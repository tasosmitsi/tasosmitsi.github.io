00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
Let's imagine you have a black rapper

00:04.200 --> 00:06.840
who invites people on stage,

00:06.840 --> 00:09.960
and let's suppose they invite a black person on stage

00:09.960 --> 00:13.560
and they're perfectly happy when the black person

00:13.560 --> 00:17.200
is full out with their lyrics.

00:17.200 --> 00:20.080
They invite a white person on stage.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.720
The white person doesn't really, sort of mystified,

00:23.720 --> 00:28.200
but it comes on stage and full out with what the rapper says,

00:28.200 --> 00:29.560
including the infamous N-word.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.760
And then the black rapper gets mad.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.880
Imagine the white comedian who satirizes that,

00:35.880 --> 00:38.480
pokes fun at that.

00:38.480 --> 00:42.960
And in poking fun at that, says the infamous N-word.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.040
Am I angry?

00:44.040 --> 00:47.720
No, I'm not angry, not angry at all.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.680
The following is a conversation with Randall Kennedy,

00:52.680 --> 00:54.520
professor at Harvard Law School

00:54.520 --> 00:58.400
and author of many seminal books on race, law,

00:58.440 --> 01:00.600
history, culture, and politics,

01:00.600 --> 01:03.400
including specifically on affirmative action,

01:03.400 --> 01:05.680
criminal justice, policing,

01:05.680 --> 01:09.360
and the topic explored extensively in this conversation,

01:09.360 --> 01:12.200
the single most powerful word and slur

01:12.200 --> 01:14.880
in the English language, the N-word,

01:14.880 --> 01:17.040
with a hard R at the end.

01:17.040 --> 01:21.080
Randall has written a book with this word as the title,

01:21.080 --> 01:24.960
N-word, the strange career of a troublesome word.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.520
Please be warned that Randall uses this word

01:27.520 --> 01:31.520
throughout this conversation deliberately and skillfully

01:31.520 --> 01:33.680
to discuss its power and its role

01:33.680 --> 01:36.240
in the history of the United States.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.680
I don't intend to shy away

01:38.680 --> 01:41.000
from controversial topics like these,

01:41.000 --> 01:43.720
and I'll work hard to handle them thoughtfully

01:43.720 --> 01:47.280
and thoroughly with respect and with empathy,

01:47.280 --> 01:48.680
often with several guests

01:48.680 --> 01:51.680
who have very different perspectives on the topic.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.400
In the end, I believe in the power

01:53.400 --> 01:56.120
of long-form conversations to heal divides

01:56.160 --> 01:58.840
by furthering understanding of human nature,

01:58.840 --> 02:00.200
of human history,

02:00.200 --> 02:03.600
and the full diversity of the human experience.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.920
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.160
in the description.

02:09.160 --> 02:12.520
And now, dear friends, here's Randall Kennedy.

02:13.560 --> 02:16.280
You wrote a book whose title is the N-word,

02:16.280 --> 02:18.680
spelled out with a hard R at the end.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.720
So let's start with the history of this word.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.920
What is the history of the N-word?

02:23.920 --> 02:27.200
The word you're referring to is nigger.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.920
The book that you're referring to is nigger,

02:29.920 --> 02:32.400
the strange career of a troublesome word.

02:33.400 --> 02:37.640
The word dates back to the 16th, 17th century.

02:37.640 --> 02:39.680
It's got a long lineage, in other words.

02:40.800 --> 02:45.760
Basically Latin, basically Spanish,

02:45.760 --> 02:50.760
basically N-I-G, you know, black in various formulations.

02:51.720 --> 02:56.720
We don't know actually how the term nigger became a slur.

02:59.120 --> 03:03.880
So there were words that were close to N-I-G-G-E-R

03:03.880 --> 03:05.480
that were used in various ways.

03:05.480 --> 03:10.480
For instance, N-I-G-G-U-H was used.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.200
N-I-G-G-U-R was used.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.920
And sometimes it was used in a way

03:19.400 --> 03:23.440
that seemed to be just purely descriptive.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.760
We do know that by the early 19th century,

03:27.760 --> 03:30.520
it had become a slur.

03:30.520 --> 03:33.080
It had become a derogatory word

03:33.080 --> 03:35.440
about which people complained.

03:35.440 --> 03:40.160
But exactly how that came about, not altogether clear.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.320
So it's been 20 years since you've written the book.

03:42.320 --> 03:45.280
What have you, what wisdom have you gained

03:45.280 --> 03:47.560
about this word since writing the book

03:47.560 --> 03:49.880
and maybe having to interact with people,

03:49.880 --> 03:52.320
having to read, having to see,

03:52.320 --> 03:55.240
having to feel the response to the book?

03:55.240 --> 03:59.880
This book has generated a lot of controversy.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.240
I thought it would.

04:01.240 --> 04:03.320
It's probably generated more controversy

04:03.320 --> 04:05.360
than I had anticipated.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.760
It has certainly generated more

04:10.920 --> 04:12.840
more different sorts of experiences

04:12.840 --> 04:14.080
than I had anticipated.

04:14.080 --> 04:19.080
So for instance, I did not think that writing this book

04:19.800 --> 04:23.400
would prompt people to ask me

04:23.400 --> 04:26.840
to be an expert witness in cases.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.920
And over the past 20 years, I've been an expert witness

04:29.920 --> 04:31.640
in a number of different cases.

04:31.640 --> 04:36.640
I've been an expert witness in a murder case,

04:37.200 --> 04:41.040
in various cases of assault.

04:41.080 --> 04:46.080
I've been an expert witness in cases involving tort cases,

04:46.720 --> 04:49.600
intentional infliction of emotional distress.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.840
I've been an expert witness

04:50.840 --> 04:53.520
in a number of employment cases.

04:54.760 --> 04:58.080
I had not anticipated that,

04:58.080 --> 05:02.360
nor had I anticipated the extent to which

05:02.360 --> 05:07.360
people would get in trouble for using my book.

05:07.680 --> 05:12.680
Every year, there are teachers who are suspended

05:12.760 --> 05:17.320
or who are fired because they will excerpt

05:17.320 --> 05:18.960
a chapter of my book.

05:18.960 --> 05:22.160
Let's imagine, and this is not,

05:22.160 --> 05:24.720
I'm not imagining things as this happened.

05:24.720 --> 05:28.800
A teacher is teaching, for instance,

05:28.800 --> 05:32.000
the Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.280
The word nigger appears in that book over 200 times.

05:36.280 --> 05:39.360
The teacher, trying to be earnest,

05:39.360 --> 05:42.960
trying to be sensible, trying to be serious,

05:42.960 --> 05:45.160
will excerpt a part of my book

05:46.840 --> 05:51.480
to acquaint students with the history of the word

05:51.480 --> 05:53.640
and maybe the history of controversy

05:53.640 --> 05:58.040
involving the use of the word in this particular novel.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.280
The teacher will give it out,

06:00.280 --> 06:04.120
hand it out to the teachers, hand it out to students.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.200
And there have been a number of teachers

06:06.200 --> 06:09.760
who've been suspended or worse because of that.

06:12.120 --> 06:15.160
Students will get upset, go home, tell their parents.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.960
Their parents will storm to the school

06:16.960 --> 06:19.800
and say that this is terrible.

06:19.800 --> 06:24.040
The teacher is, quote, using the word nigger

06:24.040 --> 06:25.800
in an offensive way.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.280
And oftentimes, administrators

06:29.280 --> 06:33.800
will basically abandon the teacher.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.600
Whenever this comes to my attention,

06:38.120 --> 06:42.600
I write, I'll write the superintendent of schools

06:42.600 --> 06:43.880
or I'll write the principal,

06:43.880 --> 06:48.520
or sometimes I'll write an opinion editorial piece

06:48.520 --> 06:50.320
for the local newspaper.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.560
But every year, there are teachers

06:52.560 --> 06:57.120
who are disciplined for using my book.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.760
I had not anticipated that.

07:01.640 --> 07:04.320
And what is the nature of the letter or the op-ed

07:04.320 --> 07:08.120
that you write on why they shouldn't be disciplined

07:08.120 --> 07:12.760
or to the degree they should be or shouldn't be?

07:12.760 --> 07:15.080
There has not been one case,

07:15.080 --> 07:20.080
there's not been one case that has come to my attention

07:20.120 --> 07:25.080
in which it was even remotely sensible

07:25.080 --> 07:27.400
for the teacher to be disciplined.

07:28.400 --> 07:32.720
And what I say is that number one,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.520
frankly, I go through,

07:36.520 --> 07:39.960
what I write is almost a synopsis of my book.

07:39.960 --> 07:44.240
Number one, this is an important word in American history.

07:44.240 --> 07:47.880
It is a word that is explosive.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.520
That's why people get so upset.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.160
It's a word that's volatile.

07:51.160 --> 07:55.280
It's a word that has typically,

07:55.440 --> 07:58.480
has typically been used in a terrible way.

07:58.480 --> 08:02.280
It's a word that is part of the soundtrack

08:02.280 --> 08:05.240
of racial terrorism in the United States.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.440
So people ought to know about this word.

08:07.440 --> 08:10.440
I mean, if you're interested in knowing

08:10.440 --> 08:12.480
the real history of the United States,

08:12.480 --> 08:15.600
if you're interested in knowing about lynching,

08:15.600 --> 08:17.680
if you're interested in knowing about the way

08:17.680 --> 08:20.720
in which black people have been terrorized

08:20.720 --> 08:23.440
in the United States, you need to know this word.

08:23.440 --> 08:24.680
You need to know that history.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.160
So you need to know why it is

08:26.160 --> 08:28.600
that people are upset about the word,

08:28.600 --> 08:31.160
but that's not, but it doesn't end there.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.920
You have to know that.

08:33.920 --> 08:38.920
And if you know that, then that knowledge

08:39.000 --> 08:43.560
should equip you to be careful.

08:43.560 --> 08:46.360
It should equip you to know that,

08:47.440 --> 08:52.440
to know the range of context in which this word appears.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.160
But again, it doesn't just end there

08:55.160 --> 08:57.920
because especially young people,

08:57.920 --> 09:00.600
you tell that to young people, they nod, they read,

09:00.600 --> 09:04.600
they understand that, but then, but then what?

09:04.600 --> 09:06.440
But then they turn on their radios

09:06.440 --> 09:09.440
and they turn on, you know, they listen to Spotify,

09:09.440 --> 09:13.880
they listen to their, some of their favorite entertainers.

09:13.880 --> 09:18.200
They listen to Dr. Dre, they listen to the ghetto boys,

09:18.280 --> 09:21.280
they listen to Snoop and they listen to NWA.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.440
What do they hear?

09:25.440 --> 09:28.440
They listen to stand-up comedians.

09:28.440 --> 09:33.440
They listen to Dave Chappelle, they listen to Cat Williams.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.240
They, you know, what do they hear?

09:38.240 --> 09:41.240
They hear the word nigger or nigger,

09:41.960 --> 09:44.960
being used in a lot of different ways.

09:45.960 --> 09:50.000
And so they need to know about that as well.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.480
What are people doing?

09:53.480 --> 09:58.480
How does one explain the fact that Dick Gregory,

09:59.600 --> 10:03.400
Dick Gregory was a comedian, activist,

10:03.400 --> 10:05.480
friend of Martin Luther King,

10:05.480 --> 10:08.480
and he was a comedian, and he was a comedian,

10:08.720 --> 10:13.720
activist, friend of Martin Luther King Jr., a true activist.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.720
I mean, he had a very, he had a flourishing career

10:17.720 --> 10:21.600
as an entertainer that he abandons

10:21.600 --> 10:25.200
in order to struggle for racial justice

10:25.200 --> 10:28.480
throughout the United States and including the deep South.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.040
How does one explain the fact that the,

10:31.040 --> 10:32.560
he wrote several memoirs,

10:32.560 --> 10:37.560
but his first memoir is called Nigger, A Memoir.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.960
How does one explain that?

10:40.960 --> 10:44.920
How does one explain the way in which,

10:44.920 --> 10:48.160
how does one explain Richard Pryor?

10:48.160 --> 10:53.160
I mean, Richard Pryor's best album is that nigger's crazy.

10:53.240 --> 10:57.200
Well, was Richard Pryor trying to put down black people?

10:57.200 --> 10:58.600
How does one explain that?

10:58.600 --> 11:02.480
One can only explain that by getting deeper into the word,

11:02.480 --> 11:05.280
by understanding that yes,

11:05.280 --> 11:08.600
this is a word that has been used in a derogatory way.

11:08.600 --> 11:12.480
This is a word that has been used to put people down.

11:12.480 --> 11:16.040
This is a word that has been used to terrorize people.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.920
You gotta know that,

11:17.920 --> 11:21.440
but you also have to know that this is a word

11:21.440 --> 11:24.880
that has also been put to other uses.

11:24.880 --> 11:29.520
There are artists, there are entertainers

11:29.520 --> 11:34.520
who have used this word like Dick Gregory used it

11:34.920 --> 11:38.400
to put up a mirror to American society

11:38.400 --> 11:39.920
and say, look at this word

11:39.920 --> 11:42.920
and look at the terrible way in which it's been used.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.040
We don't want you to look away.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.920
No, don't look away.

11:45.920 --> 11:49.600
We're not, no euphemism, no asterisk,

11:49.600 --> 11:52.280
no, no N-word, no, nigger.

11:52.280 --> 11:54.400
Now we want you to look at that

11:55.280 --> 11:56.960
and we wanna talk about that.

11:56.960 --> 12:01.000
James Baldwin, James Baldwin,

12:01.400 --> 12:05.560
there was a documentary about James Baldwin

12:05.560 --> 12:10.400
a couple of years ago, a highly lauded documentary.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.440
The title that was given to this documentary was,

12:13.440 --> 12:15.200
I Am Not Your Negro.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.720
That's not what James Baldwin said.

12:17.720 --> 12:22.040
Anybody can go to YouTube right now, take a look.

12:22.040 --> 12:25.320
James Baldwin said, I am not your nigger.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.880
And then he went on to talk about that.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.280
Well, James Baldwin wasn't,

12:30.280 --> 12:34.640
again, he wasn't trying to cover up anything.

12:34.640 --> 12:38.980
He wanted people to face the facts of American life.

12:39.880 --> 12:43.080
And it seems to me that if you're a teacher

12:43.080 --> 12:46.760
and you want to have your students face the facts

12:46.760 --> 12:50.240
about American life, well, you've got to grapple

12:50.240 --> 12:51.880
with the word nigger.

12:51.880 --> 12:56.120
Now, let me just quickly say, teachers have a tough job

12:56.120 --> 13:00.040
and if we're talking about students,

13:00.040 --> 13:02.520
of course, there's a wide range of students.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.520
Am I saying that one ought to give my book

13:05.520 --> 13:07.480
to kindergartners?

13:07.480 --> 13:10.820
No, you know, kindergartners are probably not ready

13:10.820 --> 13:11.820
for such a book.

13:12.740 --> 13:16.320
Third graders, probably no, not third grade.

13:16.320 --> 13:19.880
If we're talking, however, about people in the 10th grade,

13:19.880 --> 13:21.980
do I think the 10th graders can read my book?

13:21.980 --> 13:23.480
Yeah, sure, absolutely.

13:23.480 --> 13:26.680
11th graders, 12th graders, people in college,

13:26.680 --> 13:28.660
there are people in college.

13:28.660 --> 13:29.580
There are people in college.

13:29.580 --> 13:32.100
There are people in law schools.

13:32.100 --> 13:35.440
Teachers in law schools have been disciplined

13:37.680 --> 13:41.720
because the word nigger has come out of a teacher's mouth.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.560
Why?

13:42.560 --> 13:44.760
In a couple of cases recently,

13:44.760 --> 13:48.440
teacher would be reading a court opinion.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.140
The word appears in the court opinion,

13:52.140 --> 13:54.500
the teacher pronounces the word, ah.

13:56.060 --> 14:00.000
You know, students get up, leave in a huff,

14:00.000 --> 14:01.500
report the teacher.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.740
There's some instances in which teachers have been,

14:03.740 --> 14:06.720
under those circumstances, have been disciplined.

14:06.720 --> 14:11.720
In my view, that's bad and people ought to say it's bad.

14:13.180 --> 14:15.100
It's bad pedagogically.

14:16.340 --> 14:20.900
And frankly, in many of these instances,

14:21.500 --> 14:23.940
it's stupid and I don't mind saying that.

14:23.940 --> 14:25.440
I think that some of these instances

14:25.440 --> 14:28.760
in which teachers have been disciplined, absolutely stupid.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.700
People say, well, the teacher used the word, excuse me,

14:31.700 --> 14:33.140
used the word.

14:33.140 --> 14:36.260
It'd be one thing, it'd be one thing

14:36.260 --> 14:39.420
if a teacher looked at a student

14:39.420 --> 14:42.860
and called the student nigger.

14:42.860 --> 14:45.020
You know, get out of here, nigger.

14:45.020 --> 14:47.020
That'd be one, that'd be, you know, fine.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.720
Discipline, that's teacher, that's bad.

14:51.060 --> 14:53.340
But that's not what's going on.

14:53.340 --> 14:56.500
You don't have, none of these are cases

14:56.500 --> 14:58.980
in which you have an individual

14:58.980 --> 15:01.620
who is a stranger to another individual

15:01.620 --> 15:04.120
and this word just sort of comes out.

15:04.120 --> 15:07.900
No, what we have here is a class

15:08.820 --> 15:12.140
involving a person who is a teacher

15:13.420 --> 15:15.800
interacting with students,

15:16.940 --> 15:20.220
talking about subjects in which it would be

15:20.260 --> 15:23.500
perfectly understandable why this word would emerge

15:23.500 --> 15:25.380
as a subject of conversation.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.220
Now, under those circumstances,

15:29.220 --> 15:34.220
it's somehow wrong for a teacher to utter this word.

15:35.660 --> 15:37.260
In my view, the answer is no.

15:37.260 --> 15:41.300
And, you know, I said that 20 years ago.

15:41.300 --> 15:44.100
I say it even more emphatically now.

15:45.660 --> 15:48.580
Still, it is one of the most powerful words

15:48.580 --> 15:50.500
in the English language.

15:50.500 --> 15:54.540
And there's a kind of responsibility

15:54.540 --> 15:56.540
that we as humans should have with words.

15:56.540 --> 15:57.380
Yes.

15:57.380 --> 15:59.460
With statements.

15:59.460 --> 16:02.820
That word, if not used skillfully,

16:02.820 --> 16:04.500
if not used competently,

16:04.500 --> 16:07.140
even when just read from a legal transcript,

16:07.140 --> 16:09.560
can do more harm than good.

16:10.980 --> 16:13.540
I agree with what you say, yes.

16:13.540 --> 16:18.140
Words are powerful, words do matter.

16:18.980 --> 16:23.980
And so I'm certainly not suggesting that people be lax.

16:25.020 --> 16:30.020
I'm not suggesting that people be irresponsible.

16:32.020 --> 16:35.680
It's precisely because words matter, however,

16:36.580 --> 16:41.580
that we need to be willing to face words

16:42.980 --> 16:46.380
and grapple with words and talk about words

16:46.380 --> 16:48.220
and talk about the history of words,

16:48.220 --> 16:51.020
precisely because words matter.

16:51.020 --> 16:54.740
And among other things, it seems to me,

16:54.740 --> 16:57.700
it's important to understand that words

16:57.700 --> 17:01.380
can mean different things in different contexts.

17:01.380 --> 17:05.780
It's not the case that a word

17:06.980 --> 17:10.820
means the same thing in every context.

17:11.820 --> 17:13.980
The word discriminating.

17:14.980 --> 17:18.780
Sometimes it's a very bad thing.

17:18.780 --> 17:20.820
That person discriminates.

17:22.420 --> 17:26.320
And when you, again, intonation of voice means something.

17:26.320 --> 17:29.500
If I say that person discriminates,

17:29.500 --> 17:31.680
and I'm obviously being disapproving,

17:32.640 --> 17:35.820
implicitly what I'm saying is that person

17:37.220 --> 17:42.220
distinguishes between things on an unjustifiable basis,

17:42.700 --> 17:44.340
and that's a bad thing.

17:44.340 --> 17:49.100
On the other hand, that person has discriminating taste.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.740
Oh, that means something very different.

17:50.740 --> 17:55.100
That means that the person differentiates

17:55.100 --> 17:58.220
in a way that shows that they understand

17:58.220 --> 18:03.220
the difference between excellent, good, and not so good.

18:03.620 --> 18:05.660
And we think that that's a good thing.

18:05.660 --> 18:07.780
So words can have different,

18:07.780 --> 18:10.960
words can mean different things in different contexts.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.640
It seems to me that that's something

18:12.640 --> 18:16.480
that actually we oughta recognize,

18:16.480 --> 18:19.800
we oughta recognize and talk about.

18:19.800 --> 18:24.800
Well, some words enter this territory of being a slur.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.720
And it seems like when they cross the line

18:27.720 --> 18:28.920
into being a slur,

18:31.600 --> 18:33.800
there's the number of contexts

18:33.800 --> 18:37.440
in which it's okay to mention it exponentially decreases.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.720
Right?

18:39.720 --> 18:42.520
No, no, I'm gonna resist that a little bit

18:42.520 --> 18:47.520
because the whole idea of slurs, slurs change.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.200
Yankee was a slur.

18:54.300 --> 18:59.040
Yankee was a slur in 18th century United States.

19:00.920 --> 19:05.920
Slur today, New York Yankees, I'm a Yankee fan,

19:06.280 --> 19:07.400
I'm a Yankee.

19:09.720 --> 19:14.720
Queer, queer, you know, and this is in my lifetime,

19:16.520 --> 19:19.680
there was a time, you know, you queer

19:20.800 --> 19:23.520
and people would really run away from it.

19:23.520 --> 19:26.400
And that was, you know, a bad thing.

19:26.400 --> 19:31.400
And then thank goodness, gay liberation movement,

19:32.240 --> 19:34.780
gay liberation movement, basically,

19:34.780 --> 19:37.120
we're not gonna run away from this.

19:37.120 --> 19:40.920
We're gonna grab this quote slur

19:40.920 --> 19:45.040
and we're going to affix it to ourselves.

19:45.040 --> 19:48.340
And we are going to repurpose it.

19:49.460 --> 19:53.880
Now, the word queer is again, you know, can it be a slur?

19:53.880 --> 19:57.200
Yeah, it can be a slur, doesn't have to be.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.360
And it seems to me that it's important for people

19:59.360 --> 20:04.360
to know about how a word, a symbol

20:04.900 --> 20:06.640
in some contexts can be a slur

20:06.640 --> 20:09.320
and some contexts doesn't have to be.

20:09.320 --> 20:14.160
So the whole idea of what's a slur,

20:15.360 --> 20:18.640
that's a complicated idea in and of itself.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.480
That's very complicated.

20:20.480 --> 20:24.600
It's, if I may say almost fascinating how language evolves.

20:24.600 --> 20:29.600
But if we were to kind of have a minute by minute evaluation

20:30.240 --> 20:35.240
of the most powerful, intensely slur like words

20:35.920 --> 20:40.380
in the world, I think the N word with a hard R at the end,

20:40.380 --> 20:44.880
which is the title of your book, is number one on that list.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.520
Well, probably so.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.020
And of course, that's one of the reasons

20:48.020 --> 20:49.920
why I wrote a little book about it.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.240
Yeah, but it hasn't, even since you wrote

20:52.240 --> 20:55.160
a little book about it, it seems like it's maintained

20:55.160 --> 20:56.520
its number one status.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.040
You mentioned queer.

21:01.440 --> 21:04.280
Maybe queer was in the top 20, I don't know,

21:04.320 --> 21:08.680
for a while and now it's sliding into the top 1,000

21:08.680 --> 21:11.160
and the N word is at the top.

21:11.160 --> 21:12.240
You're absolutely right.

21:12.240 --> 21:17.240
The origins of this book, I clearly remember,

21:17.440 --> 21:22.440
I was at my office and I was thinking about lecture topics

21:23.560 --> 21:26.360
and I get invited to give lectures from time to time.

21:27.160 --> 21:31.320
And I was thinking, well, what might make

21:31.320 --> 21:32.360
for an interesting lecture?

21:32.360 --> 21:37.200
And all of a sudden, the word nigger popped into my mind.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.640
Now, this is a word, I've grown up with this word.

21:39.640 --> 21:44.040
I mean, there's never been a time in my life

21:44.040 --> 21:49.040
when, at least in my conscious life,

21:50.440 --> 21:54.700
in which this word's been absent.

21:54.700 --> 21:56.680
I mean, in my household, for instance,

21:56.680 --> 22:00.980
in my household, my parents are black people,

22:01.940 --> 22:04.660
my parents were refugees from the Jim Crow South.

22:04.660 --> 22:07.940
I was born in the deep South, South Carolina.

22:07.940 --> 22:12.620
In my household, I heard the word nigger used

22:12.620 --> 22:15.580
in every possible way.

22:15.580 --> 22:18.180
I heard it used as a slur.

22:18.180 --> 22:21.580
I also heard it used with respect to people

22:21.580 --> 22:23.460
who were praised.

22:24.700 --> 22:29.660
My father, I clearly remember my father, whom I revere.

22:31.940 --> 22:33.980
That's the smartest nigger in the world.

22:33.980 --> 22:36.100
That's the bravest nigger in the world.

22:36.100 --> 22:38.380
That's the baddest nigger I know.

22:38.380 --> 22:41.940
He wasn't putting people down, this is the way he talked.

22:41.940 --> 22:46.820
And I grew up hearing this word in various ways.

22:46.820 --> 22:48.220
And so I was thinking to myself,

22:48.220 --> 22:50.900
God, where did this word come from?

22:50.900 --> 22:52.300
And one of the first things I did,

22:52.300 --> 22:54.900
I clearly remember just jumping up out of my seat,

22:54.900 --> 22:58.460
running up to the library, Oxford English Dictionary,

22:58.460 --> 23:01.020
when did this word first appear in English?

23:01.020 --> 23:03.460
What was the history of the word?

23:03.460 --> 23:07.820
And then what really sort of grabbed my attention

23:08.700 --> 23:13.700
is I went, I get my computer going

23:16.600 --> 23:19.280
and I asked the computer system,

23:21.500 --> 23:26.500
give me every case, every federal court case

23:27.420 --> 23:31.060
in which this word appears, thousands of cases.

23:32.340 --> 23:35.980
And then I said, oh my goodness, this is really interesting.

23:35.980 --> 23:40.980
And then I started just cataloging all the different cases.

23:41.780 --> 23:44.420
There came a point, I'd say probably about a month

23:44.420 --> 23:48.380
into this, I compared the usage,

23:48.380 --> 23:52.860
I compared the number of times nigger came up

23:52.860 --> 23:54.540
with other sorts of slurs.

23:54.540 --> 23:58.180
So for instance, kike, K-I-K-E,

23:58.180 --> 24:03.180
long time derogatory word for Jews.

24:03.220 --> 24:05.700
How many times has this word come up?

24:05.700 --> 24:09.920
There was a time in which the word appeared,

24:09.920 --> 24:14.920
but nothing like the infamous n-word, nothing.

24:15.140 --> 24:17.700
And then, what about wetback?

24:17.700 --> 24:20.980
What about, and then I just,

24:20.980 --> 24:24.260
let me just take a look at all the other slurs.

24:24.260 --> 24:29.260
Nothing came close, not even remotely close to nigger.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.540
And I think it has something to do with,

24:33.100 --> 24:36.540
I think it has something to do with the uniqueness

24:36.540 --> 24:41.540
of the color line, particularly as it pertains

24:41.540 --> 24:43.780
to African-Americans.

24:43.780 --> 24:46.580
I think that the fact that nigger

24:47.420 --> 24:52.420
sort of occupies such a unique status among slurs,

24:54.900 --> 24:59.900
I think that's a reflection of the unique stigma

25:01.340 --> 25:04.340
that has been imposed on African-Americans.

25:04.340 --> 25:07.120
It's hard to know the chicken or the egg,

25:08.140 --> 25:13.140
why a one word is able to so distinctly and clearly

25:13.540 --> 25:18.540
encapsulate this struggle between races

25:19.340 --> 25:22.020
that is throughout American history.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.720
I mean, they didn't have to probably be so,

25:23.720 --> 25:25.540
but it came to be that way.

25:25.540 --> 25:27.920
It became that, not only that, not only that,

25:27.920 --> 25:32.920
but of course, the nigger spurred other slurs.

25:33.580 --> 25:38.580
So Arabs, sand niggers, the Irish, the niggers of Europe,

25:43.820 --> 25:46.580
women, the niggers of the world.

25:46.580 --> 25:48.100
John Lennon even has a song.

25:48.100 --> 25:49.700
That's right.

25:49.700 --> 25:51.340
Well, I think Yoko Ono, I think,

25:51.340 --> 25:53.300
had something to do with that song.

25:53.300 --> 25:58.300
So, I mean, it is a slur that has spawned other slurs.

26:00.660 --> 26:05.060
And again, that's why, as you indicated a moment ago,

26:05.060 --> 26:10.020
this is a quite unique term.

26:10.020 --> 26:14.940
But are you conscious, are you deliberate

26:14.940 --> 26:16.260
in you saying this word?

26:16.260 --> 26:19.220
So let me just say from a personal experience,

26:19.220 --> 26:21.620
maybe my upbringing, where I came from,

26:22.580 --> 26:26.860
in my daily life, I don't think I've ever heard

26:26.860 --> 26:30.740
that word with a hard R said as often.

26:30.740 --> 26:34.100
You clearly in my life said that I've heard it today

26:34.100 --> 26:37.260
more than I have ever heard in my entire life.

26:37.260 --> 26:42.260
And I think there's a few people who listen to this,

26:42.380 --> 26:45.820
they'll be listening to this and be very uncomfortable.

26:45.820 --> 26:50.820
I would say not in a bad way, probably in a good way.

26:50.900 --> 26:54.420
I'm uncomfortable now, and I am almost introspecting

26:54.420 --> 26:57.500
and trying to figure out why I'm uncomfortable.

26:57.500 --> 27:00.700
And I think even the title of your book

27:00.700 --> 27:02.080
is making me think that.

27:02.940 --> 27:05.860
Just looking into my own mind and trying to understand,

27:05.860 --> 27:07.860
wow, words of power.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.620
And why does it have so much power?

27:09.620 --> 27:11.460
But are you deliberate in that action?

27:11.460 --> 27:13.720
And by the way, not only are the people listening

27:13.720 --> 27:17.500
to this sweating, this will be on YouTube in part.

27:19.580 --> 27:22.840
And YouTube, the people on the other side will be sweating.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.540
What do we do with this?

27:24.540 --> 27:28.260
Yeah, well, am I deliberate?

27:28.260 --> 27:30.220
The answer is yes.

27:30.220 --> 27:33.420
And let me unpack that a little bit.

27:33.500 --> 27:35.980
First, that's right.

27:35.980 --> 27:38.780
I mean, am I deliberate?

27:38.780 --> 27:43.500
Yeah, I deliberately wrote a book

27:43.500 --> 27:47.620
called, Nigger, The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word.

27:47.620 --> 27:49.360
And was that deliberate?

27:49.360 --> 27:50.720
Yeah, that was quite deliberate.

27:50.720 --> 27:53.380
But the title could have been N-word versus it's public.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.560
The title could have been N-word.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.460
Sure, the title could have been N-word.

27:57.460 --> 28:02.100
The title could have been a book about a word

28:02.100 --> 28:04.700
that causes pain to many people.

28:04.700 --> 28:06.060
I could have named it that.

28:07.020 --> 28:09.700
There are many titles I could have used.

28:10.940 --> 28:15.220
Did I want a title that would be provocative?

28:15.220 --> 28:18.220
Did I want a title that would grab people?

28:18.220 --> 28:20.580
The answer to that is yes.

28:20.580 --> 28:22.220
What, you know, I'm a writer.

28:22.220 --> 28:24.800
I want people to read what I write.

28:24.800 --> 28:28.500
Was I being sensationalistic?

28:28.500 --> 28:32.020
Well, I mean, if you wanna put it like that,

28:32.020 --> 28:36.700
yes, I'm not embarrassed to say that.

28:36.700 --> 28:39.580
I mean, I'm sure that when people write books,

28:39.580 --> 28:41.220
they think really hard about their titles

28:41.220 --> 28:42.180
and they try to get a title

28:42.180 --> 28:45.660
that will grab people's attention.

28:45.660 --> 28:50.660
I know people, respect people very deeply

28:51.060 --> 28:54.940
who never, as a matter of principle,

28:54.940 --> 28:59.220
never utter this word.

28:59.260 --> 29:01.140
And I've talked with people.

29:01.140 --> 29:06.140
I've had people say, you know, I read your book.

29:06.780 --> 29:09.620
Let's talk about it, but let's be very clear.

29:09.620 --> 29:11.060
I'm not gonna use the word.

29:11.060 --> 29:13.420
I've had many conversations with people

29:13.420 --> 29:15.420
who've asked me not to use the word.

29:16.340 --> 29:21.340
I was on a, the first time this came up was a book tour.

29:22.260 --> 29:25.420
It was 20 years ago when the book first came out

29:25.420 --> 29:30.140
and I was on one of these call-in shows

29:30.140 --> 29:31.820
early in the morning.

29:31.820 --> 29:35.100
Time came to call in, seven o'clock.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.180
I called in at five or seven.

29:37.180 --> 29:40.100
Right before I go on, the host of the show says,

29:40.100 --> 29:45.100
oh, by the way, we have a strict policy here at the station.

29:45.880 --> 29:48.180
We never use this word.

29:48.180 --> 29:49.060
And I said, well, gosh,

29:49.060 --> 29:50.620
I wish you had told me this earlier.

29:50.620 --> 29:53.140
Does this mean then that you're never going

29:53.140 --> 29:57.100
to pronounce fully the title of my book?

29:57.100 --> 29:58.580
And she said, that's right.

29:58.580 --> 30:00.700
And I had to make a choice right then and there.

30:00.700 --> 30:03.580
Am I gonna go on or am I not?

30:03.580 --> 30:04.420
What'd you do?

30:04.420 --> 30:08.460
I went on and I abided by the station's rules

30:08.460 --> 30:12.260
and fine, we had a perfectly fine conversation.

30:13.700 --> 30:17.740
And you know, there is a place for euphemism.

30:17.740 --> 30:20.380
The American language is a very supple language.

30:20.380 --> 30:22.820
There are lots of words that one can use.

30:22.860 --> 30:27.860
I do not get angry with people who don't, you know,

30:28.220 --> 30:29.420
they say as a matter of principle,

30:29.420 --> 30:30.860
they're not gonna use the word, fine.

30:30.860 --> 30:34.900
I'm willing to, I understand where they're coming from.

30:34.900 --> 30:38.760
And often I will defer to their wishes.

30:39.660 --> 30:42.580
All I say is, I want people to understand

30:42.580 --> 30:43.780
where I'm coming from.

30:44.680 --> 30:48.340
I'm not just using this word willy nilly.

30:48.340 --> 30:50.180
There's a pedagogical reason.

30:50.180 --> 30:54.780
There is a reason for why I'm saying what I'm saying.

30:54.780 --> 30:59.780
There is a reason why I use the word.

30:59.980 --> 31:04.140
Can you make the case why using the word is a good idea

31:04.140 --> 31:06.020
and can you make, can you steel man the case

31:06.020 --> 31:07.380
why it's a bad idea?

31:07.380 --> 31:09.060
Maybe you've heard from some critics.

31:09.060 --> 31:09.900
Yes.

31:09.900 --> 31:12.500
Who said that you saying this word out loud

31:12.500 --> 31:13.980
is actually causing a lot of harm.

31:13.980 --> 31:17.860
Not like harm because people's feelings are hurt,

31:18.660 --> 31:21.260
increasing the amount of racism and hate in the world.

31:21.260 --> 31:24.220
Yeah, critics, let's start with the critics.

31:25.580 --> 31:30.580
One, again, going back to when the book was first published,

31:30.660 --> 31:34.580
I remember going to the first bookstore I went to

31:34.580 --> 31:37.220
and I talked about the book, had a very, you know,

31:37.220 --> 31:42.220
talked, asked questions and the last comment,

31:42.700 --> 31:45.780
wasn't a question, but the last comment was made by

31:48.060 --> 31:51.740
an elderly black man.

31:51.740 --> 31:54.100
I called on him and he said,

31:54.100 --> 31:56.180
I've listened to what you've had to say

31:56.180 --> 31:58.500
and I appreciate what you've had to say,

31:59.500 --> 32:02.900
but he said, but I remain unconvinced

32:03.980 --> 32:08.980
and I remain unconvinced because when I was coming up,

32:10.700 --> 32:15.020
this word was used to put me in the back of the bus

32:15.980 --> 32:19.260
and this word was used to prevent me from voting

32:20.180 --> 32:24.020
and this was the word that was used to justify me

32:24.020 --> 32:26.020
never being called as a juror.

32:27.220 --> 32:32.060
So to me, this word has only one meaning.

32:33.420 --> 32:35.860
It's a terrible meaning.

32:35.860 --> 32:38.340
I'm never going to use the word.

32:38.340 --> 32:42.540
It hurts me when I hear people use the word,

32:43.540 --> 32:45.820
especially those who don't know anything about the,

32:45.820 --> 32:48.060
you know, really about the history of it.

32:48.900 --> 32:53.620
And he went on to say, I think that your book,

32:53.620 --> 32:57.980
though well-intended, is probably going to be seen

32:57.980 --> 33:01.700
by some people as giving them permission to use the word.

33:02.780 --> 33:07.620
And then he stopped and I thought there was a lot of power

33:07.620 --> 33:10.900
behind that gentleman's comment.

33:11.020 --> 33:15.620
I think that what he said is probably correct.

33:15.620 --> 33:18.700
And so far as there are probably some people

33:18.700 --> 33:21.860
who read the book, there are probably some people

33:21.860 --> 33:24.580
who are listening to our conversation right now

33:25.780 --> 33:30.780
who will think that I'm giving people permission

33:34.580 --> 33:36.180
to use the word.

33:37.020 --> 33:42.020
You know, I have said that I'm not,

33:44.100 --> 33:46.980
I want people to understand the word.

33:46.980 --> 33:49.940
I think that there is a burden that comes from

33:51.500 --> 33:53.780
whenever you utter a word like this.

33:55.620 --> 33:57.220
But that's, you know, that's a critique.

33:57.220 --> 33:59.620
And I think there's strength to that critique.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.860
I'm not going to say that that's a ridiculous critique.

34:01.860 --> 34:04.580
I think that there is something to that.

34:04.580 --> 34:06.940
And by the way, I should say, and that's why

34:07.820 --> 34:12.140
I would say to anyone, that's right.

34:12.140 --> 34:13.780
If this word comes out of your mouth,

34:13.780 --> 34:17.460
you are taking on real responsibility.

34:17.460 --> 34:19.620
So for years, it doesn't happen so much now,

34:19.620 --> 34:24.100
but they were, I'd say for about the first five years

34:24.100 --> 34:28.500
after this book was published, I would get an email

34:28.500 --> 34:33.500
at least once a week, and it would begin like this.

34:34.420 --> 34:39.060
You know, dear Professor Kennedy, I read your book

34:39.060 --> 34:41.260
and I'm calling to ask you a question.

34:42.140 --> 34:45.540
And as soon as I saw that, I knew what the question

34:45.540 --> 34:47.780
was going to be, and what the person would say

34:47.780 --> 34:49.420
is the following.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.820
I like rap, and then I knew what was coming.

34:52.820 --> 34:57.820
I like rap, I'm white, and I have black friends

34:58.620 --> 35:01.580
and we listen to rap and we're driving in the car

35:01.580 --> 35:06.500
and we're listening to the song, we start humming along

35:06.500 --> 35:11.500
and singing along, and my black friends sing along,

35:11.660 --> 35:16.060
and when nigger or nigga comes up, they sing,

35:16.060 --> 35:17.420
and I don't know what to do.

35:19.420 --> 35:21.540
Is it wrong for me to sing along?

35:22.500 --> 35:27.500
This happened so often that, I'd say about the 10th time

35:27.500 --> 35:31.980
I got in such an email, I wrote a form letter

35:31.980 --> 35:36.980
because I didn't want to just take up time writing,

35:37.420 --> 35:39.540
sort of crafting letter after letter after letter.

35:39.540 --> 35:41.380
So I wrote a form letter, and basically what I said

35:41.380 --> 35:45.900
was listen, number one, I'm flattered that you're asking me,

35:45.900 --> 35:50.140
but number one, you should have a conversation

35:50.140 --> 35:51.300
with your friend.

35:52.700 --> 35:55.900
Number two, no matter what your friend says,

35:55.900 --> 36:00.460
let me put something else for you to consider.

36:00.460 --> 36:02.420
Let's suppose for the sake of discussion

36:02.420 --> 36:05.500
that your friend says, oh, doesn't bother me,

36:05.500 --> 36:06.740
I know where you're coming from,

36:06.740 --> 36:09.180
we're just enjoying the music.

36:09.180 --> 36:12.980
I don't think that this is a racist utterance

36:12.980 --> 36:13.860
coming out of your mouth.

36:13.860 --> 36:16.580
Let's suppose that your friend says that.

36:16.580 --> 36:21.100
That doesn't end matters because let's imagine the following.

36:21.100 --> 36:23.900
Let's imagine that you're in a theater

36:24.900 --> 36:29.900
and you're waiting for the film to start,

36:30.740 --> 36:33.500
and you're just talking with your friends

36:33.500 --> 36:34.860
or singing with your friends,

36:34.860 --> 36:37.220
or just kicking back with your friends,

36:38.260 --> 36:42.700
and they're talking about nigger this or nigga this,

36:42.700 --> 36:46.780
and you say it, you the white boy say it,

36:48.420 --> 36:52.140
and the next thing you feel is a fist,

36:52.140 --> 36:57.140
a big fist in your mouth that has been launched

36:57.140 --> 37:01.340
by a person that you did not see who was right behind you.

37:01.340 --> 37:04.860
All this person saw was a white person saying nigga,

37:04.860 --> 37:07.180
and the next thing, pow!

37:09.460 --> 37:14.460
That's not some sort of overheated scenario

37:15.100 --> 37:17.540
coming from some law professor's mind.

37:17.540 --> 37:21.260
That is a very plausible scenario.

37:21.300 --> 37:24.780
So you have to be worried about lots of things,

37:24.780 --> 37:26.820
including mistake.

37:26.820 --> 37:31.820
So my advice to you is be prudent.

37:32.100 --> 37:35.220
I would stay clear of the word unless,

37:35.220 --> 37:37.460
unless you're very certain,

37:37.460 --> 37:40.300
and unless if you're called on it,

37:40.300 --> 37:43.780
you feel you're in a position to defend yourself,

37:43.780 --> 37:45.780
defend what you're doing,

37:45.780 --> 37:48.820
but the prudent thing would be to stay clear.

37:48.820 --> 37:51.020
There's so many questions I wanna ask there.

37:51.020 --> 37:53.420
One is about the violence and the legal aspect of that.

37:53.420 --> 37:55.900
It's very interesting how you raise that in the book,

37:55.900 --> 38:00.740
but I do wanna bring up something

38:00.740 --> 38:02.460
I probably disagree with you on,

38:02.460 --> 38:05.340
which is you say that there's not a significant difference

38:05.340 --> 38:07.980
between the different variations of the n-word.

38:09.380 --> 38:11.820
The one, or maybe you don't.

38:11.820 --> 38:13.980
I just listened to a bunch of your interviews.

38:13.980 --> 38:18.980
So there's the version with a E-R at the end,

38:20.180 --> 38:22.380
version with a G-A at the end,

38:22.380 --> 38:26.260
and then G-R-O at the end.

38:26.260 --> 38:28.020
These are all different versions,

38:28.020 --> 38:31.700
and I feel like in that list of powerful words,

38:31.700 --> 38:34.540
you know, I feel like there's a distinction.

38:34.540 --> 38:37.300
I feel that the number one spot

38:37.300 --> 38:39.420
is the one with the hard R,

38:39.420 --> 38:42.500
and I don't know.

38:42.500 --> 38:47.380
Maybe you can try to shed light,

38:47.380 --> 38:51.220
but I feel like the one that ends in G-A

38:51.220 --> 38:55.380
is really far down the list in terms of modern culture.

38:55.380 --> 38:57.780
So we talked about the evolution of the words

38:57.780 --> 39:00.060
and the word queer, for example.

39:00.060 --> 39:02.700
It feels like maybe because of rap,

39:02.700 --> 39:03.540
because of comedians,

39:03.540 --> 39:06.660
because it's become much more,

39:06.660 --> 39:08.500
it lost so much of its power.

39:09.740 --> 39:12.740
Well, no, I think there's a difference

39:12.740 --> 39:15.540
between nigger and nigga.

39:15.540 --> 39:18.860
I mean, people make a distinction between them,

39:18.860 --> 39:20.820
and I think that to the extent

39:20.820 --> 39:23.100
that lots of people make a distinction between them,

39:23.100 --> 39:26.260
I think, you know, just as a sociological fact,

39:26.260 --> 39:27.180
they are different.

39:29.220 --> 39:33.940
I think that people who get upset,

39:33.940 --> 39:36.660
if somebody, especially white people,

39:36.700 --> 39:40.100
so if a white person says nigga,

39:40.100 --> 39:45.100
and they're sort of criticized about it,

39:45.980 --> 39:47.700
and they say, well, I didn't say nigger,

39:47.700 --> 39:50.020
I said nigga, believe me.

39:50.020 --> 39:53.780
I think most people who are mad at them

39:53.780 --> 39:55.420
are gonna stay mad at them.

39:57.500 --> 39:59.180
Now, you raised the word,

39:59.180 --> 40:01.740
so nigger and nigga, I would put

40:02.740 --> 40:07.660
in a very different category than negro.

40:07.660 --> 40:09.020
Educate me here.

40:09.020 --> 40:11.740
Well, yeah, sure, I'm happy to.

40:13.580 --> 40:18.580
Negro is a, also controversial.

40:20.980 --> 40:22.340
It's also controversial.

40:24.540 --> 40:29.540
But negro has never been viewed

40:32.140 --> 40:35.660
by a substantial number of people

40:36.620 --> 40:39.180
as a derogatory term,

40:39.180 --> 40:43.020
at least with the same amount of animus,

40:43.020 --> 40:44.260
the same amount of,

40:46.900 --> 40:51.900
it's a very different kind of word than nigger or nigga.

40:52.180 --> 40:56.220
I mean, after all, I mean, negro,

40:56.220 --> 40:57.700
Martin Luther King Jr.,

40:58.380 --> 41:03.260
you know, all of his great oratory, negro.

41:03.260 --> 41:08.260
You read the work of the great W.E.B. Du Bois, negro.

41:11.420 --> 41:16.420
You read the work of my boss.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.820
For instance, I use the word negro.

41:19.700 --> 41:24.700
I use African-American, black, Afro-American,

41:25.100 --> 41:26.900
but I also use the word negro.

41:26.900 --> 41:29.300
Now, there are some people who get really mad at me

41:29.300 --> 41:32.460
because of when I use the word negro.

41:32.460 --> 41:34.580
And so, for instance, there's students

41:34.580 --> 41:38.020
who've gotten really quite exercised.

41:38.020 --> 41:41.780
And they'll say, I'll be giving a lecture

41:41.780 --> 41:44.420
and a hand will go up, I'll call on somebody

41:44.420 --> 41:47.380
and they'll say, listen, are you using the word negro

41:48.580 --> 41:52.860
and it's purely because of the historical time period

41:52.860 --> 41:55.980
that you're using, so is that why you're using it?

41:55.980 --> 41:58.380
Or are you using it in your own voice?

41:59.660 --> 42:02.620
And often I'll say, well, I'm using it in my own voice

42:02.620 --> 42:04.740
and they'll say, well, I'm offended.

42:04.740 --> 42:08.260
We think that this is, you know, that's old-timey,

42:08.260 --> 42:09.660
it's derogatory.

42:10.980 --> 42:15.980
When this first came up, I said, let's pause for a moment

42:17.660 --> 42:20.300
and I'll take that under advisement

42:21.220 --> 42:23.620
and let me look into this.

42:23.620 --> 42:25.660
And I ended up writing an essay about it,

42:25.660 --> 42:29.460
an essay about the history of the terms

42:29.460 --> 42:34.060
that black people have used to describe themselves.

42:35.180 --> 42:38.700
And it's a long list, you know, black, colored,

42:38.700 --> 42:42.340
Afro-American, African-American, negro, et cetera.

42:43.940 --> 42:45.500
So I go through all that and I said, now,

42:45.500 --> 42:49.300
let me just tell you, I know for certain

42:49.300 --> 42:52.540
when I started using the word negro

42:53.380 --> 42:58.100
often in writing, I can date it.

42:59.580 --> 43:03.700
1983, the summer of 1983 is when I started using

43:03.700 --> 43:08.700
the word negro in my professional life as a lawyer.

43:11.940 --> 43:15.180
And I did it for a very specific reason.

43:15.180 --> 43:20.180
I did it because my boss demanded that I negro capital N.

43:20.860 --> 43:24.820
Now, who was my boss?

43:25.540 --> 43:30.540
My boss in the summer of 1983 was associate justice

43:31.860 --> 43:35.820
of the United States Supreme Court, Thurgood Marshall,

43:35.820 --> 43:39.420
known as Mr. Civil Rights.

43:41.500 --> 43:45.460
Now, it seems to me, you're telling me

43:45.460 --> 43:47.860
that this word is so out of bounds,

43:48.020 --> 43:49.940
that this word is derogatory,

43:49.940 --> 43:51.820
nobody should ever use this word.

43:51.820 --> 43:55.380
Does the fact that Thurgood Marshall demanded

43:55.380 --> 43:58.460
that I use this word, does that complicate things

43:58.460 --> 43:59.300
a little bit?

44:00.740 --> 44:03.300
And so I think that people, again, you know,

44:03.300 --> 44:04.540
ought to know more.

44:05.580 --> 44:10.580
I mean, I've encountered students who don't know very much,

44:10.660 --> 44:15.660
but who want to lecture me on word usage,

44:16.420 --> 44:21.420
because they know, you know, three sentences

44:23.260 --> 44:28.260
about current fashion and hold it, you know, hold it.

44:30.700 --> 44:33.580
By the way, I push it further.

44:33.580 --> 44:35.900
I sometimes use the word colored.

44:35.900 --> 44:39.540
And then, you know, some people really don't like that.

44:39.540 --> 44:42.420
Colored, well, you know, there's an organization

44:42.420 --> 44:47.420
still very much alive in American life and law,

44:48.140 --> 44:50.420
the National Association for the Advancement

44:50.420 --> 44:54.380
of Colored People, the NAACP.

44:56.340 --> 44:58.660
They haven't changed their name.

44:58.660 --> 45:01.900
And as far as I'm concerned, it's a wonderful organization.

45:03.180 --> 45:07.180
There are people who have used the word colored.

45:07.180 --> 45:10.860
That's what my grandmother used, colored.

45:10.860 --> 45:14.260
Perfectly fine as far as I'm concerned.

45:14.260 --> 45:19.260
So again, we, there are lots of different words

45:19.780 --> 45:20.940
that one can use.

45:20.940 --> 45:23.380
You can use different formulations.

45:23.380 --> 45:26.340
I understand that people have different preferences.

45:26.340 --> 45:27.940
Fine.

45:27.940 --> 45:32.460
I have my preferences, at least know where I'm coming from.

45:32.460 --> 45:37.020
Still, words have power and they have power to hurt.

45:37.020 --> 45:42.020
And there's a lot of reasons that I could see

45:43.100 --> 45:45.700
to justify the use of the word in its full form,

45:45.700 --> 45:49.180
as you're saying, in this conversation as you're using it.

45:49.180 --> 45:53.140
One of them is perhaps fighting for the freedom

45:53.140 --> 45:55.460
to be able to use those kinds of words.

45:55.460 --> 45:57.660
So let me ask you about the freedom of speech

46:00.860 --> 46:02.860
and the censorship of the word.

46:02.860 --> 46:04.940
Should the use of the N-word be censored,

46:04.940 --> 46:06.740
for example, on social networks?

46:08.020 --> 46:10.780
So we can come up with different places.

46:10.780 --> 46:15.780
We can say university campuses, maybe in op-eds or,

46:16.300 --> 46:19.100
I don't know, but I think social networks currently

46:19.100 --> 46:21.300
is a very interesting place.

46:21.300 --> 46:23.900
There's a lot of conversations that are happening on them.

46:23.900 --> 46:28.100
There's the ability, the technical capability to sentence,

46:28.100 --> 46:31.460
to remove the ability of people to use the word.

46:31.460 --> 46:33.340
Do you think they should be allowed to use the word

46:33.340 --> 46:34.580
on Twitter, for example?

46:34.660 --> 46:35.500
Mm-hmm.

46:36.660 --> 46:41.100
My response is it all depends on the way

46:41.100 --> 46:43.660
in which the word is being used.

46:43.660 --> 46:47.020
If the word is being used to intimidate,

46:47.020 --> 46:50.020
if the word is being used to terrorize,

46:55.460 --> 46:59.660
then no, along with lots of other words, by the way.

46:59.660 --> 47:02.100
I mean, you can have, I could use the word,

47:02.100 --> 47:03.700
I suppose, gentleman.

47:04.900 --> 47:07.300
I mean, I'm sure that I could conjure up a way

47:07.300 --> 47:11.700
in which that word could be used in a intimidating way.

47:11.700 --> 47:12.540
So,

47:15.780 --> 47:20.780
would I be happy if there was a technology

47:20.900 --> 47:25.820
that always blanked this word, N-I-G-G-E-R?

47:25.820 --> 47:28.020
I would be against that.

47:28.020 --> 47:33.020
For one thing, it would erase the name of one of my books.

47:34.500 --> 47:39.180
And I think that the book actually has

47:39.180 --> 47:42.220
a lot of useful information, makes some useful points.

47:43.580 --> 47:47.140
And by the way, let's imagine a world

47:47.140 --> 47:51.820
in which there was a technology that blanked

47:51.820 --> 47:55.460
every time N-I-G-G-E-R appeared.

47:55.460 --> 48:00.460
You would have, what would that do to novels

48:00.860 --> 48:05.860
by James Baldwin, by Toni Morrison, by,

48:06.020 --> 48:09.860
what would that do to the speeches

48:09.860 --> 48:13.060
of Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr.?

48:13.060 --> 48:15.780
What would that do to the comedy albums

48:15.780 --> 48:19.500
of Richard Pryor, Cat Williams, Dave Chappelle?

48:21.500 --> 48:23.340
You know, what would that,

48:23.380 --> 48:25.900
if one sort of plays that out,

48:27.100 --> 48:31.180
would one want to have all of those blanks

48:32.340 --> 48:37.340
in important literary and political performances?

48:43.660 --> 48:45.260
No, I don't want such blanks.

48:46.300 --> 48:49.300
What I want, I would want for people,

48:49.300 --> 48:51.700
I would want the word to be there

48:51.700 --> 48:54.860
and for people to understand how to deal with this word.

48:54.860 --> 48:58.180
And by the way, you've used the word hurt an awful lot.

48:58.180 --> 48:59.580
So let's talk about hurt.

49:01.700 --> 49:04.020
I think we need to be more careful

49:04.020 --> 49:06.900
with the way in which we deal with hurt

49:07.740 --> 49:12.740
because people can be justifiably hurt.

49:14.020 --> 49:17.500
You can have justifiably hurt feelings.

49:17.500 --> 49:21.580
And if somebody has justifiably hurt feelings,

49:21.620 --> 49:24.020
I then think that we should turn to the person

49:24.020 --> 49:26.820
who has hurt those feelings and say,

49:26.820 --> 49:31.820
you have acted wrongly because this person's feelings

49:31.980 --> 49:36.980
are justifiably hurt in relationship to what you've done.

49:37.060 --> 49:42.060
On the other hand, there are people who have hurt feelings

49:42.860 --> 49:46.780
and frankly, it's unjustified.

49:46.780 --> 49:49.300
So just imagine the following.

49:49.300 --> 49:53.660
Let's imagine that I give a talk

49:53.660 --> 49:57.780
about the greatness of Martin Luther King Jr.

49:57.780 --> 50:01.220
And then let's imagine that a Ku Klux Klansman comes up to me

50:01.220 --> 50:03.580
after my talk and says,

50:03.580 --> 50:07.500
oh, you have now hurt my feelings.

50:07.500 --> 50:09.380
What am I supposed to be?

50:09.380 --> 50:11.580
Am I supposed to apologize?

50:11.580 --> 50:15.620
Am I supposed to be regretful that my talk

50:15.620 --> 50:17.860
about the greatness of Martin Luther King Jr.

50:17.900 --> 50:20.500
has hurt the feelings of the Klansman?

50:20.500 --> 50:22.580
No, my response is gonna be,

50:22.580 --> 50:26.220
you need to reevaluate your feelings

50:26.220 --> 50:31.220
because actually your feeling of hurt is unjustified.

50:32.300 --> 50:36.540
And no, there's no apology coming from me.

50:36.540 --> 50:39.980
But there's a kind of line in perhaps the gray area

50:39.980 --> 50:42.460
and maybe the word hurt has been overused

50:42.460 --> 50:44.580
because if you try to avoid hurting

50:45.220 --> 50:50.220
a small fraction of society that is mentally weak

50:50.900 --> 50:52.820
in a way where everything hurts them,

50:52.820 --> 50:56.500
that's the wrong way to build a society.

50:56.500 --> 50:58.780
But if we flip that upside down and say,

50:58.780 --> 51:01.180
trying to maximize the amount of love in the world

51:02.900 --> 51:04.580
and think about decisions we make

51:04.580 --> 51:06.820
in terms of language we use to try to maximize

51:06.820 --> 51:10.060
the amount of love and not just short-term, but long-term.

51:10.060 --> 51:11.940
And that's where freedom of speech is very powerful

51:11.940 --> 51:15.500
because it's a short-term painful thing often,

51:15.500 --> 51:19.540
but long-term beneficial thing, just having freedom.

51:19.540 --> 51:22.900
And so there's where the question of the N-word

51:22.900 --> 51:24.060
starts to come in.

51:28.140 --> 51:32.060
How do we think about its use on the internet,

51:32.060 --> 51:35.220
on college campuses in a way that maximizes

51:35.220 --> 51:37.060
the amount of love and compassion

51:37.060 --> 51:38.380
and camaraderie in the world?

51:38.380 --> 51:42.340
I think that's good and I would associate myself

51:42.340 --> 51:47.340
with your vision, how can we maximize love?

51:47.900 --> 51:50.060
No, I love that, I think that's great.

51:50.060 --> 51:51.820
So let's take that on.

51:53.740 --> 51:57.380
I doubt that the way of doing that

51:58.700 --> 52:03.700
is to erase the infamous N-word.

52:08.900 --> 52:11.780
I doubt that the way of doing that

52:12.700 --> 52:16.940
is to say to people,

52:18.060 --> 52:21.380
we understand that your feelings are really hurt

52:21.380 --> 52:24.100
and we're gonna do all that we can

52:24.100 --> 52:29.020
to avoid this symbolic action,

52:29.020 --> 52:31.420
maybe this word or maybe this symbol.

52:31.420 --> 52:35.540
We're gonna do all that we can to suppress it

52:35.540 --> 52:39.340
so that we can have a more loving universe.

52:39.340 --> 52:40.740
I doubt that that's the way to do it.

52:40.740 --> 52:42.420
I think a better way to do it,

52:42.420 --> 52:45.300
I think a better way to do it

52:45.300 --> 52:49.820
would be to fully educate people,

52:49.820 --> 52:52.780
including educate people such that,

52:54.980 --> 52:57.220
you see that over there?

52:57.220 --> 53:01.700
That is the uniform of the Ku Klux Klan.

53:01.900 --> 53:03.780
I want you to be educated about the uniform

53:03.780 --> 53:06.180
of the Ku Klux Klan so that you can look at the uniform

53:06.180 --> 53:09.060
of the Ku Klux Klan and know what it's about.

53:09.060 --> 53:11.500
You're not terrorized by it.

53:11.500 --> 53:14.780
You're not immediately, you don't see it

53:14.780 --> 53:18.780
and sink to your knees and start wailing and crying.

53:18.780 --> 53:22.580
You don't see it and say, oh, I'm traumatized.

53:22.580 --> 53:24.300
No, you don't do any of that.

53:24.300 --> 53:26.820
You see it, you understand it.

53:26.820 --> 53:28.020
If somebody asks you about it,

53:28.020 --> 53:29.820
you're fully prepared to do it.

53:29.820 --> 53:31.020
If somebody asks you about it,

53:31.020 --> 53:33.620
you're fully prepared to talk about it.

53:33.620 --> 53:37.260
It seems to me that that attitude, that poise,

53:37.260 --> 53:42.260
that strength, that knowledge would be a better way

53:43.460 --> 53:48.460
of equipping us to have a more loving world.

53:48.780 --> 53:50.420
And by the way, just so, you know,

53:50.420 --> 53:52.900
I would say that about the swastika.

53:52.900 --> 53:55.580
I would say it about the infamous N-word.

53:55.580 --> 54:00.020
I would say it about all of the things

54:00.020 --> 54:01.100
that we're talking about.

54:01.100 --> 54:04.820
It would be better for people to be educated

54:04.820 --> 54:08.540
so that they are not traumatized.

54:11.860 --> 54:16.860
So to you, you know, the N-word should not be removed

54:19.580 --> 54:22.780
from Huck Finn, Adventures of Huck Finn

54:22.780 --> 54:24.980
or from the works of James Baldwin and Tony Morrison.

54:24.980 --> 54:26.100
Not at all.

54:26.100 --> 54:30.820
In fact, it seems to me that the bowlerization

54:30.820 --> 54:35.820
of these great artists' literary work,

54:36.500 --> 54:40.060
as far as I'm concerned, highly objectionable.

54:40.060 --> 54:41.540
Highly objectionable.

54:42.820 --> 54:45.740
When is it okay for a white man to say the N-word

54:45.740 --> 54:47.500
with a hard R?

54:47.500 --> 54:52.500
Well, you know, here we need to focus on the word say.

54:53.140 --> 54:58.140
Is it ever okay for anyone, you know, black, white, pink,

54:58.940 --> 55:02.260
yellow, I don't care, red, orange,

55:02.260 --> 55:07.020
is it okay for anyone to use this word in a way

55:08.460 --> 55:11.780
to put down people, to terrorize people,

55:11.780 --> 55:15.140
to intimidate people, answer no.

55:15.140 --> 55:18.380
But, you know, and I'd say that black person,

55:18.380 --> 55:19.620
I've seen, I mean, by the way,

55:19.620 --> 55:22.060
I've seen black people use this word

55:22.060 --> 55:25.500
to try to intimidate, put down other black people.

55:25.500 --> 55:27.940
Bad, so I'm against it with a black person,

55:27.940 --> 55:30.180
white person, doesn't matter.

55:30.180 --> 55:33.620
On the other hand, on the other hand,

55:36.260 --> 55:41.260
imagine, imagine a white person

55:41.260 --> 55:46.260
who is giving a lecture

55:56.820 --> 55:59.220
on the history of American racism,

56:00.900 --> 56:04.300
a lecture on the history of American racism.

56:05.220 --> 56:08.500
And in giving that lecture,

56:09.100 --> 56:14.100
quotes the, you know, white racist politicians

56:20.820 --> 56:24.540
who until fairly recently in American life

56:24.540 --> 56:26.620
use the infamous N word.

56:27.540 --> 56:31.260
So imagine a white history professor

56:31.260 --> 56:35.820
giving a lecture about the history of American racism

56:35.820 --> 56:40.820
and says, in 1948, this is what so-and-so

56:43.180 --> 56:47.100
running for the presidency of the United States said.

56:47.100 --> 56:52.100
And then quotes a paragraph or two

56:53.260 --> 56:57.860
in which the infamous N word is featured.

56:57.860 --> 56:58.940
Is that bad?

56:58.940 --> 57:00.780
No, that's not bad.

57:00.780 --> 57:02.900
No, that's not bad.

57:02.900 --> 57:06.020
Sounds like a perfectly good lecture.

57:06.020 --> 57:09.980
And I'm glad that you put the infamous N word in there

57:09.980 --> 57:14.220
so that we can see that as recently as 1948,

57:14.220 --> 57:15.980
people who were running for the presidency

57:15.980 --> 57:19.300
of the United States openly use the word.

57:19.300 --> 57:21.340
That does not bother me.

57:21.340 --> 57:22.340
I'll say this too.

57:22.340 --> 57:25.540
Now, you know, somebody says, well, you know,

57:25.540 --> 57:30.540
nice job, Kennedy, but you've limited it to over here.

57:31.140 --> 57:33.260
You've put it in an academic setting.

57:34.620 --> 57:36.260
What about other settings?

57:36.260 --> 57:37.820
It does not bother me.

57:37.820 --> 57:41.820
Let's imagine somebody who's a comedian, a white comedian,

57:41.820 --> 57:46.820
who is satirizing word usage.

57:51.260 --> 57:56.260
Let's imagine a white comedian who is satirizing

57:56.260 --> 58:01.260
who is satirizing our current practice

58:02.940 --> 58:07.940
and wants to poke fun at the way in which, you know,

58:10.060 --> 58:13.060
let's imagine you have a black rapper

58:14.220 --> 58:16.860
who invites people on stage.

58:16.860 --> 58:19.980
And let's suppose they invite a black person on stage

58:19.980 --> 58:23.580
and they're perfectly happy when the black person

58:23.580 --> 58:27.220
is full out with, you know, their lyrics.

58:27.220 --> 58:30.100
They invite a white person on stage.

58:30.100 --> 58:32.180
The white person is, you know, that doesn't really,

58:32.180 --> 58:35.260
you know, sort of mystified, but it comes on stage

58:35.260 --> 58:38.220
and full out with what the rapper says,

58:38.220 --> 58:39.580
including the infamous N word.

58:39.580 --> 58:41.740
And then the black rapper gets mad.

58:42.980 --> 58:45.900
Imagine the white comedian who satirizes that,

58:45.900 --> 58:48.460
pokes fun at that.

58:48.460 --> 58:53.100
And in poking fun at that says the infamous N word.

58:53.140 --> 58:54.060
Am I angry?

58:54.060 --> 58:57.740
No, I'm not angry, not angry at all.

58:57.740 --> 58:59.660
What if in the process of satirizing

58:59.660 --> 59:00.980
that comedian is not very funny?

59:00.980 --> 59:04.220
You say that bad joke, you were not funny.

59:04.220 --> 59:05.380
Okay.

59:05.380 --> 59:08.780
I don't object to the use of the infamous N word.

59:08.780 --> 59:11.900
I just say, you know, you're not very funny.

59:11.900 --> 59:15.220
But because there's a line when the joke is not funny,

59:15.220 --> 59:19.100
it just seems like the comedy is used as a cover

59:19.100 --> 59:20.700
to actually say something hateful.

59:20.700 --> 59:23.020
It's interesting thing about comedy.

59:23.940 --> 59:25.980
I feel like the funnier you are,

59:25.980 --> 59:28.220
the more you can get away with.

59:28.220 --> 59:29.060
Probably.

59:29.060 --> 59:32.100
And that's something to do with the thing we said earlier,

59:32.100 --> 59:35.460
which is when you use words that have power,

59:35.460 --> 59:38.060
you should do so with skill and competence

59:38.060 --> 59:42.100
and the responsibility those words carry.

59:42.100 --> 59:44.460
Again, the cases that I'm most familiar with

59:44.460 --> 59:48.820
are the cases involving teachers, professors,

59:48.820 --> 59:50.380
you know, academic.

59:50.420 --> 59:55.420
And it is said sometimes, oh, you know, why do I object?

59:56.380 --> 01:00:01.380
I object, sometimes people say, because, you know,

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:05.900
I suspect that this teacher just wanted to say the word

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:10.140
and that all of this is a cover, a pretext.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:14.620
Do I, you know, in my sense, my sense of it is no,

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.260
I don't think it's a pretext.

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:19.820
If, you know, if it's pretextual, that's bad.

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:22.700
But in my experience, I have not seen that.

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:24.740
I don't believe that that's what's going on.

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:27.740
I agree with you on that, but sometimes I do see people

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:32.380
that kind of have this fly, flying towards the light,

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:37.380
desire to say something controversial and edgy,

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.540
and they don't realize that there's a responsibility there.

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:42.980
There's a skill they should, you shouldn't just say,

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:45.100
I mean, actually, when comedians first start out,

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.460
they'll sometimes go into that church

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:50.300
they'll say edgy stuff that's totally not funny.

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:55.220
And then you realize this is not like the edgier the thing,

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.900
the more skills required to really serve.

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:01.460
Like if you're, if you're cooking as a chef,

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:04.180
a poisonous fish, there's a responsibility

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:05.500
on how to cook the damn thing

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.260
so you don't poison the people eating it.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:10.620
I would agree, but to get back to your question,

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:16.540
let's imagine that somebody produces a new set

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:20.020
of Lenny Bruce albums.

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:22.580
So Lenny Bruce was white.

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:27.100
Lenny Bruce used the term nigger in his sets.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:27.940
Sure did.

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:32.940
Question, would I want Lenny Bruce's albums now

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:39.820
to be purged of the infamous N word?

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:43.260
My response, absolutely not.

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:47.060
As another follow on sort of question, what you think,

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:50.620
I've seen interviews you've done about this particular book.

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:54.340
The title of those interviews on YouTube and elsewhere

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:56.420
would use the full word.

01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:00.180
What do you think about that?

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.960
Should I use this word in the title?

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.760
In my view, the answer would be yes.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:10.000
Again, there are people, I've been on interviews.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I've been on stage with people who had a different conclusion

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.440
and I respect a different way.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.440
Again, there is a place for euphemism.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.160
Again, it all depends.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.800
I'm not offended.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:35.280
Let's imagine that you posted this

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:39.880
and you had asterisks instead of spelling it out.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.640
Would I be offended?

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.920
No, I wouldn't be offended.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:46.640
I would prefer the full spelling,

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.960
but I would understand where you're coming from.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:49.800
Would it offend me?

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:50.640
No, it wouldn't offend me.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.400
Well, here's the weird calculation is which version

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.540
of the word in the title, as silly as that is,

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.920
brings more love to the world.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.160
It's hard and basically your answer is

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:06.840
I don't know.

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:11.120
Your answer is you have to do it and find out.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.120
I'm not sure.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:17.360
Again, there's certain questions in which,

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.600
there's certain questions you're not gonna,

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:23.560
we're not really going to know.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.880
There's no sociologist who's gonna be able to tell us that.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.040
So what do we do then?

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:34.040
Then we go to secondary positions.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:39.200
And my secondary position is

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:43.840
I don't know one thing that I hold on to, however,

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:48.840
very strongly is the virtue of openness,

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:55.400
the virtue of transparency, the virtue of freedom.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:01.600
And I feel as though if I'm holding on to those things,

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:06.760
if I'm trying to engage in a serious conversation

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:11.520
in which I'm trying to make other people understand me

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.880
and I'm listening carefully to other people,

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.520
I feel at ease.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.360
I feel at ease.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:23.360
I feel this is going to eventuate in something positive

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.160
and I feel okay.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.280
So you are at Harvard.

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:34.640
You're one of the most respected people

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:35.880
in the history of Harvard.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.560
That said, you did write a book with the N word in it

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.680
and you also have a lot of opinions

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.640
that challenge the mainstream perspectives

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.600
on race from all sides.

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.520
Hopefully we'll get to talk about some of them.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:52.240
But what's your view on Harvard

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:55.880
and universities in general and speech?

01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:00.880
Did you feel pressure from any direction on first of all,

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.520
the title of this book, the content of the book

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.640
and in general, your views on race?

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:11.640
Yeah, I am very laudatory of Harvard University.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:18.680
I've been at Harvard since 1984.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:23.680
I think it is a wonderful place to work.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:29.320
I have, in the various positions I've taken

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.960
with particularly with respect to this book

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.400
or all my other books, what has Harvard University done?

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.920
Harvard University has done nothing

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:48.920
but provide support, sustenance, encouragement.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:54.760
I think that people get down on Harvard University.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.280
I would say to anybody, imagine the following.

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:05.200
Imagine that the ethos of Harvard University

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:10.200
became the governing ethos of the United States overnight.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.600
Tomorrow, we would wake up

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.800
in a much better United States of America.

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:24.840
I've been supported by Harvard University.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.560
I think well of Harvard University.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.680
That's not to say that I don't have criticisms of it,

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:35.680
but by and large, Harvard University,

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:40.080
more than by and large, overwhelmingly, it has provided me

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:44.600
and I think it overwhelmingly provides my colleagues

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:49.600
with a work setting in which they can do their work

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:54.800
without fear and that's a good thing.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:58.640
Are there certain aspects of Harvard University

01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.840
about which I'm critical?

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:00.680
Yeah, sure.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.760
By the way, I think a few people rightfully, wrongfully

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:07.560
would disagree with you

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.560
that if the ethos of Harvard University

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:12.120
took over the country, it'd be a better place.

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.120
But there's a lot of interesting ways to break that down

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.360
because Harvard, there's not one ethos.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:19.440
There's a lot of things going on that are very interesting.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.440
But one of the things that's happening

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:25.960
is the disproportionate and a kind of aggressive growth

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:29.760
of the administration versus faculty and students.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.160
I think the power of university

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.920
should always be with the faculty and the students.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.840
That's where the beauty is.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.880
That's where the flourishing happens.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:38.800
And the more you have kind of rules and bureaucracy

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.760
and all this kind of stuff,

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.240
the less powerful the university is.

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:46.480
I think that at my university

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.880
and at many universities, that's right.

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:54.320
There's too much bureaucracy, too much regulation.

01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:00.600
And are there dangers to freedom of expression

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.680
at my university and at other universities?

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.840
Answer, yeah, there are, there are.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:14.280
So, and this has really hit home for me.

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:18.080
There was a period of time in which I was getting off of,

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:22.280
you know, I'd gotten off of all boards.

01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:23.640
I was just doing my work.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.000
Forget it, I'm just gonna do my work.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.080
I'm not gonna be on, you know,

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.560
associated with any organizations.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.880
In the last five years, that has changed quite dramatically.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.880
I have gotten on various, I've re-associated myself

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.640
with various organizations, mainly organizations

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:47.640
involving academic freedom because of what's going on

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.480
at, you know, on university campuses.

01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:58.480
Again, I have been, at least thus far, thus far,

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:05.200
this hasn't pinched me where I live, but...

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:07.480
You mean in the space of ideas.

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:10.000
In the space of ideas, in the space of speech,

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.520
in the face of, you know, teaching.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.280
You know, I haven't been pinched,

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:18.640
but I am concerned about things.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:21.640
So, for instance, let's imagine that you're applying

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:25.160
for a job, you know, you wanna be an assistant professor.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.600
Or let's suppose that you're seeking a promotion.

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.440
On many university campuses,

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:36.120
you are asked to give a DEI statement

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:41.120
in which you say, I plan to, you know,

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.960
one of the reasons why you should hire me

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.520
or one of the reasons why you should promote me

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:49.440
is because I'm going to, you know,

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:54.440
advance the DEI ambitions.

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.440
Diversity, equity, and inclusion for people who don't know.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:01.560
This is the general set of programs

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.680
that most universities now have.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.520
Yes, that's right.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:10.000
So, you know, you've got to sort of, you know,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.800
basically what you're being asked to do,

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.440
whether they say it explicitly or not,

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.880
they don't say this explicitly,

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.800
but this is what they're being, this is what is up.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:24.360
What you're being asked to do is to say,

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:29.400
I'm down with the diversity, equity, and inclusion ethos,

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.680
program, policy, campaign,

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.760
and here's what I've done that shows

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:43.520
that I'm down with this program and therefore I'm okay.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.800
Well, you know, a lot of what I do

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.720
would fit very comfortably within that,

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:51.480
but let's suppose that I didn't,

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.640
just suppose I didn't like this.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:58.160
And by the way, there's certain aspects of the DEI,

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:01.120
you know, industry that I don't like.

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.880
You mean to tell me that, you know,

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:07.520
I'm being judged at an academic institution.

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.120
Let's suppose I want to be a chemist.

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.640
Let's suppose I want to be a physicist.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.680
Let's suppose I want to be, I don't care,

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:17.000
you know, a critic of literature.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.520
I oppose this program.

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:24.160
I don't, you know, I don't think this is the way

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.720
in which higher education should be going.

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:33.840
Should I have to, on pain of relinquishing my ability

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.000
to be hired, should I have to sign on to this?

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:42.560
Just suppose, let's change it around.

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:45.720
Let's not make it a DEI campaign.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:50.640
Let's make it a Make America Great Again campaign.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.720
What would we think then?

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.720
Let's suppose it was something that said,

01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:00.240
instead of it saying DEI, let's make it say

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:06.040
the advancement of American capitalism as we know it.

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.840
We want you to be down with that.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:14.320
What have you done that shows us that you believe

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:18.240
in the advancement of capitalism in America?

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.520
Would I be happy about it?

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.880
No, I would say this is no.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:27.880
Well, no with respect to these, as far as I'm concerned,

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:30.400
with the, you know, the DEI statements.

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.560
Oh, here's another one.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.760
I just learned, and in fact, I mean,

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.920
there's certain things that are happening,

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.160
and I must say, I mean, I'm in academia,

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.400
but it's news to me.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.120
I didn't know until relatively recently

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.000
about positionality statements.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.880
So these are statements in which somebody writes an article.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:55.720
Let's suppose, you know, I write an article,

01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:00.720
and it's not enough for me just to submit my article

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:06.080
to some law review or to some, you know,

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.920
some other sort of journal.

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:12.520
No, in addition to me submitting my article,

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.120
I've got to give a positionality statement

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:19.440
in which I say whether I am, you know,

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:22.640
gay or straight or what have you,

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:27.640
in which I say my race, in which I say my nationality,

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:31.440
in which I say my, you know, my stance

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.360
toward this ideological position

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.160
or that ideological position.

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.040
Interesting.

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.640
What?

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:42.880
Is this becoming a kind of a standard?

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.480
I don't know how widespread it is.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.280
I know there was a very good article

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:50.000
in the New York Times a couple of days ago

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.720
about these positionality statements,

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:54.040
and in fact, that's what sort of tipped me off.

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.400
Somebody had told me there was a law review

01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:00.200
at my home institution, and I had a friend

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.800
who sort of mentioned this offhandedly

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:06.920
and who said, well, I submitted an article

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:11.000
to this journal, and I was a little bit taken aback

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.000
insofar as they did have me fill out a questionnaire

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:23.880
in which I was required to state my race,

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:28.240
state this, state that, state the other,

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:34.240
and, you know, as far as I'm concerned,

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:40.000
well, what does that have to do

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.000
with a proper assessment of somebody's work?

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.000
This concerns me.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:53.680
I'm concerned about the fact, you know,

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.480
a little while ago, you mentioned,

01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:00.560
a little while ago, you mentioned the word negro.

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:07.440
I was talking with colleagues a couple months ago,

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:12.040
and somebody mentioned that this word had come up

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:15.840
in their class because what happened was

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:20.840
one student was reading from a Supreme Court decision,

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:26.080
and the word negro was part of what they read out,

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.160
and another student held up his hand

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.280
and said to the student who was reading,

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.240
A, you should be careful because, you know,

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:39.320
I find the word negro offensive,

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:45.280
and you need to be careful about even saying a word

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.920
that would be offensive to someone,

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.000
and this person, and then, you know, the teacher was,

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.480
you know, what should I say in those circumstances?

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.960
What should I have said?

01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:00.040
And I volunteered, you know, and I said,

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.480
well, guys, that's really interesting

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.120
because see, if that had come up in my class,

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.600
I would have said, well, frankly, I don't see what the,

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.520
I don't even see what the big deal is

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:14.080
because I use the word negro.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:19.080
And, you know, Harvard University

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:24.840
is not, you know, on some island that is, you know,

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.840
apart from everything else that's happening in the world,

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:30.360
if these things are happening in other places,

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:31.840
if they're happening at Stanford,

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:32.880
if they're happening at Yale,

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:36.120
if they're happening at Columbia, you know,

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.280
they're gonna happen at Harvard.

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:45.040
But thus far, and I am most especially experienced

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:50.000
in life at Harvard Law School.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.800
Harvard Law School is an open environment

01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:00.800
in which ideas are tested and they are tested fully.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:09.320
And it's because of that that I say

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:13.960
I have been fully supported at Harvard Law School,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.400
feel that it is an excellent place in which to do work.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:22.280
I'm a fan, I am a fan, and I'm not embarrassed to say it.

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:27.280
I am a fan of my workplace, Harvard Law School.

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.960
Very happy to be associated with Harvard Law School.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:36.720
Zooming out, in general in education,

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:39.560
there's something called critical race theory.

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.160
Can you comment on what are your thoughts

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:47.160
about this kind of perspective on race and race in America

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:51.720
to the degree that it's becoming a part

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:53.760
of the education program?

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.480
Okay, so the first thing I wanna say-

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:56.600
What is it?

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.640
Well, the first thing I wanna say

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:02.400
about critical race theory is that critical race theory

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:06.840
has become a term, so I'm gonna put quotation marks

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:09.920
around the term critical race theory.

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.040
In a minute, I'll talk about critical race theory

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:16.160
without quotation marks, but to begin with,

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.880
I wanna talk about critical race theory

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.720
because the reason why people are talking

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:22.240
about critical race theory so much now

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:26.680
is because politicians, mainly Republican

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:32.880
right-wing politicians, have created a boogeyman

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:38.400
critical race theory with quotation marks around it.

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.640
They have created a boogeyman,

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.240
and they have tried to make it seem

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:51.240
as though this boogeyman believes all sorts of ideas

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:57.120
that Americans should loathe and that Americans should fear.

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:01.840
And they've created this boogeyman and they've created it

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.480
and they've done a very good job of creating the boogeyman

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:09.480
and they have mobilized sufficient public support

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:13.200
such that there are a number of states

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:18.200
that have passed laws prohibiting the teaching

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:22.600
of so-called critical race theory.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.280
Now, the first thing I wanna say about this

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:30.280
is that this campaign, these laws, these various policies

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.800
telling teachers don't teach this and don't teach that

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:38.880
and you can't use this book, you can't use that book,

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:43.880
this is a frightening encroachment on freedom,

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.320
freedom of speech, freedom to learn,

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:53.320
freedom to listen, freedom to read, that's terrible.

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.280
And it's one of the most frightening things

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:59.520
that has happened in American life in recent memory.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.200
So that's the first thing I wanna say

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:04.480
about so-called critical race theory.

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.720
Now, now I'll say something,

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:09.400
I'm gonna take the quotation marks off

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.840
of the term critical race theory.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:16.120
Critical race theory is a sort of a,

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.160
you could have a nice conversation

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:21.080
about actually what it is.

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:25.320
One way of viewing it is to say that,

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:30.320
well, critical race theory is a community of ideas

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:34.360
that comes from a community of people.

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:40.320
The community of people would be people in legal academia

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:47.200
in the period 1908 starting

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:53.160
and probably the middle of the 1980s.

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:57.200
It would be associated with people like Derrick Bell,

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:01.160
it would be associated with people like Kimberly Crenshaw,

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:03.080
people like Charles Lawrence,

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:07.440
people like Richard Delgado, people like Mary Matsuda.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:11.200
And these are folks who held,

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:14.760
embraced a couple of,

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.240
they articulated a couple of propositions.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.560
One of their propositions was that

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:24.560
liberal race policy was insufficient.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:35.560
They would say that the racial policies of a person

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:40.040
like my old boss, their good marshal,

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:45.040
the liberal racial policies were insufficient

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:50.800
to grapple fully with the pervasiveness

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:54.480
and the depth and intensity of American racism.

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.760
Their basic claim, and I think by the way,

01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:57.600
it was a good claim.

01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:01.320
Their basic claim was that American racism

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:06.320
is more central, more deeply embedded in American life

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:12.200
than most people perceived, including liberals.

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:14.800
And I think there was a lot of strength to that

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:19.800
proposition, but then they also took on

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.720
some other propositions with which

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.840
I was in very strong disagreement.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:30.280
So I think it's perfectly fine to say that racism

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:35.280
is a force in American life that is deeper, more pervasive,

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:41.520
more stubborn, more resilient than I think people often

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:46.320
understand, often perceive.

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:51.320
But then some of the folks in critical race theory

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:56.400
push further.

01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:00.320
One of the propositions that some of the people

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:03.080
in critical race theory took was the proposition

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:08.080
that America was doomed to always be a country

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:16.720
that would be governed according to the dictates

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.200
of white supremacy.

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:21.680
Derek Bell, who was a colleague of mine

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:24.320
and a friend of mine, took that position.

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:29.320
He talked about the prominence of racism in American life,

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:33.080
and he took the position that the various changes

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:36.040
that had been wrought in American life

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:39.880
were really mainly cosmetic.

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.640
They didn't amount to a whole lot.

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:44.640
I mean, Derek Bell took the position,

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:47.920
the second reconstruction, the civil rights movement.

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:52.160
Well, yeah, it made changes, but at the end of the day,

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:57.160
black people were still, after the second reconstruction,

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:03.280
were still in a position of almost, you know,

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:08.160
I don't know, some of them would even say neo-slavery.

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.720
Well, I think that's ridiculous.

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:13.840
The second reconstruction changed a lot.

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:17.200
And as for neo-slavery, neo-slavery,

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:18.600
what are you talking about?

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:22.720
A black American was president of the United States

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.720
between the years 2008 and 2016.

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:30.220
I mean, what are we talking about here?

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:34.600
There's been a tremendous change,

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.560
and I think people ought to understand that.

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:42.200
Now, am I saying that everything is peachy keen and all right?

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:47.200
No, the United States is still, to a very large extent,

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:52.640
still a pigmentocracy, but that doesn't mean

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:55.720
that a lot hasn't changed, a lot has.

01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:00.360
So I disagree with certain tenets of critical race theory

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.920
and have been very outspoken in my disagreement.

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:05.360
There's another one, by the way, I need to mention,

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:08.000
because we've talked so much in our discussion

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.440
about freedom of speech, freedom to teach,

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.600
freedom of listening.

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.000
Another big problem that I've had

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.280
with some of the people who talk of themselves

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:23.960
as critical race theory people has to do

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:28.960
with their attitude towards freedom, freedom of speech.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:32.400
Some critical race theory people think

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:37.400
that the American legal system is wrong in the latitude

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:43.920
that it gives to what they call hate speech

01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:46.360
or the latitude that it gives

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:49.920
to what they would view as racist beliefs.

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.360
Some of the people who associate themselves

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.040
with critical race theory think

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:59.800
that racist beliefs ought to be expunged

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:03.680
with the aid of state power, if need be.

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:05.680
Well, I'm against that.

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:10.680
And I think we are at a moment, an ironic moment

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:17.960
in which actually it's the right wing

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:20.760
that has embraced some of the ideas

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:23.600
that were championed by some of the people

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:26.600
who call themselves critical race theorists.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:31.600
They say, oh, we ought to expunge hate speech.

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.880
Well, the right wing is saying this critical race theory,

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:37.160
that's hate speech, so let's expunge it.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.000
And so again, I've been very outspoken

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:48.040
in my criticism of some of the illiberal dimensions

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:54.960
of critical race theory.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:58.000
So I've been a critic of certain features

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.600
of critical race theory.

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:04.600
I have applauded certain features of critical race theory.

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.320
Critical race theory, there's some aspects of it

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.400
that I think have been useful.

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.400
There's some aspects of it that I think have been

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:14.040
profoundly wrong-headed.

01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.280
So that's where I am.

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:21.120
And I certainly, and above all,

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:25.720
I certainly am against any efforts

01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:30.720
to remove it from the intellectual universe.

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:33.960
It is a part of our intellectual universe.

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:38.760
People ought to know about it and people ought to debate it

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:41.880
and people ought to be free to make up their minds

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:46.400
to conclude what they will about the strengths

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.800
and weaknesses of critical race theory.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:53.800
And we'll talk about the pessimistic

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:56.560
and the optimistic perspective on race

01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:59.360
in the history of the 20th century in America.

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.080
I think you have very interesting perspectives there,

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:04.800
but before that, I'd love to look at the current moment.

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:08.680
And you had a conversation with Glenn Lowry

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:12.800
and John McWhorter, and from there,

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:16.840
it became clear to me, I think John made clear

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:21.840
how important to the conversation about race

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:26.120
is policing in today's society,

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:29.680
that that's where a lot of African-Americans feel

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:32.720
is sort of the pinnacle of racism sits,

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.920
the people that believe there's still racism in America.

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:37.520
There's still a lot of racism in America.

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:38.840
That's where it is.

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:43.840
So to what degree do you think there's widespread

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.920
institutional racism in policing?

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:51.920
Yeah, well, my first book was a book called

01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:56.720
Race, Crime, and the Law, and-

01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.120
1997.

01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.800
1997, wow.

01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:02.280
Time flies.

01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:03.240
Time flies.

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:10.320
Unfortunately, unfortunately,

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:18.840
the impetus behind that book stands.

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:29.560
That book was propelled by a sense that,

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.880
with respect to the administration of criminal justice,

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:40.440
African-Americans are

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:47.440
feel deeply aggrieved,

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:50.520
and they feel deeply aggrieved with good reason.

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:54.760
And they feel deeply aggrieved with good reason

01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:57.000
in at least two dimensions.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.480
On the one hand,

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:01.760
on the one hand,

01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:08.280
African-Americans suffer from under protection.

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:13.480
And in fact, in that book, the central theme of that book,

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:18.600
was that black Americans suffer from under protection.

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:21.880
If you take a look at the broad,

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:26.840
sort of the broad trajectory of American history,

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.760
and ask yourself,

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:36.760
in what way have black Americans been most oppressed?

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:42.440
Well, take a look at the antebellum period,

01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:47.520
period before the abolition of slavery.

01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:51.000
Before the abolition of slavery,

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:56.040
in the locales where most black people resided,

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.880
namely the slave states,

01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:02.040
in a lot of those areas, question,

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:06.320
was there a crime in the slave states?

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:12.080
A crime called the murder of a black person.

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:16.880
Answer, for a long period, the answer was no.

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:18.560
There might've been a tort, you know,

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:22.400
so if a white person killed the slave,

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.800
killed a slave,

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.760
that person could be sued,

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:29.640
because they had,

01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:34.640
they had injured the property of another,

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:38.520
and would have to pay money to, you know, for that,

01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:40.960
but had they committed a crime?

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:42.160
Answer, no.

01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:47.600
In the antebellum period,

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:52.600
were black women protected against the crime of rape?

01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:59.840
In most states, the answer was no.

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.120
There was no such crime.

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:07.680
Let's go to after, you know, slavery is abolished.

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:11.200
Thank God, slavery is abolished.

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:13.600
Then, let's see, you know, what happens?

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:18.120
What, you know, so we hear lynching, lynching.

01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:23.960
But in the, from 1890 until, let's say, 1930,

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:29.600
well, you know, in 1890, there were,

01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:33.240
there was probably, you know, I would say,

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:34.600
but there was probably, on average,

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:37.120
a lynching every day in the United States,

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:39.400
you know, well over 300 lynchings.

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:44.320
It goes down, that was the case in the 1890s,

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:47.120
probably the first decade of the 20th century,

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:48.840
and then it starts going down.

01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:53.160
What was lynching about?

01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:58.160
Lynching was about black people being executed

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:01.680
outside the law.

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:06.880
Did the legal system do anything about that?

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:07.800
Answer, no.

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:13.160
You know, you, show me, show me cases

01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:17.200
in which people were prosecuted criminally

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:20.920
for engaging in lynching.

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:24.760
You come up, in most places, with a null set.

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:30.440
Black people suffered the under protection of the law.

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.080
Do black people still suffer

01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:33.440
the under protection of the law?

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:34.800
The answer is yes.

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:39.120
And people talk about the Kerner Commission Report, 1968.

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:43.400
Black people were asked, you know,

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:45.840
with respect to the police,

01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:48.240
what's your main complaint?

01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:51.760
In many places, the main complaint was,

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:53.880
we don't have police protection.

01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:58.760
You know, when things happen to us,

01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:02.960
when our houses are burgled,

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:09.200
when our businesses are encroached upon by robbers,

01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.080
when our businesses are robbed,

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:18.440
when we're assaulted, you know, nothing happens.

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:22.680
The police protect white people, they don't protect us.

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:26.240
Under protection.

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:31.960
Our society right now, if you take a look at the statistics,

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:36.880
who is most liable to be raped,

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:40.880
robbed, the victim of assault?

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:45.360
What have you?

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.240
Black people.

01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:49.680
I mean, and it's not even close.

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.200
Under protection.

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:56.560
So that's one way in which the administration

01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:00.280
of criminal justice harms black people

01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:04.600
by not doing what government is supposed to do,

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.880
which is protect us.

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:10.520
14th Amendment, you know.

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:16.960
Equal protection, I underline, protection of the law.

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:19.920
So that was a big theme of race, crime, and the law.

01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:22.360
Now, second thing, second,

01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:24.960
and this is the thing that gets most attention.

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.120
And it's important.

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:29.160
I think that the under protection story

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.200
does not get enough attention.

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:32.480
But then there's a second story.

01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:36.360
The second story is that black people

01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:39.120
have historically and still today,

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:44.800
black people are subjects of invidious racial discrimination

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:47.320
when it comes to,

01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:51.440
when it comes to police action.

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:53.600
So, you know,

01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:02.080
walking down the street, walking down the street,

01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:09.520
you have a black person who's, let's say, 20 years old.

01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:13.480
You have a white person who's 20 years old.

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.080
Let's make them men.

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:16.960
Both just walking down the street.

01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:22.960
And the question, attitude of the police towards these two.

01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:27.400
And attitude, you know, is a complicated thing.

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.280
It can show itself in various ways.

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:30.800
It can show itself in a look.

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:36.200
It can show itself in who gets the look.

01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:41.120
You know, black persons walking down the street

01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:42.560
or running down the street,

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.040
white persons walking down the street

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.440
or running down the street.

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.480
What happens with respect to the police?

01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:58.160
Let's suppose that, you know, who gets the second look?

01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:02.040
Who is followed?

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:06.040
Who is detained for a moment?

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:11.120
Well, some of it is just on a small tangent.

01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:12.240
I apologize to interrupt,

01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.160
but attitude is an interesting one

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:17.680
because a lot of it,

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:21.040
a lot of the interaction doesn't show up in the data.

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:23.560
So detained, for example, starts showing up in the data.

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:25.760
But before then, the second look, the third look,

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:26.720
the first look,

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:30.520
this is where the gray area of conversation happens

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:35.520
because culture and society happens in the stuff

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:37.640
that doesn't often show up in the data.

01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:39.720
Yep, yep.

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:43.560
So I'll tell you, this really came home to me

01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:46.320
several years ago.

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:48.120
I was in New York City

01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:53.720
and it was at a time when there was a lot of discussion

01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:55.840
over the-

01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:56.680
Stop and frisk.

01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:58.520
Stop and frisk, basically, you know,

01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:00.440
racial profiling on the street.

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:03.040
I was walking, I was in Harlem.

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:06.000
I'm walking down the street.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:12.000
And frankly, you know, the police weren't bothering me.

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:13.360
I'm just walking.

01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:14.840
No, no, no, the police weren't bothering me,

01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:16.680
but you know, I'm of a certain age.

01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:22.840
I did notice though, I was looking at the police

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:28.840
and the way that the police attitude,

01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:32.480
you know, had to do with body posture,

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:35.840
it had to do with, that's right, who got a second look,

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:39.640
I noticed, I'm walking in the street,

01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:41.920
I'm walking in Harlem.

01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:44.160
You know, there are white people in the street.

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:47.120
You know, most of the people though were black,

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:48.640
some Hispanic.

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:54.080
The level of contempt,

01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:58.400
the level of animus,

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:02.120
the level of unfriendliness

01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:05.280
that was pouring off the cop, the police,

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:06.960
they didn't say anything.

01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:10.240
No, they didn't detain, they didn't say anything.

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:14.480
It was palpable, I could feel the attitude

01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:19.480
that was being directed at the young black men.

01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:23.400
And the thing is, see, the thing is,

01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:27.800
it's not as if this doesn't matter, it matters

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:32.800
because the way I saw it, these young black men knew,

01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:38.480
they felt the contempt that the police were shedding

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.440
and this was gonna have a consequence.

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.360
The consequence it was gonna have is,

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:46.880
let's imagine that the police did say, excuse me,

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:51.080
you know, what are you up to?

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.240
Now, if you have been feeling this contempt,

01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:00.360
if you feel like the officer who is asking this question

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:03.360
doesn't like you, doesn't know anything about you,

01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.520
but just doesn't like you on site,

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.840
you might answer in a certain sort of way.

01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:14.200
You're not going to give the cop the benefit of the doubt

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:16.440
and basically think, well, you know,

01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:18.480
policeman's just, you know, asking me this,

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:22.800
you know, probably just trying to make the neighborhood safe.

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:25.080
Well, if that's your feeling, you know,

01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:26.240
policeman's just asking me this,

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:27.920
trying to make the neighborhood safe,

01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:31.320
well, officer, the reason why I'm here is such and such

01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:35.400
and, you know, thanks for your service.

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:36.920
That's one response.

01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:39.960
Another response is,

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.040
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:48.600
You know, I'm not gonna tell you anything.

01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:52.720
I know that you don't mean me any good.

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:54.200
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:55.480
Am I free to leave?

01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:59.840
And then the cop, having heard that,

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:01.160
then says something bad.

01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:04.640
You know, after five minutes, what do you have?

01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:07.800
You have an altercation on your hand.

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:12.560
And I felt that, and that is part,

01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:14.360
and you're absolutely right.

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:16.800
That's not written down.

01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:18.320
It doesn't get to court.

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:21.600
It's there,

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:27.080
but it's an important part of street life.

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.920
It's an informal part of street life.

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:33.280
And it has ripple effects because that young black man

01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:37.000
will probably talk shit about that cop later that day,

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.400
so the narrative persists,

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:41.840
and then the cop will also talk shit,

01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:43.960
and then there's these narratives,

01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:48.720
and I think the contempt is such a powerful thing.

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:51.840
It's so hard to disentangle,

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:53.640
because you're absolutely right.

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:58.120
The young man, let's suppose that the story ends, quote,

01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:02.240
well, he's gonna go,

01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:03.960
and he's gonna be talking with his friends,

01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:04.800
and he's gonna say,

01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:06.720
let me tell you what just happened to me.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.600
And his friends are gonna say,

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:11.400
oh yeah, that doesn't surprise me.

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:13.880
Let me tell you what happened to me.

01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:16.600
And you know, for two hours, this goes on.

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:19.400
The anger, the feeling of humiliation,

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:24.400
the feeling of aggrievement grows, it's disseminated,

01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:30.240
and that's part of what we have.

01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:34.200
But that's not all of, that's a important part

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:36.640
of what we have, but we have, it's even worse than that,

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:39.240
because then you ask the question,

01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:44.240
you know, what about things we do know?

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:49.800
I know this from my teaching.

01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:54.240
This was brought up, you know,

01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:56.720
there was a lawsuit in New York City.

01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:01.640
And notice, I didn't say Birmingham, Alabama,

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:03.280
I didn't say Atlanta, Georgia,

01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:05.480
I didn't say Tallahassee, Florida,

01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:08.120
I didn't say, you know, the Deep South,

01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:12.400
I didn't say Montana, I didn't say Idaho, New York City.

01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:18.040
You know, cosmopolitan place, metropolis.

01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:22.520
In New York City, the police were challenged

01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:26.000
with respect to their policies.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:30.120
A judge wrote a very lengthy opinion,

01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:31.600
and the facts were rolled out,

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:34.160
and the facts were really quite horrifying.

01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:39.880
People, there were black men who had been stopped

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:42.920
many, many times, it wasn't just once,

01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:47.280
over and over and over again,

01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:50.240
under circumstances in which

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:52.560
they ought not have been stopped.

01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:56.520
And, you know, this has real consequences.

01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:58.560
It doesn't just show up here though, of course,

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:01.080
it also shows up in other places

01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:04.360
with respect to the administration of justice.

01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:08.520
And we still have, you know, a big problem.

01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.920
Now, you mentioned, you know, the police.

01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:13.400
If you ask yourself,

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.560
who are the state agents

01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:23.840
that are most consequential?

01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:28.200
The police.

01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:29.960
I mean, you walking down the street,

01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:34.960
what other agents have guns on them?

01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:39.800
What other agents are authorized by the law

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:43.320
to shoot you under certain circumstances?

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:44.200
It's the police.

01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:49.200
The police are the most consequential agents of the state

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:51.600
that most people interact with.

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:54.880
I mean, there's, to push back a little bit,

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:58.000
consequential in a physical sense,

01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.400
but if we return to the power,

01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:01.960
the psychological sense of contempt,

01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:04.400
I would say, store clerks and stuff like that

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:05.400
can also be a source of-

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:06.920
They're not agents of the state.

01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:07.800
Right.

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:10.560
But if we look at the landscape of contempt,

01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:13.080
which throughout the 20th century,

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:15.400
you know, or the bus, right,

01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:21.040
you can experience the same kind of contempt

01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:23.200
in other aspects of society.

01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:25.720
But yes, the cops have consequences.

01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:27.160
I would still put the police.

01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:30.840
The policeman or the police person

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:35.960
is a person walking down the street with a gun.

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:37.360
Gun, yeah.

01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:41.480
And if you think about the way in which the law,

01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:47.360
the extent to which the police are authorized

01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:52.120
to use their force,

01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:54.680
the police have extraordinary,

01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:58.320
you know, extraordinary authority.

01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:04.280
You know, you're driving your car and you're speeding.

01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:09.360
The police can arrest you right then and there

01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:11.560
and take you to jail.

01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:13.400
That's an extraordinary power.

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:15.480
But they also have, because of that,

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.120
the leverage, just one human to another,

01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:19.920
they have more leverage to be an asshole

01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:21.360
and to show contempt to you.

01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:22.200
They certainly do.

01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:27.280
To be the lesser, to lean into the lesser aspects

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.320
of their nature as all humans can,

01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:31.080
just to be an asshole, to show contempt.

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:32.800
You had a bad day.

01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:34.920
They have the more freedom to do that.

01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:39.920
Yes, and that's why police officers are very important.

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:45.840
I recognize, I mean, you know, I know police officers.

01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:47.480
They have a very difficult job,

01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:52.320
a very important job, very important.

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:55.160
Again, remember what I talked about under protection.

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:57.440
I want the police to protect me.

01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:01.960
I want the police to protect me from the rapist, the robber.

01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:06.520
So I, you know, the police, I'm with the police.

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:08.840
We need good policing.

01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:13.680
But we need good policing.

01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:16.720
And for good policing, we need accountability.

01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:21.480
And one of the scandals, one of the just absolute scandals

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:25.680
of American law is the extent to which the police

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:28.440
are not held accountable.

01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:30.640
It's absolutely remarkable.

01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:35.640
The degree to which American law fails

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.800
to properly hold police accountable.

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:42.520
They have an important job, a difficult job.

01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:44.680
I want them to be very well paid.

01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:48.000
As far as I'm concerned, you know, we should be,

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.560
police should make more money.

01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:54.840
They should be given the importance of what they do.

01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:00.560
They should have more respect, more prestige, more money.

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:04.840
With all of that, they should be held accountable.

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:09.440
And the way things are now, they're not held accountable.

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:14.440
And every day we see the consequences in our newspapers

01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:17.320
or just, you know, talking with people.

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:20.160
So what do you make of the different perspective on this

01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:24.560
to bring up a person that I'll probably speak

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:29.560
with Heather McDonald who wrote a book called War on Cops

01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:35.240
and will often bring up the stuff that does show up

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:38.000
in the data to show the disproportionate amount

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.720
of homicides committed by African-Americans.

01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:46.440
And we'll also justify racial profiling on that basis

01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:48.360
in stop and frisk programs.

01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:51.840
And we'll also bring up things like the Ferguson effect

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:58.040
saying that because of this pushback and all the stuff

01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:03.600
we've been saying about police, in those areas,

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:07.080
the police will step back and crime will increase.

01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:09.080
I was in one debate with her.

01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:12.840
And one of the things that I said is it was a debate

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.840
that was sponsored by the Federalist Society,

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:19.000
conservative legal group.

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:21.600
You know, these were law,

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:24.040
conservative law students at Harvard Law School.

01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:26.360
We had a, she made a presentation

01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:28.840
and they asked me to respond.

01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:31.040
And one of the things that I said was,

01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:34.160
when we're talking about the police,

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:41.800
I'm disappointed with the,

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:47.840
the reaction of some of my conservative colleagues.

01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:50.360
And I would consider her to be

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:52.520
one of my conservative colleagues.

01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:56.800
Because what are the sort of the,

01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:01.800
what are some of the important precepts of conservatives?

01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:09.720
One very important precept of conservatives,

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:13.760
limited government, limited government.

01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:17.840
You know, what conservatives talk about the tendency

01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:20.560
of government to overreach itself

01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:25.560
and governmental agents to overreach themselves.

01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:29.720
And I say, you're right, you're right.

01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:31.880
I, you know, right on.

01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:36.000
Why is it that you somehow forget that

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.960
when you're talking about the police?

01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:40.800
When you're talking about the police,

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:45.800
you're never, you seem to be unaware of this tendency

01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:50.760
that is so much in your consciousness and other places.

01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:54.080
But now when you're talking about the police,

01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:56.160
you make it seem as though I'm, you know,

01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:58.240
other people are being paranoid

01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:02.600
when they talk about the danger of overreach.

01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:06.920
We need to be very careful about the danger of overreach.

01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:08.760
Another thing with respect to the,

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:13.240
what do conservatives, transparency in government.

01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:18.000
You're right, you're absolutely right.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.400
We need transparency in government.

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:25.400
So why is it that so often when we're talking about policing,

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:32.560
why is it that conservatives actually embrace police unions

01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:38.280
and are the enemies of transparency?

01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:44.160
Why is it that you want to prevent the citizenry

01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:49.160
from knowing that officer so-and-so has, you know,

01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:53.920
there've been 10 incidents in the last year

01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:57.440
in which citizens have complained about officer so-and-so.

01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:00.240
Don't you think that the citizenry ought to know that?

01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:04.080
Why is it that you want to keep that under wraps?

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:09.080
So overreach, transparency, the tendency,

01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:14.240
or, you know, the problem of governmental agent corruption.

01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:20.480
Why is it that those sorts of things

01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:26.800
are forgotten about when some conservatives,

01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:30.560
by the way, not all conservatives, not all conservatives,

01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:34.920
there's some conservatives who have stuck,

01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:39.600
and appropriately so, to their guns and have said,

01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:44.600
A, we need to make sure that the police stay in their lane.

01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:48.440
We need to make sure that the police

01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:53.280
do not overstep constitutional bounds.

01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:56.720
We need to be, we need to insist on transparency

01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:00.320
and there are some conservatives who have taken that line,

01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:03.280
and I salute them, but there are a lot of conservatives,

01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:05.960
and I would say Heather McDonald was one of them,

01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:10.000
who all of a sudden become just, you know,

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.440
totally uncritical status

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:14.840
when they're talking about the police.

01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:18.200
So the overstepping, overreach, the lack of transparency.

01:53:19.780 --> 01:53:21.160
Of course, we see this kind of stuff

01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:23.920
in foreign policy as well,

01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:26.040
which is starting military conflicts

01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:27.520
and a lot of the supporters,

01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:31.400
at least with the Iraq and Afghanistan wars,

01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:34.440
were conservatives and hawks and so on.

01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:35.720
So there's a lot of hypocrisy

01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:37.320
in terms of principles and so on.

01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:41.980
But maybe one question is,

01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:46.040
in this discussion about racism and policing,

01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:50.760
there was a lot of cops that might listen to this

01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:53.480
and feel like they're not being,

01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:56.680
their profession is not being respected,

01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:57.880
they're not being heard,

01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:01.960
not being respected to the difficulty

01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:05.000
of the problem they're facing, and-

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.160
Can I just interject?

01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:08.040
Remember a few moments ago,

01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:12.400
I mean, if I were in charge of things,

01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:17.080
if I were in charge of things, I'd pay police more,

01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:21.040
in fact, much more than they receive.

01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:25.400
I do, police have a very difficult job,

01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:27.040
extraordinarily difficult job.

01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:31.400
I mean, for one thing, sort of maintaining the law.

01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:35.240
The law, that's a very complicated thing, the law.

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.460
That's not an easy thing.

01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:39.040
I mean, I teach law.

01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:44.360
I spend a lot of hours with very smart people

01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:48.480
trying to understand the law, very difficult.

01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:52.760
So here we expect people to understand the law

01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:57.760
at the same time that they are grappling with people,

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.200
some of whom are violent.

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:01.600
It's very difficult.

01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:04.480
I respect police officers,

01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:07.680
and I said, we need police officers.

01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:09.880
You did not hear me say, by the way,

01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:13.400
so let's get down to brass tacks.

01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:18.040
You did not hear me say, defund the police, did you?

01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:21.840
In fact, to the contrary, I said, defund,

01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:26.840
actually, I want more funds for the police.

01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:30.560
I wanna hold them accountable.

01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:34.260
I understand the difficulty of their job.

01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:36.600
I respect the police.

01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:39.640
I want people to respect the police.

01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:42.320
I also want the police to respect

01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:46.980
civilians and demand that they do.

01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:51.240
I am not a police abolitionist,

01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:54.240
far from it, far from it.

01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:57.600
Again, we need good policing.

01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:01.480
For good policing, we need good people.

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:04.040
To what degree,

01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:08.920
that's almost philosophically, maybe practically,

01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:12.200
do you think police should be doing racial profiling,

01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:14.200
profiling in general?

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:15.020
Okay.

01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:20.020
Very difficult, philosophical, moral, human question.

01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:24.580
Yeah, so first thing we need to do,

01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:28.140
and here we get back to the early part of our conversation

01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:30.820
because we've focused so much on,

01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:32.940
first part of it, a word.

01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:35.860
Here we have another word, profiling.

01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:39.660
Question, what is racial profiling?

01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:44.240
Now, here we have, in the weeds,

01:56:46.020 --> 01:56:49.960
we have people talking past one another.

01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:53.820
I've been in conversations with police officers in debates

01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:58.260
and we talk past one another

01:56:58.260 --> 01:57:02.180
because we are defining racial profiling very differently.

01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:04.500
If you ask, I've been in conversations

01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:06.020
with police officers and they say,

01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:09.620
oh, I'm totally against racial profiling.

01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:11.100
Then I say, well, you know, sir,

01:57:11.100 --> 01:57:12.760
what do you mean by racial profiling?

01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:14.460
And here's what they say.

01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:18.700
Racial profiling is when police officers act

01:57:18.700 --> 01:57:22.360
against somebody wholly on the basis of race.

01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:26.580
That is, that gets rid of the issue

01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:32.500
because, you know, most police officers don't act

01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:37.760
against anyone wholly on the basis of race.

01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:41.020
You could have the most racist police officer

01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:46.060
and that police officer is not going to act adversely

01:57:46.220 --> 01:57:50.340
against the 90-year-old black woman

01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:53.680
walking down the street with a cane, okay?

01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:58.460
So it's always, you know, if you define racial profiling

01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:02.020
that way, you're getting rid of the issue.

01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:05.500
The issue is, the proper issue is this.

01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:11.460
Should the police be able to act against someone

01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:18.820
taking race into account as a factor?

01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:23.180
So let's imagine that a black person who's 25 years old

01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:25.860
is walking down the street right next to a white person

01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:27.280
who's 25 years old.

01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:31.660
Some people would say, you know what?

01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:36.660
Under those circumstances, it's okay for the police officer

01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:40.420
to give two looks at the black person

01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:43.740
and only one look at the white person, why?

01:58:43.740 --> 01:58:48.740
Because the statistics tell us that the black 25-year-old,

01:58:49.700 --> 01:58:52.460
there's much more risk of that person acting

01:58:52.460 --> 01:58:53.780
in an unlawful way.

01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:57.540
If you take a look at, you know, crime statistics

01:58:57.540 --> 01:58:58.960
and ask the question,

01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:04.420
with respect to, you know, homicide,

01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:07.600
with respect to robbery, with respect to various,

01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:10.900
you know, crimes, what's the,

01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:16.880
is there a difference between the white 25-year-old

01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:18.640
and the black 25-year-old?

01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:20.500
With respect to certain crimes, the answer is,

01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:22.020
in certain places, the answer is, yeah,

01:59:22.020 --> 01:59:26.720
there is a difference, and there is a greater risk

01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:30.460
that the black 25-year-old has engaged

01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:33.400
in various forms of criminality.

01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:35.860
I'm not, you know, that, okay.

01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:39.280
Under those circumstances, what do I say?

01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:42.260
Should the police officer, therefore,

01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:46.640
be allowed to take action vis-a-vis the black person,

01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:48.600
as opposed, you know, as against the white person?

01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:49.860
My answer is no.

01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:53.320
I'm fully willing to concede,

01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:55.640
let's concede for the point of, you know,

01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:59.760
for the point of discussion that there is more risk.

01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:02.320
There might be, there might be.

02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:08.400
But for reasons of constructing the sort of society I want,

02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:17.780
we should not empower agents of the state

02:00:18.860 --> 02:00:21.240
to act towards certain people

02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:27.240
in a way that's, you know, adverse to them.

02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:31.480
Let me try to break this down in a little different way.

02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:38.580
Let's go back to, let's talk about what happens

02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:40.420
when you wanna get on an airplane.

02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:42.920
You know, wasn't so long, you know,

02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:45.000
9-11 wasn't all that long ago.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.320
It was a while ago, but it wasn't all that long ago.

02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:49.080
And this very issue came up

02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:53.040
with respect to the profiling of Muslims.

02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:54.640
And there were some people who said,

02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:57.520
geez, you know, in the aftermath of 9-11,

02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:00.400
profiling of Muslims makes sense.

02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:03.400
You know, no hard feelings, but, you know,

02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:07.160
the 11 people who were on those planes were all Muslims.

02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:12.400
Now, there is a rationale, you could just simply say,

02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:16.960
it's not prejudice, it's not animus, it's not invidious,

02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:21.120
it's just, you know, the facts take us this way.

02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:23.160
Well, the facts never take us this way.

02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:26.880
There are facts, and then there is our choice

02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:29.760
of how we want to respond to those facts.

02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:35.160
Now, you could respond by saying,

02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:40.160
well, we perceive Muslims to be more likely

02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:46.320
to, you know, do bad things on an airliner.

02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:48.400
You could respond in that way.

02:01:49.900 --> 02:01:52.740
On the other hand, you could say, no,

02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:57.780
we want a society in which people

02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:02.780
do not have to grapple with prejudice

02:02:02.780 --> 02:02:07.020
on the basis of their religion or on the basis of their race.

02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:09.980
And to deal with that, we are gonna demand,

02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:12.860
we're gonna demand that agents of the state

02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:18.580
act towards people in the same way.

02:02:18.580 --> 02:02:23.580
And so if that means that everybody getting on the airplane

02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:30.100
before they get on the airplane has to, you know,

02:02:30.100 --> 02:02:35.100
open up their luggage and it slows things down,

02:02:38.940 --> 02:02:42.260
but everybody has to open up their luggage.

02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:47.260
I would prefer that over a system in which we have

02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:53.100
the focus on people who are Muslim.

02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:55.460
And one of the reasons, and I'm gonna bring this back

02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:57.380
to our, to the racial thing.

02:02:57.380 --> 02:03:00.580
One of the reasons why I wanna insist upon that

02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:06.180
is because if, you know, if we all have to open up

02:03:06.180 --> 02:03:11.180
our luggage, what that means is we're all paying a tax

02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:16.300
for more security and we're all likely to ask ourselves,

02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:22.780
hmm, do we wanna pay this tax?

02:03:22.780 --> 02:03:25.060
Whereas if we focus simply on the Muslims

02:03:25.060 --> 02:03:27.540
and allow the Muslims to be the only ones

02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:32.540
who are sort of paying the tax, we will foist that on them.

02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:36.260
Same in the, you know, black person, white person,

02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:38.620
25 years old, walking down the street.

02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:44.620
Do we want to impose a racial tax on the black 25 year old?

02:03:46.820 --> 02:03:48.500
Some people would say, yes.

02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:50.300
I say, that's a mistake.

02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:51.580
Black people aren't stupid.

02:03:51.580 --> 02:03:53.940
They know that they're paying this tax.

02:03:53.940 --> 02:03:58.940
It is a violation of, it seems to me,

02:03:59.020 --> 02:04:01.900
the rules that we ought to want to have

02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:04.500
to govern our society.

02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:07.660
I say, spread the costs.

02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:12.660
Make the police deal with everybody the same

02:04:16.380 --> 02:04:19.900
and don't allow a situation to develop

02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:24.900
in which a group of people can accurately say,

02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:29.540
we are paying more of a cost

02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:31.700
than these other people over here.

02:04:31.700 --> 02:04:35.140
So it's a better, avoiding profile is,

02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:42.700
while it may have costs on security in the short term,

02:04:44.140 --> 02:04:47.500
in the long term, it's the embodiment of the principles

02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:49.340
that all men are created equal.

02:04:49.340 --> 02:04:51.660
So it has a much bigger benefit

02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:55.180
in representing the fairness that is at the core

02:04:55.180 --> 02:04:56.940
of the ideals of this country.

02:04:56.940 --> 02:04:57.780
Yes.

02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:01.940
Let me ask a big philosophical question.

02:05:01.940 --> 02:05:05.060
Why do you think there is racism in the world?

02:05:05.060 --> 02:05:06.780
Oh, now you've, okay, fine.

02:05:06.780 --> 02:05:10.540
Now you've asked me a question in which I throw up my hands

02:05:10.540 --> 02:05:12.580
and I don't know.

02:05:12.580 --> 02:05:14.300
Will there always be?

02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:16.300
Why is there tribalism?

02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:21.300
Are humans always finding this way to divide ourselves?

02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:25.980
And how bad of a problem is that?

02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:27.540
It's a huge problem.

02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:31.060
I don't, you know, I mean, I'm not gonna pretend

02:05:31.060 --> 02:05:36.060
that I know enough to grapple in a satisfactory way

02:05:37.020 --> 02:05:38.100
with such a question.

02:05:38.100 --> 02:05:41.380
I mean, to really grapple with that question,

02:05:41.380 --> 02:05:46.380
one really has to have a very broad knowledge base

02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:52.220
in which they can make comparisons.

02:05:52.220 --> 02:05:53.980
I mean, the world's a big place.

02:05:54.140 --> 02:05:56.620
From the little bit I know about the world,

02:05:56.620 --> 02:06:00.340
and I read, I read as much as I can.

02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:02.780
I've been, I'm a very privileged character.

02:06:02.780 --> 02:06:04.860
I mean, I live in a university,

02:06:04.860 --> 02:06:08.260
so I'm reading constantly and listening constantly.

02:06:08.260 --> 02:06:12.660
From what I gather, the problem of divided societies

02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:14.980
is a problem that is worldwide.

02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:18.820
There's, you know, and it seems as though,

02:06:18.820 --> 02:06:22.900
it seems as though human ingenuity is such

02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:27.900
that humans will find something to divide over.

02:06:30.420 --> 02:06:34.020
You know, it might be texture of hair.

02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:39.020
It might be, you know, complexion of skin.

02:06:40.900 --> 02:06:41.740
If every-

02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:42.580
Political ideology.

02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:43.500
Political ideology.

02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:45.540
If the texture, if the texture,

02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:50.540
if the texture of skin is the same,

02:06:50.860 --> 02:06:55.020
it'll then be, well, you know,

02:06:55.020 --> 02:06:58.500
you wear these sorts of clothes.

02:06:58.500 --> 02:07:00.920
You speak in this sort of way.

02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:07.500
You believe this, whereas I believe that.

02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:11.340
I mean, it seems like a human ingenuity is such they will,

02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:16.340
humans will find some way of distinguishing themselves,

02:07:17.340 --> 02:07:22.340
and then they seem to want to embellish the distinction.

02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:25.220
It's not just a distinction.

02:07:25.220 --> 02:07:28.460
It's not just you believe this and I believe this.

02:07:28.460 --> 02:07:30.260
Okay, that makes the world interesting.

02:07:30.260 --> 02:07:32.860
You know, let's talk about what you believe

02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:33.700
and what I believe.

02:07:33.700 --> 02:07:38.700
No, it's usually associated with you believe this,

02:07:39.300 --> 02:07:40.380
I believe this.

02:07:40.380 --> 02:07:44.240
Of course, my way, my belief is superior to your belief.

02:07:45.080 --> 02:07:48.800
And I want to put you down.

02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:52.600
And now we're headed towards war.

02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:54.960
The interesting thing is if I were to step outside

02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:56.020
of this whole thing,

02:07:56.020 --> 02:07:58.120
from an alien perspective, visiting Earth,

02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:02.360
I think America is one of the greatest,

02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:03.640
if not the greatest countries

02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:05.840
in the history of human civilization.

02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:10.840
And I think that the line between white and black,

02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:12.400
the racial struggle,

02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:17.000
is the thing that in part made it a great nation.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.800
There's something about the division

02:08:19.800 --> 02:08:21.720
and the way you alleviate that division

02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:24.360
through the struggle for human rights

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:26.360
that makes for a great nation.

02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:29.360
And so it's interesting that the division

02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:32.840
is almost the fuel for the greatness,

02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:35.360
for our discovery of what it means to be human,

02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:38.400
what it means to be, or what justice means of,

02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:41.920
and it's interesting that it seems like

02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:45.420
there's this struggle that you're elucidating now,

02:08:45.420 --> 02:08:48.420
but that struggle itself is our search,

02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:53.360
a man's search for meaning and justice and freedom.

02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:54.680
I think there's something to that.

02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:57.680
As you were speaking, I was immediately thinking of

02:08:57.680 --> 02:08:59.840
the person who most jumped to mind

02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:02.200
was the great Frederick Douglass.

02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:04.880
So here you have a person who, in my view,

02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:07.680
is one of the great people in the history of the world.

02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:13.480
And one of the things that ironically enabled him

02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:15.360
to become one of the great people of the world,

02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:18.000
he was born into slavery.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:22.880
His overcoming was the very thing

02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:27.880
that in a sense made him this larger than life figure.

02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:30.160
I think there's something to you.

02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:31.840
I will say this because a minute ago

02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:34.740
you mentioned optimism and pessimism.

02:09:35.740 --> 02:09:40.740
And I'd say in the last few years,

02:09:48.420 --> 02:09:53.420
my feeling about the United States has changed,

02:09:57.460 --> 02:09:59.420
and it's changed in a somber way.

02:09:59.420 --> 02:10:04.420
For most of my life, for most of my life,

02:10:04.420 --> 02:10:07.980
I've been in the optimistic camp

02:10:07.980 --> 02:10:11.100
with respect to my view of American race relations.

02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:14.580
The optimistic camp, that was the camp,

02:10:14.580 --> 02:10:17.420
that's the camp that believes we shall overcome.

02:10:18.700 --> 02:10:20.940
That's Martin Luther King's camp.

02:10:20.940 --> 02:10:25.260
I mean, Martin Luther King, hours before he's killed,

02:10:25.260 --> 02:10:26.940
I've been to the mountaintop.

02:10:26.940 --> 02:10:29.140
I might not get there with you,

02:10:29.140 --> 02:10:32.180
but I've glimpsed the promised land.

02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:33.300
Optimism.

02:10:34.300 --> 02:10:37.760
Frederick Douglass would be in that tradition.

02:10:39.180 --> 02:10:43.940
There would be other people, wonderful, good people,

02:10:43.940 --> 02:10:45.540
who would be in that tradition.

02:10:45.540 --> 02:10:46.860
Would you, sorry to interrupt,

02:10:46.860 --> 02:10:49.020
put in the pessimist camp, would you put Malcolm X in it?

02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:51.500
On the pessimistic camp, the pessimistic camp

02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:52.820
is the more interesting camp.

02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:53.660
That's okay.

02:10:53.660 --> 02:10:56.340
I mean, it is, it's the more interesting camp

02:10:56.340 --> 02:10:59.380
because in the pessimistic camp, you have,

02:10:59.380 --> 02:11:02.900
I mean, if I was gonna list some of my pessimists,

02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:05.500
pessimist number one, Thomas Jefferson.

02:11:07.340 --> 02:11:09.700
Thomas Jefferson, the author,

02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:11.700
principal author, Declaration of Independence,

02:11:11.700 --> 02:11:16.700
he was also the author of Notes on the State of Virginia.

02:11:16.980 --> 02:11:20.340
And he said in Notes on the State of Virginia,

02:11:20.340 --> 02:11:22.580
basically, we shall not overcome.

02:11:24.020 --> 02:11:27.660
He talked, he said, the black people

02:11:28.660 --> 02:11:33.660
will always know that their forebears were enslaved

02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:40.260
and they will always be resentful of that,

02:11:40.260 --> 02:11:42.340
always be aggrieved by that.

02:11:43.420 --> 02:11:46.840
Jefferson did not think that we would ever have

02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:50.420
in the United States a multiracial democracy.

02:11:50.420 --> 02:11:52.080
He was very critical of slavery.

02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:53.080
Now, he was a hypocrite.

02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:55.360
He had slaves, he sold slaves.

02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:57.800
He was terrible in that way,

02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:00.500
but he did understand that slavery was horrible.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:06.040
But he did not want,

02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:09.640
but he did not wanna free the slaves

02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:11.040
for a variety of reasons.

02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:13.860
But then one reason was because he thought that

02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:17.500
it would be impossible to have a society

02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:22.500
in which blacks and whites were equal neighbors.

02:12:22.980 --> 02:12:24.140
He was thoroughly pessimistic.

02:12:24.140 --> 02:12:27.140
Another pessimist, Alexis de Tocqueville,

02:12:27.140 --> 02:12:29.340
thoroughly pessimistic.

02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:31.580
So who were some of the other pessimists?

02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:34.700
Abraham Lincoln, pessimistic.

02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:36.940
That's why he was so interested in colonization.

02:12:36.940 --> 02:12:40.020
He basically said, I don't like slavery,

02:12:40.020 --> 02:12:42.180
but blacks and whites are not gonna be able

02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:43.380
to share the United States.

02:12:43.380 --> 02:12:46.700
Maybe the best we can do is just put blacks,

02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:48.820
ship blacks someplace else.

02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:49.900
Can you elaborate on that?

02:12:50.100 --> 02:12:51.260
Can you elaborate on that?

02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:54.020
I think people would be surprised to hear

02:12:54.020 --> 02:12:56.100
that you will put Abraham Lincoln in the pessimist camp.

02:12:56.100 --> 02:12:57.940
Oh, Abraham Lincoln's thoroughly pessimistic.

02:12:57.940 --> 02:13:02.680
He believed, he was anti-slavery,

02:13:03.660 --> 02:13:06.240
but he did not believe that blacks and whites

02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:09.980
would be able to share the United States together.

02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:14.620
And he was always very interested therefore in colonization.

02:13:14.620 --> 02:13:17.860
Even during the Civil War,

02:13:17.860 --> 02:13:22.860
he was interested in maybe all black people,

02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:26.140
would all black people be interested

02:13:26.140 --> 02:13:28.140
in maybe going to Panama?

02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:30.820
Would they be interested in going someplace else?

02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:35.180
Because Lincoln was aware of how racist white people were,

02:13:35.180 --> 02:13:37.140
including himself.

02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:39.300
And he did not think that black people and white people

02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:42.740
would be able to share the United States.

02:13:42.740 --> 02:13:44.860
Now there's the black nationalist tradition.

02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:45.900
You mentioned Malcolm X.

02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:48.480
Well, before Malcolm X, you know, Marcus Garvey.

02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:55.340
My father, my father was a thoroughgoing pessimist.

02:13:56.500 --> 02:14:01.500
His view was A, the United States was born

02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:04.220
as a white man's country.

02:14:04.220 --> 02:14:07.140
It's gonna remain a white man's country.

02:14:08.660 --> 02:14:10.020
And that's the way it is.

02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:12.460
He was thoroughly pessimistic.

02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:15.260
You mentioned just a brief aside about your dad

02:14:16.220 --> 02:14:19.400
when you moved to South Carolina to Washington, DC,

02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:23.660
and you asked him why his response to you was

02:14:23.660 --> 02:14:26.020
because either a white man was going to kill me

02:14:26.020 --> 02:14:27.700
or I was going to kill a white man.

02:14:27.700 --> 02:14:28.860
Yes.

02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:32.420
So he saw race as an important line

02:14:32.420 --> 02:14:34.300
that divided people in the United States.

02:14:34.300 --> 02:14:35.120
He certainly did.

02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:39.600
And he thought that the line, my father did not,

02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:45.560
my father had passed away before Obama was elected.

02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:49.840
I would have loved to have talked with my dad.

02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:51.360
What do you think he would have said?

02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:56.480
And you wrote a book about the Obama presidency.

02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:57.960
I did, I did.

02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:02.000
And I never, what would my father have said?

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.360
My father would have been delighted.

02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:05.960
My father would have been happy about his election.

02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:09.800
I do think though,

02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:15.280
I do think that my father would have said,

02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:18.060
I'm happy that Barack Obama has been elected.

02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:22.240
Hold on to your seats.

02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:26.640
Let's see how the white people respond.

02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:27.880
So he would have predicted Donald Trump.

02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:31.640
I think that my father, I think that in 2016,

02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:33.120
I think that in 2016-

02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:34.120
He would have said, I told you.

02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:35.440
Yes.

02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:39.680
I think that in 2016, my father would have said,

02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:44.160
all of you people who are talking about,

02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:46.320
I don't know what's happened to America

02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:48.080
and how could this have happened?

02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:51.800
And you know, no.

02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:53.120
I think my father would have said,

02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:56.280
this is America being America.

02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:01.280
And what has happened is that America has been

02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:07.280
put off kilter by a black family being in the White House.

02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:11.560
It has deranged millions of white people.

02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:14.120
And now this is coming home to roost.

02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:17.240
So I think my father would have absolutely said in 2016,

02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:18.280
I told you so.

02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:22.920
In 2016, as you're saying is the reason that you have

02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:27.920
at least dipped your toe outside of the optimist camp

02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:29.280
into the pessimist camp.

02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:34.280
I'm, yeah, I wanna be careful here and I don't wanna-

02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:38.000
Don't give up on the optimist camp.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.920
I don't wanna, I don't, you're right.

02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:43.200
I don't wanna give up on the optimist camp.

02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:47.200
I don't, I have been,

02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:51.720
my optimism has definitely been dampened.

02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:55.040
It has definitely been tested.

02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:58.840
I am certainly no, I am not,

02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:05.080
I am not as triumphalist as I once was.

02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:11.400
I am not as indignant as I once was

02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:14.040
in my criticism of pessimists.

02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:18.120
But at this moment, as we speak,

02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:22.400
you know, am I more in the optimist camp

02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:23.840
than I'm in the pessimist camp?

02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:25.840
I'm still probably more in the optimist camp.

02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:28.920
My optimism has been dampened.

02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:32.760
But as I speak, I have to say the following things

02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:34.840
and I'd say the following things if my father,

02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:39.680
but again, whom I revere, great man.

02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:42.640
But if my father was sitting here with us,

02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:44.120
I would say, listen, Pop,

02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:51.840
it's absolutely true that the country is more racist

02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:53.240
than I had thought.

02:17:53.240 --> 02:17:54.200
That is true.

02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:59.480
It's also true, Pop, that the Vice President

02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:02.880
of the United States, as we speak, is a black woman.

02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:09.160
As we speak, it's true that the Secretary of Defense,

02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:14.680
now, Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Defense

02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:16.760
is the head of the Pentagon.

02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:21.760
The Secretary of Defense knows where the button is, okay?

02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:23.240
This is not a little, you know,

02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:28.000
this is not a small, out-of-the-way thing.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:33.000
This is the sec, the Secretary of Defense is a black man.

02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:39.600
There are a slew of black generals.

02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:45.240
There have been black Secretaries of State.

02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:50.880
There are black people who are the heads

02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:52.600
of police forces.

02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:54.600
There are black mayors.

02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:58.480
There are black people who are the heads of, you know,

02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:01.480
some of our foremost foundations.

02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:05.560
There are, you know, the President-elect

02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:12.160
of Harvard University is a black woman.

02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:14.280
And we could go on and on and on and on.

02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:17.200
This is not, you know, we're not, when I was growing up,

02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:21.080
when I was, let's say, 10 years old,

02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:25.200
we got a magazine, Ebony Magazine, every month.

02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:28.200
And in Ebony Magazine, you could turn to the middle

02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:32.080
of Ebony and they would have black firsts,

02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:33.600
the first black person to do this,

02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:35.800
the first black person to do this.

02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:37.680
You could read Ebony and frankly,

02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:41.560
I could tell you all of those, I knew their names.

02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:47.560
Now, I read stuff, you know, the leading cadet,

02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:57.760
the chief cadet at the United States Naval Academy.

02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:01.680
I'm reading, I'm reading, then I see a picture.

02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:06.120
Black woman, I didn't know that.

02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:08.240
Back in the day, I would have known that.

02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:13.240
Now, has the United States changed?

02:20:15.720 --> 02:20:16.560
Yes.

02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:19.080
Is there racism?

02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:20.000
Yes.

02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:24.680
Is it, you know, a substantial force in American life?

02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:27.640
Regrettably, tragically, yes.

02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:30.640
Has the United States changed?

02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:31.560
Yes.

02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:34.360
And again, if we want to go international,

02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:38.000
the United States is not the only country

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:43.000
that is a country that has wrestled with deep division.

02:20:44.920 --> 02:20:48.080
You think about, I don't know, think about India,

02:20:48.080 --> 02:20:50.760
think about, you know, the United Kingdom,

02:20:50.760 --> 02:20:55.480
think about practically any large nation state.

02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:57.880
They've all grappled with divisions.

02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:03.880
If one asks about the United States and the race question,

02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:10.600
and one puts on the table that, you know, in 1865,

02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:18.000
now, you know, when I talk with students, I say 1865,

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:21.120
they think, oh my God, you know,

02:21:21.120 --> 02:21:22.960
isn't that when dinosaurs roamed?

02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:24.800
No, it wasn't when dinosaurs roamed.

02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:28.480
1865, frankly, is not all that long ago.

02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:33.480
In 1865, the great mass of black people in the United States

02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:39.440
had recently been released from chattel slavery.

02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:42.320
The great mass of black people in the United States

02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:45.400
in 1865 were illiterate.

02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:50.720
Now?

02:21:51.720 --> 02:21:54.600
I mean, it's absolutely, it's an absolutely

02:21:54.600 --> 02:21:56.040
extraordinary story.

02:21:57.160 --> 02:22:01.840
And so one of the difficulties I have at this moment

02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:06.840
is wrapping my head around two stories

02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:09.520
that are in such tension with one another.

02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:13.280
One is the continuing story of racism,

02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:18.280
which is an awful story, but the other story

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:24.000
is a story that is encapsulated in the title

02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:29.600
of a great book of history by John Hope Franklin,

02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:32.160
From Slavery to Freedom.

02:22:33.920 --> 02:22:38.920
And, you know, those are two stories in American life,

02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:42.760
and it takes an awful lot to put your mind

02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:46.680
around both stories, and I'm trying to.

02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:49.440
Well, as an optimist, I think you put more value

02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:52.240
to the overcoming side of the story,

02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:55.400
the overcoming of hardship, the overcoming of slavery,

02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:56.560
of discrimination.

02:22:57.680 --> 02:23:00.640
Well, since you mentioned illiteracy from,

02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:04.520
what is it, 150 years ago, let me ask you

02:23:04.520 --> 02:23:06.160
about affirmative action.

02:23:06.160 --> 02:23:09.560
You wrote a book on the topic titled For Discrimination,

02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:11.440
Race, Affirmative Action, and the Law.

02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:14.800
First, what is affirmative action?

02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:18.600
And maybe we could talk about

02:23:18.600 --> 02:23:20.800
what your view is on it today.

02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:25.800
Sure, well, affirmative action refers to,

02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:30.040
racial affirmative action,

02:23:30.040 --> 02:23:32.440
because there's various sorts of affirmative action.

02:23:32.440 --> 02:23:35.080
I mean, you can have affirmative action for veterans,

02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:40.080
you can have affirmative action for in-state residents.

02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:42.440
Let's suppose you have a school, you know,

02:23:42.440 --> 02:23:46.000
the University of, you know, blah, blah, blah,

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:49.520
and we're gonna, we're gonna, we want to reach,

02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:54.520
we're gonna give a, reach out a hand to boost,

02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:58.000
help the people who live within this state.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.560
We're gonna have a boost for veterans.

02:24:00.560 --> 02:24:04.220
We're gonna have a boost for, you know, for women.

02:24:05.800 --> 02:24:09.840
We're gonna have a boost for men in certain circumstances.

02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:13.520
Well, we're, the most,

02:24:14.800 --> 02:24:17.960
the type of affirmative action that gets most attention,

02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:20.440
and that's worth noting as well,

02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:23.840
there's lots of different sorts of affirmative action,

02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:25.800
but when you say affirmative action,

02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:29.520
the type of affirmative action that immediately

02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:32.280
people are thinking about is racial affirmative.

02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:34.880
Seems like race is at the core of this American experiment

02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:36.840
that we're part of, in every part of its culture.

02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:39.720
Bingo, bingo, you know, why is it

02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:42.800
that, you know, we, again, you know, there's various,

02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:47.340
there's various ways in which institutions reach out

02:24:47.340 --> 02:24:50.800
to help various sectors of our population.

02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:55.720
Why is it that this is the one that generates

02:24:55.720 --> 02:25:00.320
all of the pulling out of hair and gnashing of teeth?

02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:02.860
We can put that to the side for a moment.

02:25:02.860 --> 02:25:06.760
Racial affirmative action refers to efforts

02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:09.760
in which institutions, you know,

02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:17.560
reach out to provide assistance to racial minorities.

02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:23.360
Now, the reaching out has, you know,

02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:24.900
can happen in different ways.

02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:30.880
A light form of affirmative action might be reaching out

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.980
in terms of recruiting, making a special effort

02:25:34.980 --> 02:25:38.860
to make sure that young people, let's say,

02:25:38.860 --> 02:25:43.780
in racial minority neighborhoods know about your college.

02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:45.780
You know, that's, you know, recruitment.

02:25:47.860 --> 02:25:50.700
On the other hand, racial affirmative action

02:25:50.700 --> 02:25:54.300
might take more, you know, might take a stronger form.

02:25:54.300 --> 02:25:55.900
It might take the form of saying,

02:25:55.900 --> 02:25:59.900
okay, we have a competition, and we think

02:26:00.780 --> 02:26:05.780
that there will be too few racial minority kids

02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:10.100
who do well enough in this competition

02:26:10.100 --> 02:26:11.680
to be admitted to our school.

02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:16.680
So what we're gonna do is we are going to,

02:26:17.260 --> 02:26:22.260
in various ways, give a boost to the minority kids.

02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:27.940
If it comes down to you have two kids,

02:26:28.820 --> 02:26:32.940
they both, you know, I don't know, have, you know,

02:26:32.940 --> 02:26:37.100
99 on the test, there's one place left.

02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:40.000
We only have one spot left, two kids.

02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:43.040
One's a black kid, one's a white kid.

02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:44.300
They both got 99.

02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:46.100
We're gonna give it to the black kid.

02:26:47.220 --> 02:26:48.060
Why?

02:26:48.060 --> 02:26:51.820
Well, black kid, all there is to it.

02:26:51.820 --> 02:26:54.420
Black kid, we wanna, you know, maybe,

02:26:54.420 --> 02:26:55.940
and then our theory, you know,

02:26:55.940 --> 02:26:58.980
maybe our theory is that black people have been done wrong

02:26:58.980 --> 02:27:01.700
in the United States, and we want our institution

02:27:01.700 --> 02:27:04.580
to contribute to making amends.

02:27:04.580 --> 02:27:07.500
That might be a theory, another theory might be,

02:27:08.980 --> 02:27:13.980
you know, we think that we'll have

02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:17.660
a more interesting student body,

02:27:17.660 --> 02:27:19.340
we'll have a better student body,

02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:22.300
a more, you know, better discussion

02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:24.620
if there are more black kids on campus.

02:27:24.980 --> 02:27:26.580
Unless we make a special effort

02:27:26.580 --> 02:27:28.620
to bring more black kids on campus,

02:27:29.620 --> 02:27:32.420
you know, our student body

02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:35.260
will be overwhelmingly mono-racial.

02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:38.540
We'll just have, you know, white kids,

02:27:38.540 --> 02:27:40.820
few Asian kids, a few Latino kids,

02:27:40.820 --> 02:27:42.820
if there are no black kids here,

02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:46.100
I don't know, it'll be lacking

02:27:46.100 --> 02:27:48.300
an important aspect of American life.

02:27:48.300 --> 02:27:50.020
So that's some sort of, you know,

02:27:50.020 --> 02:27:52.580
the so-called diversity story.

02:27:52.620 --> 02:27:55.020
So anyway, there are various theories.

02:27:56.020 --> 02:28:01.020
Some are grounded, like I said, in reparative justice.

02:28:01.220 --> 02:28:03.460
Some might be granted in distributive justice.

02:28:03.460 --> 02:28:06.700
So for instance, when people say nowadays, you know,

02:28:07.740 --> 02:28:11.100
we want a cabinet, we want a team,

02:28:11.100 --> 02:28:15.100
we want a student body that looks like America.

02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:18.180
That might be a distributive justice theory

02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:19.700
for why you want affirmative action,

02:28:19.700 --> 02:28:24.700
unless we reach out and give a boost to certain groups,

02:28:28.100 --> 02:28:30.060
they won't be here.

02:28:30.060 --> 02:28:33.940
And we want a campus that looks like America.

02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:36.100
And we won't have a campus that looks like America

02:28:36.100 --> 02:28:38.380
unless we give a special boost to,

02:28:38.380 --> 02:28:40.020
I don't know, the Latino kids,

02:28:40.020 --> 02:28:43.740
or unless we give a special boost to black applicants.

02:28:43.740 --> 02:28:47.420
So reparative justice, distributive justice,

02:28:47.420 --> 02:28:50.900
or third, diversity.

02:28:50.900 --> 02:28:52.980
We just wanna have an interesting student body

02:28:52.980 --> 02:28:54.420
and to have an interesting student body,

02:28:54.420 --> 02:28:59.380
we want, you know, kids from a wide array of places.

02:28:59.380 --> 02:29:01.860
We think that that'll make for a better campus,

02:29:01.860 --> 02:29:03.420
more interesting campus.

02:29:03.420 --> 02:29:05.740
Those are three justifications,

02:29:05.740 --> 02:29:10.740
all of which, however, are justifications for

02:29:10.740 --> 02:29:15.740
in a competition, giving a special boost to some people

02:29:16.740 --> 02:29:18.260
based on their race.

02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:19.500
So what's your sense?

02:29:19.500 --> 02:29:21.860
Can you make the case for affirmative action

02:29:21.860 --> 02:29:23.500
and can you make the case against it?

02:29:23.500 --> 02:29:25.340
Yeah, I can make the case for

02:29:25.340 --> 02:29:26.820
and I can make the case against.

02:29:26.820 --> 02:29:30.620
The case for, I won't spend much time on this.

02:29:30.620 --> 02:29:35.620
Like I said, there are three main justifications.

02:29:40.580 --> 02:29:45.140
Your audience should know that one,

02:29:45.380 --> 02:29:49.820
the justification that actually led to affirmative action

02:29:49.820 --> 02:29:53.500
is a justification that you don't hear about in the courts

02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:55.260
because the courts have said that

02:29:55.260 --> 02:29:58.700
that justification is insufficient.

02:29:58.700 --> 02:30:02.060
So the real justification behind affirmative action

02:30:02.060 --> 02:30:05.940
was, you know, in the late 1960s,

02:30:05.940 --> 02:30:08.500
in the aftermath of the Civil Rights Revolution

02:30:08.500 --> 02:30:11.060
and the aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement,

02:30:11.060 --> 02:30:13.260
there was a feeling that, well, okay, fine,

02:30:13.260 --> 02:30:16.540
we're not discriminating against black people anymore,

02:30:16.540 --> 02:30:20.700
but black people have been disadvantaged

02:30:20.700 --> 02:30:24.060
by the discrimination that has been put upon them

02:30:25.220 --> 02:30:28.820
and this discrimination that was put upon them

02:30:28.820 --> 02:30:30.220
has disabled them.

02:30:31.340 --> 02:30:36.340
And so they go into competitions and it's unfair.

02:30:36.820 --> 02:30:40.180
Yeah, they score less well on the standardized tests,

02:30:40.180 --> 02:30:43.900
but you know, surprise, surprise, what the heck?

02:30:44.900 --> 02:30:49.460
They went to schools in which they got the leavings

02:30:49.460 --> 02:30:50.940
of the white folks.

02:30:50.940 --> 02:30:55.180
You know, the white folks gave the black folks

02:30:55.180 --> 02:30:59.260
the old textbooks, that's what the black kids read.

02:30:59.260 --> 02:31:01.980
The white kids read the newest textbooks,

02:31:01.980 --> 02:31:02.900
on and on and on.

02:31:02.900 --> 02:31:07.900
So reparative justice, we're gonna try to repair

02:31:08.900 --> 02:31:13.900
the scars left by past racial injustice.

02:31:14.620 --> 02:31:19.220
And so it's sort of an effort to overcome

02:31:19.220 --> 02:31:22.300
the vestiges of past misdeeds.

02:31:22.300 --> 02:31:24.700
That was one justification for affirmative action.

02:31:24.700 --> 02:31:27.500
And frankly, I think that's the justification

02:31:27.500 --> 02:31:31.180
that has always been the predominant justification,

02:31:31.180 --> 02:31:33.460
whether people owned up to it or not,

02:31:33.460 --> 02:31:35.540
but that's one justification.

02:31:36.020 --> 02:31:39.380
The distributive justice justification is there.

02:31:39.380 --> 02:31:43.140
Like I say, you know, people, we want an integrated America,

02:31:43.140 --> 02:31:45.740
we want an America that looks like America.

02:31:48.140 --> 02:31:53.140
In that justification, legitimacy is sometimes mentioned.

02:31:54.180 --> 02:31:59.180
So for instance, people will say things like,

02:31:59.180 --> 02:32:03.140
well, you know, if we're gonna, in the armed forces,

02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:08.180
you can't have an armed forces in which the,

02:32:08.180 --> 02:32:13.180
you know, the sort of the people on the ground are,

02:32:13.460 --> 02:32:15.220
you have a lot of people on the ground

02:32:15.220 --> 02:32:16.940
who are people of color,

02:32:16.940 --> 02:32:19.180
but none of the people calling the shots,

02:32:19.180 --> 02:32:22.900
none of the generals, none of the may, you know,

02:32:22.900 --> 02:32:25.220
colonels are people of color.

02:32:25.220 --> 02:32:29.460
No, you know, the people on the ground

02:32:29.460 --> 02:32:31.460
are not gonna stand for that.

02:32:31.460 --> 02:32:34.620
So for purposes of legitimation,

02:32:34.620 --> 02:32:39.220
we need to, for purposes of buy-in,

02:32:39.220 --> 02:32:43.860
we need to have a situation in which people get the sense

02:32:43.860 --> 02:32:47.780
that even if they're sort of low down,

02:32:48.740 --> 02:32:52.220
they're still part of the story, they're part of the team.

02:32:52.220 --> 02:32:56.260
So that's part of the sort of, you know,

02:32:56.260 --> 02:33:00.300
I don't know, distributive justice notion.

02:33:00.340 --> 02:33:01.460
Do you think there's power to that?

02:33:01.460 --> 02:33:02.780
I mean, do you think there's value,

02:33:02.780 --> 02:33:04.540
there's correctness to that kind of idea?

02:33:04.540 --> 02:33:05.900
I think there's some.

02:33:05.900 --> 02:33:07.460
Because for the application process

02:33:07.460 --> 02:33:08.380
for different universities,

02:33:08.380 --> 02:33:11.140
I think that there's probably a driving narrative,

02:33:11.140 --> 02:33:16.140
justification for, well, affirmative action,

02:33:16.260 --> 02:33:19.540
I don't know where we put DEI efforts

02:33:19.540 --> 02:33:23.300
because they overlap, but they're not perfectly overlapping.

02:33:23.300 --> 02:33:26.900
The reason that the school, so yeah, as you know,

02:33:26.900 --> 02:33:29.740
there is a case, we'll know about it,

02:33:29.740 --> 02:33:32.180
it'll be announced sometime in the next month.

02:33:34.740 --> 02:33:36.500
Well, month, month and a half.

02:33:38.420 --> 02:33:41.180
It's a case of the Supreme Court of the United States

02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:44.500
in which the affirmative action program at Harvard

02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:45.940
and the affirmative action program

02:33:45.940 --> 02:33:49.100
at the University of North Carolina are being challenged.

02:33:49.100 --> 02:33:51.460
Most people think, including me,

02:33:51.460 --> 02:33:53.980
that the Supreme Court of the United States

02:33:53.980 --> 02:33:58.980
is going to limit, if not totally,

02:34:00.460 --> 02:34:03.500
seek to abolish affirmative action.

02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:05.540
So this is a very burning issue.

02:34:06.860 --> 02:34:09.060
As things currently stand,

02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:15.180
my university and other universities

02:34:15.180 --> 02:34:18.700
embrace affirmative action on the third ground,

02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:20.100
the diversity ground.

02:34:20.100 --> 02:34:25.100
And what they say is we need affirmative action

02:34:25.620 --> 02:34:29.420
because affirmative action is good

02:34:29.420 --> 02:34:32.020
for pedagogical reasons.

02:34:32.020 --> 02:34:35.660
Now, frankly, do I think there's something to that?

02:34:35.660 --> 02:34:37.420
I think there's a little something to that

02:34:37.420 --> 02:34:39.500
with respect to some subjects.

02:34:41.060 --> 02:34:43.500
I don't think that's what's really going on

02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:44.500
for the most part.

02:34:44.500 --> 02:34:46.460
I mean, if that's what's really going on,

02:34:46.460 --> 02:34:49.500
why don't we have more foreign students?

02:34:51.060 --> 02:34:52.300
Why isn't there a greater effort

02:34:52.300 --> 02:34:53.700
to bring in more foreign students?

02:34:53.700 --> 02:34:56.700
Why isn't there a greater effort to bring in more,

02:34:56.700 --> 02:35:00.460
I don't know, religious fundamentalists?

02:35:00.460 --> 02:35:02.540
Why isn't there a greater effort to bring in?

02:35:02.540 --> 02:35:06.420
And you could just name various groups that are,

02:35:06.420 --> 02:35:08.180
you hardly ever see them on campus.

02:35:08.180 --> 02:35:10.780
So you don't think this kind of effort

02:35:10.780 --> 02:35:15.500
of driving towards diversity is rigorous enough?

02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:17.180
I think it's often pretextual.

02:35:17.180 --> 02:35:22.180
I think, frankly, the real reason has to do with the belief,

02:35:23.180 --> 02:35:24.860
and I think it's a good belief.

02:35:24.860 --> 02:35:26.660
I associate myself with the belief.

02:35:26.660 --> 02:35:30.220
It's just that because of the legal rules,

02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:34.820
the authorities can't say this belief out loud,

02:35:34.820 --> 02:35:37.500
but it's still the case that a lot of institutions

02:35:37.500 --> 02:35:42.500
want to help American society overcome its racial past.

02:35:43.900 --> 02:35:46.140
That's the real animating force.

02:35:46.140 --> 02:35:49.660
Now, this thing about we'll have better classroom

02:35:49.660 --> 02:35:54.380
discussions, some discussions, with some subjects.

02:35:56.140 --> 02:36:00.340
Listen, I'm an ignoramus when it comes to physics.

02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:04.060
My sense of it is, however, that if you're talking

02:36:04.060 --> 02:36:06.900
about physics, you're talking about physics,

02:36:06.900 --> 02:36:09.060
and frankly, it doesn't much matter

02:36:09.060 --> 02:36:11.900
in terms of mastering physics,

02:36:11.900 --> 02:36:15.340
what the demographics of that classroom are.

02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:16.860
You either know physics or you don't.

02:36:16.860 --> 02:36:19.260
The interesting thing I've noticed since doing this podcast

02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:24.860
is one way it does matter, it's really lonely

02:36:24.900 --> 02:36:27.700
when you do a thing and you don't see somebody

02:36:27.700 --> 02:36:29.980
that looks like you doing that thing,

02:36:29.980 --> 02:36:32.820
and it's such a seemingly stupid thing.

02:36:32.820 --> 02:36:35.060
Why does it matter if there's another person

02:36:35.060 --> 02:36:38.740
that looks like you in this very shallow sense,

02:36:38.740 --> 02:36:40.740
but it seems to matter to people,

02:36:40.740 --> 02:36:43.620
and when I talk to, for example, women on this podcast,

02:36:43.620 --> 02:36:46.940
a lot of women reach out saying how inspiring that is,

02:36:46.940 --> 02:36:48.660
and that's interesting, right?

02:36:48.660 --> 02:36:51.060
I think we're still human, and we see people

02:36:51.060 --> 02:36:54.900
that look like us, and this kind of narrow,

02:36:54.900 --> 02:36:57.460
shallow definition of diversity still matters.

02:36:57.460 --> 02:37:02.380
Okay, well, you know, I think you've made a good point,

02:37:02.380 --> 02:37:07.140
and maybe so, so let's go back to the physics.

02:37:07.140 --> 02:37:10.700
I mean, let's suppose that under one scenario,

02:37:10.700 --> 02:37:14.260
there's a classroom and a kid sticks his head,

02:37:14.260 --> 02:37:16.740
a black kid sticks his head in the classroom

02:37:16.780 --> 02:37:19.340
and doesn't see anybody else black there

02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:21.540
and has to make a quick decision and says,

02:37:21.540 --> 02:37:23.540
yeah, you know, nah, this ain't for me,

02:37:24.580 --> 02:37:28.140
versus they stick their head in the classroom,

02:37:28.140 --> 02:37:29.980
they see a smattering of other black people

02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:32.500
in the classroom, they say, let me try this,

02:37:32.500 --> 02:37:34.300
and then they try it, and it turns out,

02:37:34.300 --> 02:37:36.580
damn it, they're Albert Einstein.

02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:41.540
So, you know, to that extent, I can see, you know,

02:37:41.540 --> 02:37:43.900
under that scenario, maybe it does matter,

02:37:43.900 --> 02:37:46.260
so, you know, I'll have to recalibrate.

02:37:46.260 --> 02:37:51.260
Still, those are the three leading justifications

02:37:51.260 --> 02:37:52.660
for affirmative action.

02:37:52.660 --> 02:37:54.180
You asked me, where do I stand

02:37:54.180 --> 02:37:55.580
with respect to affirmative action?

02:37:55.580 --> 02:37:59.340
Oh, no, before we get to that, are there criticisms?

02:37:59.340 --> 02:38:02.940
The answer is yes, there are criticisms of affirmative action.

02:38:02.940 --> 02:38:07.900
Affirmative action is a policy like, you know, any policy.

02:38:07.900 --> 02:38:10.940
Any policy is gonna have some downsides to it,

02:38:10.940 --> 02:38:12.420
and affirmative action's no different.

02:38:12.420 --> 02:38:14.020
Does affirmative action have some downsides?

02:38:14.020 --> 02:38:15.580
Yes, it does have some downsides.

02:38:15.580 --> 02:38:16.420
What are they?

02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:18.700
Well, let me mention a couple.

02:38:18.700 --> 02:38:23.700
One, stigma, stigma.

02:38:25.260 --> 02:38:29.340
So, if you have an institution

02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:34.340
that says that it reaches out

02:38:34.380 --> 02:38:39.380
to give a boost to certain people on a racial basis,

02:38:40.340 --> 02:38:44.380
they're gonna be people who observe that

02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:46.980
and who are gonna be thinking to themselves,

02:38:46.980 --> 02:38:50.780
hmm, if so-and-so is here

02:38:50.780 --> 02:38:53.380
and they were given a special boost,

02:38:53.380 --> 02:38:58.380
doesn't that mean that they were not as proficient

02:38:59.380 --> 02:39:01.620
as the other people who are here

02:39:01.620 --> 02:39:04.380
and who did not have that boost?

02:39:04.380 --> 02:39:06.580
So, if they are not as proficient,

02:39:06.580 --> 02:39:08.220
if they are not as proficient,

02:39:08.220 --> 02:39:11.460
that means that they might not be as good.

02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:13.380
They might not be as up to snuff.

02:39:15.380 --> 02:39:19.220
Is that part of our affirmative action world?

02:39:19.220 --> 02:39:23.260
Yes, it's part of our affirmative action world, yes.

02:39:24.180 --> 02:39:26.660
I'm a professor at Harvard Law School.

02:39:26.660 --> 02:39:29.260
One of the subjects I teach is contracts.

02:39:30.660 --> 02:39:34.500
Actually, that's probably the subject I most enjoy teaching.

02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:39.500
I think I most enjoy writing about racial conflict

02:39:39.820 --> 02:39:43.100
and the legal system, but as far as teaching,

02:39:43.100 --> 02:39:45.540
I most enjoy teaching contracts.

02:39:45.540 --> 02:39:49.860
Well, on that very first day, on the very first day,

02:39:49.860 --> 02:39:52.900
when I, you know, the 80 students come,

02:39:52.900 --> 02:39:55.900
especially the first-year students, they're nervous,

02:39:58.180 --> 02:39:59.220
I show up.

02:40:00.180 --> 02:40:03.940
I'm quite sure that there's some students there

02:40:03.940 --> 02:40:08.340
who are thinking, okay, well,

02:40:09.340 --> 02:40:14.220
is this guy as good as my other teachers?

02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:17.060
Because, you know, I know that, you know,

02:40:17.060 --> 02:40:19.940
institutions like Harvard have made a special effort

02:40:19.940 --> 02:40:23.180
to bring in people like this guy, Kennedy.

02:40:24.220 --> 02:40:25.620
Is he as good?

02:40:26.860 --> 02:40:28.780
Well, I mean, I'm sorry,

02:40:28.780 --> 02:40:33.580
if you have an affirmative action regime,

02:40:33.580 --> 02:40:35.300
people are gonna think that.

02:40:35.300 --> 02:40:36.940
And are they crazy to think that?

02:40:36.940 --> 02:40:40.100
No, they're not crazy to think that, no.

02:40:40.100 --> 02:40:45.100
That's a perfectly logical thing for somebody to think.

02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:50.020
Does it have an effect on me as the teacher?

02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:52.740
Yeah, actually, it does have an effect on me, sure.

02:40:54.020 --> 02:40:56.260
I'm aware that some people are thinking that.

02:40:56.260 --> 02:40:59.140
It doesn't, I'm not, you know,

02:40:59.140 --> 02:41:04.140
it doesn't, you know, make me shake in my boots.

02:41:04.740 --> 02:41:05.580
Am I aware of it?

02:41:05.580 --> 02:41:06.740
Yeah, I'm aware of it.

02:41:06.740 --> 02:41:07.940
Does it have an effect?

02:41:07.940 --> 02:41:09.660
Yeah, it probably does have an effect.

02:41:09.660 --> 02:41:10.500
It probably does.

02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:15.500
It probably, it probably makes me,

02:41:20.300 --> 02:41:24.700
it probably makes me redouble my efforts

02:41:25.700 --> 02:41:30.660
because I don't want anybody to think justifiably

02:41:31.740 --> 02:41:34.820
that I'm less able than my colleagues.

02:41:35.860 --> 02:41:39.180
So, you know, it's funny,

02:41:39.180 --> 02:41:40.020
when I was growing up,

02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:42.780
my father used to tell me over and over again,

02:41:42.780 --> 02:41:46.020
Randy, tie, tie, you lose, okay, brother?

02:41:46.020 --> 02:41:47.380
Let me just tell you that.

02:41:47.380 --> 02:41:50.420
And he was telling me that because when he was, you know,

02:41:50.420 --> 02:41:53.340
in an earlier time, tie, tie, you lose,

02:41:54.340 --> 02:41:57.260
it was, you know, if it's even,

02:41:57.260 --> 02:41:59.180
and there's a choice to be made,

02:41:59.180 --> 02:42:02.300
the white person is gonna get the benefit of the doubt.

02:42:02.300 --> 02:42:04.940
Now, under affirmative action,

02:42:04.940 --> 02:42:07.020
there's been a switcheroo.

02:42:07.020 --> 02:42:08.780
Oftentimes, it's the black person

02:42:08.780 --> 02:42:10.700
who gets the benefit of the doubt,

02:42:10.700 --> 02:42:13.660
but I'm still in a situation in which-

02:42:13.660 --> 02:42:14.500
You have to work hard.

02:42:14.500 --> 02:42:18.900
Yes, to avoid the stigmatization

02:42:18.900 --> 02:42:21.380
that is imposed by affirmative action.

02:42:21.380 --> 02:42:22.580
But is that stigma there?

02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:23.980
Yes, it's there.

02:42:23.980 --> 02:42:24.820
It is there.

02:42:25.900 --> 02:42:27.500
I'll tell you another way in which it comes up

02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:28.540
from a student's point of view.

02:42:28.540 --> 02:42:29.860
I'll never forget this.

02:42:30.860 --> 02:42:32.740
It was in my second year of law school.

02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:35.620
It was in tax class.

02:42:36.500 --> 02:42:38.380
We had a very famous tax teacher,

02:42:38.380 --> 02:42:39.660
wonderful tax teacher.

02:42:39.660 --> 02:42:41.620
On the very first day of class,

02:42:46.100 --> 02:42:49.340
Professor Bicker, wonderful man, wonderful teacher,

02:42:49.340 --> 02:42:52.980
Boris Bicker, called on,

02:42:52.980 --> 02:42:55.860
the very first person he called on was a black student.

02:42:55.860 --> 02:42:58.540
I remember this as if it were yesterday,

02:42:58.540 --> 02:42:59.660
called on a black student.

02:42:59.660 --> 02:43:01.300
It was a black woman student.

02:43:03.340 --> 02:43:05.300
And I remember when he called on her,

02:43:05.300 --> 02:43:09.900
I remember just, I felt,

02:43:13.340 --> 02:43:16.660
I felt as if the room got quieter.

02:43:16.660 --> 02:43:19.060
Really, I felt as if the room got quieter,

02:43:19.700 --> 02:43:22.780
and I know there was a real tenseness within me.

02:43:22.780 --> 02:43:24.660
He didn't call on me, he called on somebody else,

02:43:24.660 --> 02:43:26.060
was a black woman student.

02:43:27.140 --> 02:43:30.740
And I felt different.

02:43:30.740 --> 02:43:32.540
I felt as if I was,

02:43:41.540 --> 02:43:44.540
I felt as if I was somehow at issue.

02:43:49.140 --> 02:43:53.500
I felt as if my place, I felt as if my status

02:43:53.500 --> 02:43:58.500
was to some small degree at issue.

02:44:00.620 --> 02:44:02.340
In the positive direction or the negative?

02:44:02.340 --> 02:44:03.580
Just at issue.

02:44:03.580 --> 02:44:04.420
At issue.

02:44:04.420 --> 02:44:06.580
And so, now all of this is happening really quickly.

02:44:06.580 --> 02:44:08.460
He calls on the student.

02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:11.780
This is happening like in seconds.

02:44:11.780 --> 02:44:15.380
And she responded, and she responded really strongly.

02:44:15.380 --> 02:44:18.540
It was clear, he asked her a question.

02:44:18.620 --> 02:44:19.940
She answered the question.

02:44:19.940 --> 02:44:21.740
She answered the question, you know, beautiful.

02:44:21.740 --> 02:44:25.300
I mean, you know, very strong, comprehensive,

02:44:25.300 --> 02:44:28.020
wonderful response.

02:44:28.020 --> 02:44:30.700
Now you might say, okay, well, you know, smart student.

02:44:30.700 --> 02:44:32.260
Okay, fine, next.

02:44:33.220 --> 02:44:38.220
After class, after class, I went up to her,

02:44:39.260 --> 02:44:40.780
and I clearly remember this.

02:44:40.780 --> 02:44:45.420
I said, that was great, thank you.

02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:47.420
Why?

02:44:48.300 --> 02:44:50.780
Because I'm a black student,

02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:54.540
predominantly white institution, Yale Law School,

02:44:54.540 --> 02:44:59.540
and I felt some of the, again, you know, affirmative action.

02:45:05.540 --> 02:45:10.540
I felt some of the burden

02:45:12.100 --> 02:45:15.260
of this affirmative action stigma.

02:45:16.100 --> 02:45:18.900
So it was almost like, thank you for showing

02:45:18.900 --> 02:45:20.540
that we belong here.

02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:23.060
Yes, perfect, boom.

02:45:23.060 --> 02:45:25.740
Yes, that's exactly what the situation,

02:45:25.740 --> 02:45:28.220
and by the way, I wasn't the only one.

02:45:28.220 --> 02:45:30.580
I wasn't being idiosyncratic.

02:45:30.580 --> 02:45:31.740
I wasn't the only one.

02:45:31.740 --> 02:45:33.940
There weren't many black people in that class,

02:45:33.940 --> 02:45:38.940
but all of us, and we laughed about it later.

02:45:39.220 --> 02:45:41.660
We laughed about it, but that was there.

02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:44.500
So there's the stigma issue,

02:45:44.500 --> 02:45:46.460
and some people have made a lot of this.

02:45:46.460 --> 02:45:49.780
Some people have really made a lot of the stigma issue.

02:45:49.780 --> 02:45:53.060
My attitude towards the stigma issue, yeah, it's there.

02:45:53.060 --> 02:45:56.740
It's, you know, again, it's part of, you know,

02:45:56.740 --> 02:45:58.340
it's part of the situation,

02:45:58.340 --> 02:46:00.940
but I think that the benefits outweigh the burdens,

02:46:00.940 --> 02:46:01.780
but is that a burden?

02:46:01.780 --> 02:46:02.700
Yeah, that's a burden.

02:46:02.700 --> 02:46:03.740
What are some others?

02:46:05.020 --> 02:46:08.660
Resentment, resentment in society,

02:46:08.660 --> 02:46:12.940
and that's, you know, so in the fancy schools,

02:46:12.980 --> 02:46:14.060
and by the way, you know,

02:46:14.060 --> 02:46:16.660
remember when we're talking about affirmative action,

02:46:18.060 --> 02:46:20.700
most colleges and universities in the United States,

02:46:20.700 --> 02:46:23.500
there is no affirmative action issue

02:46:23.500 --> 02:46:24.780
because they're not selective.

02:46:24.780 --> 02:46:26.340
Hell, they'll take anybody who, you know,

02:46:26.340 --> 02:46:28.780
if you can pay, come on in.

02:46:28.780 --> 02:46:33.380
It's only a fairly small set of schools that are selective,

02:46:33.380 --> 02:46:35.980
but of course, those are the most elite schools.

02:46:35.980 --> 02:46:39.300
Those are the schools that people most want to get into,

02:46:39.300 --> 02:46:41.100
and that's one of the reasons why we have all this,

02:46:41.100 --> 02:46:42.620
you know, fighting over those schools.

02:46:42.620 --> 02:46:47.620
Now, you know, there's a whole,

02:46:48.140 --> 02:46:52.260
how many millions of people are there in America

02:46:53.140 --> 02:46:56.140
who have applied to various places?

02:46:56.140 --> 02:46:59.620
They didn't get in, and what do they say?

02:46:59.620 --> 02:47:03.780
The white person who applied to Harvard, applied to Yale,

02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:08.780
applied to Columbia, you know, applied to Georgetown,

02:47:08.980 --> 02:47:13.980
applied to NYU, you know, didn't get in.

02:47:14.540 --> 02:47:15.740
What do they say?

02:47:16.740 --> 02:47:17.580
I would have gotten in

02:47:17.580 --> 02:47:20.620
if it hadn't been for that racial affirmative action.

02:47:20.620 --> 02:47:22.180
They're resentful.

02:47:22.180 --> 02:47:24.540
Well, you know, should they be resentful?

02:47:24.540 --> 02:47:27.060
No, they shouldn't be resentful, but they are resentful.

02:47:27.060 --> 02:47:28.100
Does that have a consequence?

02:47:28.100 --> 02:47:29.780
Yeah, it has a consequence.

02:47:29.780 --> 02:47:32.220
It has a consequence on how they act towards other people.

02:47:32.220 --> 02:47:34.220
It has a consequence on how they vote.

02:47:34.220 --> 02:47:36.460
It has a consequence.

02:47:36.460 --> 02:47:39.940
And, you know, that's something.

02:47:42.340 --> 02:47:44.580
Are there other things?

02:47:44.580 --> 02:47:49.580
Yeah, and you know, in my book, I go through various,

02:47:53.100 --> 02:47:58.100
I think that there is a certain sort of denialism

02:47:58.620 --> 02:48:03.620
that has accompanied the affirmative action debate.

02:48:03.660 --> 02:48:08.660
So because, you know, black people like myself

02:48:12.700 --> 02:48:17.700
want to avoid the stigmatizing burden of affirmative action,

02:48:21.100 --> 02:48:24.380
there's some people who, to deal with that,

02:48:25.380 --> 02:48:30.380
have said, oh, actually, there is no difference

02:48:31.380 --> 02:48:36.380
between, you know, the beneficiaries of affirmative action

02:48:37.020 --> 02:48:39.060
and the other kids.

02:48:39.060 --> 02:48:40.780
There is no difference.

02:48:40.780 --> 02:48:45.780
If the affirmative action kids got, let's say, a 500,

02:48:45.780 --> 02:48:48.500
and the other kids got a 750,

02:48:48.500 --> 02:48:50.340
that doesn't make any difference.

02:48:50.340 --> 02:48:52.300
That's just the way it is.

02:48:52.660 --> 02:48:54.020
That doesn't make any difference.

02:48:54.020 --> 02:48:55.980
That's just BS.

02:48:55.980 --> 02:48:58.540
The only reason the kid who, you know,

02:48:58.540 --> 02:49:02.980
the 550 kid didn't get 750 is because the test asks

02:49:02.980 --> 02:49:07.460
all sorts of, you know, bias, culturally biased things

02:49:07.460 --> 02:49:09.060
like, you know, what is a yacht?

02:49:11.140 --> 02:49:13.900
Well, sorry.

02:49:15.900 --> 02:49:18.700
Yes, there is a difference.

02:49:18.700 --> 02:49:21.060
There's a 200 point difference.

02:49:21.060 --> 02:49:22.180
Does the difference matter?

02:49:23.020 --> 02:49:24.860
Yes, the difference matters.

02:49:24.860 --> 02:49:27.740
And by the way, if you don't know what a yacht is,

02:49:27.740 --> 02:49:30.940
you can know what a yacht is without owning a yacht, okay?

02:49:32.260 --> 02:49:37.260
And there's this denialism that I think has really seeped

02:49:37.940 --> 02:49:42.940
into not just, you know, into various conversations.

02:49:43.020 --> 02:49:46.020
That can have a slippery slope effect that's beyond just this.

02:49:46.020 --> 02:49:48.780
Yes, and, you know, we see it in various ways.

02:49:48.940 --> 02:49:51.260
This, you know, this attack on testing.

02:49:52.260 --> 02:49:54.700
It's not like I'm holding the, you know,

02:49:54.700 --> 02:49:56.380
some tests are not good tests.

02:49:56.380 --> 02:49:58.740
I think we should be skeptical of everything,

02:49:58.740 --> 02:50:00.500
but there are a lot of tests that,

02:50:00.500 --> 02:50:02.420
yeah, they tell us something all right.

02:50:02.420 --> 02:50:04.580
They tell us who knows what.

02:50:04.580 --> 02:50:08.060
And there's some people who are really, you know,

02:50:08.060 --> 02:50:10.300
dead set against testing because they're dead set

02:50:10.300 --> 02:50:12.620
against anything that might show a gap.

02:50:13.540 --> 02:50:16.220
Well, I think by the way, you know, are there gaps?

02:50:16.220 --> 02:50:18.140
Yeah, there are gaps.

02:50:18.140 --> 02:50:22.220
And what we need to do is be cognizant of those gaps

02:50:22.220 --> 02:50:26.500
and do things to make it so that if there's a gap,

02:50:26.500 --> 02:50:31.100
if you're deficient, no shame in being deficient.

02:50:31.100 --> 02:50:33.300
Heck, I'm deficient about a lot of things.

02:50:34.180 --> 02:50:39.180
Let's, you know, let's learn so that I catch up.

02:50:39.940 --> 02:50:42.260
But others, you know, but I think sometimes

02:50:42.260 --> 02:50:44.860
there've been people who've been afraid

02:50:45.740 --> 02:50:50.740
of even acknowledging the gaps.

02:50:51.500 --> 02:50:54.420
Of course, there's, I guess, a colleague of yours,

02:50:54.420 --> 02:50:57.580
Michael Sandel, with Tyranny and Merit.

02:50:57.580 --> 02:51:01.700
There's interesting, rigorous ways to kind of challenge ways

02:51:01.700 --> 02:51:03.100
on the flip side of that,

02:51:03.100 --> 02:51:05.500
where obsessing with merit can go wrong also.

02:51:05.500 --> 02:51:07.700
Yes, you mentioned Michael Sandel.

02:51:07.700 --> 02:51:11.580
He's a wonderful colleague and he's a wonderful friend.

02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:13.700
I've known him a long time.

02:51:13.700 --> 02:51:17.260
I think he makes very important arguments

02:51:18.260 --> 02:51:20.420
about meritocracy.

02:51:21.500 --> 02:51:25.660
I disagree with some of the points that he makes

02:51:25.660 --> 02:51:26.500
about meritocracy. You do.

02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:28.900
So you lean towards the importance of meritocracy.

02:51:28.900 --> 02:51:33.060
I think that, yes, I think that there are values

02:51:33.060 --> 02:51:35.340
in meritocracy extremely important,

02:51:35.340 --> 02:51:40.340
that in fact, you know, the movement from,

02:51:40.340 --> 02:51:43.420
you know, feudalism, the movement from status,

02:51:44.140 --> 02:51:49.140
the idea of, you know, I don't care who your,

02:51:49.660 --> 02:51:51.660
you know, father or mother was.

02:51:51.660 --> 02:51:53.940
I don't care from what part of town you come from.

02:51:53.940 --> 02:51:55.900
I don't care what your last name is.

02:51:55.900 --> 02:51:58.460
I don't care what your color of your skin is.

02:51:59.340 --> 02:52:01.700
Show me what you can do.

02:52:01.700 --> 02:52:03.300
And then somebody sits down, okay,

02:52:03.300 --> 02:52:05.340
I'll show you what I can do.

02:52:05.340 --> 02:52:07.340
And they show it, you're in.

02:52:08.820 --> 02:52:11.100
I think there's a lot to that.

02:52:11.100 --> 02:52:15.780
And, you know, the impulse, the sentiments behind that,

02:52:15.780 --> 02:52:19.140
I resonate with that.

02:52:19.140 --> 02:52:20.580
I think that there's a lot there.

02:52:20.580 --> 02:52:25.020
What I want to do is I want to get rid

02:52:25.020 --> 02:52:30.020
of those features in society that deprive people

02:52:30.940 --> 02:52:35.940
of what you need to develop yourself.

02:52:36.140 --> 02:52:39.020
You know, sometimes those are psychological.

02:52:39.020 --> 02:52:43.020
Sometimes it's, you know, you're not around people

02:52:43.020 --> 02:52:44.860
who've done things that give you the idea

02:52:44.860 --> 02:52:46.060
that you can do things.

02:52:46.060 --> 02:52:48.220
I want to get rid of that.

02:52:48.220 --> 02:52:53.220
But the idea of, you know, people,

02:52:55.060 --> 02:53:00.060
the idea, by the way, of, you know, distinguishing,

02:53:00.420 --> 02:53:03.420
you know, this is excellent.

02:53:03.820 --> 02:53:05.940
And the people who are excellent,

02:53:07.500 --> 02:53:10.020
you know, they're here.

02:53:10.020 --> 02:53:13.020
And then there are people who are good.

02:53:14.340 --> 02:53:15.180
Are they excellent?

02:53:15.180 --> 02:53:16.860
No, they're not excellent.

02:53:16.860 --> 02:53:17.700
They're good.

02:53:19.740 --> 02:53:24.740
I'm not gonna, you know, close my eyes at that distinction.

02:53:24.820 --> 02:53:28.780
And highlight that distinction,

02:53:28.780 --> 02:53:30.580
and yet at the same time,

02:53:30.900 --> 02:53:33.900
maintain a sense that their basic worth

02:53:33.900 --> 02:53:35.300
as a human being is equal.

02:53:35.300 --> 02:53:36.140
Yes.

02:53:36.140 --> 02:53:41.140
So, you know, was it Run BMC, one of the rap groups?

02:53:44.180 --> 02:53:49.180
You know, we're all written down on the same list.

02:53:49.260 --> 02:53:51.420
We're all written down on the same list.

02:53:51.420 --> 02:53:55.940
Yes, we're, you know, so I want to recognize

02:53:56.140 --> 02:54:01.140
so I want to recognize our fundamental humanity.

02:54:03.260 --> 02:54:04.380
I don't think that that,

02:54:04.380 --> 02:54:07.180
I think that one can recognize our fundamental humanity

02:54:07.180 --> 02:54:10.980
and one can also recognize as far as I'm concerned,

02:54:10.980 --> 02:54:15.980
that we all collectively should make sure

02:54:15.980 --> 02:54:20.060
that we do all that we can to prevent people

02:54:20.060 --> 02:54:23.540
from sinking below a certain level and being, you know,

02:54:23.540 --> 02:54:27.020
in misery, you know, all for that.

02:54:27.900 --> 02:54:32.900
But I want to be careful about some of the attacks

02:54:35.260 --> 02:54:37.300
that I hear on meritocracy.

02:54:37.300 --> 02:54:39.700
So some of the people, including, again,

02:54:39.700 --> 02:54:44.700
I have all the respect in the world for Michael Sandeli,

02:54:44.940 --> 02:54:48.140
you know, talks about the arrogance of the winners.

02:54:49.060 --> 02:54:50.900
Okay, I want to be, you know,

02:54:51.140 --> 02:54:54.180
I don't want the winners to be arrogant.

02:54:54.180 --> 02:54:57.260
That's right, luck has a lot to do with things.

02:54:57.260 --> 02:55:00.380
You know, you didn't have any control

02:55:00.380 --> 02:55:03.380
over the circumstances in which you were born into.

02:55:03.380 --> 02:55:07.820
You were lucky that you were born healthy

02:55:07.820 --> 02:55:12.060
and that you were born with a, you know, well-working mind.

02:55:12.060 --> 02:55:13.300
You didn't have anything to do with that.

02:55:13.300 --> 02:55:14.380
That was pure luck.

02:55:14.380 --> 02:55:16.420
There's some people who don't have that luck.

02:55:16.420 --> 02:55:21.420
So don't, you know, don't be, you know, Mr. Big Stuff, okay?

02:55:23.940 --> 02:55:27.020
So I'm, you know, I'm against that sort of arrogance.

02:55:27.020 --> 02:55:32.020
You know, I'm entitled as if I taught myself how to read.

02:55:32.340 --> 02:55:35.060
No, you didn't teach yourself how to read.

02:55:35.060 --> 02:55:37.820
There was people who did all sorts of things for you

02:55:37.820 --> 02:55:39.140
and you don't even know it.

02:55:40.180 --> 02:55:43.220
Okay, so, you know, I want to, you know,

02:55:43.220 --> 02:55:44.660
get rid of the arrogance.

02:55:46.620 --> 02:55:48.780
Have decent humility.

02:55:48.780 --> 02:55:50.140
I'm all for that.

02:55:50.140 --> 02:55:53.220
At the same time, you know,

02:55:54.980 --> 02:55:59.980
I want to be careful about the problem of envy.

02:56:00.140 --> 02:56:01.740
I want to be, I want to be careful

02:56:01.740 --> 02:56:04.900
about the problem of resentment.

02:56:04.900 --> 02:56:09.220
I want to be, I want to be careful about, you know,

02:56:09.220 --> 02:56:13.500
I've heard, you know, so let's not have,

02:56:14.500 --> 02:56:19.500
let's not give a trophy to the person who wins the race

02:56:21.660 --> 02:56:25.780
because to give a trophy to the person who wins the race

02:56:25.780 --> 02:56:29.260
will make the person who they defeated feel bad.

02:56:29.260 --> 02:56:32.980
No, no, no, no, I don't want that.

02:56:32.980 --> 02:56:36.500
I want to give a trophy to the person who wins the race

02:56:36.500 --> 02:56:41.500
because I think it's a good thing to valorize the best.

02:56:44.180 --> 02:56:49.180
Yeah, it's a kind of celebration of this whole human project

02:56:52.580 --> 02:56:54.900
that we're on is celebrating the best.

02:56:56.100 --> 02:56:58.700
You mentioned your father several times,

02:56:58.700 --> 02:57:00.100
so let me just linger on that.

02:57:00.100 --> 02:57:01.900
What have you learned from,

02:57:03.100 --> 02:57:05.540
what have you learned about life from your father?

02:57:08.020 --> 02:57:12.100
There's, I've been just such a lucky person.

02:57:13.100 --> 02:57:16.100
I mean, I feel like I've just lived

02:57:16.100 --> 02:57:21.100
an absolutely charmed life and I live,

02:57:24.980 --> 02:57:29.980
I mean, the work that I do is what I love doing.

02:57:35.020 --> 02:57:38.620
I would pay to do what I am paid to do.

02:57:39.340 --> 02:57:40.180
Yeah.

02:57:40.180 --> 02:57:42.780
I mean, it's great.

02:57:42.780 --> 02:57:47.780
And I've been fortunate in so many ways.

02:57:48.540 --> 02:57:53.540
And one way in which I've been fortunate is my parents.

02:57:53.740 --> 02:57:58.740
My parents, Rachel Spann Kennedy, Henry Harold Kennedy,

02:58:00.020 --> 02:58:02.420
my mother born in Columbia, South Carolina,

02:58:02.420 --> 02:58:07.420
my father from New Orleans, Louisiana.

02:58:07.780 --> 02:58:10.380
They were refugees from the Jim Crow South.

02:58:12.420 --> 02:58:17.420
They were people who put their all into their children.

02:58:19.860 --> 02:58:22.220
I have an older brother of a younger sister.

02:58:23.100 --> 02:58:28.100
All three of us know beyond any controversy

02:58:30.820 --> 02:58:35.260
that we were loved and dearly loved by our parents.

02:58:36.260 --> 02:58:39.700
And they were great people.

02:58:39.700 --> 02:58:44.700
My father, very interesting man, very independent minded.

02:58:46.780 --> 02:58:50.180
He was perfectly willing to go his own way.

02:58:51.100 --> 02:58:55.340
And I learned much from him, including,

02:58:55.340 --> 02:58:56.820
I learned things from him

02:58:56.820 --> 02:58:58.580
even when I ultimately disagreed with him.

02:58:58.580 --> 02:59:01.820
So for instance, again, to go back to his pessimism,

02:59:01.900 --> 02:59:05.180
yeah, he was pessimistic, thoroughly pessimistic.

02:59:08.140 --> 02:59:13.140
But he was also willing to change in certain ways.

02:59:15.060 --> 02:59:16.860
In fact, both my parents.

02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:18.300
I mean, one of the most important things

02:59:18.300 --> 02:59:22.500
that happened to my parents was that I'd say

02:59:24.660 --> 02:59:28.500
when I was, let's say 10 years old,

02:59:30.300 --> 02:59:31.620
I was born in 1954.

02:59:32.460 --> 02:59:35.300
So in 1964, in 1964, I think my parents

02:59:35.300 --> 02:59:37.060
would have taken the position that

02:59:38.900 --> 02:59:42.260
you definitely never under any circumstances

02:59:42.260 --> 02:59:44.140
trust a white person.

02:59:44.140 --> 02:59:46.580
If a black person trusts a white person,

02:59:46.580 --> 02:59:48.220
that person is a fool.

02:59:48.220 --> 02:59:51.260
Do not trust white people, all right?

02:59:51.260 --> 02:59:53.380
They are not to be trusted.

02:59:53.380 --> 02:59:58.380
And it's the highly, highly, highly unusual one

02:59:59.380 --> 03:00:02.420
who is not prejudiced, okay?

03:00:02.420 --> 03:00:04.340
So white people are not to be trusted.

03:00:04.340 --> 03:00:08.300
And by and large, you're gonna be your enemy, all right?

03:00:08.300 --> 03:00:09.340
So let's just face that.

03:00:09.340 --> 03:00:11.980
That was their point of view.

03:00:14.460 --> 03:00:16.420
I'd say that 10 years later,

03:00:22.780 --> 03:00:26.060
that point of view had been leavened somewhat.

03:00:29.340 --> 03:00:31.620
And you say, well, what happened in those 10 years?

03:00:31.620 --> 03:00:35.780
Well, certainly in my life,

03:00:37.100 --> 03:00:40.020
one of the things that happened in those 10 years is

03:00:43.340 --> 03:00:47.660
I was a student in various schools

03:00:49.020 --> 03:00:53.340
and I had a series of teachers.

03:00:53.340 --> 03:00:55.340
I've had wonderful black teachers.

03:00:56.340 --> 03:00:58.620
I've also had wonderful white teachers.

03:01:00.060 --> 03:01:04.020
And my parents paid attention to who my teachers were

03:01:04.020 --> 03:01:05.780
and how my teachers treated me.

03:01:06.940 --> 03:01:11.940
And I think that they were affected by the way

03:01:12.820 --> 03:01:17.820
in which there were white people who really helped me

03:01:18.220 --> 03:01:23.220
and were on my side and were thoroughly on my side.

03:01:24.940 --> 03:01:29.460
And I think that that experience

03:01:33.260 --> 03:01:37.220
changed my parents in their general view.

03:01:37.220 --> 03:01:39.980
They, you know, skeptical, yeah, but they were,

03:01:41.900 --> 03:01:46.900
the possibility, the possibility that my parents

03:01:47.820 --> 03:01:51.020
were the possibility of a white person

03:01:52.500 --> 03:01:57.140
genuinely being the friend of a black person,

03:02:00.620 --> 03:02:02.300
that became alive to them.

03:02:02.300 --> 03:02:05.660
And I give them a lot of credit because they were adults.

03:02:05.660 --> 03:02:10.100
And, you know, for an adult to change, that's a big deal.

03:02:10.100 --> 03:02:11.780
But my parents did change.

03:02:11.780 --> 03:02:15.100
In that transformation that was inspiring to you,

03:02:15.100 --> 03:02:18.500
was formative to you in terms of joining the Optimist camp.

03:02:18.500 --> 03:02:23.500
Hugely, and, you know, the school,

03:02:23.580 --> 03:02:26.220
I mean, again, you know, I said a moment ago

03:02:26.220 --> 03:02:28.020
how lucky I've been, heck.

03:02:29.260 --> 03:02:32.340
I teach at Harvard Law School.

03:02:33.340 --> 03:02:38.340
I attended Balliol College, Oxford.

03:02:39.780 --> 03:02:43.460
I got my law degree from Yale Law School.

03:02:44.460 --> 03:02:48.460
I got my undergraduate degree at Princeton University.

03:02:48.460 --> 03:02:50.300
Those are some pretty good schools.

03:02:50.300 --> 03:02:52.820
They all were, they all were.

03:02:52.820 --> 03:02:56.700
The most important school, however, that I attended,

03:02:56.700 --> 03:03:00.420
the school that made the most difference in my education

03:03:00.420 --> 03:03:03.100
was my high school, St. Albans School,

03:03:03.100 --> 03:03:05.300
St. Albans School for Boys.

03:03:05.300 --> 03:03:10.300
And at St. Albans, I encountered a cadre of teachers.

03:03:10.540 --> 03:03:14.020
And by the way, at St. Albans, when I went to St. Albans,

03:03:14.020 --> 03:03:18.020
all these teachers were white, all these teachers.

03:03:18.020 --> 03:03:23.020
There was one, the head of athletics,

03:03:23.900 --> 03:03:27.700
very important man, very impressive man, Brooks Johnson,

03:03:27.700 --> 03:03:32.700
was black, otherwise, white teachers.

03:03:33.220 --> 03:03:38.220
And these teachers made a huge difference in my life

03:03:38.780 --> 03:03:43.780
and I can call their names, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

03:03:43.860 --> 03:03:48.860
The greatest of them all was a man by the name of

03:03:50.980 --> 03:03:51.820
Jack McCune.

03:03:53.660 --> 03:03:58.660
Yeah, we called him Gentleman Jack, Gentleman Jack McCune.

03:03:59.060 --> 03:04:00.260
And-

03:04:00.260 --> 03:04:01.460
What subject did he teach?

03:04:01.460 --> 03:04:04.540
He taught me history.

03:04:04.940 --> 03:04:07.940
He was my advanced placement history teacher.

03:04:09.300 --> 03:04:14.300
But John F. McCune, and we shared a birthday,

03:04:17.300 --> 03:04:22.300
John F. McCune was a fabulously good teacher

03:04:23.300 --> 03:04:28.300
and we developed a deep lifetime friendship.

03:04:29.220 --> 03:04:34.220
I was with Mr. McCune the day before he died.

03:04:42.060 --> 03:04:47.060
And he was a white man.

03:04:51.380 --> 03:04:56.380
And I've had other teachers, some of whom have become

03:04:56.620 --> 03:05:01.620
colleagues of mine, Sanford Levinson.

03:05:02.060 --> 03:05:04.940
Sanford Levinson was a teacher of mine at Princeton.

03:05:07.460 --> 03:05:09.460
He's become a colleague of mine.

03:05:10.700 --> 03:05:15.340
I mean, frankly, it would be impossible for me to,

03:05:18.420 --> 03:05:23.420
I can't make some sort of blanket condemnation

03:05:27.380 --> 03:05:32.380
of white people with Sandy Levinson in my life.

03:05:32.980 --> 03:05:35.980
I mean, seriously, with John F. McCune in my life,

03:05:35.980 --> 03:05:40.980
with Eric Foner in my life, with my colleague Martha Minow

03:05:41.340 --> 03:05:44.500
in my life, my colleague Cass Sunstein in my life,

03:05:44.500 --> 03:05:46.500
impossible.

03:05:46.500 --> 03:05:49.660
You know, that speaks to the power of teachers and mentors.

03:05:49.660 --> 03:05:50.500
Oh yeah.

03:05:51.820 --> 03:05:53.460
And you're that to a lot of people.

03:05:53.620 --> 03:05:57.100
Well, I've taken that to, I hope, I hope,

03:05:57.100 --> 03:05:59.420
listen, I would be, I would, listen,

03:05:59.420 --> 03:06:04.420
I would be absolutely overjoyed if there was a student

03:06:06.420 --> 03:06:10.820
who thought of me in the way that I think

03:06:10.820 --> 03:06:13.140
of gentlemen Jack McCune.

03:06:13.140 --> 03:06:18.100
If that's the case, just one, just one.

03:06:18.100 --> 03:06:22.060
If that's the case, I'm overjoyed.

03:06:22.140 --> 03:06:24.820
That's a life well lived.

03:06:24.820 --> 03:06:29.740
What do you think of Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream?

03:06:29.740 --> 03:06:31.980
Do you still share that dream?

03:06:31.980 --> 03:06:34.300
I think that Martin Luther King Jr.'s

03:06:34.300 --> 03:06:37.580
I Have a Dream speech is one of the great speeches,

03:06:37.580 --> 03:06:39.020
not only in American history,

03:06:39.020 --> 03:06:41.060
but in the history of the world.

03:06:41.060 --> 03:06:44.100
You know, there's a tendency now for people

03:06:44.100 --> 03:06:46.460
to sort of poo poo that speech.

03:06:47.780 --> 03:06:50.700
I think, unfortunately, the speech, you know,

03:06:50.740 --> 03:06:54.580
has been embraced by, you know,

03:06:54.580 --> 03:06:56.780
advertisers and corporate America.

03:06:56.780 --> 03:07:01.380
It's been so, you know, it's been heard so many times

03:07:01.380 --> 03:07:04.300
that it sort of has been made to suffer

03:07:04.300 --> 03:07:07.780
from what some people might view as overexposure.

03:07:07.780 --> 03:07:09.220
It's so unfortunate, I mean.

03:07:09.220 --> 03:07:10.140
It's too bad.

03:07:10.140 --> 03:07:12.860
When, especially when Hollywood rolls in,

03:07:12.860 --> 03:07:16.540
they did that with John Lennon's Imagine recently,

03:07:16.540 --> 03:07:18.900
which I think is one of the greatest songs ever.

03:07:19.860 --> 03:07:21.420
The actors and actresses ruined it

03:07:21.420 --> 03:07:22.700
by trying to like sing along

03:07:22.700 --> 03:07:25.060
and do this kind of cliche Hollywood thing.

03:07:25.060 --> 03:07:28.100
It has, but people have tried to make it into a cliche.

03:07:28.100 --> 03:07:33.100
The fact of the matter is it's the sentiment,

03:07:33.300 --> 03:07:36.900
the sentiment behind I Have a Dream.

03:07:36.900 --> 03:07:39.700
Yeah, I'll associate myself with that.

03:07:39.700 --> 03:07:44.700
And anybody wants to see some great oratory, go watch.

03:07:44.820 --> 03:07:47.820
And, you know, Martin Luther King Jr.,

03:07:47.820 --> 03:07:52.820
I mean, he gave, you know, several great speeches.

03:07:54.460 --> 03:07:55.980
You know, his first speech,

03:07:55.980 --> 03:08:00.980
the first speech that he gave as a civil rights leader,

03:08:03.780 --> 03:08:08.780
the Holt Street Baptist Church, 1955,

03:08:09.180 --> 03:08:11.940
at the beginning of the Montgomery Bus Boycott,

03:08:12.420 --> 03:08:14.940
at the beginning of the Montgomery Bus Boycott,

03:08:14.940 --> 03:08:18.100
which was virtually an extemporaneous speech,

03:08:18.100 --> 03:08:19.940
was one of his greatest.

03:08:19.940 --> 03:08:24.100
And he was, I think, 26 years old, great.

03:08:24.100 --> 03:08:27.500
His last speech, you know, his mountaintop speech,

03:08:27.500 --> 03:08:30.740
great speech, but I Have a Dream, I love it.

03:08:32.180 --> 03:08:34.660
I will associate myself with those sentiments

03:08:34.660 --> 03:08:36.740
any day of the week, absolutely.

03:08:36.740 --> 03:08:41.740
So you still have hope for a deep kind of multiracial,

03:08:42.300 --> 03:08:44.860
a deep unity in the 21st century.

03:08:44.860 --> 03:08:46.060
I have that hope.

03:08:46.060 --> 03:08:48.820
And I think that the sentiments

03:08:48.820 --> 03:08:53.820
that Martin Luther King Jr. expressed in August, 1963,

03:08:54.700 --> 03:08:59.700
that represents the best of American life.

03:09:01.940 --> 03:09:05.500
And I think it's a, you know,

03:09:05.500 --> 03:09:08.620
do I want to see that come to pass?

03:09:08.620 --> 03:09:10.500
Yeah, I want to see that come to pass.

03:09:10.500 --> 03:09:13.340
And we'll work to, you know,

03:09:13.340 --> 03:09:17.180
push that project along as far as it'll go.

03:09:17.180 --> 03:09:21.500
Well, thank you for carrying his spirit of optimism forward,

03:09:21.500 --> 03:09:23.700
the spirit of your mother and father.

03:09:23.700 --> 03:09:25.260
Thank you for all the amazing work you've done.

03:09:25.260 --> 03:09:28.020
And thank you for just, this conversation is a huge honor.

03:09:28.020 --> 03:09:29.020
This is awesome. Thank you.

03:09:29.020 --> 03:09:30.260
Really appreciate it. Thank you.

03:09:30.260 --> 03:09:31.100
Thank you, Randall.

03:09:40.580 --> 03:09:42.900
from Martin Luther King Jr.

03:09:42.900 --> 03:09:45.100
Darkness cannot drive out darkness.

03:09:45.100 --> 03:09:47.260
Only light can do that.

03:09:47.260 --> 03:09:49.900
Hate cannot drive out hate.

03:09:49.900 --> 03:09:51.780
Only love can do that.

03:09:52.700 --> 03:09:55.460
