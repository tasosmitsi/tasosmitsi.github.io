00:00.000 --> 00:04.160
you can't have permanent war without fiat.

00:04.160 --> 00:07.560
And I also think there's a case to be made

00:07.560 --> 00:10.360
that you can't really have fiat without war.

00:12.560 --> 00:15.480
The following is a conversation with Safety and Amos,

00:15.480 --> 00:17.840
one of the central and most impactful economists,

00:17.840 --> 00:21.520
philosophers, and educators in the world of Bitcoin.

00:21.520 --> 00:24.440
He's an Austrian economist, an anarchist,

00:24.440 --> 00:26.960
and the author of the Bitcoin Standard

00:26.960 --> 00:29.600
and the new book, The Fiat Standard.

00:29.640 --> 00:33.760
Safety does not mince words in his criticism of economists

00:33.760 --> 00:36.800
and humans in general with whom he disagrees.

00:36.800 --> 00:39.040
For example, Paul Krugman,

00:39.040 --> 00:41.560
who is a neo-Lakensian economist

00:41.560 --> 00:43.640
and a previous guest at this podcast.

00:44.600 --> 00:48.760
Safety's opinions are strong and often controversial.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.760
I do push back in this conversation

00:50.760 --> 00:54.360
playing devil's advocate or trying to steal man each side,

00:54.360 --> 00:57.960
but as always, I do so in the service of exploring

00:58.000 --> 01:00.520
the rich space of ideas that Safety has

01:00.520 --> 01:03.720
about human nature and human civilization.

01:03.720 --> 01:06.760
I trust the intelligence of you, the listener,

01:06.760 --> 01:09.200
to come to your own conclusions.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.640
That is the burden of being a free-thinking human.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.840
It is on each of us individually

01:14.840 --> 01:17.880
to dive into this chaos of ideas

01:17.880 --> 01:19.120
and from that chaos,

01:19.120 --> 01:23.240
discover long-lasting universal wisdom to live by.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.160

01:29.520 --> 01:32.920
And now, dear friends, here's Safety and Amoose.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.760
Let's start with a big question.

01:35.760 --> 01:39.080
What is money and what is the role of money

01:39.080 --> 01:40.720
in the history of human civilization?

01:40.720 --> 01:42.440
Money is a medium of exchange.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.680
The thing that defines money is that it is a good

01:44.680 --> 01:46.840
that you don't buy for its own sake

01:46.840 --> 01:48.480
because you want to consume it itself

01:48.480 --> 01:50.880
or because you want to employ it

01:50.880 --> 01:51.920
in the production of other goods,

01:51.920 --> 01:53.480
which is what capital goods are.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.880
So we have consumption goods, we have capital goods.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.080
Money is distinct from those two

01:58.080 --> 02:00.320
because it is a good that is acquired purely

02:00.320 --> 02:02.480
to be exchanged later on for other goods.

02:02.480 --> 02:05.440
So it's not something that you acquire for its own sake.

02:05.440 --> 02:08.320
You acquire it so that you can then later on exchange it.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.280
And that's a market good.

02:10.280 --> 02:12.640
That's a market good like all other goods.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.680
You acquire food because you eat it,

02:14.680 --> 02:16.720
you acquire a car to move you around,

02:16.720 --> 02:18.480
you acquire money so that you can exchange it

02:18.480 --> 02:20.040
for other goods.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.880
And that's something that many people have a hard time

02:22.880 --> 02:25.600
grasping on the concept of money as a market good,

02:25.920 --> 02:27.880
just like all others.

02:27.880 --> 02:31.440
And the importance of it is that it allows us to trade.

02:31.440 --> 02:35.760
It allows us to develop the division of labor,

02:35.760 --> 02:37.280
which would not be possible

02:37.280 --> 02:39.920
at any kind of sophisticated level without money.

02:39.920 --> 02:44.360
So if we live in a small society of 10 people,

02:44.360 --> 02:46.560
then think about all the things that we can make,

02:46.560 --> 02:48.160
all the things that we can produce.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.800
If we're only 10 people isolated from the world,

02:51.800 --> 02:53.520
there's only very few things that we can make.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.280
And therefore, we can exchange those things

02:56.280 --> 02:57.880
directly with one another.

02:57.880 --> 03:02.680
But if we get in contact with other societies

03:02.680 --> 03:04.160
that have more people,

03:04.160 --> 03:06.920
then the opportunities for specialization increase.

03:06.920 --> 03:07.760
If there's 10 people,

03:07.760 --> 03:10.880
the only thing that you can make is the very basics

03:10.880 --> 03:12.120
you need for your survival.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.680
But if you're part of an economy of 10 million people,

03:15.680 --> 03:17.440
there's much more room for specialization.

03:17.440 --> 03:19.800
You can make a car, you can make a house

03:19.800 --> 03:21.960
that's very sophisticated.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.440
And that relies on the division of labor.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.640
That relies on you specializing

03:26.640 --> 03:28.960
in doing one tiny little thing,

03:28.960 --> 03:30.840
which is not what you consume.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.280
And you trade that thing

03:33.280 --> 03:34.680
for all the things that you consume.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.600
So as the economy becomes more sophisticated

03:37.600 --> 03:38.920
and involves more people,

03:38.920 --> 03:41.240
and currently we're all part of an economy

03:41.240 --> 03:43.680
of almost 8 billion people,

03:43.680 --> 03:46.600
each one of us produces one tiny little thing,

03:46.600 --> 03:48.960
and they exchange that thing

03:48.960 --> 03:50.720
for all the things that they want.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.400
And so because we specialize,

03:52.400 --> 03:53.600
we become more productive

03:53.600 --> 03:55.480
in doing the thing that we're good at.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.960
So there's people out there who are engineers

03:57.960 --> 04:00.000
who are designing windshields in cars.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.680
It's a very specialized thing.

04:01.680 --> 04:05.200
They sell windshield design to Mercedes-Benz.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.480
And then from that,

04:07.480 --> 04:09.600
that windshield design is added on

04:09.600 --> 04:11.520
to millions of cars around the world.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.240
And from that, they're able to get enough money

04:14.240 --> 04:16.040
to meet all of their needs.

04:16.040 --> 04:19.440
So the division of labor is enhanced enormously with money

04:19.440 --> 04:20.840
because without money,

04:20.840 --> 04:23.680
it's very difficult to be able to exchange

04:23.680 --> 04:24.800
a large number of goods.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.280
It's very difficult to have a sophisticated economy

04:27.280 --> 04:29.160
with a large degree of specialization

04:29.160 --> 04:33.560
because it's very difficult to find people

04:33.560 --> 04:36.000
who want the thing that you have

04:36.000 --> 04:37.760
and have the thing that you want.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.640
We call this the coincidence of wants.

04:40.640 --> 04:42.720
And that's really the problem that money solves.

04:42.720 --> 04:46.720
So you make apples and I make oranges.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.400
I'd like to have some of your apples,

04:48.400 --> 04:50.640
but you don't want my oranges.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.240
We have a problem of coincidence of wants.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.080
So what do I do?

04:53.080 --> 04:54.160
You want bananas.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.280
I need to find somebody who has bananas,

04:56.280 --> 04:58.240
give them my oranges, take their bananas,

04:58.240 --> 05:00.880
give you their bananas, and then I take the apples.

05:00.880 --> 05:03.440
In that case, bananas are a medium of exchange.

05:03.440 --> 05:06.400
So it's natural that a medium of exchange will evolve

05:06.400 --> 05:07.840
and will emerge in an economy

05:07.840 --> 05:09.680
as an economy becomes more sophisticated.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.920
As we move beyond 10 people and 10 goods,

05:12.920 --> 05:15.760
it's inevitable that we're going to come to a situation

05:15.760 --> 05:18.440
where we have the problem of coincidence of wants.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.680
And the way to solve that is to use a medium of exchange.

05:21.680 --> 05:22.520
And it can be anything.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.360
It can be a banana.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.920
It can be food, stuff.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.200
It can be any kind of good.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.880
As long as I acquire the good

05:29.880 --> 05:32.560
with the purpose of passing it on to you,

05:32.560 --> 05:35.240
not with the purpose of me consuming it or using it,

05:35.240 --> 05:36.880
then that's a medium of exchange.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.960
So when we look at the entirety of human society

05:39.960 --> 05:42.560
of millions of billions of people,

05:42.640 --> 05:43.520
you think of them,

05:43.520 --> 05:46.520
just a bunch of individuals running around.

05:46.520 --> 05:49.560
I love the term coincidence of wants.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.720
So each one of them, it's like a stochastic system.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.360
They have desires.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.840
It's like a random collection of desires,

05:56.840 --> 05:59.040
somehow rooted in our evolutionary history,

05:59.040 --> 06:01.640
but mostly random in terms of preference

06:01.640 --> 06:04.280
of banana or apple, that kind of thing.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.400
And then they also have the capacity

06:07.400 --> 06:11.920
for competence and excellence in particular kind of labor.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.360
So like a specialization.

06:14.360 --> 06:16.600
They're able to be like incredible

06:16.600 --> 06:18.160
at a particular set of tasks.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.800
So there's a bunch of ants running around

06:20.800 --> 06:23.240
with consciousness and intelligence.

06:23.240 --> 06:26.600
And they have desires and they have capabilities.

06:26.600 --> 06:31.600
And then there's a coincidence of both the wants they have

06:32.880 --> 06:34.560
and the capabilities they have.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.360
And you wanted to create a system

06:36.360 --> 06:39.320
that kind of exchanges those things.

06:39.320 --> 06:44.320
So when you imagine what is a good, what is markets?

06:45.200 --> 06:49.600
When you imagine a market is like a hierarchical system,

06:49.600 --> 06:50.920
what do you imagine?

06:50.920 --> 06:51.960
What is a market?

06:53.000 --> 06:53.960
A market is just the name

06:53.960 --> 06:55.760
for the naturally emergent phenomena

06:55.760 --> 06:58.320
of people voluntarily exchanging things.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.160
It's-

06:59.160 --> 07:00.080
At any scale.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.320
At any scale, yeah.

07:01.320 --> 07:04.640
It could be a market of two people on an island on their own.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.920
It could be 8 billion people across the planet.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.480
Naturally emerging.

07:09.480 --> 07:10.320
Yes.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.480
This is the thing I think that is very hard

07:12.480 --> 07:15.440
for many people who don't have a good understanding

07:15.440 --> 07:18.880
of economics to grasp that capitalism and markets

07:18.880 --> 07:23.480
are not something that you need a central planner

07:23.480 --> 07:26.840
or a government officer to make happen.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.280
Capitalism is just what happens

07:28.280 --> 07:30.040
when people are left to their own devices.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.640
And it's just our cognitive capacity allows us

07:32.640 --> 07:36.240
to develop tools that we can use for production.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.920
And that's what we do.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.880
That's what humans have been doing since they started

07:40.880 --> 07:42.160
making spears to hunt.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.240
That's the first capital good probably.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.240
So we're constantly accumulating capital.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.720
We're constantly trading with one another.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.400
We find an opportunity.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.560
You've got a lot of oranges.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.520
I've got a lot of apples.

07:52.520 --> 07:53.840
Then I'll take some of yours.

07:53.840 --> 07:54.680
You'll take some of mine.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.040
We're both better off.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.920
This is just the naturally emergent thing.

07:58.920 --> 08:03.080
And money is what makes it enormously powerful.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.320
Money is what allows it to scale really.

08:05.360 --> 08:09.280
Money is what allows it to go beyond small societies

08:09.280 --> 08:11.360
into just something that is global.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.960
Because with money, again, as I was saying earlier,

08:14.960 --> 08:17.120
all you need to do is specialize in doing one thing,

08:17.120 --> 08:18.360
the thing that you do best.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.720
And then you exchange that for money

08:19.720 --> 08:21.640
and you don't have to worry about

08:21.640 --> 08:24.360
whether the other people involved in this

08:24.360 --> 08:26.640
want what you have and have what you want.

08:26.640 --> 08:30.040
You just sell it for money to whoever wants it.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.880
And you buy whatever you want from whoever has it.

08:32.880 --> 08:37.240
And that's an enormous reduction in the mental burden

08:37.240 --> 08:39.480
of how a market economy functions.

08:39.480 --> 08:40.920
So the first thing that I would say about money

08:40.920 --> 08:43.160
is that it allows for the division of labor

08:43.160 --> 08:45.400
and it allows for the market system to grow.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.000
And the second thing is that money is a mechanism

08:48.000 --> 08:50.600
for storing value into the future.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.760
So again, as humans, we develop the capacity

08:53.760 --> 08:55.840
to think for the future.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.640
We make a spear so that we can hunt

08:58.640 --> 09:00.360
and then we see that it works.

09:00.360 --> 09:01.640
And then we take it out of the animal

09:01.640 --> 09:03.840
that we hunted it with and we keep it

09:03.840 --> 09:05.600
for the next day's hunt.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.120
And then we start making a better spear

09:07.120 --> 09:08.480
and we make a better fishing rod

09:08.480 --> 09:09.720
and then we make a fishing net

09:09.720 --> 09:11.360
and then we make a fishing boat.

09:11.360 --> 09:15.200
And that's our ability to think of the future.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.000
And as we start building durable goods,

09:18.000 --> 09:19.840
we start thinking more and more of the future,

09:19.840 --> 09:22.960
we start becoming more and more future oriented.

09:22.960 --> 09:26.560
And that's really the process of civilization,

09:26.560 --> 09:29.480
the process of denying our needs now

09:29.480 --> 09:31.160
in order to think for the future.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.760
So instead of spending all of our day on the beach,

09:33.760 --> 09:38.080
enjoying ourselves, we take time off from leisure

09:38.080 --> 09:42.520
on the beach and spend some time making a spear

09:42.520 --> 09:45.320
or making a fishing rod so that our productivity

09:45.320 --> 09:48.120
in hunting or fishing tomorrow is gonna be higher.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.840
And so that ability to think for the future

09:51.840 --> 09:54.680
is enhanced by our ability to provide for the future.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.840
And we do that with durable goods.

09:56.840 --> 10:00.760
But then money ends up being the best mechanism

10:00.760 --> 10:02.160
for providing for the future

10:02.160 --> 10:04.440
because the future is uncertain.

10:04.440 --> 10:07.960
So you can save your apples and oranges,

10:07.960 --> 10:09.600
you can save the spears,

10:09.600 --> 10:12.120
you can save the animal that you hunted.

10:12.120 --> 10:15.240
But these things, first they rot,

10:15.240 --> 10:17.600
they're not very good at holding on to their value over time.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.160
But even if they were,

10:19.160 --> 10:22.440
even if you have objects that are durable,

10:22.440 --> 10:24.400
the problem with them is that you don't know

10:24.400 --> 10:28.200
if you need them tomorrow or next month or next year.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.320
You're not sure if you're going to be needing them.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.920
And you might end up not needing them.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.960
And you might end up not finding anybody who needs them

10:33.960 --> 10:35.200
or finding somebody who needs them

10:35.200 --> 10:36.440
but doesn't value them much

10:36.440 --> 10:38.360
and won't give you much in exchange.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.040
Money allows you the optionality

10:40.040 --> 10:43.760
of saving the most liquid good, the most saleable good.

10:43.760 --> 10:46.000
So it's something that you can sell tomorrow

10:46.000 --> 10:47.720
with the least uncertainty.

10:47.720 --> 10:49.400
It has the most liquidity, the most ability

10:49.400 --> 10:52.520
to be sold without a loss in its value.

10:52.520 --> 10:55.480
So money is our most advanced technology

10:55.480 --> 10:58.480
and our best technology for moving value into the future.

10:58.480 --> 11:01.360
And so I think history really,

11:01.360 --> 11:03.680
I argue this in all my books,

11:03.680 --> 11:06.440
is that really history we see,

11:06.440 --> 11:10.640
we can think of it as a process of our money gets harder.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.800
And so our money gets better at holding

11:13.800 --> 11:16.040
onto its value for the future.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.560
And by harder, I mean harder to produce.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.760
We find things that are hard to produce

11:20.760 --> 11:23.080
that are better at holding onto their value.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.400
So they hold onto their value better for the future.

11:25.400 --> 11:28.320
And that allows us to plot and plan for the future

11:29.160 --> 11:31.200
that makes the future less uncertain

11:31.200 --> 11:34.000
and that makes us more future oriented.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.640
In other words, it lowers our time preference.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.840
And the harder the money is,

11:38.840 --> 11:41.520
the better it is allowing us to think of the future.

11:41.520 --> 11:44.680
So people should know that you've written

11:44.680 --> 11:48.800
the book Bitcoin Standard from 2018, I believe.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.240
And then a new book called Fiat Standard.

11:52.120 --> 11:55.440
The Bitcoin Standard is considered kind of the Bible

11:55.440 --> 11:57.800
in the cryptocurrency space and the Bitcoin space

11:58.680 --> 12:01.760
is just a very rigorous systematic explanation

12:01.760 --> 12:06.400
of why Bitcoin, what is it, why should it be,

12:06.400 --> 12:07.480
why is it good?

12:07.480 --> 12:10.800
So you're describing in that book and in the new book,

12:10.800 --> 12:13.640
different implementations of the technology of money.

12:14.480 --> 12:17.560
In the new book, you talk about fiat money,

12:17.560 --> 12:19.520
which is another way to do money.

12:19.520 --> 12:22.640
So obviously there's a lot of different ways to do money.

12:22.640 --> 12:25.720
And maybe we haven't discovered the best way to do money yet.

12:25.720 --> 12:27.720
Our conversation today is how to do money

12:28.680 --> 12:30.160
and how to do money better.

12:31.040 --> 12:33.640
Maybe we'll go back to bananas eventually.

12:33.640 --> 12:34.480
Right?

12:34.480 --> 12:36.480
Very good reasons why we won't.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.560
Well, we can disagree.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.800
We can agree to disagree on this.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.800
I'm open-minded to the bananas.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.640
They're one of the biggest source of joy to me

12:45.640 --> 12:49.440
when I first came to this country is eating bananas.

12:49.440 --> 12:54.280
And so maybe money, happiness,

12:54.840 --> 12:58.440
will eventually become the best medium of exchange.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.280
I don't know.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.120
Open-minded.

13:00.120 --> 13:03.200
Anyway, so you mentioned hard money and soft money.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.520
So there's different ways to do money.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.600
What is hard money?

13:06.600 --> 13:08.400
What is soft money?

13:08.400 --> 13:10.400
In the Bitcoin standard, I present the argument

13:10.400 --> 13:14.840
that money is always whatever is the hardest thing to make.

13:14.840 --> 13:17.480
Historically, I think we see many examples of that.

13:17.480 --> 13:20.120
So for instance, in prison, people use cigarettes as money

13:20.120 --> 13:22.360
because nobody can make cigarettes in prison.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.240
In societies, we have the example of Yap Island,

13:25.240 --> 13:26.080
for instance.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.040
It's an island that doesn't have any limestone,

13:28.040 --> 13:31.360
but there's a nearby island that has a lot of limestone.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.600
And it's very expensive, obviously,

13:33.600 --> 13:35.600
with primitive technology to move limestone

13:35.600 --> 13:38.160
from Palau to Yap.

13:38.160 --> 13:41.600
So on Yap, limestones were money.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.000
Seashells, rare seashells that are not easy to find

13:44.000 --> 13:48.200
end up serving as money in places where they're rare.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.720
Glass beads were money in West Africa

13:50.720 --> 13:52.720
where there was no glass making technology

13:52.720 --> 13:54.680
because they were imported from abroad

13:54.680 --> 13:57.200
and they were very hard to make.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.360
And I think there's a conscious effort

13:59.360 --> 14:02.240
of some people might recognize the hardness

14:02.240 --> 14:04.480
and the scarcity and choose this as money.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.800
But I think what's more important is just

14:06.800 --> 14:10.440
a natural evolutionary process whereby people choose

14:10.440 --> 14:14.560
all kinds of random things as money, bananas maybe even.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.320
But then the people who end up making these bad choices

14:17.320 --> 14:18.920
don't end up with any wealth left.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.320
Whereas the people who store their wealth

14:21.320 --> 14:24.040
in the things that are hard to make

14:24.040 --> 14:26.880
end up acquiring, end up maintaining their wealth

14:26.880 --> 14:29.120
and maybe even increasing it over time.

14:29.120 --> 14:32.000
And of course, this culminated in the 19th century,

14:32.000 --> 14:33.160
in the end of the 19th century,

14:33.160 --> 14:36.920
by basically the entire planet being on a gold standard.

14:36.920 --> 14:37.760
And that-

14:37.760 --> 14:38.640
What is a gold standard?

14:38.640 --> 14:41.800
The gold standard is basically when money is gold,

14:41.800 --> 14:44.720
or at least government currencies backed by gold.

14:44.720 --> 14:47.600
But the reason gold became money and not copper,

14:47.600 --> 14:49.120
not nickel, not bananas,

14:49.120 --> 14:52.160
is that gold is the hardest metal in the world.

14:52.160 --> 14:55.920
And it is the hardest metal to increase the supply of.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.000
And the reason for that is based in chemistry.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.080
So gold is indestructible.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.680
You can't destroy gold in any meaningful sense.

15:03.680 --> 15:08.680
It's been accumulating stockpiles for thousands of years.

15:08.680 --> 15:12.400
The gold that was worn by Nefertiti back in ancient Egypt

15:12.400 --> 15:16.040
is today probably in somebody's necklace

15:16.040 --> 15:17.160
or in somebody's gold coin.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.000
It's still there.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.040
So for thousands of years, humans have been digging for gold.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.240
They dig it out of the ground, they refine it,

15:23.240 --> 15:25.880
and then they put it in a jewelry or a coin,

15:25.880 --> 15:27.440
and then it just stays there.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.880
It gets melted down into new other forms.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.520
The jewelry gets turned into coins

15:31.520 --> 15:33.200
or coins get turned into bars.

15:34.240 --> 15:38.560
But it's just stockpiles that are accumulating.

15:38.560 --> 15:41.080
On the other hand, every year,

15:41.080 --> 15:43.920
we get better at our technology of looking for gold.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.400
There's more people all over the world.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.880
The population increases, the technology improves.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.960
So we keep finding more and more gold,

15:49.960 --> 15:52.080
and we keep making the stockpiles bigger.

15:52.080 --> 15:55.240
However, because we're constantly adding to a stockpile

15:55.240 --> 15:57.920
that is not being devalued, sorry,

15:57.920 --> 15:59.280
that is not being consumed

15:59.280 --> 16:00.640
because there's no way of consuming gold.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.640
You can't eat it, you can't burn it,

16:03.640 --> 16:04.800
it doesn't rust.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.320
Because of that, we're constantly adding

16:07.320 --> 16:08.920
to a constantly growing stockpile.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.000
So if you look at the numbers,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.240
you see over the last 100 years,

16:13.240 --> 16:14.640
you've got pretty reliable data

16:14.640 --> 16:16.360
on gold production worldwide.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.760
We see that pretty much gold stockpiles

16:18.760 --> 16:22.480
increase at around one and a half to 2% per year, every year.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.200
So yes, we're making more every year,

16:25.200 --> 16:28.080
but we're making more so we're adding to the stockpile,

16:28.080 --> 16:29.200
the stockpile grows more.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.560
So every year we're adding only around one and a half

16:31.560 --> 16:32.400
to 2%.

16:33.840 --> 16:38.080
Compare that to the second hardest metal historically

16:38.080 --> 16:40.960
was silver, and that increased historically

16:40.960 --> 16:43.760
at around maybe 5% per year or so.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.920
Now it probably increases something like closer to 30%

16:46.920 --> 16:49.240
because it's now getting used extensively

16:49.240 --> 16:50.920
in industrial uses.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.960
So when you use it in industry,

16:53.960 --> 16:56.520
when you put silver in a laptop or in a camera

16:56.520 --> 16:59.600
or in a machine, effectively,

16:59.600 --> 17:01.120
you are consuming the stockpile

17:01.120 --> 17:02.680
because it's not used as money,

17:02.680 --> 17:05.000
it's taken out of the monetary stockpile.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.400
So over the last 150 years, since 1870 in particular,

17:08.400 --> 17:12.000
and I discuss this in detail in the Bitcoin standard,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.640
what happened in 1870 was Germany won

17:14.640 --> 17:16.480
the Franco-Prussian war,

17:16.480 --> 17:19.000
and Germany was on a silver standard,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.200
but the value of silvers was declining.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.680
So Germany did something very smart,

17:22.680 --> 17:27.080
which is they took their indemnity from France in silver,

17:27.080 --> 17:30.520
in gold, and used that big chunk of gold

17:30.520 --> 17:33.080
to switch to going on a gold standard.

17:33.080 --> 17:36.760
And since then, silver has been collapsing in value

17:36.760 --> 17:37.600
next to gold.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.160
So back then, the price of an ounce of gold

17:40.160 --> 17:42.160
was around 15 ounces of silver.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.480
Today, it's closer to 100.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.600
It's just been declining for the last 150 years.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.520
And so because of that,

17:47.520 --> 17:50.760
because of the fact that it's lost its monetary role

17:50.760 --> 17:52.920
as people shifted toward gold,

17:52.920 --> 17:54.600
the value of silver went down,

17:54.600 --> 17:56.200
and so it became economical to use it

17:56.200 --> 17:58.320
in more and more industrial applications.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.360
So the stockpile declines,

18:00.360 --> 18:01.920
and then as a result,

18:01.920 --> 18:05.240
that weakens its monetary properties

18:05.240 --> 18:06.800
more and more and more.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.600
So that's why by the end of the 19th century,

18:09.600 --> 18:10.920
I mean, at the beginning of the 19th century,

18:10.920 --> 18:12.200
gold and silver were money.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.480
By the end, it was basically only gold.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.880
And the countries that were still on a silver standard,

18:16.880 --> 18:18.480
China and India in particular,

18:18.480 --> 18:19.760
suffered enormously from it

18:19.760 --> 18:23.640
because their money was devaluing very quickly next to gold.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.920
And so Europeans who would come to China or India

18:26.920 --> 18:30.360
were able to buy things at practically a big discount.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.840
So I hope it's okay if I ask

18:32.840 --> 18:34.640
very simple, very basic questions.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.720
There's few people in this world that are good,

18:37.720 --> 18:41.200
as good as you are at answering very basic,

18:41.200 --> 18:42.960
almost ridiculously basic questions.

18:42.960 --> 18:46.000
Because I think exploring questions like what is money

18:46.000 --> 18:49.120
is a really great way to think from first principles,

18:49.120 --> 18:50.800
to really think deeply about this world.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.680
So I really appreciate you doing that.

18:52.680 --> 18:55.600
When you say standard, what does it mean?

18:55.600 --> 18:57.600
When you say silver standard, gold standard,

18:57.600 --> 18:59.960
again, with the basic question.

18:59.960 --> 19:03.640
The term really, I think, was based out of gold.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.280
The first time this came out was the gold standard.

19:06.280 --> 19:09.280
Because, so I said gold was money

19:09.280 --> 19:11.000
at the end of the 19th century.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.560
But it wasn't just that everybody was using gold coins

19:13.560 --> 19:15.080
and trading with gold coins,

19:15.080 --> 19:19.360
because that's got a problem of divisibility.

19:19.360 --> 19:23.440
So a lot of things are worth less than one gold coin.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.200
So how do you buy that thing?

19:25.200 --> 19:28.120
And the answer was that you created monetary instruments

19:28.120 --> 19:30.200
that were backed by gold.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.640
And so currencies, national currencies

19:32.640 --> 19:36.800
under the gold standard, were specific units of gold.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.000
And that's how a gold standard functioned.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
Money was gold, but you had pieces of paper

19:42.000 --> 19:43.920
that were redeemable in gold.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.120
So you could go to the central bank,

19:45.120 --> 19:46.960
you could give them the piece of paper,

19:46.960 --> 19:49.160
the $100 bill or the $10 bill,

19:49.160 --> 19:51.000
and they'll give you gold in exchange.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.760
And they give you a specific quantity of gold in exchange.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.240
Effectively, the paper was just a receipt for gold.

19:56.240 --> 19:59.480
So the paper exactly represented the amount of gold.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.480
Exactly, that was the plan.

20:01.480 --> 20:03.200
That was what it's supposed to do.

20:03.200 --> 20:07.280
But arguably, we never had a pure gold standard,

20:07.280 --> 20:09.240
because the nature of gold means

20:09.240 --> 20:12.040
that the people who are in charge of the gold,

20:12.040 --> 20:13.520
they have an enormous amount of power,

20:13.520 --> 20:15.160
because the gold is concentrated with them.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.840
And as long as not everybody shows up at the same time

20:17.840 --> 20:18.880
asking for their gold,

20:18.880 --> 20:20.880
then you can make more receipts than you have gold.

20:20.880 --> 20:21.720
And this has been-

20:21.720 --> 20:24.200
So there's always shady stuff going on,

20:24.200 --> 20:26.160
but at least that's the state of goal,

20:26.160 --> 20:28.360
is the receipt should exactly represent

20:28.400 --> 20:29.880
the amount of gold there.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.760
And also when you say standard,

20:31.760 --> 20:34.920
it means that governments

20:36.760 --> 20:40.520
sort of publicly stated that this is the approved,

20:40.520 --> 20:44.080
the main way of making transactions that are monetary.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.160
So this is the money,

20:45.160 --> 20:47.640
this is the official money that you should be using

20:47.640 --> 20:48.800
if you live in this country.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.560
Yes, although I would say

20:50.560 --> 20:52.000
it's more like the other way around.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.440
It's not that the governments established gold as money.

20:55.480 --> 21:00.080
It's more like gold gave the governments

21:00.080 --> 21:01.960
the credibility for their currencies.

21:01.960 --> 21:06.360
So governments were not the ones that made gold money.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.560
Gold has been money before states were invented.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.280
States, if you have a government

21:12.280 --> 21:14.240
and you'd like to have some legitimacy

21:14.240 --> 21:16.680
and you'd like to be able to deal with other governments

21:16.680 --> 21:18.080
on an equal footing,

21:18.080 --> 21:19.840
you had to go by the gold standard.

21:19.840 --> 21:22.520
You had to have a currency that was redeemable in gold

21:22.520 --> 21:24.200
so that you could trade with the rest of the world

21:24.200 --> 21:28.200
so that people could in your country use that currency.

21:28.200 --> 21:32.160
So it's not that governments were choosing gold.

21:32.160 --> 21:35.520
It's more like they were having to adapt

21:35.520 --> 21:37.800
their own currencies to gold

21:37.800 --> 21:39.440
in order to give their currencies credibility.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.040
So there's a dance there though,

21:41.040 --> 21:43.640
because if they had to,

21:43.640 --> 21:46.560
then why did they switch away from it after?

21:46.560 --> 21:49.680
So there is a dance where the governments,

21:49.680 --> 21:52.160
the people pressure.

21:52.160 --> 21:56.080
So first of all, the basic characteristics

21:56.080 --> 22:00.920
of the hard money pressures the governments and the people

22:00.920 --> 22:02.760
in terms of what should be used.

22:02.760 --> 22:05.240
Then the people, based on their community,

22:05.240 --> 22:09.280
the network effects, the narratives they tell each other,

22:09.280 --> 22:10.440
all that kind of stuff,

22:10.440 --> 22:12.440
they pressure the governments

22:12.440 --> 22:14.120
to take on a particular money.

22:14.120 --> 22:18.000
Then the governments, they like power,

22:18.000 --> 22:19.760
they like control, all those kinds of things.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.160
They pressure the people

22:21.160 --> 22:22.320
to tell different kinds of narratives.

22:22.320 --> 22:24.920
So there's a dance going on in this evolution

22:24.920 --> 22:27.400
of what technology to use for a monetary system.

22:27.400 --> 22:32.400
So the reason I don't know if governments had to,

22:32.400 --> 22:34.240
because they clearly didn't have to

22:34.240 --> 22:37.400
because they eventually moved away from it.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.040
But there was pressure probably.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.320
Yeah, but even after they moved away from it,

22:41.320 --> 22:42.520
central banks until today,

22:42.520 --> 22:45.000
they still hold a lot of gold reserves.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.440
In fact, if you look at 1914,

22:47.440 --> 22:50.960
when the world really went off the gold standard,

22:51.760 --> 22:53.720
the amount of gold reserves held by central banks

22:53.720 --> 22:55.720
was a tiny fraction of what it was.

22:55.720 --> 22:57.440
As time went on,

22:57.440 --> 22:59.840
central banks accumulated more and more gold.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.160
What ended up happening is they prevented their citizens

23:02.160 --> 23:04.240
from using the gold, but they continued to use it.

23:04.240 --> 23:07.560
So gold continued to be money up until 1971

23:07.560 --> 23:10.800
because effectively the world was on a dollar standard

23:10.800 --> 23:12.960
and the dollars were backed by gold.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.600
But then after 1971, even then,

23:15.600 --> 23:17.280
central banks continued to accumulate gold

23:17.280 --> 23:20.000
because why would you as a central bank

23:20.000 --> 23:22.520
want to accumulate pieces of paper effectively

23:22.520 --> 23:25.200
or credit liabilities of another central bank

23:25.200 --> 23:27.920
that can produce them infinitely?

23:27.920 --> 23:31.760
And it's a lesson that's becoming more and more obvious

23:31.760 --> 23:35.040
to governments today as we see US sanctions

23:35.040 --> 23:37.920
taking say Russian reserves or Afghanistan reserves.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.840
And this is why we see China and Russia

23:40.840 --> 23:44.040
have accumulated a lot of gold over the last 10, 20 years.

23:44.040 --> 23:48.400
So just to return to the question of definitions.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.960
So what is hard money versus soft money?

23:50.960 --> 23:54.080
Yes, so hard, I mean, it's a relative thing,

23:54.080 --> 23:56.480
but the hardness refers to the difficulty

23:56.480 --> 23:59.440
of producing more units of the money supply.

23:59.440 --> 24:01.600
So an easy money would be a money

24:01.600 --> 24:04.400
that is relatively easy to make.

24:04.400 --> 24:08.760
So you can increase the supply by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50%

24:08.760 --> 24:09.600
or something like that.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.600
So pretty much all commodities, all market commodities

24:12.600 --> 24:15.480
other than gold and silver, they're easy money

24:15.520 --> 24:18.880
and they're not suitable as a monetary medium

24:18.880 --> 24:20.160
because they're being consumed.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.320
So if you look at, and in the Bitcoin standard,

24:22.320 --> 24:25.040
I mentioned this metric called the stock to flow ratio,

24:25.040 --> 24:28.840
which is the ratio of the annual production, the flow

24:28.840 --> 24:31.480
to the stockpile, the existing stockpile.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.200
If you look at all the other metals, they're easy money

24:34.200 --> 24:36.160
because they're being consumed.

24:36.160 --> 24:38.320
So think about how much stockpiles of copper

24:38.320 --> 24:40.120
there are in the world today.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.920
So copper companies obviously have

24:41.920 --> 24:43.960
some stockpiles of copper.

24:43.960 --> 24:47.040
Major copper consumers will have stockpiles of copper,

24:47.040 --> 24:49.840
but the vast majority of copper is essentially

24:49.840 --> 24:54.440
on a conveyor belt of production from the mine

24:54.440 --> 24:58.440
straight to the consumer good that it's being used for.

24:58.440 --> 25:02.720
So the existing stockpiles are roughly in the range

25:02.720 --> 25:04.880
of one year's production.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.760
If you take all of the companies,

25:06.760 --> 25:09.240
I don't have exact statistics.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.040
It's very difficult to get these, but you know,

25:11.040 --> 25:12.720
it's roughly in the same range.

25:12.720 --> 25:17.240
Like if copper production were to stop completely today,

25:17.240 --> 25:19.480
we'll have about a year's production

25:19.480 --> 25:22.000
stored in various places.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.720
So that makes copper terrible money,

25:24.720 --> 25:27.480
because if you started using copper as money,

25:27.480 --> 25:28.880
and this is why a lot of people say,

25:28.880 --> 25:30.680
well, money is a collective illusion,

25:30.680 --> 25:34.240
money is a social construct.

25:34.240 --> 25:35.960
If we all agree that something is money,

25:35.960 --> 25:36.800
then something is money.

25:36.800 --> 25:37.880
I think this is completely clueless,

25:37.880 --> 25:39.760
and it's usually Marxists who believe this,

25:39.760 --> 25:42.280
so obviously no understanding of economics.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.360
It's completely clueless,

25:43.360 --> 25:46.160
because even if everybody in society decided

25:46.160 --> 25:47.880
we wanted to make copper as money,

25:47.880 --> 25:50.960
even if we all decided to collectively take part

25:50.960 --> 25:53.320
in this hallucination or illusion,

25:53.320 --> 25:54.960
it would not make copper money.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.240
It would just make everybody who decides to take part

25:57.240 --> 25:58.800
in this hallucination poor.

25:58.800 --> 25:59.620
That's it.

25:59.620 --> 26:01.040
It would make copper miners rich.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.080
It would make all of the people who chose copper

26:03.080 --> 26:05.640
as money poor, and copper would not be money.

26:05.640 --> 26:07.720
It can't work, because what happens is,

26:07.720 --> 26:10.280
because of the fact that the stockpiles are so small,

26:11.280 --> 26:14.120
even if you get the 1,000 richest people in the world,

26:14.120 --> 26:16.240
all of the world's billionaires,

26:16.240 --> 26:18.640
they get together and they all dump

26:18.640 --> 26:19.680
all of the money that they have,

26:19.680 --> 26:22.520
all the stocks, all the bonds, all the gold,

26:22.520 --> 26:24.440
all of the bitcoin, everything that they own,

26:24.440 --> 26:27.480
they dump it and they buy copper with it.

26:27.480 --> 26:28.320
What's gonna happen?

26:28.320 --> 26:30.800
Price of copper is gonna go up a lot,

26:30.800 --> 26:33.000
but what's gonna stop copper miners

26:33.000 --> 26:35.960
from flooding the market with even more copper

26:35.960 --> 26:37.760
than what the billionaires bought?

26:37.760 --> 26:38.600
Nothing.

26:38.600 --> 26:41.880
They're gonna dump all of that extra copper production.

26:41.880 --> 26:43.040
If the price of copper is gonna go up,

26:43.040 --> 26:45.680
so there will be a lot more copper mining

26:45.680 --> 26:47.120
than all the other metals,

26:47.120 --> 26:51.120
a lot of nickel companies and gold miners

26:51.120 --> 26:53.520
are gonna switch to focusing on copper,

26:53.520 --> 26:55.680
and then we're gonna dump an enormous amount

26:55.680 --> 26:57.040
of copper on the market.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.020
The value of copper is gonna crash,

26:59.020 --> 27:01.600
and the people who chose copper as money

27:01.600 --> 27:03.800
are just gonna end up with large warehouses

27:03.800 --> 27:06.500
of very cheap rusting metal.

27:06.540 --> 27:07.980
So that's a brilliant description,

27:07.980 --> 27:09.960
and that kind of pushes towards gold,

27:09.960 --> 27:13.300
where the stock to flow ratio,

27:13.300 --> 27:15.620
I guess you would say is 1.5 to 2%,

27:15.620 --> 27:16.780
like you mentioned earlier.

27:16.780 --> 27:18.780
Well, that would be like the inverse of the stock to flow.

27:18.780 --> 27:20.020
That's the supply growth rate,

27:20.020 --> 27:21.340
so the stock to flow is the inverse.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.620
It's around 60.

27:22.620 --> 27:23.780
60, got it.

27:23.780 --> 27:26.060
But let me push back on,

27:26.060 --> 27:27.900
as somebody who likes human psychology,

27:27.900 --> 27:31.020
let me push back on the collective hallucination

27:31.020 --> 27:32.180
and the illusion.

27:32.180 --> 27:35.940
So that's for copper, but what about paper money?

27:37.340 --> 27:42.340
That's not, you can't smoke it, you can't eat it.

27:42.420 --> 27:44.860
It's supposed to represent,

27:44.860 --> 27:47.060
it's supposed to just be the medium of exchange,

27:47.060 --> 27:50.120
and in that sense,

27:50.120 --> 27:54.620
what role does collective hallucination play

27:54.620 --> 27:56.060
in the effectiveness of money?

27:56.060 --> 27:59.100
Exactly zero, because all of the paper money,

27:59.100 --> 28:00.940
first of all, there's never been an instance,

28:00.940 --> 28:04.820
and again, this flies in the face

28:05.100 --> 28:08.180
of a lot of what a lot of people like to think about money.

28:08.180 --> 28:09.420
There's never been an instance

28:09.420 --> 28:11.940
where a government came out and said,

28:11.940 --> 28:13.700
all right, we're printing out these pieces of paper,

28:13.700 --> 28:14.540
use them as money.

28:14.540 --> 28:19.020
This one is worth 10 apples or use it for buying things,

28:19.020 --> 28:19.860
and here's the piece of paper.

28:19.860 --> 28:21.340
This has never happened.

28:21.340 --> 28:26.340
They've always taken fiat money, paper money,

28:26.620 --> 28:30.660
all of these things were always born out of fraud.

28:30.660 --> 28:32.700
Initially, it was a receipt for gold,

28:32.740 --> 28:34.860
and then they told you, well, you know,

28:34.860 --> 28:36.940
you don't need the gold anyway, and you have to use this,

28:36.940 --> 28:39.460
and then if you don't use it, we throw you in jail.

28:39.460 --> 28:44.380
And then, so first of all, you can't enforce this thing,

28:44.380 --> 28:45.700
so it's never really just happened,

28:45.700 --> 28:48.360
and it's never been hallucinated into existence.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.120
People can hallucinate this kind of nonsense

28:50.120 --> 28:54.380
in writing textbooks and books and in academia,

28:54.380 --> 28:57.580
but in the real world, people don't hallucinate money.

28:57.580 --> 29:00.180
People are very careful about what they put their money in.

29:00.180 --> 29:01.560
For people listening,

29:01.560 --> 29:03.120
we're gonna have fun in this conversation,

29:03.120 --> 29:08.120
because you already said Marxist, fraud, hallucination,

29:08.380 --> 29:11.560
just because we use these words doesn't mean they're true,

29:11.560 --> 29:12.920
but they're fun to talk about.

29:12.920 --> 29:17.260
So you have a strong certainty about the way you talk,

29:17.260 --> 29:20.120
which I think is fun.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.440
But allow me in my dumb self to push back,

29:22.440 --> 29:24.800
to play devil's advocate, and I'll actually ask you

29:24.800 --> 29:27.200
sometimes to play devil's advocate if possible,

29:27.200 --> 29:28.920
because you're smarter than me on all this stuff,

29:28.920 --> 29:33.560
so we want the smartest devil's advocate possible,

29:33.560 --> 29:35.000
and I'm certainly not that.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
But anyway, so, but nevertheless,

29:37.000 --> 29:41.480
we are currently on a fiat standard,

29:41.480 --> 29:46.480
so money does have value, paper money,

29:50.480 --> 29:52.800
and the reason it has value is because we believe

29:52.800 --> 29:53.800
it has value.

29:53.800 --> 29:57.800
To what degree, if we put the hallucination word aside,

29:57.800 --> 30:01.260
the belief that something is worth value

30:01.260 --> 30:06.120
is actually value and is the thing that helps money work.

30:06.120 --> 30:09.260
Because you're saying it's fraud,

30:09.260 --> 30:13.800
and the belief is almost valueless,

30:13.800 --> 30:16.320
but how much value, can we quantify the value

30:16.320 --> 30:18.480
of the belief, the collective belief?

30:18.480 --> 30:21.680
I should say, all economics is subjective.

30:21.680 --> 30:24.200
I consider myself an Austrian school economist,

30:24.200 --> 30:26.780
and the starting point of all Austrian economics

30:26.780 --> 30:28.940
is that all value is subjective.

30:28.940 --> 30:33.340
So, obviously, value only exists

30:33.340 --> 30:35.940
because humans choose to make the valuation.

30:35.940 --> 30:40.060
However, the economic reality of the way that money works

30:40.060 --> 30:42.680
means that it's just a technology, like all others.

30:42.680 --> 30:45.100
And so, for me, when people say,

30:45.100 --> 30:47.260
well, if we hallucinate that this thing can be money,

30:47.260 --> 30:48.260
then it'll be money.

30:48.260 --> 30:49.940
If we can hallucinate bananas to be money,

30:49.940 --> 30:50.900
then it'll be money.

30:50.900 --> 30:52.420
For me, it's like saying, well, if we hallucinate

30:52.420 --> 30:54.980
that bananas can be spaceships, they'll be spaceships.

30:54.980 --> 30:56.980
I mean, you can call them spaceships if you want,

30:56.980 --> 30:59.740
but a banana's not gonna get you to the moon.

30:59.740 --> 31:03.100
Well, then, nevertheless, that's true.

31:03.100 --> 31:05.100
So, you're drawing a big distinction

31:05.100 --> 31:09.380
between physical reality and the space of belief,

31:09.380 --> 31:14.380
but it seems like so much power of human civilization,

31:14.620 --> 31:18.060
so much destruction, so much creativity,

31:18.060 --> 31:21.500
creation happens in our minds.

31:21.500 --> 31:22.340
Absolutely.

31:22.340 --> 31:23.580
Everything does happen in the mind.

31:23.580 --> 31:24.980
You're not gonna get to the moon,

31:24.980 --> 31:27.620
but you might still have a significant impact

31:27.620 --> 31:31.580
on human civilization if a lot of people believe a thing.

31:31.580 --> 31:35.460
True, but economic reality exists in a way

31:35.460 --> 31:37.980
in which your beliefs are rewarded

31:37.980 --> 31:40.660
when they match up with economic reality,

31:40.660 --> 31:41.940
and they're punished when they don't.

31:41.940 --> 31:44.780
So, if you ride a banana and jump off a cliff

31:44.780 --> 31:47.020
thinking you're gonna get to the moon,

31:47.020 --> 31:48.660
that solves the problem of people thinking

31:48.660 --> 31:50.660
that bananas are spaceships by killing people

31:50.660 --> 31:53.060
who think that bananas are spaceships.

31:53.220 --> 31:55.060
And I think, to go back to your question

31:55.060 --> 31:56.460
in terms of paper money,

31:56.460 --> 32:01.420
so, yes, even though ignoring the original sin

32:01.420 --> 32:03.020
of the creation of fiat money

32:03.020 --> 32:05.460
and ignoring everything that happened before 1971,

32:05.460 --> 32:07.060
all right, well, here we are.

32:07.060 --> 32:09.380
People are using, well, it's not really paper money.

32:09.380 --> 32:12.820
We should say fiat money is predominantly credit.

32:12.820 --> 32:15.060
So, it's also a digital currency.

32:15.060 --> 32:18.820
So, more than 90% of dollars are digital.

32:18.820 --> 32:21.420
Less than 10% of dollars are physical.

32:21.420 --> 32:22.780
So, it is a digital currency,

32:23.380 --> 32:24.740
and all over the world, all these governments

32:24.740 --> 32:26.460
are using digital currencies effectively

32:26.460 --> 32:29.500
with some physical manifestations in paper.

32:29.500 --> 32:32.420
But yet, even within these currencies,

32:32.420 --> 32:33.780
it's still the same analysis,

32:33.780 --> 32:35.140
and I discussed this in chapter four

32:35.140 --> 32:36.300
of the Bitcoin standard.

32:36.300 --> 32:37.740
You look at government monies,

32:37.740 --> 32:38.780
you see that the currencies

32:38.780 --> 32:40.180
that have held onto their value,

32:40.180 --> 32:42.220
the ones that have the biggest value,

32:42.220 --> 32:44.700
the ones that play the biggest role in global trade,

32:44.700 --> 32:46.940
the ones that are used as currency reserves

32:46.940 --> 32:48.140
all over the world,

32:48.140 --> 32:50.900
are the ones that have the lowest supply growth rate.

32:50.900 --> 32:53.460
The ones that grow, whose central banks

32:53.460 --> 32:55.420
are the least inflationary.

32:55.420 --> 32:56.460
And on the other hand,

32:56.460 --> 32:58.940
the ones whose supply is more inflationary,

32:58.940 --> 33:00.940
similar to copper, end up failing.

33:00.940 --> 33:03.500
You look at Lebanon, Venezuela, Zimbabwe.

33:03.500 --> 33:06.540
These are currencies whose supply increases very quickly,

33:06.540 --> 33:09.060
and therefore, their value collapses.

33:09.060 --> 33:12.540
Whereas the dollar, the Swiss franc, the euro,

33:12.540 --> 33:14.940
the British pound, the Japanese yen,

33:14.940 --> 33:17.180
they increase at a much lower rate in general

33:17.180 --> 33:20.260
than these terrible currencies.

33:20.260 --> 33:21.980
And that's why all over the world,

33:21.980 --> 33:24.220
you see people are looking to get more dollars

33:24.220 --> 33:28.220
and more of these harder currencies than the easier ones.

33:28.220 --> 33:32.420
So I think this analysis of the hardness of the money

33:32.420 --> 33:33.700
and the ease of money

33:33.700 --> 33:37.580
is pretty well supported empirically.

33:37.580 --> 33:41.860
So like you said, you're at least in part or in whole,

33:41.860 --> 33:43.860
consider yourself an Austrian economist.

33:44.740 --> 33:49.020
So you're perhaps a great person to ask about the basics.

33:49.020 --> 33:50.580
What is Austrian economics?

33:50.580 --> 33:52.300
What is Kenzian economics?

33:52.300 --> 33:54.700
How do you compare the two?

33:54.700 --> 33:55.820
What should people know?

33:55.820 --> 34:00.060
What are the interesting defining characteristics to you

34:00.060 --> 34:01.780
about these schools of thought?

34:01.780 --> 34:03.420
So Austrian economics, the way that I see it,

34:03.420 --> 34:04.980
Austrian economics is economics.

34:04.980 --> 34:07.700
It's, we call it Austrian economics

34:07.700 --> 34:11.180
because economics has been hijacked by a bunch of frauds,

34:11.180 --> 34:12.020
really.

34:12.020 --> 34:12.940
People who are wrong, okay.

34:12.940 --> 34:14.580
Well, it's much worse than wrong

34:14.580 --> 34:16.700
by people who are just essentially propagandists

34:16.700 --> 34:17.540
for inflation.

34:17.540 --> 34:18.580
Right.

34:18.940 --> 34:20.380
It's like your opinion man.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.900
Yeah, well, that's also like your opinion man.

34:23.900 --> 34:24.740
Yeah.

34:24.740 --> 34:25.580
But you asked.

34:25.580 --> 34:26.420
That's true.

34:26.420 --> 34:28.660
Well, I also talked to Paul Krugman on this podcast.

34:28.660 --> 34:32.820
So he's, the O speaks enough,

34:32.820 --> 34:35.580
but he's one of the people

34:35.580 --> 34:39.940
that is perhaps most harshly criticized by folks

34:39.940 --> 34:44.380
in Austrian economics perspective and vice versa,

34:44.380 --> 34:45.820
which is a fascinating tension.

34:45.820 --> 34:49.020
Yeah, he's done a great job as an actor

34:49.020 --> 34:51.420
who plays an economist on TV and the internet.

34:52.500 --> 34:55.500
So anyway, now tell me what you really think.

34:55.500 --> 34:58.660
No, but so the basics of what is Austrian economics?

34:58.660 --> 35:00.660
What is the, what perspective does it take on the world?

35:00.660 --> 35:01.540
Yeah, so I mean,

35:01.540 --> 35:06.140
Austrian economics really is the continuation of a tradition

35:06.140 --> 35:08.460
that it goes back to the ancient Greeks

35:08.460 --> 35:09.740
of studying economics.

35:09.740 --> 35:13.340
Historically, it's really just economics

35:13.340 --> 35:14.700
and that has evolved over time

35:14.700 --> 35:19.700
and the establishment of the Austrian school per se

35:20.380 --> 35:23.580
came in 1871, 150 years ago,

35:23.580 --> 35:25.580
when Karl Menger, the father of the school,

35:25.580 --> 35:28.180
wrote a book called Principles of Economics

35:28.180 --> 35:30.900
and essentially invented marginal analysis,

35:30.900 --> 35:32.860
which is a big deal in economics.

35:32.860 --> 35:35.380
Marginal analysis is the idea that in economics,

35:35.380 --> 35:37.860
individuals carry out decisions at the margin.

35:37.860 --> 35:42.740
That it's, when you make choice, you're not making it,

35:42.740 --> 35:44.060
for instance, if you're making a choice

35:44.420 --> 35:46.820
between what should I spend my money on,

35:46.820 --> 35:49.780
you're not making a choice whether it is,

35:49.780 --> 35:51.900
this thing is object A or B,

35:51.900 --> 35:53.900
which one is more valuable for me in general,

35:53.900 --> 35:56.820
which one is more valuable for me for the rest of my life.

35:56.820 --> 35:59.460
You're choosing about the next unit right now

35:59.460 --> 36:00.980
at this point at this stage.

36:00.980 --> 36:04.140
And if you analyze economic decision-making at the margin,

36:04.140 --> 36:06.060
it makes a lot more sense and you can understand

36:06.060 --> 36:08.660
why people decide and make the decisions that they do.

36:09.740 --> 36:12.620
Whereas if you don't apply marginal analysis,

36:12.620 --> 36:14.380
things don't make sense.

36:14.380 --> 36:17.300
The key thing that marginal analysis helps us solve

36:17.300 --> 36:19.860
is what is called the water diamond paradox.

36:19.860 --> 36:22.300
So you will die without water.

36:22.300 --> 36:25.900
We all need water and yet water is dirt cheap.

36:25.900 --> 36:29.340
Whereas diamonds are extremely superfluous,

36:29.340 --> 36:32.380
nobody needs them, nobody's gonna live or die

36:32.380 --> 36:33.740
because they have a diamond

36:33.740 --> 36:35.540
and yet they're extremely expensive.

36:35.540 --> 36:37.100
So why is it that as human beings,

36:37.100 --> 36:41.740
we pay maybe say a dollar a liter for water,

36:41.740 --> 36:43.180
whereas we pay thousands of dollars

36:43.180 --> 36:44.980
for a few grams of diamonds.

36:44.980 --> 36:46.180
Why is this the case?

36:46.180 --> 36:49.300
Do we value water less than diamond?

36:49.300 --> 36:50.300
The answer is no.

36:50.300 --> 36:53.980
But at the margin where we are right now,

36:53.980 --> 36:55.900
you live in a place where water is very abundant

36:55.900 --> 36:57.900
because cities are only built in places

36:57.900 --> 36:59.620
where water is abundant.

36:59.620 --> 37:03.500
And you're only making a choice

37:03.500 --> 37:05.340
about the next unit of water.

37:05.340 --> 37:07.300
And so water is extremely abundant

37:07.300 --> 37:10.420
and you're choosing about whether to spend

37:10.420 --> 37:14.620
the next unit of money on water.

37:14.620 --> 37:16.460
The valuation that you give to water

37:16.460 --> 37:18.940
given that you have a lot of water at home

37:18.940 --> 37:21.460
and that you live in a place that has abundant water

37:21.460 --> 37:24.700
is pretty low to the marginal unit.

37:24.700 --> 37:27.020
But it's very high for water overall.

37:27.020 --> 37:28.460
So if I asked you,

37:28.460 --> 37:32.020
how much would you spend for water in general?

37:32.020 --> 37:34.980
How much would you pay for water for all of your life?

37:34.980 --> 37:37.020
It would be a lot higher than diamonds.

37:37.020 --> 37:39.220
If I told you you can only have water or diamonds

37:39.220 --> 37:40.500
for the rest of your life,

37:40.500 --> 37:42.340
you choose water, obviously.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.940
But nobody's ever had to make that choice.

37:44.940 --> 37:47.260
You only make your choices at the margin.

37:47.260 --> 37:50.300
So at the margin where we are, modern civilization,

37:50.300 --> 37:51.540
we have an abundance of water.

37:51.540 --> 37:53.100
That's why we have civilization.

37:53.100 --> 37:54.980
And diamonds are very rare and scarce.

37:54.980 --> 37:58.340
And people are only buying,

37:58.340 --> 38:01.780
you buy your first diamond when you're gonna get married.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.260
You give it to your wife.

38:03.260 --> 38:06.660
And that's gonna be the first few grams of diamond

38:06.660 --> 38:07.500
that she's ever gonna own.

38:07.540 --> 38:08.940
Giving my wife water.

38:10.060 --> 38:10.900
Smart move.

38:10.900 --> 38:13.260
You should definitely give her Bitcoin instead of diamonds.

38:13.260 --> 38:14.540
I tell my wife,

38:14.540 --> 38:18.140
I occasionally remind her how many Bitcoin we could have had

38:18.140 --> 38:20.380
if I bought her Bitcoin with the price of the diamond ring.

38:20.380 --> 38:21.940
What's the downside of, by the way,

38:21.940 --> 38:25.700
diamonds from the analysis of like gold and so on?

38:25.700 --> 38:27.140
Ah, that's a great question.

38:28.460 --> 38:30.140
Arguably diamonds are a scam.

38:30.980 --> 38:35.980
Because they became popular as a thing in marriage

38:37.500 --> 38:39.060
after gold was banned,

38:39.060 --> 38:41.780
after gold ownership was banned in the US in the 1930s

38:41.780 --> 38:43.460
and in many places around the world.

38:43.460 --> 38:44.900
So before that, you'd give gold.

38:44.900 --> 38:49.380
And the reason you'd give gold in a dowry in a wedding

38:49.380 --> 38:52.500
is because it wasn't just that it's pretty and shiny,

38:52.500 --> 38:53.740
it's because it's money.

38:53.740 --> 38:58.060
So if you die, your wife can take the gold

38:58.060 --> 38:59.700
and she can live off of it.

39:00.660 --> 39:01.860
It's a demonstration that you're giving her

39:01.860 --> 39:03.220
something valuable.

39:03.220 --> 39:05.820
And that's because nobody can make a lot more gold.

39:05.820 --> 39:07.140
It has the high stock to flow ratio.

39:07.140 --> 39:09.700
But then they banned gold ownership

39:09.700 --> 39:11.100
or they allowed people to only own

39:11.100 --> 39:12.780
very tiny quantities of gold.

39:12.780 --> 39:15.420
And that's when the diamond industry stepped in

39:15.420 --> 39:19.940
and marketed diamonds as the thing that you need to give.

39:19.940 --> 39:21.500
But the problem with it is, of course,

39:21.500 --> 39:23.780
that diamonds aren't like gold.

39:23.780 --> 39:27.100
They're not very hard to make more of.

39:27.100 --> 39:29.700
And the reason we have scarcity in diamonds

39:29.700 --> 39:30.580
is really artificial.

39:30.580 --> 39:34.420
There's effectively a monopoly of diamond producers.

39:34.420 --> 39:36.580
They restrict the supply.

39:36.580 --> 39:39.060
And it's a pretty dirty business.

39:39.060 --> 39:39.900
And the way that they do it

39:39.900 --> 39:44.140
is all of the talk about blood diamonds

39:44.140 --> 39:46.300
is a way for them to ensure their monopoly.

39:46.300 --> 39:51.180
So if you're part of the monopoly of diamond producers,

39:51.180 --> 39:53.340
then it doesn't matter how many people get killed

39:53.340 --> 39:54.380
producing your diamonds.

39:54.380 --> 39:55.860
If you're out of the monopoly,

39:55.860 --> 39:58.660
then human rights organizations descend on you

39:58.660 --> 40:02.180
and call for shutting you down for selling blood diamonds.

40:02.180 --> 40:03.180
And they're also restricting

40:03.180 --> 40:04.460
the production of artificial diamonds.

40:04.460 --> 40:05.300
This is the other thing.

40:05.300 --> 40:06.420
You can make artificial diamond,

40:06.420 --> 40:08.420
you can't make artificial gold.

40:08.420 --> 40:11.060
So they restrict the production of artificial diamond

40:11.060 --> 40:13.540
and they try and insist that, you know,

40:13.540 --> 40:15.460
you shouldn't take artificial diamonds,

40:15.460 --> 40:18.820
but they're indistinguishable from real diamonds.

40:18.820 --> 40:20.340
So it's an artificial scarcity.

40:20.340 --> 40:22.140
And I think there's gonna come a point at some point

40:22.140 --> 40:23.380
that this monopoly is gonna break.

40:23.380 --> 40:25.380
And a lot of people are gonna be left with

40:26.340 --> 40:30.500
essentially highly devalued jewelry.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.740
I'm gonna take this segment of the podcast.

40:32.740 --> 40:34.540
When I'm getting mad, I'm gonna send it.

40:34.540 --> 40:38.620
And then instead you're getting water or Bitcoin.

40:38.620 --> 40:40.620
Yes, water and Bitcoin is all you need.

40:40.620 --> 40:44.100
So marginal analysis, focusing on the margin

40:44.100 --> 40:45.340
is the thing that allows you

40:45.340 --> 40:47.860
to most accurately capture human nature,

40:47.860 --> 40:50.780
the actual day-to-day decisions that we humans make.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.740
Yeah, that's really revolutionized economics.

40:54.820 --> 40:59.220
So 1870, and that was Menger's work.

40:59.220 --> 41:02.620
And then he had a student, Eugene Bomberg,

41:02.620 --> 41:05.060
who developed capital theory.

41:05.060 --> 41:07.100
And then he had a student, Ludwig von Mises,

41:07.100 --> 41:10.660
who is arguably the most important economist ever.

41:10.660 --> 41:12.660
And he developed theory of money.

41:12.660 --> 41:15.020
And he wrote a book in 1912

41:15.020 --> 41:17.420
called The Theory of Money and Credit.

41:17.420 --> 41:20.220
And then in the 40s, he wrote Human Action,

41:20.220 --> 41:23.340
which is a big treatise on economics.

41:23.340 --> 41:27.420
And I think this is the correct tradition of economics.

41:27.420 --> 41:32.420
And before World War I, this was just known as economics.

41:32.420 --> 41:35.620
And then after what happened in World War I,

41:35.620 --> 41:37.780
and I discussed this in detail in the Fiat Standard,

41:37.780 --> 41:42.260
is that the Bank of England essentially went off gold

41:42.260 --> 41:45.260
and tried to pass off their own credit

41:45.260 --> 41:49.860
as being as good as gold in order to finance the war.

41:49.860 --> 41:52.780
And incidentally here, this is part of the history

41:52.780 --> 41:54.100
that is not discussed often.

41:54.100 --> 41:56.420
This is presented as an innovation.

41:57.380 --> 42:00.900
Later on, they needed essentially a propaganda school

42:00.900 --> 42:03.300
that would justify what they did.

42:03.300 --> 42:05.460
And later on, it's presented as,

42:05.460 --> 42:08.220
oh, hey, we realized that gold was not good.

42:08.220 --> 42:10.940
And now look, we've built this thing

42:10.940 --> 42:11.900
that is better than gold,

42:11.900 --> 42:13.580
where now the government can just print money

42:13.580 --> 42:14.420
whenever it wants.

42:14.420 --> 42:18.020
And now gold money is not an issue anymore,

42:18.020 --> 42:20.060
which is extremely idiotic,

42:20.060 --> 42:22.180
because the whole point of money

42:22.180 --> 42:23.420
is that it's not easy to make.

42:23.420 --> 42:24.940
If it's easy to make, it's not money anymore.

42:24.940 --> 42:27.540
It's just destroying the entire function of money.

42:27.540 --> 42:30.420
And we've seen that happen extensively in the 20th century

42:30.420 --> 42:32.900
after countries went off the gold standard.

42:32.900 --> 42:35.100
So essentially, Keynesian economics

42:35.100 --> 42:36.700
is just inflation apologia.

42:36.700 --> 42:39.940
It's just propaganda to justify inflationism.

42:39.940 --> 42:43.220
And it's profoundly nonsensical.

42:43.220 --> 42:47.220
It's built on the idea that if you just make more money,

42:47.220 --> 42:49.460
you can stimulate economic production.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.460
And of course, this is very self-serving

42:51.460 --> 42:53.220
to the central banks and to the banks

42:53.220 --> 42:56.300
and to the governments who promote this nonsense.

42:56.300 --> 42:58.740
And this is also very pervasive.

42:58.740 --> 43:01.380
If you've had the misfortune of studying at a university

43:01.380 --> 43:02.780
over the last century,

43:02.780 --> 43:04.900
you were taught Keynesian garbage economics.

43:04.900 --> 43:09.100
You were taught that if there's a problem in the economy,

43:09.100 --> 43:11.620
the way to fix it is that the government prints money,

43:11.620 --> 43:13.460
the government lowers the interest rate,

43:13.460 --> 43:17.380
and then that leads to more economic production,

43:17.380 --> 43:18.900
which is completely nonsensical.

43:19.740 --> 43:23.500
So, you're, again, for the listener,

43:23.500 --> 43:26.260
you're using strong words and I'll push back

43:26.260 --> 43:30.460
just to find, to please devil's advocate

43:30.460 --> 43:33.420
to hopefully one day arrive at the truth.

43:33.420 --> 43:37.060
So, just because it's in the interest

43:37.060 --> 43:39.060
of the central banks and the government,

43:40.540 --> 43:43.860
the interests and the models of Keynesian economics

43:43.860 --> 43:47.460
and the government are aligned doesn't mean they're wrong.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.900
So, let's give them a chance.

43:49.900 --> 43:54.300
So, the conventional wisdom, perhaps economics wisdom,

43:54.300 --> 43:58.460
is that inflation is good in moderation

43:58.460 --> 44:00.100
as it encourages spending,

44:00.100 --> 44:03.780
but too much is bad because it completely devalues,

44:03.780 --> 44:05.300
destroys people's savings.

44:05.300 --> 44:08.780
So, a little bit of inflation is good to stimulate spending.

44:10.300 --> 44:13.180
And, I mean, I suppose this is one of the things

44:13.180 --> 44:17.140
that's supported by Keynesian economics.

44:17.620 --> 44:19.620
This is basically the whole point of Keynesian economics

44:19.620 --> 44:23.420
is to try and find an endless array of explanations

44:23.420 --> 44:25.780
to explain why inflation is a good thing.

44:25.780 --> 44:28.380
Well, it could, the chicken and the egg.

44:28.380 --> 44:30.540
So, that's the cynical take.

44:30.540 --> 44:31.980
This is a propaganda machine

44:31.980 --> 44:34.060
to sell the government's narrative.

44:34.060 --> 44:35.860
The less cynical take is this,

44:35.860 --> 44:38.900
a bunch of economists who are telling, who...

44:38.900 --> 44:40.300
Who figured out this thing and it happens

44:40.300 --> 44:42.340
to be good for banks and governments.

44:42.340 --> 44:43.860
And just because it's good for them doesn't mean...

44:43.860 --> 44:45.980
And it justifies the existence of government

44:45.980 --> 44:48.940
and your basic...

44:48.940 --> 44:50.620
I don't think it's your basic assumption,

44:50.620 --> 44:53.660
but a foundational principle of your thought

44:53.660 --> 44:56.660
is that a lot of government is not a good thing.

44:56.660 --> 45:00.460
Your first gut instinct, government bad.

45:00.460 --> 45:02.940
Like I mentioned, I live next door to Michael Malice,

45:02.940 --> 45:07.140
who probably beats you on the intensity

45:07.140 --> 45:10.060
and how quickly he says, government bad.

45:10.060 --> 45:15.060
So, there's a potential argument for government good.

45:15.820 --> 45:19.020
Some government is good, maybe a lot of government is good.

45:19.020 --> 45:22.260
Maybe we need a lot of centralized management

45:22.260 --> 45:23.900
for resource allocation and so on,

45:23.900 --> 45:26.940
because we humans specialize, we're too busy and so on.

45:26.940 --> 45:30.020
So, there is an argument for that, that exists.

45:30.020 --> 45:32.180
You probably disagree with any possible argument

45:32.180 --> 45:35.180
on that side, but anyway, so why is that idea

45:35.180 --> 45:36.820
of Keynesian economics wrong?

45:36.820 --> 45:39.580
I'm gonna focus for this on the money idea,

45:39.580 --> 45:42.380
the idea that a little bit of inflation is good.

45:42.420 --> 45:46.260
The idea here, I mean, the criticism is that

45:46.260 --> 45:48.300
without inflation, people wouldn't spend

45:48.300 --> 45:50.940
and then the economy would come to a grinding halt.

45:50.940 --> 45:53.220
And that's nonsensical because people spend

45:53.220 --> 45:56.100
not because they wanna keep this magical monster

45:56.100 --> 45:58.060
called the economy going,

45:58.060 --> 45:59.940
people spend because they need to consume

45:59.940 --> 46:02.580
because that's how we live, that's how we survive.

46:02.580 --> 46:04.380
You need to eat, you need shelter,

46:04.380 --> 46:06.580
you need clothes to keep you warm.

46:06.580 --> 46:09.620
And as technology advances, the capabilities

46:09.660 --> 46:14.660
of the things that we can do with our time increases,

46:14.860 --> 46:16.700
and so we wanna buy more things.

46:16.700 --> 46:19.420
So people buy things because people want to consume.

46:19.420 --> 46:21.820
There's a limitless desire to consume,

46:21.820 --> 46:26.820
that there's no shortage of reasons for people to consume,

46:28.900 --> 46:33.460
whether it's food or Ferraris or private jets,

46:33.460 --> 46:35.420
people just always wanna buy more.

46:35.420 --> 46:37.060
Can I interrupt just really quick?

46:37.060 --> 46:40.100
What about the fear about the uncertainty of the future

46:40.100 --> 46:45.100
where they might want to buy things,

46:46.020 --> 46:48.220
but they're really afraid because it seems like

46:48.220 --> 46:50.780
there's a lot like a pandemic going on or whatever it is.

46:50.780 --> 46:52.260
That's good.

46:52.260 --> 46:54.620
So fear of uncertainty is good,

46:54.620 --> 46:55.820
but can you have too much fear of uncertainty?

46:55.820 --> 46:57.740
Here's the thing, what I was saying is,

46:57.740 --> 46:59.340
I was making the point that

46:59.340 --> 47:02.500
we don't need to be motivated to consume.

47:02.500 --> 47:05.260
We have the insatiable desire to consume.

47:05.260 --> 47:08.540
Everybody would like to have more of all kinds of things.

47:08.540 --> 47:10.460
Everybody would like to have a bigger house.

47:10.460 --> 47:12.340
Well, not everybody, some people have a big enough house,

47:12.340 --> 47:14.220
but everybody would like a house,

47:14.220 --> 47:18.740
everybody would like a car, jet, all kinds of things,

47:18.740 --> 47:20.940
electronics, machines.

47:20.940 --> 47:23.980
So we don't need a desire to consume.

47:23.980 --> 47:26.540
But of course, the limit on how much we consume

47:26.540 --> 47:29.340
is opportunity cost.

47:29.340 --> 47:30.860
Why don't you buy a Ferrari?

47:30.860 --> 47:32.340
Well, because that's really expensive

47:32.340 --> 47:35.180
and it would mean that, well, maybe you do have a Ferrari,

47:36.100 --> 47:36.940
but I mean, most people don't buy a Ferrari

47:36.940 --> 47:39.940
because it's too expensive, they can't afford it.

47:39.940 --> 47:41.900
They'd have to work too hard to get it.

47:41.900 --> 47:45.180
And if they do get it, it might mean that,

47:45.180 --> 47:46.580
they can't afford their house anymore.

47:46.580 --> 47:48.540
So we have to economize.

47:48.540 --> 47:49.740
That's a good thing.

47:49.740 --> 47:51.980
And we have to also think of the future.

47:51.980 --> 47:54.020
And so humans consume,

47:54.020 --> 47:57.180
that we don't need more motivation to consume.

47:57.180 --> 47:59.580
We have to deal with the economic reality

47:59.580 --> 48:03.060
of the things that limit us from consuming more.

48:03.060 --> 48:06.780
So what Keynesians present is that

48:06.780 --> 48:08.740
when there is a problem in the economy,

48:08.740 --> 48:10.620
like there was after World War I,

48:11.780 --> 48:16.780
the problem is always caused by the inflation.

48:17.260 --> 48:18.940
And what the Keynesian hucksters do

48:18.940 --> 48:23.340
is that they look at the consequences of inflation

48:23.340 --> 48:25.620
and blame it on people not spending enough,

48:25.620 --> 48:27.380
when people are doing the rational thing.

48:27.380 --> 48:30.540
The money is, so there was inflation,

48:30.540 --> 48:34.420
it caused an unsustainable boom, it caused the recession.

48:34.420 --> 48:36.100
And now a lot of people lost their jobs

48:36.100 --> 48:37.540
and they don't have enough money to go out

48:37.540 --> 48:39.980
and spend frivolously.

48:39.980 --> 48:41.420
So they save for the future.

48:41.420 --> 48:42.780
The future is uncertain.

48:42.780 --> 48:44.100
That's a good thing.

48:44.100 --> 48:46.420
That's how you fix things.

48:46.420 --> 48:48.340
You begin the recovery by,

48:48.340 --> 48:50.820
well, you lost some wealth, so you spend less.

48:50.820 --> 48:54.620
Like if your business goes bust, if you lose your job,

48:54.620 --> 48:57.800
it's natural and smart that you stop spending money

48:57.800 --> 49:00.260
on the frivolous things that you used to spend.

49:00.940 --> 49:01.780
And you save it for the future.

49:01.780 --> 49:04.220
You invest in something else, you get a new job.

49:04.220 --> 49:06.380
And then once you've recovered, you start spending more.

49:06.380 --> 49:08.900
This is very sane and very good.

49:08.900 --> 49:11.300
And it's the way to recovery.

49:11.300 --> 49:14.700
But essentially the Keynesians have used this

49:14.700 --> 49:17.460
as a justification for more inflation.

49:17.460 --> 49:19.340
Because inflation is an addiction.

49:19.340 --> 49:21.340
Once the government gets down the path

49:21.340 --> 49:23.820
of spending money to solve its problems,

49:23.820 --> 49:26.860
then every problem looks like it can be solved

49:26.860 --> 49:27.820
by more inflation.

49:27.820 --> 49:31.460
And so this is where Keynesian economics comes in.

49:31.460 --> 49:34.860
And of course, the Keynesian economics is based

49:34.860 --> 49:38.980
on the work of Keynes, which came in the 1930s.

49:38.980 --> 49:40.140
And this is the key point.

49:40.140 --> 49:42.780
Like it's portrayed in the textbook

49:42.780 --> 49:46.620
as if it's just this scientific breakthrough,

49:46.620 --> 49:50.020
that somebody in the 1930s, this genius came about

49:50.020 --> 49:53.300
and realized that, oh, we don't actually need gold.

49:53.300 --> 49:54.340
We don't need hard money.

49:54.340 --> 49:56.660
We can actually just print all the money.

49:56.700 --> 50:00.700
And in reality, of course, it was just the very thin,

50:00.700 --> 50:03.260
flimsy, idiotic justification for what governments

50:03.260 --> 50:05.220
were already doing for 20 years.

50:05.220 --> 50:07.660
They'd already gone off the gold standard.

50:07.660 --> 50:09.980
And they'd gone through 20 years

50:09.980 --> 50:11.980
in which they were lying to their population,

50:11.980 --> 50:14.100
telling their population, we're still on a gold standard,

50:14.100 --> 50:18.540
but there are problems caused by various random things.

50:18.540 --> 50:20.160
But don't worry, we're gonna be going back

50:20.160 --> 50:21.000
on the gold standard.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.060
20 years later, after they went off the gold standard,

50:24.060 --> 50:27.140
they come up with this justification for why,

50:27.140 --> 50:29.940
oh, actually, the gold standard was bad.

50:29.940 --> 50:32.980
And this is a really pernicious thing about it is

50:32.980 --> 50:34.580
the problems that were caused by us

50:34.580 --> 50:36.460
going off the gold standard

50:36.460 --> 50:39.100
were caused by the gold standard.

50:39.100 --> 50:40.700
And we're going to fix them

50:40.700 --> 50:42.900
by going off the gold standard even more.

50:42.900 --> 50:45.980
Just because government is lying and it's shady

50:45.980 --> 50:47.300
and it does these kinds of things

50:47.300 --> 50:49.700
doesn't mean Keynesian economics is wrong.

50:49.700 --> 50:53.180
So just, because I wanted to separate a few things you said.

50:53.220 --> 50:55.340
It could very well be very wrong

50:55.340 --> 50:57.060
and they could indeed be hucksters.

50:57.060 --> 51:00.860
All of these colorful, such colorful language.

51:00.860 --> 51:03.300
I love you deeply for this, this is fun.

51:03.300 --> 51:05.340
Yeah, but I mean, it's not like somebody like Krugman

51:05.340 --> 51:07.980
doesn't use this kind of language when discussing Austrians.

51:07.980 --> 51:10.740
It's just that when actors like him use it,

51:10.740 --> 51:13.300
it's presented as if it is legitimate

51:13.300 --> 51:15.680
because he's part of the major shows.

51:17.060 --> 51:22.060
So the case they make and the criticism Keynesians make

51:22.100 --> 51:24.820
of Austrian economics and the case they make

51:24.820 --> 51:28.180
for Keynesian economics is it's based on empirical evidence.

51:28.180 --> 51:32.940
So Austrian economists are pie in the sky,

51:32.940 --> 51:37.340
theorists about like how human nature works

51:37.340 --> 51:39.460
and it's just all theory.

51:39.460 --> 51:42.140
And just like you said, Keynesian economics kind of sell it

51:42.140 --> 51:44.780
as a science, data-driven science.

51:44.780 --> 51:49.780
And so where's the data, bro, on the Austrian.

51:50.580 --> 51:55.580
So one way of saying it is how do you know

51:55.660 --> 51:57.980
if we get rid of inflation?

51:57.980 --> 52:00.020
How do you know if we get rid of central banks?

52:00.020 --> 52:02.620
If we push towards that direction,

52:02.620 --> 52:06.740
we will have a better world, a better functioning economy,

52:06.740 --> 52:10.900
better functioning markets, better functioning society.

52:10.900 --> 52:13.420
This is another inaccurate way

52:13.420 --> 52:15.300
in which they present the economics.

52:15.300 --> 52:16.620
They present it as if it's just theory

52:16.620 --> 52:19.760
and the data doesn't matter, but that's not the case.

52:20.760 --> 52:23.120
What the Austrians say is that without guiding theory,

52:23.120 --> 52:27.200
data is mute, data is dumb, data can't say anything.

52:27.200 --> 52:31.160
Theory first and then you have to have models

52:32.640 --> 52:35.960
to provide context for interpretation of the data.

52:35.960 --> 52:38.800
And it's a sign of just how little self-awareness they have

52:38.800 --> 52:42.240
that they think that they're just being led by the data

52:42.240 --> 52:46.480
when they're being led by Keynes's moronic theories.

52:47.280 --> 52:50.880
And they use the data to justify those theories

52:50.880 --> 52:52.360
and to stick by them.

52:52.360 --> 52:54.080
And in fact, they are the ones

52:54.080 --> 52:56.240
whose theories cannot be refuted

52:56.240 --> 53:00.320
because it's just government mandated religion.

53:00.320 --> 53:03.020
So according to Keynes's nonsense,

53:06.040 --> 53:07.560
so the way that the whole thing is,

53:07.560 --> 53:10.600
the way that they justify the inflationism is this,

53:10.600 --> 53:12.320
and I'm just using this to give an example

53:12.320 --> 53:14.540
of what you're talking about in terms of theory.

53:14.540 --> 53:15.960
The way they justify the inflationism

53:16.000 --> 53:17.800
to tie it back to the original point,

53:17.800 --> 53:20.100
they justify, all right, we need money to spend.

53:20.100 --> 53:22.120
And then the level of spending in the economy

53:22.120 --> 53:23.700
is what determines the state of the economy.

53:23.700 --> 53:25.140
And I've taught macroeconomics

53:25.140 --> 53:27.520
at university level for a while, so I know this.

53:27.520 --> 53:31.520
I know Keynesian nonsense better than most Keynesians know,

53:31.520 --> 53:34.280
Austrians, if not all of them, I guarantee you.

53:34.280 --> 53:38.200
And so the way they see it is the level of spending

53:38.200 --> 53:40.400
in the economy is what determines the state of the economy.

53:40.400 --> 53:42.720
There's a level of output and there's a level of spending.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.480
So there's like the factories on the one side

53:44.480 --> 53:46.040
that are churning out goods,

53:46.040 --> 53:48.840
and those goods have a certain quantity and value,

53:48.840 --> 53:51.720
market value, and it's completely nonsensical, of course,

53:51.720 --> 53:54.920
because how can the value of the goods produced

53:54.920 --> 53:56.760
be different from the value of the spending?

53:56.760 --> 53:59.100
But let's put that aside for a second.

54:00.160 --> 54:02.520
So the amount of spending that happens in the economy

54:02.520 --> 54:04.200
determines the state of the economy.

54:04.200 --> 54:07.880
If the value of the production, which they call Y,

54:07.880 --> 54:10.360
is higher than the aggregate expenditure,

54:10.360 --> 54:11.360
so this is the production,

54:11.360 --> 54:13.480
and then the aggregate expenditure is lower,

54:13.480 --> 54:16.760
then we don't have enough spending to buy all the goods,

54:16.760 --> 54:18.320
and then that causes a recession,

54:18.320 --> 54:20.800
the factories start laying off workers,

54:20.800 --> 54:23.360
and then the laid off workers start spending less,

54:23.360 --> 54:25.560
and then that leads to aggregate expenditure

54:25.560 --> 54:28.360
dropping even further, and so it's a vicious cycle

54:28.360 --> 54:30.640
where the economy gets into recession,

54:30.640 --> 54:34.040
and the only way out is for Keynes's bankster buddies

54:34.040 --> 54:36.120
and government buddies to print a lot of money

54:36.120 --> 54:39.520
to give to themselves, and then that will-

54:39.520 --> 54:43.120
That's one interpret, so to print more money,

54:43.120 --> 54:46.320
to increase the expenditure, to match the spot.

54:46.320 --> 54:47.400
To match the level of output.

54:47.400 --> 54:49.200
Sounds pretty good to me, I'm sold.

54:50.840 --> 54:53.400
Even though you're saying huckster, so I just,

54:53.400 --> 54:56.560
you know, the way, I love you very much,

54:56.560 --> 54:59.680
but just for people who are listening,

54:59.680 --> 55:02.960
I think it's, I love the way you talk,

55:02.960 --> 55:05.960
and it's great, and keep doing it, but just for context,

55:06.280 --> 55:10.880
like I don't know anything that involves human nature

55:10.880 --> 55:12.720
deserves this level of certainty.

55:12.720 --> 55:15.360
At least my position is that we don't know

55:15.360 --> 55:18.240
what the hell we're doing on basically anything, and-

55:18.240 --> 55:19.360
Perhaps, but I mean-

55:19.360 --> 55:23.760
Like there's a lot, like certainty can get us in trouble,

55:23.760 --> 55:24.600
is my worry.

55:24.600 --> 55:27.240
I don't know much about economics,

55:27.240 --> 55:30.800
I don't even know financial systems, monetary systems,

55:32.240 --> 55:35.440
but I've just seen us get in trouble with human psychology.

55:35.440 --> 55:38.440
Certainty, certainty of ideologies in general.

55:38.440 --> 55:40.400
You mentioned Marxism and so on,

55:40.400 --> 55:42.240
I came from the Soviet Union,

55:42.240 --> 55:44.480
there's a lot of people that are very certain

55:44.480 --> 55:46.640
throughout the history of the 20th century

55:46.640 --> 55:49.880
that communism is the utopia

55:49.880 --> 55:52.600
that humanity should strive for.

55:52.600 --> 55:54.400
So I'm nervous around certainty.

55:54.400 --> 55:56.000
I could be wrong, but you know,

55:56.000 --> 55:57.240
you asked me for my opinion.

55:57.240 --> 56:00.280
Yes, yes, sorry, so that little bit of a caveat.

56:00.280 --> 56:03.240
So to go back to the idea, then on the other hand,

56:03.240 --> 56:07.160
you have the other situation is when the level of spending

56:07.160 --> 56:10.040
is higher than the amount of aggregate output.

56:10.040 --> 56:11.840
In that situation, you have too much spending,

56:11.840 --> 56:14.640
so therefore what ends up happening is inflation.

56:14.640 --> 56:16.160
So according to the Keynesian worldview,

56:16.160 --> 56:18.280
this is really important because this is a way

56:18.280 --> 56:20.960
that I'm gonna get to your point about empirical data

56:20.960 --> 56:25.960
and to show you why they're not correct.

56:26.600 --> 56:28.360
Yeah, they're not correct about what they say

56:28.360 --> 56:29.640
about empirical data.

56:29.640 --> 56:32.640
So then what this means is that there's a level of output

56:32.640 --> 56:34.240
and there's a level of aggregate expenditure.

56:34.240 --> 56:36.120
The aggregate expenditure can either be higher

56:36.120 --> 56:38.680
or lower than the output or equal to it.

56:38.680 --> 56:41.720
If it's higher, we get inflation.

56:41.720 --> 56:46.640
If it's lower, we get recessions, okay?

56:46.640 --> 56:50.040
So is there any universe in this model,

56:50.040 --> 56:53.400
is there any potential universe in which you can have

56:53.400 --> 56:56.320
both inflation and a recession?

56:56.320 --> 56:59.440
According to the Keynesian model, you can't, right?

56:59.440 --> 57:01.400
Because aggregate expenditure cannot be

57:01.400 --> 57:05.040
both higher and lower than output.

57:05.040 --> 57:08.520
So therefore, if you were truly being an empirical person,

57:08.520 --> 57:09.800
if you were looking at evidence

57:09.800 --> 57:13.200
and trying to analyze data,

57:13.200 --> 57:16.440
you'd look at this and say one example,

57:16.440 --> 57:18.800
you just need one example of high inflation

57:18.800 --> 57:23.760
and high unemployment to refute this entire model, right?

57:23.760 --> 57:26.040
And of course, the world is full of examples

57:26.040 --> 57:28.200
of high inflation and high unemployment.

57:28.200 --> 57:29.400
And that's what happened in the 19...

57:29.400 --> 57:30.880
And of course, they ignored it

57:30.880 --> 57:32.280
when it happens in poor countries

57:32.280 --> 57:34.520
because poor countries don't really matter.

57:34.520 --> 57:37.240
But then in the 1970s, that happened in the US

57:37.240 --> 57:38.280
and in the Western economies

57:38.280 --> 57:40.400
and the most advanced industrial economies.

57:40.400 --> 57:42.480
So historically, before then,

57:42.480 --> 57:45.720
you had all these Keynesian central bankers

57:47.200 --> 57:49.000
talking about this model and saying,

57:49.000 --> 57:51.080
well, aggregate expenditure is too low now

57:51.080 --> 57:52.480
and that's why we have unemployment,

57:52.480 --> 57:53.640
so we need to print more money.

57:53.640 --> 57:56.520
And then they print more money, inflation goes up,

57:56.520 --> 57:58.360
but also unemployment goes up

57:59.360 --> 58:01.880
because this model is broken.

58:01.880 --> 58:03.240
That's not how the world works.

58:03.240 --> 58:04.320
That's not...

58:04.320 --> 58:06.320
The level of aggregate spending in the economy

58:06.320 --> 58:09.000
is not a lever with which you can control

58:09.000 --> 58:10.800
inflation and unemployment.

58:10.800 --> 58:12.880
So what would a scientist do?

58:12.880 --> 58:15.400
What would a non-Huxter do in this case?

58:17.320 --> 58:18.680
Admit the theory is wrong

58:18.680 --> 58:21.240
and find another way to reformulate it.

58:21.240 --> 58:23.040
Have the Keynesians done that?

58:23.040 --> 58:25.560
No, still the same garbage in the textbook

58:25.560 --> 58:27.160
that is being taught until today.

58:27.160 --> 58:29.720
So is it possible to have a non-Keynesian model

58:29.720 --> 58:32.000
or one that still supports

58:32.000 --> 58:34.600
moderate amount of inflation is good for the economy?

58:34.600 --> 58:37.480
I mean, since the 1970s, since this has happened, yeah.

58:37.480 --> 58:42.480
This is what basically most fiat economists,

58:43.280 --> 58:44.120
as I like to call them,

58:44.120 --> 58:45.440
essentially anybody at a university

58:45.440 --> 58:46.560
financed by governments,

58:46.560 --> 58:47.880
which is financed by central banks,

58:47.880 --> 58:48.720
which is financed by the US.

58:48.720 --> 58:50.080
We'll talk about that.

58:50.080 --> 58:53.880
The effect of fiat money on our life,

58:53.880 --> 58:56.120
as you write about in your book,

58:56.120 --> 58:58.480
fiat standard, one of them is education.

58:58.480 --> 59:00.240
I'm sure we'll disagree there too.

59:01.240 --> 59:04.040
Not smart enough to disagree, but I'll disagree anyway.

59:04.040 --> 59:06.240
So yeah, so a whole bunch of other models came up,

59:06.240 --> 59:10.680
but basically it's such an example of motivated reasoning.

59:10.680 --> 59:12.320
Like anybody who's got a familiarity

59:12.320 --> 59:13.400
with the scientific method

59:13.400 --> 59:14.920
or who's got an engineering background

59:14.920 --> 59:16.280
who comes into economics,

59:16.280 --> 59:18.600
immediately has a lot of red flags.

59:18.600 --> 59:22.360
And I remember when I used to teach macroeconomics,

59:22.360 --> 59:24.520
I used to teach introductory macroeconomics.

59:24.520 --> 59:26.600
And it's a course that would be taken by econ majors,

59:26.600 --> 59:27.680
as well as engineers.

59:27.680 --> 59:29.640
A lot of engineers would take it as an elective.

59:29.640 --> 59:31.080
And every time I'd explain,

59:31.080 --> 59:33.280
and I would just teach the Keynesian basic stuff.

59:33.280 --> 59:34.200
And every time I'd explain it,

59:34.200 --> 59:36.000
there's always that smart engineering kid

59:36.000 --> 59:38.040
who just looks at me and says,

59:38.040 --> 59:39.640
sir, this doesn't make any sense

59:39.640 --> 59:41.280
because this and this and that.

59:41.280 --> 59:43.080
I'm always like, you get it.

59:43.080 --> 59:44.760
Exactly, you're correct.

59:44.760 --> 59:46.440
Because if you have any kind of shred

59:46.440 --> 59:47.600
of scientific thinking,

59:47.600 --> 59:50.240
you see that this is all motivated reasoning.

59:50.240 --> 59:52.840
Like the answer is government needs to print money.

59:52.840 --> 59:55.680
And here's a whole bunch of models

59:55.680 --> 59:56.760
brought up by people

59:56.760 --> 59:59.120
for why government printing money is good.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.000
And the reason they're coming up to this conclusion

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.080
is that you only get funded

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.360
if you come up with this conclusion.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.280
If you come up with a conclusion

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:08.280
that we need to shut down the central bank,

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.120
you don't get funded by the central bank.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.640
You don't get published in the journals.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.560
You don't get a job at the prestigious universities.

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.000
You don't get quoted by a fiat publications

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.840
like the New York Times and CNN.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.320
They don't invite you on as an expert.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.520
Well, that's a fundamental flaw

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.600
with a lot of institutions we have today

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.960
and throughout human history.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.480
Let me zoom out for just a second to the big question.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:32.400
What is economics in general?

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.240
What's the goal?

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.920
You said there's a bunch of models.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.400
Is any economist basically trying to throw

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.040
a bunch of models about human behavior on the table

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.920
and try to generalize it to the global scale?

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.080
So both dance between micro and macro somehow

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.160
in order to determine public policy

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:53.080
and explain the past, predict the future,

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:56.960
prescribe policies that can control the future,

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:57.880
those kinds of things.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.200
That's the big, basic, ridiculous question.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.080
What is economics?

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.760
Economics is a study, the way the Austrians define it

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.160
is the study of how humans make choices

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.080
under the condition of scarcity.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.000
And then we begin with the starting point of economics

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.120
is the fact that scarcity exists.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.480
And why does scarcity exist?

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.360
Well, because it's easier to want things

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.440
than it is to make them.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.280
It's much easier to want a Ferrari than it is to make one.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.640
And so because we have wants

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:31.000
and we have limited means to meet those wants,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.240
we need to economize.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:37.240
It's a permanent marker of the human condition.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.960
We are always economizing at all times.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.040
And so how people make those decisions

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.320
under the conditions of scarcity

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.560
is what economists study.

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.920
So to go back to your point on empiricism

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.360
in Austrian school,

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:55.720
so it isn't that the Austrians don't believe in data.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:00.520
On the contrary, it's that theory has to inform data.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:02.520
And in fact, if you think about it,

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:06.680
as the example of the stagflation of the 1970 shows,

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.640
if you have stagflation,

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.480
that just completely refutes the Keynesian model.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.520
The Austrian way of thinking,

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.880
which is think from first principles,

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.880
understand how the world actually works,

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.440
think about how humans act,

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.640
and understand that economics

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.960
is really all about human action.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.680
So it's not about aggregates of goods.

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.040
This is really the key distinction

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.520
in terms of methodology.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:32.840
For the Keynesians, it's physics envy.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.400
They look at the market economy,

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.720
they look at individuals in the market economy,

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.240
and they think that they can understand the market economy

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.800
by looking at aggregates.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.200
This is really the key point

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:46.240
of what I think makes the certain branch

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.120
of economics pseudoscientific,

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.840
is the introduction of aggregates.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.520
When you introduce those aggregates,

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:54.480
how much production takes place,

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.600
how many people are unemployed,

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:59.600
the percentage of the inflation rate,

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.560
and then you think that you can establish

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.880
scientific relationship between those aggregates,

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.520
it's purely physics envy.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.000
In physics, for instance, or in chemistry,

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.880
let's say a container contains a gas,

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:18.360
and you have the ideal gas law, PV equals to nRT.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.920
Calculate the pressure, calculate the volume,

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.800
and then the temperature.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.600
If you have the pressure and the volume,

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.560
you can calculate the temperature

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:30.040
because you have the nR constants.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.720
So there's a clear relationship

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.600
that has been demonstrated in a laboratory,

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.600
and that we can do it right now.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.240
We can measure it, and we can see it,

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.040
and it continues to hold.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.760
And all it takes is one scientist

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.800
to show that this relationship does not hold,

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:48.000
to do an experiment that shows that this does not hold,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
and it stops being a law of chemistry and it's broken.

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.400
Whereas in economics, what they've done

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.200
is they've copied the superficial shape of this

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.840
without any of the scientific rigor

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.800
that was used to build it.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.880
There's no experiments.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.120
You can't experiment on economies.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.280
We don't have the ability to establish laws,

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.840
and all the laws that we establish

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.960
are just models that get people published

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:18.640
and get them on the media to say,

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:21.000
my model says we need to print more money.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.960
But it's never subject to actual scientific scrutiny.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.160
If it were, they would all be rejected in 15 minutes

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.560
because the world is full of examples

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.760
that contradict them.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.760
Is it possible to do scientific scrutiny

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:31.840
when it's human nature,

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.200
when there's a nearly infinite number of variables

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.560
and you can't control them?

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:40.200
So what's the best thing you could possibly do?

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.240
You do thought experiments.

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.520
But the problem with thought experiments,

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:49.880
Freud thinks everybody wants to have sex with their mother.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:50.720
Is he right?

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.840
That's the problem with Freud.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.840
I don't know, maybe he's right.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.960
Well, obviously, I'm joking on that front,

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:59.080
but Freud is probably under the canes.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.720
Well, no, I think there's power to the thought experiment.

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.240
Just like Einstein,

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.320
a lot of general relativity, special relativity,

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.280
that's a thought experiment.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.880
It originates in a thought experiment.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.080
Now, is it true?

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:14.680
Nice thing about physics,

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.440
you can't eventually have experimental validation.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.800
The downside of economics

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.120
is you really can't have experimental,

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:25.640
like definitive experimental scientific rigor

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.080
of validation of a theory.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.160
So a thought experiment is just a thought experiment.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.800
Using your intuition,

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.720
it's the power of reasoning together

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.680
about human nature.

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.560
And that's why economics cannot make the claims

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.400
that physics can make.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.320
So with physics, you can predict

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:42.360
that if you get this gas at this pressure, at this volume,

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.040
the temperature will be that much.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.360
And you can make that prediction

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.880
and test it a million times,

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:50.400
and you'll always get the precisely correct answer.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.080
With economics, we can't make quantitative predictions.

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.920
But still, on Twitter, and even today,

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.840
you're very certain about the statements you're making.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:58.680
Do you?

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.520
Yeah, but I don't make quantitatively certain statements.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:01.360
That's the thing.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.400
In economics, we don't make quantitative predictions.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.120
We cannot do that because we don't have experiments.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.640
But we can understand how the world actually works

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:10.480
with humility.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.240
This is really the key difference.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.960
The Keynesians think they just wanna copy

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.080
the methods of physics,

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:18.480
and then that's just gonna give them the certainty

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.400
of the results of physics,

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.240
which is like me saying,

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:23.680
I'm just gonna put a red blanket on my back

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.160
and jump from the fourth floor because I'm Superman.

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.480
Well, it's not the red blanket

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.000
that's gonna make me Superman.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.160
There's a lot more to it.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:33.480
So humility manifests itself in economics

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:35.600
as the belief in a free market,

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.400
meaning I can't centralize,

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:41.160
I can't do centralized control on this thing.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:44.480
We're going to minimize the friction

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.440
of the free exchange of goods.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:52.240
So Austrian economics puts priority in the market.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.680
Yes, and you could arrive at it through two paths.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.920
The more practical path,

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.280
which most scientific minded people arrive at,

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.520
I came from an engineering background.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.040
So I initially had this idea

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:09.200
that what is lacking in economics is mathematicization.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.280
We need to have better math models.

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.120
We need to get all of those tools from engineering,

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.200
apply them to economics,

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:17.120
and then we'll be able to plan the world economy

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.320
and make it work better.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:21.200
And then you start actually trying to solve problems,

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.320
trying to actually calculate them,

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.720
and you realize nobody can have that ability

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:28.440
because the difference ultimately comes down to the fact

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:29.800
we can't have experiments.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.080
And the reason we can't have experiments

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.920
is that you can experiment on particles of a gas.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.440
You can't experiment on human beings and entire economies.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:42.160
And because particles of a gas are just dumb matter.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:46.000
And so you kick matter in a certain way,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.760
you can calculate exactly how much is going to fly.

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.360
Human beings are much more complex.

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:51.680
They have a will inside them.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:52.920
And this is really,

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.400
this is the humility to understand

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.560
that you are a human being

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.400
and other people are also a human being just like you.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:03.600
And that every person wakes up every morning

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:06.400
and they have a million things in their mind,

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.680
a million things they care about,

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:09.480
a million things they want to do.

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:13.200
And you will never be able to make the decisions

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.680
for somebody else, let alone for millions of other people.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.000
So this is one path by which you arrive at the conclusion

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.040
that free markets are better

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.760
because you realize that all of the people

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.680
that think that they can centrally plan markets

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.920
can't actually do that.

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:30.560
And that there's really nothing scientific about them

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:33.160
except essentially the rituals they ape

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.320
of the scientific process.

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:38.120
And the other path I think that makes you arrive

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.200
at the Austrian perspective

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.440
or the libertarian perspective I should say,

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:47.000
is simply the notion of individuals

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.720
as having their own inalienable right

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.800
to decide what they want to do with themselves.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:55.720
If you, I mean, the only way that you can give yourself

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:59.280
the idea that you get to be planner

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:02.520
is ultimately you think you're better than other people.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:05.840
You think your choice, your judgment overrides mine.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.080
And I don't think that's a defensible position.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:11.640
I think I'm in no position to want to force anybody ever.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.480
I will never want to force anybody

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:15.840
to do anything they don't want.

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:16.960
The Keynesian perspective,

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:21.320
the central planning perspective is unlike physics,

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.240
which is let's force a bunch of particles

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:26.120
to sit in a lab so that we can study them.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.520
In economics, you're forcing people to do things.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:31.120
Let's stop these people from doing this job

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.400
because it's bad for the economy

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:34.040
and let's get them to do that job.

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.720
Let's force them to pay this price.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.520
Let's tax them this much.

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.480
Let's prevent them from using gold as money

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:42.280
and force them to use our credit as money.

01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:44.560
So it has to rely on coercion.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.640
There's no central planning without coercion.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.200
And coercion is a crime, in my opinion.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.720
There's no way that it is justifiable morally or ethically.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.120
So from a politics, from an ethical perspective,

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.680
your view is, I mean, perhaps broadly speaking

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:03.680
to the libertarian view is coercion is unethical.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.320
Freedom is essential.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.360
What are the pros and cons of government intervention

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.360
in the economy?

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.880
So can you provide pros?

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:19.080
You just kind of provided arguments against.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:22.600
Is there any arguments to be made for government intervention

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:25.240
for the role of government in society?

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:28.640
Speaking from a political or from an economics perspective,

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.440
what is a positive role of government

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.440
that you can imagine you can speak to?

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:34.920
I can repeat many other cases,

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.040
but I don't find any of them compelling

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.080
for the reason that I mentioned,

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.320
which is that ultimately they all rely on

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.520
putting a gun to somebody's head

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.800
and using the threat of force.

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:46.080
So that's, for me, can never be justifiable.

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:50.680
Whatever the ends are, if the means are violence

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:55.080
and the threat of violence, then the ends aren't justified.

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:58.360
Everything that's good, governments will use as an excuse

01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.880
to justify coercion.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.480
So what do you like?

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:03.040
You like motherhood and apple pie.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.040
Well, government needs to ensure that motherhood works well

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:09.520
and we need government central planning of birth.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.400
We need regulations on birth, for instance.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:14.480
We need regulations on how people give birth.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.160
We need to ban people from giving birth

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:18.120
in traditional ways that have been tried

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:18.960
for thousands of years.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.000
We need to force people to do things

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.840
in the modern scientific way.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.560
Well, so what about things like that all of us use,

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:29.520
so infrastructure, for example, or education,

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.560
or, well, the economy too, right?

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:38.480
Can you make a case for the role

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:42.120
of some large-scale centralized systems,

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.600
whether it's government or not,

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.360
that do this kind of management?

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.720
I guess perhaps you could say

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.840
there's the economies of scale argument

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.280
that some things must exist at a very large scale

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:56.840
and therefore you would want political accountability

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:58.120
of the people who manage them.

01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.040
This is kind of the argument

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.440
that's given for infrastructure monopolies.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.680
For instance, roads or electricity.

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:07.080
That, let's say we live in a country,

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.200
we need one power plant.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.160
The bigger the power plant, the better off we will all be.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:15.000
And there's a natural monopoly in the power plant business.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.160
So we're gonna have to have one power plant.

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.360
And since it's only one power plant,

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.080
then we can't just let anybody own it

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.360
because then they're gonna make it too expensive.

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.240
So we need to have the government own it

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.200
so it can make it too expensive.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.920
And you don't find that case compelling?

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.760
Not at all.

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:31.600
I used to believe in it.

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.680
I was pretty much a Keynesian

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:36.440
when I first started my graduate studies at Columbia.

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.280
And no, I don't find that compelling at all

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:42.800
because I think all these examples that they mentioned

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:45.640
of natural monopolies or economies of scale

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.720
that can only fit at a scale of government,

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.320
it's always, you know,

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.520
government bans people from opening power plants

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.240
and then there's only one power plant

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.280
and they need to be in charge of it.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:02.840
But in reality, no, in reality,

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.600
power plants can exist at all kinds of manners

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.440
of scales of operation.

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.880
And yes, of course there are benefits to centralization

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.320
in power plants in particular

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.200
because there's efficiency in generation.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:17.120
One big power plant is more efficient

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.040
than 10 equivalent smaller power plants.

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:22.320
But there's also inefficiencies in centralization

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.560
because the more centralized and the bigger the plant is,

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:29.920
the further away a lot of the population is going to be.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:31.960
So you're gonna be losing a lot of the electricity

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.560
and transmission.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:35.280
And you believe the free market is best

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.560
in managing that dance, that balance

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:39.240
of centralization.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.560
Exactly, and if we do end up in a situation

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.360
where there's one power plant for an area,

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:48.960
then if the market ends up centralizing all of it

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.760
into one power plant, I don't see that as a problem.

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.880
There are places, you know, there's a small town

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.080
with only one barbershop.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.480
Is that a catastrophe?

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:00.920
No, because they don't need two barbershops.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.520
Now, if that barbershop started to take advantage of people,

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.400
started to charge higher price,

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.480
well then that's just an opportunity for others

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:10.040
to step in and put them in their place.

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:11.440
And that's the same thing with power plants.

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.600
It's the same thing with everything.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.320
Ultimately, I think the key thing is this.

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:20.120
From the central planning perspective,

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.720
they'll present you the problem as it is

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.600
and they'll tell you, well, this is bad.

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:28.160
The fix, you know, and what we can do is better.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:31.920
So let's stop what's bad and do what is better.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:32.760
Two problems here.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:35.000
Usually the reason that the thing is bad

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.160
in the first place is because it is a government monopoly.

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:39.200
It's because of government intervention.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.040
But the second thing is that this notion

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.200
that we could just pass a law and fix what's wrong

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.920
and make it better, it ignores

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.800
the fundamental underlying reality,

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:53.160
which is that what you're doing is you're offering

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.560
only one way for this problem to be solved

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:58.400
and making all other solutions practically illegal.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.200
You're taking taxpayer money,

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:03.000
you're putting guns to people's heads to take their money,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.120
to use it to build, say, this one solution for a power plant,

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.520
but you're preventing the free market process

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:11.360
from providing us with other alternatives.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.720
Well, so you phrased it sort of from that perspective,

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:18.520
but in theory, there is a feedback accountability mechanism

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:22.400
for the solution that you propose and enforce

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.840
by, as you're saying, placing a gun to people's head.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:29.160
You're accountable for that choice,

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:32.640
for the quality of that solution by being voted out

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.720
if the solution is actually bad.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:37.320
So it's just a different selection mechanism.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.880
And I think, I personally believe it is a selection

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:43.560
mechanism that has worked in the past.

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:48.560
It just often does not work nearly as well as a free market.

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:52.040
And the question is, are there domains

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.800
in which the free market gets itself into trouble?

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.080
So this theoretical view is that

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.080
that's the point of a free market,

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:04.120
is it doesn't, if there's trouble, that's a signal,

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.840
and it will respond to that signal,

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.920
and it will respond appropriately

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.400
to try to maximize happiness.

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.520
The question is, is there a local optima

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.680
that free markets get stuck in and need governments

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.120
to represent the broader scale of the people

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.520
to get outside of that?

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:24.160
I think the fundamental problem here is the idea

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.120
that there is a feedback mechanism

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.920
when there is coercion in one party,

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.920
when one party can employ coercion

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:31.760
and the other one cannot.

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.840
So in other words, I'm gonna put a gun to your head,

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.280
I'm gonna take your money,

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.680
and I'm gonna use it to buy more guns

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.960
for me to put against your head.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:43.000
But somehow, you're gonna put a paper in a box

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.960
and that's going to deactivate my guns.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.040
Well, love requires a push and pull,

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:50.360
a little bit of tension, a little spice in a relationship,

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.720
a little gun to the head.

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.560
Good luck to anybody who's gonna be dating you

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.200
if you think you're putting a gun to people's head

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.840
is comparable to a relationship.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:04.640
All jokes, but yes, people don't often think of it

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:09.640
as government and the military as gun to the head,

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:13.720
but that is sort of a libertarian perspective

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:15.760
because ultimately, when you, you know,

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:18.720
turtles all the way down and at the bottom there's guns.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:20.760
Yeah, so at the bottom, if you don't wanna pay,

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:21.600
if you don't wanna, you know,

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.200
all right, I don't wanna be part of your power plant,

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.080
I wanna get my own generator, I don't wanna do it,

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:26.600
and I don't wanna pay for it.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.560
You go to jail, you can't not pay for it.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.560
That's really the asymmetry which the market doesn't have,

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:33.920
which is why, in my opinion, it's not as if, you know,

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:36.160
I'm being stubborn and stuck on the idea

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:39.360
that I want a market and that the government can't work.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.440
It's presented as if, you know,

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:42.680
we're choosing between two different machines,

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:45.760
you know, should we use an Apple or a PC,

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.520
and I'm just constantly choosing one of them

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:50.480
and saying that the other one can't work.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:52.320
It's not equivalent, it's not two machines.

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:56.480
We're comparing between a machine and a gun to the head,

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:57.880
and we're comparing between a situation

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.040
in which anybody, anywhere,

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:02.640
is free to provide the service or the good,

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.960
and anybody anywhere is free to buy it from them

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.760
or reject to buy it from them.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:08.680
So anyone can build a power plant,

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.040
anyone can succeed at it, anybody can fail at it,

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.600
anybody can build it in a way

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:15.800
that I can choose to take part in or not take part in.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.080
I can build my own.

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.280
So we have a situation in which 10 million people,

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.800
let's say, they each can freely choose

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:25.440
to provide the good or to buy the good.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:28.680
That cannot be considered an alternative

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:30.640
on an equal footing to a situation

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.720
where one person or one entity gets to decide for everybody

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:37.120
and those who disagree go to jail.

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:41.760
So the problem is that the alternative to governments

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:44.480
is other large successful entities

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:45.680
that have humans in them,

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:48.040
and human nature is such that there's corruption,

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:50.000
manipulation, and so on.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I think free market depends on the honest

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:59.840
communication of information as widely as possible

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.480
so people can make great rational decisions,

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:06.440
but sort of my fear is that, like the proposal is that

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:08.040
in general there's manipulation,

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.120
whether it's government, whether it's companies.

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.360
They're going to manipulate,

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.000
they're going to try to do propaganda,

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.960
they're going to try to manipulate you, deceive you,

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:19.920
shut down competition by playing games,

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.600
human games of different kinds,

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.360
and sometimes even meaning well.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.120
It's not like everybody thinks they're doing good

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:27.600
and they're actually doing evil.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:30.760
So how do we prevent the worst of human nature

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:35.000
coming out in a free market as well?

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.520
By not giving the worst of human nature,

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:40.760
a monopoly on violence in the institution of government.

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.920
That little inkling of coercion,

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:47.320
that little bit of asymmetry creates a gigantic

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:49.920
ripple effect of asymmetry in your view.

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:52.920
Yes, and it ends up just being the place where

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:55.160
corporations, individuals, free markets,

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:57.800
they can't coerce without the resort to government.

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:01.080
So you think about all the examples of corrupt corporations

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:05.520
doing bad things, it's always because they have

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:10.080
certain privileges from governments because as it exists,

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:13.080
Coca-Cola, McDonald's, all of these giant corporations,

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.840
they can't do anything to me without government.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.120
They can't take any of my money

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.280
and they can't force me to buy their stuff.

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:21.480
And so it doesn't matter to me.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:24.040
So if Coca-Cola is corrupted,

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:25.840
that's a problem for Coca-Cola customers,

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.960
that's a problem for Coca-Cola shareholders,

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.960
that's a problem for anybody who deals with Coca-Cola,

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:32.480
but as somebody who doesn't drink their stuff

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:34.400
and isn't a shareholder,

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.560
I have absolutely no interest in what happens.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:39.040
They could all go bust tomorrow and I don't care.

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:43.240
I don't buy their product and I'm not a shareholder.

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:46.440
So in this situation where you choose to voluntarily

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:50.160
associate with people and you only give your money

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.480
to people you want to voluntarily give the money to,

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.840
so you either buy their product or invest

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.440
in their production, in that situation,

01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:59.800
the only way that a company can get my money

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:03.160
is if they build the product that I value

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:07.320
or if they convince me that they are going to use it

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.680
in a way that's profitable.

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:12.680
I may be wrong, I may invest in a company that fails

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:17.280
or I may invest in a company that turns out to be fraudulent,

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.440
but that's my fault.

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:24.720
It's my fault that I gave them my money

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.840
and then it turned out to be scoundrels,

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.920
but it's a totally different problem

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:31.480
when we make it mandatory.

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:36.080
No, it's violence, it's a crime to put a gun to my head

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.480
and force me to subsidize companies

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.280
and force me to comment certain conclusions.

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:43.160
Do you find an interesting distinction,

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:44.200
you mentioned Michael Malice,

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.720
between anarchism and libertarianism,

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.800
so this particular use of violence,

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.680
this last resort, this policing force

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:56.200
that libertarianism is okay with

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.720
and anarchism is not okay with,

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:02.360
so basically nation-states that keep you safe

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:05.320
from the worst of war?

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.520
Yeah, I think to be more accurate,

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:07.360
there are other distinctions

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.040
between anarchism and minarchism.

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.640
I think libertarianism is kind of a vague term

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:13.400
that can encompass both.

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:14.480
It means a lot of things, okay.

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:15.520
Yeah, but-

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:19.880
On the Karl Marx to Michael Malice spectrum,

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:20.720
where do you-

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.160
No, no, I'm full anarchist.

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.000
You're full anarchist.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:23.840
Yeah, full anarchist.

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:26.320
I mean, I don't find any justification

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.720
for the use of force

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:31.480
and I think recently perhaps I've,

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.800
maybe I'm getting old, maybe I'm getting senile,

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:36.080
maybe I'm getting wise, who knows,

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:39.640
but I'm beginning to become more sympathetic to monarchy.

01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.680
So I'm an anarchist-

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:42.520
Which is what, sorry?

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.360
Monarchy.

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:44.440
Which, what is that?

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:45.280
King's royal.

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:46.120
Oh, monarchy.

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:46.960
Yeah.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:49.040
And I think-

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.840
Wait, are you joking or not?

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:53.120
No, I'm not joking.

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:58.120
And I think, I mean, I think morally and intellectually,

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:02.360
I'm an anarchist, but the reality is we find ourselves

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:05.560
in a world in which a lot of people are not

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:09.400
and the question is what is the thing

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:12.800
that is going to provide you with more freedom?

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:16.760
And I think I'm recently coming around to the idea

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:21.080
that monarchy might be the best way to provide people

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.120
with the largest amount of freedom

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.880
because to have a free society,

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:28.080
you need a majority perhaps or a plurality of people

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.920
to have a very strong understanding of libertarian ideas,

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.160
to have a low time preference,

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.760
to have a preference for the future.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.520
So you need a majority of the population

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:41.360
to not decide to go and do something insane

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:44.120
in order to continue to have a free society.

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:48.640
When a respiratory illness comes along,

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:51.480
unfortunately, the last couple of years showed

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:56.160
that the vast majority of people are gonna freak out

01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:58.560
and lose their mind and support whatever

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.520
their stupid TV tells them to support.

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:03.600
And there's always a current thing

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.840
and the media is always telling you

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.320
that we need this current thing as an excuse

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.240
for more and more government power

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:11.640
and more and more government coercion.

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.120
What's the role of kings and queens

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:15.960
in that case of a monarchy?

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.760
What's the role of a leader?

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.840
I think there might be a case that,

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:24.320
so as I was saying, you need a majority of the population

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:28.760
to get together and decide, nope, whatever is the case,

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.480
the answer is voluntary.

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.120
No matter how bad the disease is,

01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.320
it doesn't justify forcing people to stay home.

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.520
You wanna stay home, stay home.

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:39.640
You wanna wear a mask, take a vaccine,

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:42.440
do whatever you want, but you can't force others to do that.

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:43.920
So you need a majority of the people

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:46.440
to strongly believe in this principle

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:49.520
in order to get it in a democracy.

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:54.440
Whereas in a monarchy, you just need the king to get it.

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:57.400
And I think the reason kings are more likely to get it

01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:00.000
is that kings have a low time preference

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.520
where they think about things for many generations.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.440
Whereas in a democratic system,

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:08.240
your president is likely only going to be there

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:10.640
for four years or eight years or 10 years

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:12.600
or five years or whatever it is.

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:15.920
So the only way that, all humans are self-interested.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:17.920
So the only way that your president in a democracy

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:19.840
can provide for themselves

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.440
is to maximize the amount of exploitation

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.120
that they can do of the population

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.400
during their brief stint.

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.680
And then when he's out, you get a new one

01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:30.520
and then that one wants to start all over again.

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:33.040
So every four years, you get a new robber.

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:38.040
With monarchy, you sign up for a multi-generational

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:41.360
subscription to the same family.

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.200
And when they have the security of knowing that

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.560
his great-grandson is going to be taking money

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.720
from your great-grandson, suddenly his interests

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:55.480
in yours align because they both want

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:57.800
your great-grandson to be prosperous

01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:00.240
and have enough money for his great-grandson to take.

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:02.320
It's a monarchy with a tiny government.

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:07.320
So anything required to really provide for a free market.

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.000
So for maximizing individual freedom

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.440
and the freedom of the economy.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:13.680
Yeah, and if I were a king,

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:16.080
which is highly unlikely to ever happen,

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:18.240
but I think if you look historically,

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:21.120
the dynasties that have succeeded

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.160
had lasted for a long time.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.920
The key thing that they managed to do

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:26.880
is to basically be libertarian.

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:29.760
The key to being a good king is to just leave people alone,

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.120
let them do whatever they want,

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:34.200
don't rob them too much or rob them as little as possible

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.080
or maybe even don't rob them.

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:40.520
And as a king, use your power only

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:43.160
to punish people who aggress against others.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.840
Don't use your power to enrich yourself

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.280
and enrich your friends.

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:49.680
And that's really, like if you look at smart kings,

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:51.680
this is what they do, this is what they teach their children.

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.800
And the cycle of kingdoms is that the first king

01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:57.520
understands this, builds the empire.

01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:00.800
And the first couple of generations, they get this

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:04.640
and the society is free, the economy is free.

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:09.080
And because of that, there's peace and prosperity.

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:12.440
But then over time, the next generation of kids

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.760
become a lot more high time preference.

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:17.280
They haven't worked hard,

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.960
they don't understand the meaning of hard work.

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:23.720
So they become more likely to engage

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:24.960
in destructive behavior.

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:29.960
So raise taxes, pass laws that require people to do things

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:33.880
even when they're not hurting anybody.

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.360
And that ends up basically

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:37.000
eventually destroying the kingdom.

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:40.320
Of course, power corrupts.

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.800
So you have to kind of create human institutions

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.960
that prevent you as a king or any kind of leader

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:48.360
from expanding.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:52.160
So going back on the original promises

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.560
and the purposes of your position,

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:58.800
and then using tools of technology and communication

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.320
to distract the populace while you expand the power.

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:02.160
Exactly.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:03.400
All right.

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.800
You wrote the Fiat Standard.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.560
I think we danced around it quite a bit,

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.200
but I don't know if we actually defined it.

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:11.880
So what is Fiat money?

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:14.680
What is the history of how it came to be?

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.120
The fascinating history of the birth

01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.480
of the Fiat monetary system is something

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:21.720
that really only got uncovered in 2017.

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:25.080
This is extremely, extremely interesting.

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:29.640
In 1914, Britain joined World War I.

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:31.720
And if you remember your history books,

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.320
it's famous that this was called August Bank Holiday.

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.760
It was just going to be a few weeks

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:38.320
where the British troops were gonna go

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:41.760
and kick European ass and come back triumphant.

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.080
And most European countries believed that.

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:46.360
But then the war kept on dragging on.

01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.360
And of course, to finance the war,

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:49.960
the government, this is what they used to do

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:52.960
under the gold standard governments would issue bonds.

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:55.640
So you'd issue the bonds, people would buy the bonds,

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:57.960
the money would be used to finance the military,

01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:00.680
and then the government would pay off the bond

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:03.000
over the next five or 10 or 20 years.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.200
So for World War I, the British government,

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:10.200
the British treasury issued bonds for financing the war.

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:13.400
And this only came to light in 2017.

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.840
Only a third of the bonds were actually subscribed.

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.520
So people, British people, and this is perhaps

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.280
the greatest thing that they've ever done,

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.200
they decided fighting a war in Europe

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:25.240
is just not my ideal way of investing my capital.

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:26.080
It's a stupid thing.

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:27.280
Why should I go and fight?

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:30.160
Because the Austrians and the Germans and the Serbians

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:34.200
are at each other's throats.

01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.160
I'd rather invest in something else.

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:38.920
So they only bought a third of the bond issue.

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:42.120
And then the astonishing thing that happened,

01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:44.160
which really set the tone for the next century

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:49.120
of war, murder, Keynesianism, and theft and inflation

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:53.160
was that the Bank of England went and got two

01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:56.720
of the high-ranking officials in the Bank of England

01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:59.480
to buy the other remaining outstanding two-thirds

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:01.560
of the bonds under their own name

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.200
with a line of credit from the Bank of England.

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:04.720
So it wasn't their own money,

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:06.680
but they took money essentially from the Bank of England,

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:10.440
bought two-thirds of the bonds that financed the war.

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.720
And that was how England was able

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:14.880
to keep going into the war.

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:17.120
So that's essentially what they did

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:20.160
is what we today know as quantitative easing.

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:23.760
Back then, they just got, they printed money

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:26.240
from the Bank of England, or credit, printed credit,

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:29.040
gave it to those two employees.

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:30.040
They bought the bonds.

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:32.400
The government could fight the war.

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.560
Sounds like it's a nice idea.

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:38.160
And Keynes, of course, being a huckster himself,

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:42.120
he himself said this was, he wrote a letter

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:44.000
to the Bank of England that was uncovered recently.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.880
And he said, I congratulate you

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:48.040
on this masterly manipulation.

01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:49.440
I quote it in the book,

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.680
masterly manipulation is what he called it,

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:54.760
that they basically managed to buy the bonds

01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:56.440
using the money of the government.

01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:00.040
And of course, he never had an idea of how economics works

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.640
because he never could ask the question of,

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:02.800
okay, and then what?

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.400
All right, so we just printed money

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:07.360
to buy two-thirds of these government bonds.

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.040
What's gonna happen next?

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.400
What could go wrong?

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:12.840
Not a question Keynesians ask themselves

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:16.760
because their jobs depend on not thinking

01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:18.280
about what's going to go wrong.

01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:20.680
So just a quick question about war.

01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:23.680
And somebody has been nonstop reading

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:26.680
and thinking about the wars of the 20th century

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:31.680
and thinking that most of those wars

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:34.520
were unjust, unethical, and destructive.

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:40.160
How else do you find, how would you finance a war?

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:41.960
Ideally, you don't.

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:43.080
No, but I mean, of course, there are,

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:45.120
sometimes you wanna fight for self-defense.

01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:48.520
Yeah, and then you finance it, taxation or bonds.

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:51.160
So the people really need to want to war

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:55.240
not just with their voices, their thoughts, their tweets,

01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:56.760
or their actual financial investment.

01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:58.160
They gotta put up the bullets

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:00.400
and the cost of the bullets and the bodies.

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:03.640
So their life and their financial well-being.

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:07.400
That's how it was under the gold standard mostly

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:09.240
because under the gold standard,

01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:10.680
the government couldn't print gold.

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:12.040
And so they had a budget

01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:13.480
and they had a certain amount of gold.

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:15.600
And that wasn't just that they couldn't

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.760
infinitely increase it.

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:20.200
So they couldn't tax their population at will.

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:23.080
And it's very difficult to take money from people.

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:25.600
You go knock on doors and search everybody's home,

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.280
see where they're hiding their gold.

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:28.600
It's very complicated.

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:30.200
On the other hand, when you gave them paper money,

01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:33.240
which is what the case was in 1914,

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:36.240
you could take their wealth just by printing the money.

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:38.800
And that's what changed everything when it comes to war.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:41.960
That's why the 20th century was the century of total war

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:43.200
because under the gold standard,

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:46.400
governments fought until they ran out of their own gold.

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:48.720
Under the fiat standard, with paper money,

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:52.080
with credit money, governments fought until they ran out

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:55.840
of liquid wealth in the hands of all of their citizens.

01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:00.840
So let's find flaws in this thinking if there's any.

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.280
Okay.

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.880
There's a lot of pacifist type of thinking

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:10.040
in World War II as Hitler was expanding and expanding,

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:14.640
Hitler framed himself as a victim of the past, of history.

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:16.560
He never attacked anybody.

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:18.960
Everyone's always threatening to attack him.

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:21.560
That's kind of the narrative and he keeps expanding.

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.680
He keeps sweet talking with his charisma,

01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:25.920
all the countries around him,

01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:28.840
into sort of embracing pacifism,

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.840
stay out of the war until the war's on your doorstep.

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:36.840
So France, just very suboptimal military strength

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:39.960
strategy from the perspective of many European nations

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.880
in response to Hitler.

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:45.640
They were basically hoodwinked by his words.

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:50.640
So then there's Churchill, Winston Churchill,

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:55.320
who stepped up and says that perhaps irrationally,

01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:57.920
from some kind of economics perspective,

01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:59.960
saying we're not going to back down.

01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:01.600
We're going to fight Germany.

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:05.240
And perhaps that step alone is one of the biggest reasons

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:09.160
that Hitler failed in his expansion.

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:13.600
That decision to fight back,

01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:18.840
what's the right way to do that?

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.440
If you're a Winston Churchill,

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:23.040
what's the right way to do that?

01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:30.440
To fight back evil when violence is required.

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:35.440
Now, you could argue that no war is just,

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:38.840
but there are such a thing as a just war index.

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:41.920
And a lot of people argue if there is a just war

01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:44.880
in the 20th century, it's World War II.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.800
So how would you fund, if you were Britain, the war?

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:54.560
Would you require Winston Churchill to convince the populace?

01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:57.480
Like, don't fight until they're fully convinced

01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:59.080
that this is the right thing to do.

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:01.200
You can't just make a decision for them.

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.920
You have to convince them fully

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:04.360
so that they give their life

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:07.720
and they give their money to support the war.

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:08.680
Is that the right way to do it?

01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:09.520
I think so.

01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:14.040
And I think when you have a true threat and a true evil

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:18.280
and a true force that people really do think is genuine,

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:19.360
you don't need to convince them.

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:22.720
I mean, when it's real, people will want to fight

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:24.400
and people will want to pay to fight.

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:28.880
And I mean, I think though on this particular example,

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:31.680
the best way to fight Hitler is to have not fought

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:36.080
World War I and not take out the Kaiser of Germany.

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:40.120
If Britain in the US had not gotten involved

01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:44.560
in World War I, which really is the senseless war

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:46.600
about nothing, what was in it?

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:49.600
And what was the goal from anybody fighting that war?

01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:52.360
If you look at it, after World War I,

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:56.080
there were very minor adjustments in the borders

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.680
of the countries that were participating.

01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:00.840
So Germany lost some land, Austria lost some land,

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:04.320
but really it wasn't all that massive.

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:09.320
And it wasn't like Britain wanted to take over Germany

01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:12.040
and move their people into Germany and kick the Germans out.

01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:17.040
So there was no real value from that war.

01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:18.120
And that's why the British people

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.960
didn't want to take part in it.

01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:22.760
And that's why if they haven't done

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:25.560
this enormously criminal manipulation

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:28.520
of printing money to buy the bonds,

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.720
Britain wouldn't have gotten into the war.

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:34.520
Germany would still be a kingdom and Hitler wouldn't rise.

01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:38.080
And yeah, there'd be small changes in the borders

01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:41.440
of various European countries.

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:44.840
I struggled to see how it could have been worse.

01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:47.920
I mean, I struggled to see who benefited

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:50.800
from four years of carnage in Europe.

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:53.640
And this came at the height of civilization.

01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:58.640
Before that, the people of Europe had the golden era

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:00.200
under the gold standard.

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.240
They were trading with one another.

01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:04.440
They traveled and technology was advancing.

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:08.800
And they did not expect this war to last this long.

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:11.400
And my favorite story from World War I

01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:14.880
is the Christmas truce football game,

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:16.520
which I mentioned in my book.

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:19.680
British and German soldiers at the height of the conflict,

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:20.760
they stopped on Christmas day

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:23.160
and they played a football game against each other.

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:28.560
This is not a real war where it's a war for survival.

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.360
Britain didn't wanna end Germany.

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:31.880
Germany didn't wanna end Britain.

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:35.960
It was just kings who were emboldened

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:38.480
by the fact that they had a printing press

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:40.240
playing with the lives of the people.

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:44.680
Take that away, take away the printing press,

01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:46.400
take away their ability to print money.

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:48.920
I think we'd have had a much, much,

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:51.000
much better 20th century.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.560
Yeah, the counterfactual history.

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:54.080
Neil Ferguson is a historian

01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:59.080
who gets in quite a bit of trouble basically.

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:02.160
Well, he's a Brit suggesting that if Britain stayed out

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:04.400
of World War I, there would be no Hitler.

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.000
There would be no World War II.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.560
Yep, I agree entirely.

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:10.680
But fiat money.

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.320
Yeah, so how fiat money was born.

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:13.600
Yeah, let's get back to that.

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:16.200
So they financed the war with that money.

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.040
So what could go wrong?

01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:19.280
That's where we left off.

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:20.320
Well, what could go wrong

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:23.760
when you've just printed an enormous amount of credit

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:26.800
and use it to buy bonds?

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.600
What goes wrong is that the value of the currency

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:29.640
is going to go down.

01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:32.920
Or in other words, prices of things are gonna go up.

01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:35.280
So during the war, prices keep going up.

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:38.080
And this is of course,

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:39.280
this is gonna sound very familiar

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.600
to victims of the 20th century.

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.440
A government tells you it's because of the war,

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.280
it's not our fault, it's because of the Germans,

01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:47.160
it's because of the foreigners, it's because of Putin,

01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.160
it's because of this, it's because of that.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:50.320
This has always been the case.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:55.120
There's always, war is a very good cover for inflation,

01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:57.920
which is caused by monetary phenomena.

01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:59.760
So then the war ends.

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:02.680
And inflation, prices have more than doubled

01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:04.800
over the past four years,

01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:07.680
over the four years of World War I,

01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:09.440
prices have more than doubled.

01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:13.520
And then the British economy is in bad trouble, obviously.

01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:16.400
It's lost a lot of the labor force for four years

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.320
that was out there fighting.

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:20.640
Now those workers come back.

01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:23.240
You've got, prices are up.

01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:25.040
And so people are requiring,

01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:27.320
are demanding that the government control prices.

01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:29.480
And the government is trying to fix the problem

01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:31.040
of inflation by doing price controls,

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.880
which is what they always do,

01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:36.080
which is catastrophic because it makes things worse.

01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:38.600
When you implement price controls,

01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.640
you, when you make, when you say,

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:42.640
all right, well, bread can't be sold

01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:45.440
for more than X price.

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:48.280
Well, that's just preventing bread producers

01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:50.000
from producing a lot of bread.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.640
And that's just making the problem worse.

01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:55.240
If you let the price rise, the extra price,

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:56.920
first of all, it makes people economize.

01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:58.840
So people will only buy what they need.

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:00.880
And it provides the money for the bread producers

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:03.320
to acquire the capital and the resources

01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:04.920
they need to produce more bread,

01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:06.560
which then brings the price of bread down,

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:08.560
but price controls destroy that.

01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:10.720
And then they also implement wage controls.

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:15.240
So you wanna also make sure that people have high wages.

01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:17.160
So you raise people's wages artificially,

01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:18.680
you lower prices artificially,

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:21.320
and you cause an economic problem.

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:23.320
And this is basically, you know,

01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:25.040
I use this historical example

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:26.760
because it's the birth of fiat,

01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:27.760
because the Bank of England

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:29.480
was the most important monetary system

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:30.840
in the world at that time.

01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:33.640
And because it's the prototype

01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:35.200
that basically the entire planet copied

01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:36.280
over the last hundred years.

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:38.200
We've had this same thing happen.

01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:40.360
The government prints money because of a stupid reason,

01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:42.320
because somebody in power decided

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:44.880
this was worth destroying everybody's livelihood

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:46.240
and savings for.

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:47.680
And then the consequences come in

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:48.880
and then they start covering up

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.720
with price controls, wage controls,

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:52.800
and then that makes things worse.

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:57.520
And then they, and of course, throughout all of that,

01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:58.880
they're promising that we're going to go,

01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:01.280
oh, and also the other thing that they did,

01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:03.120
which I mentioned in the chapter is,

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:05.360
they stopped people from using physical gold

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.520
and they confiscated the, well, they didn't confiscate it,

01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:10.080
but they took the physical gold and they gave people paper.

01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:12.240
So I call it the fiat white paper.

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:14.040
You know, in Bitcoin we have the white paper.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.400
The fiat white paper was that the Bank of England

01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:20.040
announced to all of its banks and post offices

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:23.240
that from now on you should not make payment in gold

01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:24.960
and you should take payment in gold

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:26.360
and you should encourage all your customers

01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.680
to turn in all of their gold and give them paper instead.

01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:30.080
Is there an actual document?

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:30.920
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:31.760
Nice.

01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:33.440
Yeah, it was, this is all new stuff.

01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:35.400
Obviously nobody really likes to talk about this stuff

01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:36.920
because, you know, they're fiat economists,

01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:41.200
so they don't want to talk about the original sin, but.

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:42.920
Well, you should like republish it

01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:45.480
as the fiat white paper or something like that.

01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:49.720
There's a fascinating book by a guy called John Osborne.

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:53.160
So in the 1920s, I think his name was Montagu.

01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:54.840
He was the chief of the Bank of England.

01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:58.640
He commissioned one of his secretaries, John Osborne,

01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:02.560
to study what the bank did during World War I

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:05.600
and it was a study that was kept under wraps,

01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:07.720
confidential, in the Bank of England,

01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:12.160
only released in 2017, almost a century later.

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:15.120
What was special about 2017, by the way?

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:15.960
It's a year.

01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:19.840
It was a year in which some of this information was released.

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:22.320
Yeah, a bunch of people got into parts of the basements

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.360
of the Bank of England and found this and published it

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:26.120
and now you can download it as a PDF

01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:28.680
and find all of the amazing details.

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:31.480
So they confiscated the gold

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:32.960
and they forced people to use the paper

01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:33.800
and they promised people

01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:35.560
that as soon as the war is going to be over,

01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:38.200
this is temporary, we're going to be back to using gold.

01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:41.960
And of course, you know, if you told people in Britain,

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:43.880
this is the real scam about fiat,

01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:47.000
if you told people in Britain in 1914,

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
hey, we're going to go off the gold standard

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.240
because it's better.

01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:53.320
I mean, there might've been lynchings

01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:56.640
of government officials because the British pound

01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:00.520
at that point, it had been the global currency

01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:04.720
of the whole world and the fact that they'd managed,

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:07.040
the Bank of England had kept the British pound

01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:10.840
at a fixed rate next to gold for, since Newton,

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:13.960
the exchange rate, the value of the British pound

01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:16.360
was set by Isaac Newton himself.

01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.520
He was the warden of the mint

01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:22.080
and he made the pound a specific amount of gold.

01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:24.680
And since then, up until World War I,

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:28.520
it was 4.25 pounds per ounce of gold.

01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:31.400
I think I might be wrong, but I have it in the book.

01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:33.280
So he'd set that price and it was a matter

01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:35.880
of national pride for people in England.

01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:37.520
The sterling is as good as gold

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:40.280
because for two centuries it has been stuck to gold.

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:42.400
There was the exception of the Napoleonic Wars,

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:45.200
but for two centuries, mostly it was stuck to that.

01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:49.120
And so they went off that and then they couldn't go back

01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:50.240
because if they wanted to go back,

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:51.240
they didn't have enough gold.

01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:54.640
They shipped their gold to the US to finance the war

01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:56.760
and they had printed a whole bunch of money

01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:58.000
that was out there.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.240
So this begins the problem for England

01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:05.160
and that begins the end of England as the world's superpower.

01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:07.480
And the way they tried to fight that was to get more

01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:08.560
and more countries around the world

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:12.200
to establish central banks and have unholed British pounds.

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:13.560
So they'd hold, you know,

01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:17.840
basically dumping their bags like just any other shit coin.

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:20.040
You just, if you get people to buy your shit coin,

01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:21.840
you know, that raises the value of your shit coin.

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:22.680
So-

01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:23.960
Can you define shit coin?

01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:27.000
Shit coin is, in my definition of a shit coin

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.720
is that it's any form of money

01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:31.360
where somebody can produce it.

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:32.360
So soft money.

01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:35.080
Not necessarily, I guess.

01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:37.360
I think the difference, so there's easy money,

01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:42.120
but the shit coin is something that someone can produce

01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:44.040
at a rate that is different,

01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:46.520
at a cost that is different from the market cost.

01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:49.480
So gold, nobody can make gold except that they dig for it.

01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:52.480
And the cost of mining gold is generally in the range

01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:53.640
of the price of gold.

01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:56.440
Seems true for Bitcoin.

01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:57.760
So gold is not a shit coin.

01:44:57.760 --> 01:44:59.360
Gold is not a shit coin.

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:00.440
The copper is.

01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:03.280
I'm not so sure.

01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:04.320
I wouldn't call copper a shit coin

01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:05.800
as much as it is easy money.

01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:09.800
But I think government currencies and other alt coins

01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:10.640
I think are shit coins

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:13.080
because somebody could click a button

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:14.960
and make 10 times the supply.

01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:18.040
Would it be fair to say that this began

01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:23.120
with the will for war in World War I?

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:28.120
So the march towards fiat began

01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:35.160
with a global desire for war in the 20th century.

01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:39.720
Did war start this or was war a result?

01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:40.880
It's difficult to say really.

01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:42.240
I think it goes both ways.

01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:47.240
I think you can't have permanent war without fiat.

01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:51.720
And I also think there's a case to be made

01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:54.720
that you can't really have fiat without war.

01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:57.480
So it's some kind of weird dynamical system

01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:59.360
with a chicken and egg situation

01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:00.800
and they build it on top of each other.

01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:03.000
And there's a few individuals that figured out

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.840
there's a way to manipulate this to play this kind of game

01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:07.640
and it escalates.

01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:11.240
And nothing gives you the ability to manipulate money

01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:12.200
quite like war.

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:15.520
When you have a war, you can declare an emergency.

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:19.400
You can call all the people who oppose you traitors.

01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:23.680
You can get people to support you

01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:25.400
not because what you're doing is good,

01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:28.280
but because you play on their sense of tribalism.

01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:31.000
In your book, you do cost benefit analysis.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.760
So you do acknowledge or think about the pros of fiat currency.

01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:41.000
Can you do just that, look at the benefit

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.880
and look at the cost just broadly at the highest level?

01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:45.640
So the way that I write the fiat standard

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:49.400
is that I try and analyze it as an engineering system

01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:51.440
in the same way that I wrote the Bitcoin standard.

01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:52.280
So with the Bitcoin standard,

01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:54.040
I looked at Bitcoin from first principles

01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:57.280
and tried to explain how it works for a reader

01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:59.280
that doesn't really have much of a background

01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:03.760
in computer science, networks, or economics.

01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:05.520
And I thought I'll do the same with the fiat.

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:07.480
Let's just ignore the official stories

01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:10.280
and look at how this thing actually works.

01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:15.280
And I think it does have value in the fact that it...

01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:19.320
The reason that they were able to pull it off

01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:22.080
is because it was not possible for people

01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:25.520
who don't want to be part of it

01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:28.000
to use gold independently of governments.

01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.520
This is really the key thing.

01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:31.880
Gold is just very expensive to move around.

01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:36.080
And the fact that it is expensive to move around

01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:41.080
means that there's inevitably going to emerge institutions

01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:45.160
where it is centralized in physical location.

01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:48.680
And then these institutions trade liabilities for the gold.

01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:53.680
So really the gold standard intrinsically must involve credit

01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:57.160
as becoming part of the monetary system.

01:47:57.160 --> 01:47:59.920
It has to be the credit and because it gets centralized

01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:02.200
it can easily be captured by the government.

01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:05.960
So to be fair, the benefit of the fiat system

01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:08.480
is that it saves us on the cost of moving gold around,

01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:10.080
which is pretty significant.

01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:13.920
Like generally, moving a bar of gold across the Atlantic

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:16.920
is gonna cost somewhere between 0.1 to 1%

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:18.760
of the cost of the gold bar.

01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:21.440
So you move it 100 times back and forth

01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:23.480
between the Atlantic and the United States.

01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:25.320
So if you're moving the Atlantic

01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:27.160
you need to pay the whole gold bar,

01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:28.400
the cost of the whole gold bar

01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:30.160
to move it 100 times across.

01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:33.080
Well, with fiat money, it's essentially government credit.

01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:35.440
And so it's just sending a message

01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:37.920
from one central bank to another

01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:40.000
and you can move it halfway around the world.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.160
Is there also something to be said about the cost in time?

01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:46.280
So you're saving, you're reducing the friction

01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:47.640
of the communication as well.

01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:48.480
Exactly.

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:49.680
Of the transactions as well.

01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:51.040
Exactly, it's faster.

01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:52.760
How big is that benefit?

01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:55.000
Because wouldn't you argue that that potential

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.400
is the thing that enables modern economy,

01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:59.160
both the speed and the low cost,

01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:01.960
so increasing the scale and the frequency,

01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:03.920
the speed of the transactions?

01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:07.400
Yeah, arguably it does help in that regard.

01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:10.200
However, it isn't as if you couldn't have

01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:12.440
fast transactions built on top of gold.

01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:15.400
So you could have gold being used for final settlement

01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:19.600
and you could have banks settling with one another,

01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:21.120
essentially using credit settlement.

01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:24.160
Can you define settlement just for people

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:25.440
who are outside of this world?

01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:27.440
Because we'll mention that word quite a bit probably.

01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:28.280
Good question.

01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:29.960
So the way that it works is let's say right now

01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:34.960
I'm gonna pay you $10 over PayPal or credit card.

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:37.080
So it shows up in your PayPal or credit card

01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:40.040
within a few seconds that I've sent you the money

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:41.280
and then that's yours.

01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:46.280
But it didn't also happen in those 10 seconds

01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:49.840
that my bank, which could be in another country,

01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:53.480
sent the money to your bank, into your account.

01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:57.160
It's, there's a lot of infrastructure underneath that.

01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:59.200
So what actually happened is that I have an account

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:01.600
with my bank and you have an account with your bank

01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:05.520
and when the message is communicated from my app to yours,

01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:07.560
my bank crosses out the money

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:10.080
and your bank credits you with the money.

01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:13.440
And then at the end of the day, week or month,

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:16.520
banks in the same city will settle with one another,

01:50:16.520 --> 01:50:19.480
banks in the same country will settle with one another

01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:21.680
and banks from different countries

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:22.840
will settle with one another.

01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:27.000
So they won't move the $10 from my account to yours.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.560
At the end of the day or week or month,

01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:32.160
they'll tally all of the money that was sent

01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:33.840
from one bank to the other

01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:35.320
and then just settle the difference.

01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:37.040
So turns out at the end of the month,

01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:40.400
my bank had sent $15 million to your bank

01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:43.480
and your bank had sent $14 million to my bank.

01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:46.840
So they give them $1 million and that settles it.

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:48.920
That finalizes the transaction.

01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:51.680
So final settlement 3D is like the,

01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:54.640
you can think about it as the infrastructure of the system

01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:56.840
and then you can think of these things

01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:59.360
as being the higher layer levels.

01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:01.120
And you had a wonderful discussion about that

01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:02.760
with Michael Saylor.

01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:06.000
So the final settlement is like the moment

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.280
when you paper and ideas connect to physical reality.

01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:13.800
Or to some representation of physical reality.

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:15.600
Yeah, and under gold,

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:17.760
everything was tethered to physical reality

01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:19.080
because there was a market commodity

01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:20.560
at the bottom of all of this

01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:22.480
and nobody could print that market commodity.

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:24.000
And so at the end of the month,

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.280
if your bank made too many payments,

01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:29.720
if you made too many payments, there was a reckoning.

01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:33.080
If you were reckless, if you were insolvent,

01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:34.480
you went out of business.

01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:37.680
So there was no way to fool that.

01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:39.880
But then we moved to the fiat century

01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:41.920
and everything is credit.

01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:42.760
At the end of the day,

01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:45.720
the final layer is government credit.

01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:48.640
And so as long as you're friends with the government,

01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:50.280
basically you never go bankrupt.

01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:54.240
So all kinds of hucksters managed to find their way

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:58.840
into getting into position where they don't get bankrupt.

01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:03.000
So in part two of the fiat standard called fiat life,

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.600
you described the effects of fiat money

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:08.880
on a bunch of things like life, food, science, education.

01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:14.000
What is the most pernicious effect of fiat money

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.440
on our world, on our life?

01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:18.120
So it's taking a step outside of the monetary system,

01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:21.760
actually like how that affects our life from this book.

01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:23.440
I mean, there's a whole bunch of things

01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:25.400
and I won't be able to go over them

01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:26.800
and I highly recommend reading the book.

01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:28.480
But if I were to pick one,

01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:29.840
I would say it's the impact that it has

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:33.600
on our time preference, on our valuation of the future.

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:35.640
So remember when we started the discussion,

01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:38.880
when I said that the key function of money

01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:41.440
is that it serves as a store of value

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:42.960
and the harder the money is,

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:45.240
the better it is at providing us

01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:48.200
with a way for providing for our future.

01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:49.840
And so the harder the money is,

01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:51.320
the less we discount the future.

01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:53.200
We always discount the future compared to the present.

01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:56.240
So if I told you, I'm gonna give you something today

01:52:56.240 --> 01:52:59.720
versus giving it to you 10 years from now, the same thing,

01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:00.880
you would prefer to take it now

01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:03.280
because then you'd get to enjoy it over the next 10 years.

01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:06.520
So we always prefer the present to the future.

01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:09.120
There's always a discount on the future

01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:10.920
and that discount is called time preference.

01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:13.640
The degree to which we prefer the present to the future

01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:15.440
is called our time preference.

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:19.000
So the higher our time preference,

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.880
the less we care about the future.

01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:22.240
And the process of civilization

01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:24.680
is the process of lowering our time preference

01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:26.620
where we start caring more for the future,

01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:29.720
we start prioritizing the present less and less.

01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:32.560
So we start being able to not consume

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:34.800
everything that we have and store it.

01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:36.680
And so money is essential for that.

01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:38.680
And under the gold standard,

01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:40.720
everyone in the world had the ability

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:42.380
to provide for their future

01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:44.440
by simply using the same money that they use.

01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:47.600
You would work a day and you would get paid in a gold coin

01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:49.120
and you could take that gold coin

01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:51.760
and keep it safe for 10 years

01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:54.020
and know that at the end of those 10 years,

01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:56.760
that gold coin would buy you slightly more

01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:59.440
than what it bought you the day that you earned it.

01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:01.520
So anybody could provide for their future

01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:04.640
and anybody could have very high degree of certainty

01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:08.200
that whatever they're saving is going to be there

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:10.320
when they want it in the future.

01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:13.480
Because the money supply was only increasing at 1.5%,

01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:16.880
whereas the production of goods and services

01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:20.100
was increasing for most cases,

01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:22.160
for most periods at a higher rate than that.

01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:25.000
So you could buy more apples and oranges and houses

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.720
and cars at the end of the 10 years

01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:29.240
than you could at the beginning of the 10 years.

01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:31.200
So everybody had a way of providing for the future.

01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:34.280
With that, people lower their time preference

01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:38.280
and that is reflected across all aspects of life.

01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:40.080
I think it's not just the economic thing.

01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:41.480
You see it in the savings rate,

01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:44.920
the ability to deny yourself gratification today.

01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:46.400
I could take the money that I have

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:50.560
and throw a giant party, buy a sports car, buy a yacht,

01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:53.000
and yet you decided I'm not gonna do that,

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:54.400
I'm gonna keep it so that tomorrow

01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:57.280
I can throw a bigger party or buy a better yacht

01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:01.320
or have a better life or give my children a better life.

01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:04.520
So all of human civilization really is the process

01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:06.680
of us lowering our time preference

01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:09.140
and finding harder monies that allow us

01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:10.980
to provide better for the future

01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:15.220
is how we really technologically we do that.

01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:17.760
I think of the hardness of money

01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:20.760
as being the control knob for our time preference.

01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:23.540
And you can see this reflected in the 20th century

01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:26.120
where we go from the money supply increase

01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:28.880
at around one and a half percent under gold

01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:31.480
to this current situation where over the last 60 years

01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:34.440
around the numbers on money supply and fiat,

01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:38.000
the global fiat supply has increased at around 14% per year.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.300
So we've done a 10X in the increase

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:43.000
in the supply of money annually.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.320
And 14% is a weighted average.

01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:48.440
So if you take a basic numerical average

01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:52.000
for all fiat currencies, you get something like 30%.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.040
The average fiat currency increases by 30%.

01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:57.800
But if you value it by the volume of each currency

01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:00.240
so that you're not giving equal weight

01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:04.960
to the Venezuelan Bolivar increasing at 500% a year

01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:07.080
and the dollar increasing at 8% a year,

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.560
if you do it by value of the currencies

01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:12.200
so that you get the total supply of fiat,

01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:13.680
it's something like 14%.

01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:15.480
Unweighted is 30%, you said?

01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:16.920
Yeah, 30%.

01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:17.760
It's insane.

01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:19.040
I'd like to see the worst ones,

01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:22.360
the people that are dragging the average up.

01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:23.200
Yeah.

01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:25.560
But 14% is still an incredibly high, high number.

01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:27.760
And so you're saying that, sorry,

01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:29.240
that's the average over the century

01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:30.720
or the past 100 years? Over the past 60 years,

01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:34.040
1960 to 2020, we get World Bank data on that,

01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:35.640
pretty reliable data on World Bank

01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:38.640
and the European Union OECD data.

01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:40.640
I ran the numbers on that weighted average,

01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:42.120
something like 14%.

01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:45.240
And what effect that has on time preference?

01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:47.840
The effect is now it's much, much, much harder

01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:50.040
for everybody to provide for their future.

01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:52.200
Everywhere in the world, it's much harder.

01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:56.600
So how do I get the equivalent of the old gold coin

01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:58.040
that I could just put under my mattress

01:56:58.040 --> 01:56:59.680
and expect it to be there 10 years from now?

01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:01.400
Well, gold itself isn't cutting it.

01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:03.360
Gold can't keep up with inflation.

01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:04.680
And the reason for that is that gold

01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:08.320
is not being used as a money anymore in that.

01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:11.840
You can't send it internationally.

01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:14.720
You can't use it to settle trade internationally,

01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:18.680
which therefore means demand for it monetarily is limited.

01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:21.920
And so it's becoming more and more

01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:23.360
an industrial metal.

01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:26.840
And as a result of the fact that its value

01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:28.000
doesn't keep up with inflation,

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.080
it becomes economical to use it in industry.

01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:32.720
So we're seeing gold become like silver

01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:34.360
in that it gets used in industry.

01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:36.240
So the stockpile declines.

01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:38.680
And so the stock to flow ratio declines as well.

01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:40.960
And it becomes more and more of an industrial metal.

01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:44.960
And it can't protect your wealth over time very well.

01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:45.920
So what do you do?

01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:47.360
Well, you could invest.

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:49.040
And this is kind of the obvious answer

01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:50.520
that Keynesians will give you is,

01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:52.920
well, you just put your money in an investment.

01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:55.080
But investment is different from saving.

01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:56.520
Saving, the whole point of saving

01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:57.800
is that the thing is liquid

01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:00.200
and that the thing carries little uncertainty.

01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:03.760
You just held the gold coin and it just sat there.

01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:04.600
It did nothing.

01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:05.800
It didn't take risk.

01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:07.640
You knew that it was gonna be there in 10 years.

01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:10.800
Investment means you give the gold coin to somebody

01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:13.000
to go and do something with it.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.440
And it could work, it could not work.

01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:16.560
If it works, you get a positive return.

01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:18.120
You get more gold back.

01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:21.160
If it fails, you might not get any of your gold back.

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.960
So taking on risk

01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:24.440
is something very different from saving.

01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:26.960
Saving is just a way of buying the future.

01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:29.440
Investing is taking on a risk

01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:31.240
and you could lose everything with it.

01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:33.200
So what ends up happening,

01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:35.240
and this is the Keynesian objection,

01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:39.720
I think is very wrong and bad

01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:44.040
because investment is a job in itself.

01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:45.960
To figure out what to do with your money

01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:48.280
in order to beat inflation

01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:51.440
is something that there are professionals out there

01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:53.640
on Wall Street that have PhDs in finance,

01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:55.680
that have enormous computers,

01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:59.600
and they have enormous staffs of PhDs and master's degrees

01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:01.520
and math nerds that are crunching numbers

01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:04.160
and figuring out how to allocate your portfolio

01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:05.440
so that you can beat inflation.

01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:06.280
And guess what?

01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:08.480
The majority of them don't beat inflation.

01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:10.440
The majority of them can't beat inflation.

01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:13.480
Not as measured by CPI, which is completely fraudulent,

01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:14.760
but if you remember-

01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:19.040
Yeah, that 14% or even the 7%,

01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:21.080
if you look at just the increase in the money supply,

01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:23.120
which I think is a much better metric,

01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:25.520
and this is what's reflected on the desirable goods.

01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:28.280
If you look at the price of real estate in Miami Beach,

01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:30.160
as Michael Saylor mentioned in your example,

01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:32.800
it goes up at around six, 7% per year on average

01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:34.600
over the last century.

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:38.120
So that's, if you wanna live in a nice area,

01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:39.400
that's what happening to real estate.

01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:40.920
If you wanna go to the good universities,

01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:41.760
that's what's going up.

01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:43.040
It's going up at a rate that's similar

01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:44.880
to the increase in the money supply.

01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:49.880
And you can beat CPI, but CPI is designed so you can beat it,

01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:52.680
but you can't really beat the appreciation

01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:54.400
in the things that you actually want to buy,

01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:57.040
in the price of good food, the price of good real estate.

01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:01.640
So, and most investment professionals fail at doing that.

02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:06.440
So what hope does a doctor or an engineer or a scientist

02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:08.760
or an athlete have in doing those things?

02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:11.720
Investment is hard and saving should be easy.

02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:15.760
Exactly, saving is essential for us as a civilization.

02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:18.880
And what Fiat did is it took that away from us

02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:22.200
and then it forced everybody to become an investor

02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:23.680
or more accurately a gambler,

02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:25.680
because you're not just even,

02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:27.520
because the money itself is broken,

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:30.280
because the money itself is constantly changing in value,

02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:32.960
investing is becoming more of a crap shoot.

02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:36.360
I mean, value investing is completely underperforming

02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:38.400
compared to market analysis.

02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:41.720
You listen to the Fed and you,

02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:47.000
what matters to the price of individual companies

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.440
is monetary policy much more

02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:50.080
than it is their own performance.

02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:52.400
So basically you need to be a junkie watching the Fed

02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:54.000
and following all of the world's central banks

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.720
and you need to learn macroeconomics

02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:58.840
and you need to learn what all the central banks are doing

02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:00.800
and you need to understand how commodity markets work

02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:02.720
and you need to understand how equity markets work

02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:05.320
and bond markets and real estate markets.

02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:07.040
You need to do all of those things

02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:10.360
just in order to be able to save and earn

02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:13.240
and keep the money that you've already earned.

02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:15.200
That's the criminal thing about it.

02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:17.600
I've already earned that money being a doctor,

02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:19.600
being a dentist, being an athlete, being an engineer.

02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:22.560
I built a house for somebody and I got that money

02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:24.200
and all I wanna do is just make sure

02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:26.720
that I can have it 10 years from now.

02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:29.200
The only way to do so is to become a crappy engineer

02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:30.720
because you have to spend half your time

02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:34.560
not doing engineering and instead spend half of that time

02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:37.280
learning about Japanese central bank monetary policy

02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:40.120
and commodity markets and what's gonna happen to copper

02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:41.680
and what's gonna happen to oil

02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:44.560
and what's happening in the wars

02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:46.360
and what's happening with foreign policy

02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:50.080
and Russia and the US and all of those things.

02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:52.880
Under the gold standard,

02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:54.400
you didn't care about any of that stuff.

02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:56.800
Your gold coin worked regardless of all of those things.

02:01:56.800 --> 02:01:59.080
So what this means is the future.

02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:01.360
So first of all, we have all of the problems I mentioned

02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:04.440
but also it means that the future

02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:05.680
becomes much more uncertain.

02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:08.800
So you're far less likely to provide for yourself

02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:09.640
10 years from now.

02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:11.200
I'm far less likely to find an easy way

02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:14.840
to give yourself value 10 years from now

02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:17.080
and so you become more short-termist

02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:18.520
and that is reflected economically

02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:22.080
in a lower savings rate and we see savings rates decline

02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:25.160
but it is also reflected in all manners of decision-making

02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:27.560
and I think if you really wanna see what it is,

02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:30.800
take a look at a society that goes through hyperinflation

02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:32.560
and look at what happens there.

02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:36.680
How do people change under hyperinflation

02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:39.800
and compare that to essentially what we see

02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:42.400
in the 20th century all over under,

02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:45.080
not hyperinflation but under low inflation.

02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:49.600
10, 15% that you see across the board most of the time

02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:51.840
is just slow motion hyperinflation.

02:02:51.840 --> 02:02:53.400
So what happens in hyperinflation?

02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:54.960
Everybody gets their paychecks.

02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:56.880
They run straight to the supermarket.

02:02:56.880 --> 02:02:58.520
They spend all of their money.

02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:00.240
Nobody thinks about savings.

02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:01.840
Nobody thinks about the future.

02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:05.960
Survival until the end of this month is highly uncertain.

02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:07.560
How likely are you to be planning

02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:11.120
for what you're going to be doing five years from now?

02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:15.280
Very unlikely but also it's reflected not just economically.

02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:17.600
It's also reflected in all aspects of morality

02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:19.160
and all the way in which we deal

02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:20.960
with each other as human beings.

02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:23.560
When your survival is precarious,

02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:26.280
how much are you invested in the notion

02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:29.760
of being a good citizen, on caring about your reputation,

02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:32.800
on caring about not getting caught in a crime?

02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:35.760
All of these things become harder to value

02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:37.160
so people start committing crime.

02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:39.840
People start caring less and less about the future

02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:41.280
and we see it reflected in everything

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:43.920
and I argue you see it reflected in architecture.

02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:45.760
We used to build houses in the 19th century

02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:48.680
that last until today and then in the 20th century

02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:51.680
we build essentially disposable cardboard boxes

02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:54.400
that get scrapped in 20 years.

02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:57.720
So what can you say about potential positive effects

02:03:57.720 --> 02:03:59.080
of lower time preferences?

02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:04.160
I mean it's a balance like basically you're talking

02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:05.760
about an average kind of time preference

02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:07.320
but there's some things in life

02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:10.560
where low time preference could be a negative thing.

02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:13.680
So like if I want to take on risk,

02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:15.880
not for investment, for a kind of investment

02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:18.120
but say I want to start a business.

02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:20.680
I want to take something crazy,

02:04:20.680 --> 02:04:23.960
take a leap into the unknown, be an entrepreneur.

02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:26.800
What can you say about that kind of leap?

02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:30.160
Taking on debt, what's the value of that

02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:31.840
within the current system?

02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:32.960
What's the right approach to that

02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:33.840
within the current system?

02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:35.360
What's the right approach overall

02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:37.080
from an economics perspective?

02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:39.400
So it's not saving for the future.

02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:43.560
It's doing something wild,

02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:46.800
taking the money from your mattress, taking on debt

02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:48.680
and having a dream in your heart

02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:50.800
that you somehow just want to do.

02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:52.960
Maybe it's not the wisest investment decision

02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:55.720
but it's something, you know, it's being human.

02:04:55.720 --> 02:04:58.600
It's taking a leap into the unknown

02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:00.680
because something in your heart says to do it.

02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:01.520
I think you're more likely

02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:02.760
to be taking the leap in the unknown

02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:05.240
when you have a little bit of gold in the mattress

02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:06.360
than when you don't.

02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:07.360
I think this is the thing.

02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:10.040
Like if you look at the late 19th century

02:05:10.040 --> 02:05:11.920
and I discussed this in the Bitcoin standard,

02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:14.960
that was the arguably the most innovative period

02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:16.280
in human history.

02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:17.960
You know, there's qualitative evidence.

02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:20.240
You know, you look at the world around you today,

02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:21.600
pretty much everything that we use

02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:23.200
was invented in that period.

02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:28.200
The car, the airplane, the telegraph,

02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:31.920
the telephone, the camera,

02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:35.840
pretty much modern life as late 19th century.

02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:38.840
You know, the period between 1870 and 1914

02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:39.680
because the whole world

02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:41.560
was practically on a gold standard.

02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:43.720
The whole world was using the same money

02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:46.440
and the whole world could save in the same currency.

02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:49.000
That meant that a bicycle shop owner,

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:52.160
two bicycle shop owning brothers in North Carolina

02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:53.880
could go and try and fly,

02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:57.320
even as all the scientific experts in 1903

02:05:57.320 --> 02:06:01.360
were confirming that the possibility of flight

02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:03.760
has been debunked as unscientific.

02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:05.320
You know, Lord Kelvin said,

02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:07.640
not in a million years we're going to be flying.

02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:09.520
Thomas Edison said it's never gonna happen.

02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:11.160
No, I think it was Edison who said a million years,

02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:14.040
but Kelvin also said it's never gonna happen.

02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:16.440
The New York Times said it's never gonna happen

02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:20.000
the same month in which the Wright brothers did it.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.040
And they continued to deny that it was gonna,

02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:25.240
that it happened even two years after they did it.

02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:27.880
But that's, why could they do that?

02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:29.440
Because they had savings in gold.

02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:31.840
They had the security with something

02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:34.600
that you know is gonna be there.

02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:37.040
And then you can take a risk with the stuff that is extra.

02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:40.720
You know, I have say three years expenditures in gold

02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:42.200
under my mattress.

02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:45.000
And I know that I could take a risk with everything else

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.280
because whatever bad things happen with all of my dreams,

02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:49.680
like even, you know, flying,

02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:51.640
think about how insane that is.

02:06:51.640 --> 02:06:54.280
I still can go back to the three years of gold

02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:55.120
that I have saved.

02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:56.960
Still okay to take on debt,

02:06:56.960 --> 02:06:58.760
given the stuff, the gold under the mattress.

02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:00.920
Well, this is the thing under the gold standard,

02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:03.400
the way that people finance things was predominantly

02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:04.840
with capital, with equity.

02:07:04.840 --> 02:07:07.320
So you would, because you had gold savings,

02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:09.720
I had gold savings, everybody had gold savings.

02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:11.840
When you wanted to start a business,

02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:14.440
you could use your own savings or somebody else's savings.

02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:18.000
So you didn't need to get into debt.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.960
Well, you could get equity from others

02:07:19.960 --> 02:07:21.680
and you could also get debt from others.

02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:22.520
So there was-

02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:25.480
But it's directly mapped to physical reality.

02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:27.520
Yeah, it's directly mapped to economic reality

02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:28.960
in that there's a hard money out there

02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:31.160
that, you know, what you're spending money,

02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:34.040
you know, you wanna build your airplane factory,

02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:35.680
you need to get actual resources.

02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:38.360
So you get actual gold, either yours or somebody else's,

02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:40.400
you borrow it or you give them equity,

02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:42.240
but there's real resources.

02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:43.680
Now what happened with the fiat system,

02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:45.800
and this is, you know, the first part of the book

02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:48.440
when I look at it from an engineering kind of perspective

02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:50.880
is essentially, and I think this is like the breakthrough

02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:53.760
inside of the book, what fiat does

02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:58.240
is that it replaces gold mining with credit creation.

02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:01.600
The way that we make fiat money,

02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:04.120
the way that fiat is mined into existence

02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:05.240
is through credit creation.

02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:06.440
Most people think of fiat money

02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:08.840
as being something that happens when government prints money.

02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:11.480
And we still use the term government's printing money,

02:08:11.480 --> 02:08:14.520
but the vast majority of fiat is not physical.

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:16.240
And in fact, fiat is not created

02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:18.120
when it is printed physically.

02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:20.000
It's created when it is lent.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:21.600
So when you go to a bank

02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:24.200
to get a $1 million loan to buy a house,

02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:26.680
that bank is not gonna give you a million dollars

02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:29.520
from their own money or from their depositor's money.

02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:32.120
They're gonna make a fresh new million dollars.

02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:34.360
When you walk out of that bank,

02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:36.800
the money supply has increased by $1 million

02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:38.720
to finance your home.

02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:41.720
So what fiat does is, I mean,

02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:44.560
it was basically born out of government credit

02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:47.680
and the credit of banks that are backed by the central bank

02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:48.960
and the government.

02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:51.240
So if you're part of the institutions

02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:53.320
that are allowed fiat privilege,

02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:55.400
where you can just issue loans

02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:57.960
backed by the central bank, backed by the currency,

02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:00.120
you are effectively creating new currency,

02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:02.360
new money every time you issue the loan.

02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:05.360
That's fiat mining is credit creation, I love it.

02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:07.520
So can you say something, I mean,

02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:10.720
you can't really have credit without a demand for credit.

02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:12.480
You can't really have an increase in supply

02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:14.120
without a demand for it.

02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:16.600
Is there any value you place

02:09:16.640 --> 02:09:18.960
in the humans wanting it?

02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:22.760
Basically, people wanting to do something with that credit,

02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:25.320
wanting to take big leaps, big risks,

02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:27.880
big entrepreneurial decisions.

02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:31.280
So is all credit bad?

02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:34.400
No, I think what's bad is,

02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:38.440
anything in my opinion, anything that is consensual,

02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:40.640
I wanna borrow money from you and we agree the terms,

02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:41.880
I can't object to that.

02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:46.120
As long as you and I both agree, I can't object to that.

02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:48.800
But in the case of the fiat system,

02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:51.960
it's not just you and the bank who come to an agreement.

02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:53.600
Everybody who uses the currency

02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:55.800
is forced to be part of that agreement.

02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:57.640
Because if you default,

02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:00.400
effectively what's protecting the bank from you

02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:01.760
is the fact that the government

02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:04.720
can just print a bunch of money and make the bank whole.

02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:06.520
So effectively-

02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:07.360
Interesting.

02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:11.560
So that little agreement between the bank and you

02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:14.240
is actually an agreement between the bank, you,

02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:16.480
and the entire populace that's using the currency.

02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:19.040
Exactly, they're forced to provide the safety net

02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:21.360
for you and me to go and make that loan.

02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:24.040
And that safety net is the devaluation of the currency.

02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:28.200
That's how the whole thing actually works.

02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:30.960
So this is why I wrote the Bitcoin standard,

02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:31.800
explaining Bitcoin,

02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:34.160
and basically the takeaway message of the Bitcoin standard

02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:36.600
is you need to stack as much Bitcoin as you can,

02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:38.760
because this is the best money that has ever been invented.

02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:39.960
And we'll talk about that,

02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:42.800
why Bitcoin is the hardest money.

02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:45.640
Yeah, but with fiat, the conclusion of the fiat standard,

02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:47.640
and again, this is not financial advice.

02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:49.840
I'm a lowly academic.

02:10:49.840 --> 02:10:51.720
You shouldn't listen to me on issues of money,

02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:54.360
but I think theoretically and intellectually,

02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:55.840
the conclusion of the fiat system is

02:10:55.840 --> 02:10:58.880
you need to be short fiat as much as you can.

02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:00.240
That's the smart winning move.

02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:04.520
So human wisdom over thousands of years is to save,

02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:06.240
try and not borrow as much as you can,

02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:08.520
try and accumulate as much savings as you can.

02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:09.880
That's reversed under fiat.

02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:11.760
If you're saving money,

02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:14.760
you're just subsidizing everybody else taking on loans.

02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:16.280
If you're taking on loans,

02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:18.960
you're benefiting from all the people that are borrowing.

02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:21.040
So the winning move under the fiat system,

02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:23.760
and this is what rich people do, is you borrow.

02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:25.640
Rich people under the fiat monetary system,

02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:27.440
they don't hold assets.

02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:30.720
There isn't, if you're worth a billion dollars today,

02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:33.520
you don't have a billion dollars in a checking account.

02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:36.400
You've got maybe 100,000, a million,

02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:39.360
five million or something like that.

02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:41.800
A tiny fraction of your money is held in cash.

02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:43.720
The majority is going to be held

02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:46.240
in all kinds of other hard assets,

02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:48.280
and you're gonna be borrowing.

02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:49.720
The richest people in the world

02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:51.040
are the biggest borrowers in the world.

02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:52.520
The most powerful entities in the world,

02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:55.040
the governments, are the biggest borrowers in the world.

02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:58.000
And that's how they are the richest and the most powerful,

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.240
because every time you're borrowing,

02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:03.760
you're giving the bank an excuse to print new money.

02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:05.600
So you're devaluing everybody else's money,

02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:06.960
and you're getting a bit of the cut.

02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:10.360
If you're going to buy a house with your savings,

02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:13.120
you're accumulating the savings and they're losing value.

02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:17.960
And if I were to go buy the same house with credit,

02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:21.480
I'm getting the bank to print money for me.

02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:23.760
So obviously they can cut me in on that deal.

02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:25.000
And that's why it's much cheaper

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.440
for everybody to buy with credit.

02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:29.200
That's why everybody buys everything on credit.

02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:31.440
So when we look at the global monetary system,

02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:34.360
the thing you wanna do as a government

02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:37.600
is be the sexiest currency out there.

02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:42.600
So the main currency, like the dollar currently is,

02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:46.120
is the one that has the most power in that kind of context.

02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:49.120
So you have, if you were to try to summarize

02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:53.160
what is the global monetary system as it is today,

02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:57.920
is a bunch of fiat currencies battling for position,

02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:02.920
for use outside their nation,

02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:05.400
and in so doing trying to gain power

02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:06.600
in the geopolitical sense.

02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:08.440
Is that, if we just zoom out,

02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:11.120
what is the global monetary system?

02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:14.000
Like how, what is it currently?

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
So outside the United States, the whole thing.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:17.360
Yeah, you could say that,

02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:18.920
but I think it's more realistic looking at

02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:21.640
how it has actually evolved over the past few decades.

02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:23.200
It's really a dollar system.

02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:26.440
It's not a system of currencies vying with one another.

02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:27.360
It's a dollar system.

02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:29.200
And all other currencies are just basically,

02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:32.040
I like to call them dollar plus country risk.

02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.240
So each-

02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:36.400
It always returns home to the dollar.

02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:37.960
Yeah, there is no competition.

02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:41.360
There is no second best, as Michael Saylor would say.

02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:42.640
And money is like that.

02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:46.520
Gold was a winner take all by the end of the 19th century.

02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:49.160
The global monetary market is effectively

02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:51.560
a winner take all for the dollar.

02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:53.640
And if we get it to Bitcoin,

02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:56.600
you'll know I also think digital currencies

02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:59.280
are also going to be a winner take all situation.

02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:01.840
So market money wants to be won.

02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:04.920
In fact, there is no such thing as multiple currencies.

02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:07.880
Multiple currencies is just a step back to barter.

02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:09.520
Money is won.

02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:11.760
If you go back to a system of several currencies,

02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:13.760
you're just reinventing barter.

02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:16.640
So in the case of the dollar system,

02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:20.480
the global dollar system is built around the dollar

02:14:21.360 --> 02:14:23.960
because all central banks have dollar reserves

02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:25.200
and because all central banks

02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:27.400
use the dollar clearing mechanisms.

02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:31.160
So that's why you're basically playing in the dollar system.

02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:33.640
It used to have changed over the last couple of months

02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:35.560
with the sanctions on Russia

02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:37.760
and the confiscation of Russian reserves.

02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:40.840
It remains to be seen what that's going to do

02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:42.480
and how that's going to change.

02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:47.280
But it is looking like this dollar system

02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:48.720
is clearly unsustainable.

02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:49.920
It's not sustainable for the US.

02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:51.840
It's not sustainable for anybody.

02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:53.080
Speaking of which,

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:56.480
so you do an amazing podcast

02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:58.720
called the Bitcoin Standard Podcast.

02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:01.720
So episode 108 of that podcast

02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:04.000
is about the very thing you just mentioned.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.560
And allow me please to read the description of that

02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:08.040
and then ask you a couple of questions

02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:09.760
about your thoughts in general.

02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:11.160
The description reads,

02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:13.680
after the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:15.880
the US confiscated the Russian central bank's

02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:17.720
significant monetary reserves

02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:20.680
and banned some Russian banks from the SWIFT network.

02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:22.480
Serious questions are being asked

02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:25.240
about the survival of the post-war dollar

02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:28.120
based world monetary order.

02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:30.120
Will Russia, China, and other countries

02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:31.560
actually build an alternative

02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:33.360
international settlement system

02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:36.400
after years of threatening to do so, question mark?

02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:38.800
Will global central banks stop accumulating

02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:40.840
US treasury bonds and replace them

02:15:40.840 --> 02:15:43.000
with gold and commodities?

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.240
Will we witness the birth of a new commodity

02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:47.400
of gold-based monetary order?

02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:49.640
In this seminar, we use the insights

02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:52.240
from the Bitcoin Standard and the Fiat Standard

02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:54.840
on temporal and spatial salability

02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:57.680
to explain why reports of the death of the dollar

02:15:57.680 --> 02:15:59.720
in the emergence of a new gold standard

02:15:59.720 --> 02:16:00.920
may be exaggerated.

02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:04.760
So I would love to get your analysis on this situation.

02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:06.240
What are the fundamentals of it?

02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:07.360
What is SWIFT?

02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:09.160
What are the possible future evolutions

02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:11.320
of the global monetary system?

02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:12.560
Yeah, so SWIFT is the network

02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:14.760
that the US Federal Reserve uses

02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:17.920
for moving money around the world.

02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:20.160
So basically the US government can sanction you

02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:22.800
off of SWIFT as they've done with Russian banks,

02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:24.680
as they've done with Iran,

02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:27.320
and as they've done with Afghanistan.

02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:31.080
So effectively, I mean, this is really the catastrophe

02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:32.200
of the current monetary system

02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:34.400
is that in order to be able to trade

02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:37.440
as a member, as a citizen of your country,

02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:40.480
you need your monopoly, local central bank

02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:42.680
to be on good terms with the US government

02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:44.200
so that they would let them operate it.

02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:48.480
And this is really like on top of the aspect

02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:49.640
of the hardness of money,

02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:53.000
this is the other really powerful thing about Bitcoin,

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.080
which is that it's just purely a technological thing.

02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:56.960
It doesn't matter if you're Russian,

02:16:57.640 --> 02:16:58.360
if you're Iranian, if you're American,

02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:00.280
if you're Chinese, it's a technology.

02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:03.840
And so it's like a spoon or a knife or a car,

02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:06.240
you operate it properly and it works.

02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:07.600
And so with Bitcoin, it's the same thing.

02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:09.440
It doesn't care about your passport.

02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:11.880
If you have the private key, you click send

02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:14.760
and the money goes, well, it doesn't really go,

02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:18.120
but effectively it does go anywhere at once

02:17:18.120 --> 02:17:19.480
and the money can move

02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:22.560
without having to abide by political situations.

02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:26.120
And the point here is not to bash US foreign policy

02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:27.680
much as that might be deserved.

02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:28.600
I'm just going to discuss it

02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:31.120
from a kind of technical perspective.

02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:33.160
It has to be a political system with fiat

02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:35.280
because ultimately it relies on credit.

02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:37.520
And then the government is the one that has the guns

02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:38.840
and the government is going to decide

02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:40.560
who gets to pay their loans anyway.

02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:45.560
And the government's going to have to make its own rules

02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:47.920
about who gets to play and who doesn't.

02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:51.400
And so it has to be political as this kind of fiat system.

02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:56.280
And when I wrote the Bitcoin standard,

02:17:56.280 --> 02:17:58.680
initially I used to be much more of a gold bug.

02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:02.640
And in my mind, gold bugs have spent the last 50 years

02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:04.480
saying the global monetary system

02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:05.640
is going to collapse next week

02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:07.720
and we're going to go back to a gold standard.

02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:10.200
And writing the fiat standard

02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:11.880
gave me a very good appreciation

02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:13.600
for why this hasn't happened

02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:15.720
and why it's not very likely to happen.

02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:18.840
I think the reason is, as I said earlier,

02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:20.800
it's just gold is very expensive to move around

02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:24.240
and perhaps more importantly, it's very expensive to verify.

02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:25.520
That's really the problem with it.

02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:27.240
It's very expensive to verify

02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:29.560
that the gold that you're receiving is original gold.

02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:32.560
So the only way to do this properly

02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:35.960
is to melt the gold bars down and recast them,

02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:37.560
which is pretty expensive.

02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:40.440
So we have this situation now where Russia,

02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:42.760
which is one of the biggest economies in the world,

02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:45.760
has been kicked off to varying degrees

02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:47.400
off of the global monetary system

02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:49.320
and the US has confiscated their reserves.

02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:52.600
I don't have political opinions about the war.

02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:54.600
It's not something I'm very familiar with.

02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:56.480
It's outside of my area of expertise.

02:18:56.480 --> 02:18:58.840
I'm just analyzing the monetary aspects of it.

02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:00.760
It is, on the one hand,

02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:03.520
whether you think the war is justified or the sanctions

02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:07.000
are justified is not something I can opine on.

02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:11.040
But the implication of this is that effectively

02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:13.000
the US might be shooting itself in the foot

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.480
because it's telling everybody in the world,

02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:18.040
your money in our system is not really your money.

02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:22.120
It's just a token to play in our arcade.

02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:23.800
And at any point in time, if you misbehave,

02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:27.680
we kick you out of the arcade and we take your tokens.

02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:32.120
And so, I mean, this is something that China, Russia, Iran

02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:33.720
and many countries have made a lot of noise about

02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:35.080
over the past decades.

02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:38.280
It got real this year,

02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:43.280
but it's been decades of China, Iran and Russia

02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:45.960
to some extent saying that we wanna build an alternative

02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:48.720
to the US dollar-based system.

02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:50.080
And yet they haven't.

02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:51.640
And I think there's very good reasons they haven't.

02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:54.040
And the reason is, what do you do with it based on?

02:19:54.040 --> 02:19:55.200
How do you build it?

02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:57.800
So you can do a credit-based system based on,

02:19:57.800 --> 02:20:00.520
but then who's gonna be the big boss?

02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:01.400
Is it gonna be China?

02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:02.240
Is it gonna be Russia?

02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:03.060
Is it gonna be Iran?

02:20:03.060 --> 02:20:04.200
Is it gonna be India?

02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:06.840
None of these countries wants to be,

02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:10.400
they don't wanna jump out of the US-based system

02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:12.560
to get into somebody else's base system.

02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:14.440
So China doesn't wanna use a Russian system.

02:20:14.440 --> 02:20:16.520
Russia doesn't wanna use a Chinese system.

02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:17.840
And so therefore you can't use

02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:19.540
their own central bank's currencies.

02:20:19.540 --> 02:20:23.240
Don't you think they have enough leverage,

02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:27.820
India, China, Russia combined with several other nations

02:20:27.820 --> 02:20:29.920
have enough leverage and incentive

02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:32.040
to create their own system?

02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:35.600
So any one player, yes, but if they collaborate.

02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:37.280
Yeah, but then, okay, so what are you basing on?

02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:39.640
Like who's going to be the boss?

02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:40.880
Who's going to be the one who can-

02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:42.500
In this case, China, right?

02:20:43.500 --> 02:20:45.900
Because China is becoming increasingly

02:20:45.900 --> 02:20:49.540
an economic power in the world that it's hard to deny.

02:20:49.540 --> 02:20:50.380
Yes, it's true.

02:20:50.380 --> 02:20:52.660
And it's the most likely scenario perhaps

02:20:52.660 --> 02:20:54.580
if we were to witness something like this

02:20:54.580 --> 02:20:57.220
is going to be a Chinese-based system.

02:20:57.220 --> 02:21:00.500
So is it possible to have like a split

02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:04.680
in what is the driving currency of the world?

02:21:04.680 --> 02:21:06.860
It's possible, but I don't think it's sustainable.

02:21:06.860 --> 02:21:08.180
Again, money wants to be won.

02:21:08.180 --> 02:21:09.020
And that's the kind of thing

02:21:09.020 --> 02:21:10.540
that I argue in that seminar.

02:21:10.540 --> 02:21:13.500
So we could see this emerge based around the Yuan

02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:17.700
and likely, I mean, Russia is obviously going

02:21:17.700 --> 02:21:19.620
to hurt economically from what happened

02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:22.140
from the confiscation of the reserves and from the sanctions.

02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:24.580
So it's not going to be in a position.

02:21:24.580 --> 02:21:27.700
And of course, because it's outside of the US-based system,

02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:29.740
it's not in the strongest negotiating position

02:21:29.740 --> 02:21:30.580
with the Chinese.

02:21:30.580 --> 02:21:32.740
So the Chinese might be able to get them

02:21:32.740 --> 02:21:34.940
to join their Yuan-based system.

02:21:34.940 --> 02:21:36.900
But I don't think that's sustainable in the long run

02:21:36.900 --> 02:21:41.100
because these governments can issue their laws

02:21:41.100 --> 02:21:45.060
and make their designs and then make their monetary systems.

02:21:45.060 --> 02:21:50.060
But ultimately there are billions of Chinese people

02:21:50.260 --> 02:21:52.020
and billions of dollar-based people

02:21:52.020 --> 02:21:53.660
and they're going to want to trade with one another.

02:21:53.660 --> 02:21:55.560
And the power to want to trade with one another

02:21:55.560 --> 02:21:56.400
is too strong.

02:21:56.400 --> 02:21:58.220
Like we can't just split the world economy

02:21:58.220 --> 02:22:00.740
into two monetary systems that don't trade with one another.

02:22:00.740 --> 02:22:02.940
So then they're going to want to trade with one another.

02:22:02.940 --> 02:22:07.940
Or the dark possibility is it, the inability to trade

02:22:10.820 --> 02:22:14.420
as opposed to being a forcing function for trade,

02:22:14.420 --> 02:22:17.700
it will become a forcing function for conflict

02:22:17.700 --> 02:22:20.300
in cyberspace and potentially hot war.

02:22:20.300 --> 02:22:22.580
Yes, this is the scary part of it.

02:22:22.580 --> 02:22:24.780
And this is basically how World War II happened.

02:22:24.780 --> 02:22:29.060
Because there's an old historian who used to say when,

02:22:29.060 --> 02:22:30.380
I think his name is Otto Mallory

02:22:30.380 --> 02:22:32.020
and I quote him in the Bitcoin Standard,

02:22:32.060 --> 02:22:35.620
if goods don't cross borders, then bombs will.

02:22:35.620 --> 02:22:36.780
If people trade with one another,

02:22:36.780 --> 02:22:39.260
they have an incentive for each other's wellbeing

02:22:39.260 --> 02:22:42.520
and then they have less of an incentive to fight.

02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:45.500
And it was the death of global trade in the 1930s

02:22:45.500 --> 02:22:48.660
because of the failure of the fiat system

02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:52.020
that brought about the rise of the populism

02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:54.120
and the rise of all those leaders that hated each other

02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:56.260
and helped finance the war and bring it about.

02:22:56.260 --> 02:22:58.100
So that is the scary possibility.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:00.940
And of course, you can't discount that

02:23:00.940 --> 02:23:02.540
with all of the escalation that you see

02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:05.500
that is a possibility that it could turn into a real war.

02:23:05.500 --> 02:23:09.100
But then even so, I think ultimately,

02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:10.660
you can't fight wars forever.

02:23:12.220 --> 02:23:13.860
It's gonna end at some point.

02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:15.620
And we're gonna be back at square one,

02:23:15.620 --> 02:23:16.900
or well, not square one,

02:23:16.900 --> 02:23:18.220
we're gonna be back at the same dilemma

02:23:18.220 --> 02:23:21.780
of who's going to have the global monetary system.

02:23:21.780 --> 02:23:24.520
And so one alternative is that what the Chinese

02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:25.420
and the Russians could do

02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:28.220
is they could base it on a commodity.

02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:29.300
So a lot of people are now saying,

02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:30.860
well, they're gonna base it on copper

02:23:31.860 --> 02:23:35.460
and corn and agricultural commodities.

02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:38.180
And that's the analysis of saleability

02:23:38.180 --> 02:23:39.700
that we discussed in the Bitcoin standard

02:23:39.700 --> 02:23:40.900
and the fiat standard.

02:23:40.900 --> 02:23:42.180
I don't think that's workable.

02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:44.780
If you end up basing the monetary system on copper,

02:23:44.780 --> 02:23:46.100
as we said earlier,

02:23:46.100 --> 02:23:47.500
doesn't matter how many governments say

02:23:47.500 --> 02:23:50.140
that we're gonna make a new monetary system

02:23:50.140 --> 02:23:55.140
based on copper grains and nickel and iron and so on,

02:23:56.420 --> 02:23:57.260
doesn't matter.

02:23:57.260 --> 02:24:00.020
You're gonna have to stockpile those things

02:24:00.020 --> 02:24:02.420
in order to make a market in them.

02:24:02.420 --> 02:24:03.720
And then if you stockpile those things,

02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:05.420
you're just raising their value,

02:24:05.420 --> 02:24:08.780
inviting the producers to make more, flood the market.

02:24:08.780 --> 02:24:09.940
I hope they don't try this

02:24:09.940 --> 02:24:11.580
because it's going to be a devastating,

02:24:11.580 --> 02:24:15.220
devastating impact on the world economy.

02:24:15.220 --> 02:24:17.980
You're gonna have central banks bidding up the price

02:24:17.980 --> 02:24:20.820
of essential commodities that people need for real uses

02:24:20.820 --> 02:24:22.980
in order to back their currencies with them,

02:24:22.980 --> 02:24:24.800
and then just incentivizing the producers

02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:26.580
to make more and more and more of it,

02:24:26.580 --> 02:24:28.060
and then bringing the price back down.

02:24:28.060 --> 02:24:29.860
So it's gonna be a very expensive mistake

02:24:29.860 --> 02:24:31.660
where we raise the price of copper,

02:24:31.660 --> 02:24:33.820
destroy a lot of industries dependent on copper.

02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:35.620
And it's not just copper, but also food,

02:24:35.620 --> 02:24:38.260
and then increase the supply beyond what we need.

02:24:38.260 --> 02:24:41.700
And the end result is copper miners make out well,

02:24:41.700 --> 02:24:43.740
governments go broke,

02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:46.220
and we end up with a lot of rusting copper

02:24:46.220 --> 02:24:49.540
in government warehouses.

02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:50.860
That's why I don't think it works

02:24:52.860 --> 02:24:56.340
to use commodities that are not monetary commodities.

02:24:56.340 --> 02:24:58.540
Then the question is maybe gold.

02:24:58.540 --> 02:25:00.780
Can we go back on another gold standard?

02:25:00.780 --> 02:25:04.540
And I mean, Russia seems to have done that.

02:25:04.540 --> 02:25:05.620
I'm not so sure.

02:25:05.620 --> 02:25:07.660
It's very difficult to get reliable information.

02:25:07.660 --> 02:25:09.300
I'm trying to look into this more.

02:25:10.260 --> 02:25:11.300
But they seem to have said

02:25:11.300 --> 02:25:15.140
that they're fixing the price of gold in rubles.

02:25:15.140 --> 02:25:18.660
So they will buy and sell gold at a fixed ruble rate,

02:25:18.660 --> 02:25:20.900
which effectively means you're on a gold standard.

02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:24.660
Now, I'm not sure how serious this is,

02:25:24.660 --> 02:25:26.440
how they've managed to stick to it,

02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:28.840
but it seems to have stabilized the ruble

02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:31.000
and in fact brought it back to its pre-war level,

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.320
which I found absolutely astonishing,

02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:35.920
considering all the sanctions going on.

02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:38.640
But in the short run,

02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:39.720
it's obviously much better

02:25:39.720 --> 02:25:41.720
than having your currency pegged to nothing.

02:25:41.720 --> 02:25:43.200
But in the long run,

02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:46.720
I also don't think gold is gonna cut it in the 21st century.

02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:50.600
Do you think there's any chance they go full gangster move

02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:54.720
and go into the digital space on the blockchain

02:25:54.720 --> 02:25:55.840
and go with Bitcoin?

02:25:56.840 --> 02:25:58.960
I think the point of this discussion

02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:01.720
is that we run through all these other options,

02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:04.840
a Chinese-based system, why it probably won't work,

02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:06.360
commodity-based system, why it won't work,

02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:08.680
and a gold-based system, why it won't work.

02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:12.040
I think they might have to learn this the wrong way,

02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:13.520
I mean, the hard way.

02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:16.000
But eventually, I don't see them doing it now,

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:19.200
but eventually I think the winning move is going to be

02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:21.440
to go on a Bitcoin-based monetary system.

02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:23.840
Well, I don't know if everything always has to be

02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:25.720
the hard way.

02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:26.880
I'd love it not to be,

02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:30.880
but I mean, it doesn't look like there is any kind

02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:33.320
of desire in China or in Russia

02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:34.160
to switch to a Bitcoin-based system.

02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:36.160
To take a leap to Bitcoin.

02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:39.720
So unfortunately, I think we're gonna go through

02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:42.240
a few years, maybe many years,

02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:44.840
of learning the lesson the hard way

02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:46.800
of trying to accumulate these commodities

02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:47.880
and seeing the limitations

02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:50.480
that make them unsuitable as money today.

02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:52.280
One of the things I'm really concerned about

02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:53.880
is the tension, the amount.

02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:58.000
The increasing amount of hate in the world.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:26:58.880
Yes.

02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:03.480
And the increasing amount of power centers in the world

02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:09.480
between which hate is making a regular appearance

02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:14.480
and because the weapons of war are becoming

02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:16.040
more and more powerful as they have been

02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:19.680
in the past many decades,

02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:22.320
I'm really concerned about nuclear war.

02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:25.200
So let us see if Bitcoin can fix this.

02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:27.400
Yes, Bitcoin fixes all of this.

02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:30.160
First rule of Bitcoin is,

02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:32.040
if it's a problem, Bitcoin fixes it.

02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:35.040
All right, well, I have some personal questions

02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:35.880
for Bitcoin then,

02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:38.320
because I have some, my life is pretty fucked up,

02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:40.240
so I'll have to try to see.

02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:41.720
Quick pause for bathroom baking.

02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:43.120
Sure.

02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:44.840
Let's return to the basics.

02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:46.400
What is Bitcoin?

02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:48.400
We started with what is money?

02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:49.360
What is Bitcoin?

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:53.440
We talked about hard money, inflation, fiat,

02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:55.720
the history of money,

02:27:55.720 --> 02:27:57.880
the history of war in the 20th century,

02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:00.360
and that takes us into the 21st century.

02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:01.200
What is Bitcoin?

02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:05.840
Bitcoin is a software and it's a distributed software

02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:07.440
to operate the peer-to-peer network

02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:10.600
between members who are all equal on the network.

02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:11.840
They're all peers.

02:28:11.840 --> 02:28:14.560
And what this software does is that it allows you

02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:19.440
to operate a payment network between those peers

02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:22.400
and that payment network has its own currency

02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:26.360
and that seems like just a simple software game,

02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:28.680
but the reason this is such a big deal is,

02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:30.760
I believe Bitcoin is the most advanced form

02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:32.440
of money ever invented.

02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:34.880
And the reason for that comes from two properties

02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:36.880
that this network has.

02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:39.320
The first one is that the currency

02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:41.760
is the hardest money ever invented.

02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:43.400
It's the money whose supply

02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:46.000
is the most resistant to inflation.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:49.080
It's the first monetary asset that we've ever invented

02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:52.160
that is guaranteed to be fixed in its supply

02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:54.600
and it cannot be increased beyond a certain number.

02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:56.960
So there's only ever going to be 21 million Bitcoins.

02:28:56.960 --> 02:29:00.600
And that's a qualitative leap forward

02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:02.640
in our technologies of money.

02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:05.560
All of our monies leak essentially

02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:07.800
because people can always make more and more

02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:08.640
and more of them.

02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:11.040
The best money is the one that leaks the least,

02:29:11.040 --> 02:29:13.800
which is gold because it only leaks 1.5%.

02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:17.840
In other words, your share of the gold stock

02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:21.200
is diluted by 1.5% every year.

02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:23.240
Ideally, you'd like it to be zero.

02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:27.480
Bitcoin is currently at around 1.8% headed towards zero.

02:29:27.480 --> 02:29:29.200
So it's the first money that we've ever had

02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:31.960
that goes to zero in terms of terminal supply.

02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:34.640
So there'll never be more than 21 million Bitcoin.

02:29:34.640 --> 02:29:35.680
And I think that's a huge deal

02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:38.320
because as I said earlier,

02:29:38.320 --> 02:29:40.480
money is always whatever is the hardest to make

02:29:40.480 --> 02:29:43.240
and now Bitcoin is the hardest thing to make.

02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:44.520
And then the second property,

02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:46.800
which is extremely important as well,

02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:50.200
is the fact that it operates without the need

02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:51.560
to trust in anybody.

02:29:51.560 --> 02:29:54.080
It doesn't have a party that is in charge of it.

02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:56.320
It doesn't have a central authority that can,

02:29:57.520 --> 02:29:58.760
as I said, it's peer to peer.

02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:00.600
So it only has users.

02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:02.480
It doesn't have any admins.

02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:04.760
There's no authority in charge of Bitcoin

02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:05.880
that can take your Bitcoin,

02:30:05.880 --> 02:30:08.200
that can stop you from using Bitcoin,

02:30:08.200 --> 02:30:09.600
that can change the rules of Bitcoin.

02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:11.080
They can't make more of it.

02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:12.840
So it's fixed.

02:30:12.840 --> 02:30:15.160
It's available for anybody in the world.

02:30:15.160 --> 02:30:17.240
It's the hardest money ever invented.

02:30:17.240 --> 02:30:20.560
And it is absolutely, I think,

02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:23.560
an enormously, enormously significant invention

02:30:23.560 --> 02:30:26.520
because if you read the fiat standard

02:30:26.520 --> 02:30:28.640
and the Bitcoin standard as well,

02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:31.280
you'll see my perspective for why I think

02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:34.600
a very large number of problems in the world

02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:37.280
are caused by easy money, are caused by inflation

02:30:38.360 --> 02:30:41.360
and caused by government having access

02:30:41.360 --> 02:30:45.920
to essentially an infinite recourse to people's wealth.

02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:47.840
And I think Bitcoin fixes this

02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:51.440
because it allows us to have money

02:30:51.440 --> 02:30:54.440
that has the salability of gold across time,

02:30:54.440 --> 02:30:57.280
meaning it holds its value across time like gold,

02:30:57.280 --> 02:30:58.720
but much better than gold.

02:30:58.720 --> 02:31:01.800
But also it is similar to fiat

02:31:01.800 --> 02:31:03.840
in that fiat can travel quickly,

02:31:03.840 --> 02:31:06.120
but Bitcoin can travel even faster than fiat.

02:31:06.120 --> 02:31:11.120
So it combines gold's salability across time

02:31:11.400 --> 02:31:14.000
with fiat's salability across space

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:17.200
in one immutable package that nobody can change

02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:18.280
and nobody can control.

02:31:18.280 --> 02:31:20.120
Can you define the word salability?

02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:22.960
Salability is the essential property of money.

02:31:22.960 --> 02:31:27.960
It's the ability of a good to be sold easily on the market,

02:31:28.520 --> 02:31:31.200
specifically to be sold without much loss in its value.

02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:33.560
So houses are great for living in,

02:31:33.560 --> 02:31:35.040
but they're not very salable.

02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:36.680
If you wanna sell a house,

02:31:36.680 --> 02:31:38.600
you can just click a button and sell a house

02:31:38.600 --> 02:31:41.880
and have a giant market of people buying houses from you.

02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:46.200
You need to find somebody who wants the exact house

02:31:46.200 --> 02:31:48.840
that you have with the exact specifications that you have.

02:31:48.840 --> 02:31:50.520
And because houses are not identical,

02:31:50.520 --> 02:31:52.520
there's no liquid giant market for people

02:31:52.520 --> 02:31:55.400
to just buy and sell identical houses from.

02:31:56.440 --> 02:32:01.440
So gold, for instance, has good salability as money

02:32:01.640 --> 02:32:03.920
because it's a liquid good, it's uniform,

02:32:03.920 --> 02:32:05.800
and people are always buying it.

02:32:05.800 --> 02:32:08.200
Fiat dollars have great salability

02:32:08.200 --> 02:32:10.720
because everybody's always buying and exchanging dollars

02:32:10.720 --> 02:32:11.960
for other goods.

02:32:11.960 --> 02:32:13.760
So if you have a hundred dollar bill,

02:32:13.760 --> 02:32:15.360
you can easily get rid of it

02:32:15.360 --> 02:32:18.040
and you'll get a hundred dollars worth of stuff for it.

02:32:18.040 --> 02:32:20.920
If you have a hundred dollars worth of stuff,

02:32:20.920 --> 02:32:22.000
it's harder to get rid of it.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.600
If you have a hundred dollar worth of phone,

02:32:24.600 --> 02:32:26.960
it's not as easy to spend it as a hundred dollar bill.

02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:28.400
That's salability.

02:32:28.400 --> 02:32:31.040
What do you mean that Bitcoin,

02:32:31.040 --> 02:32:33.320
I understand that Bitcoin has the salability

02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:35.280
of gold across time.

02:32:35.280 --> 02:32:36.360
Better even, yeah.

02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:39.400
Better, yes, like on the order or whatever.

02:32:39.760 --> 02:32:42.880
And then it has the salability of fiat across space.

02:32:42.880 --> 02:32:43.800
What does that mean?

02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:44.760
So if you remember when you asked me

02:32:44.760 --> 02:32:46.200
what is the advantage of fiat?

02:32:46.200 --> 02:32:48.120
What is the advantage it offers us?

02:32:48.120 --> 02:32:50.880
It's cheaper to move fiat across space

02:32:50.880 --> 02:32:52.160
than it is to move gold.

02:32:52.160 --> 02:32:54.800
You know, with the current fiat monetary system

02:32:54.800 --> 02:32:58.160
for all of its flaws, you know, you can send money,

02:32:58.160 --> 02:33:01.240
you know, I could send money from my bank account in the US

02:33:01.240 --> 02:33:05.280
to a bank account in China in a couple of days

02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:08.920
or in Britain, in France in a day or two,

02:33:08.920 --> 02:33:10.960
which is much faster than you could do with gold

02:33:10.960 --> 02:33:13.440
and much cheaper than you could do with gold.

02:33:13.440 --> 02:33:16.360
But in reality with fiat, you know,

02:33:16.360 --> 02:33:17.800
the reason Bitcoin improves on that

02:33:17.800 --> 02:33:19.560
is that with Bitcoin, you're actually selling,

02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:22.960
you're sending final settlement in a couple of hours.

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:24.360
So you send the Bitcoin transaction,

02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:26.480
you get six confirmations in an hour,

02:33:26.480 --> 02:33:29.800
you get about 12 confirmations in two hours on average.

02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:31.240
With 12 confirmations, you know,

02:33:31.240 --> 02:33:36.240
you're pretty definitely clearly safe on this.

02:33:36.560 --> 02:33:38.360
So within a couple of hours,

02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:41.120
you could send a billion dollars across the ocean

02:33:41.120 --> 02:33:44.080
and have final settlement on them.

02:33:44.080 --> 02:33:46.640
It's not just that you've sent a credit obligation

02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:49.120
that's gonna need weeks and months to settle,

02:33:49.120 --> 02:33:51.080
which is the case with fiat.

02:33:51.080 --> 02:33:54.080
So it is faster than fiat effectively.

02:33:54.080 --> 02:33:56.960
So it's harder than gold and faster than fiat.

02:33:56.960 --> 02:33:58.560
That's a good way of putting it.

02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:04.480
One other aspect of Bitcoin I have to ask to me

02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:06.720
and the human level is fascinating

02:34:06.760 --> 02:34:09.840
is it was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto,

02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:12.080
an anonymous founder, there's no leader.

02:34:12.080 --> 02:34:15.040
So that's another aspect of the decentralization,

02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:16.360
it's leaderless.

02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:17.200
Yeah.

02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:19.640
So unfortunately, it's not a monarchy.

02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:20.480
Fortunately.

02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:22.200
Or fortunately, yes.

02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:24.640
Who is Satoshi Nakamoto, do you think?

02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:26.760
And first of all, is it you?

02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:28.280
It definitely is not me.

02:34:29.440 --> 02:34:30.520
I don't know who it is.

02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:32.040
If it was, would you tell me?

02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:34.400
It's a trick question.

02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:35.600
I know, trick question.

02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:36.840
But I mean, everybody who knows me

02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:38.040
knows I can't really code.

02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:41.120
So you would say that even if you could.

02:34:42.440 --> 02:34:44.440
But do you think it's one person?

02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:45.640
Do you think it's multiple people?

02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:47.000
Is it interesting to you?

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.520
Do you think it's fundamental to the coin itself

02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:53.160
to not the coin, the entirety of the concept

02:34:54.120 --> 02:34:56.240
that it's founders and animus?

02:34:56.240 --> 02:34:58.640
And how much guts do you think it takes

02:34:58.640 --> 02:35:02.320
if it's one person to just walk away from so much money?

02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:04.720
I've considered all these questions many times.

02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:07.720
It's very hard to formulate a definitive answer

02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:09.160
to all of them.

02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:10.080
I don't know who it is.

02:35:10.080 --> 02:35:15.080
And I don't know why he or them or she

02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:19.920
are not spending the coins that they most likely have.

02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:23.040
I think what really matters in Bitcoin about Satoshi

02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:24.920
is the fact that he's not there.

02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:28.040
And this is what's truly astonishing about it.

02:35:28.040 --> 02:35:29.680
The most important fact in Bitcoin

02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:31.760
is the fact that the creators disappeared

02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:33.440
and the thing has continued to operate now

02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:35.520
for almost 12 years without him being there

02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:38.840
or 11 years I think it's been since he's left.

02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:41.120
And this is really the most important thing.

02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:44.480
And maybe he died or she died

02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:49.400
or they got into an accident on a road trip or whatever.

02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:51.200
And that's why they haven't accessed their coins.

02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:54.000
Maybe they're incapacitated for some reason.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:55.960
But whatever reason it is,

02:35:55.960 --> 02:36:00.560
I really think it's fate or serendipity

02:36:00.560 --> 02:36:04.520
that has given us this very vital,

02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:07.960
very, very, very vital building ingredient in Bitcoin

02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:11.120
which no other digital currency would ever recreate,

02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:14.760
which is that because it was the first,

02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:17.360
it was the one that was able to establish

02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:19.520
the first mover advantage and get all the people

02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:22.200
who were interested in the technology to get into it.

02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:23.760
And so that's an enormous advantage.

02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:28.760
But the cherry on top or what made the whole thing

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:32.040
really function well is the fact

02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:34.000
that the guy who made it disappeared

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:35.480
and that it continued to operate,

02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:37.680
which is just a clear illustration

02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:40.000
that this is a network with no admins.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.600
And I'm tempted to think that they're incapacitated

02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:44.400
in some way, probably dead or gone,

02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:48.600
because I can't believe the,

02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:51.760
I don't believe any human being would have this level

02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:54.720
of self-control to not get into,

02:36:54.720 --> 02:36:58.080
not want to meddle with their invention so much.

02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:00.760
Even if they, you know,

02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:01.920
they might've had the self-control

02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:03.480
to like mine the first million coins

02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:05.880
to get the network going and then throw away the coins

02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:07.040
or send them to an address

02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:08.720
that they don't have the key to,

02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:12.160
because they really just wanted the networks to take off.

02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:14.200
They may have no access to the coins

02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:15.480
and that's why they can't move them.

02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:17.000
I could see that happening,

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:18.240
but I find it harder to believe

02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:20.320
that they would resist the temptation

02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:21.880
to mess with the network.

02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:23.280
You know, it's funny.

02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:25.320
I find that the founders of ideas

02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:29.600
are often principled and have the integrity

02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:34.600
that the eventual users of those ideas don't fully have.

02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:38.480
I tend to, you know, we have the kind of cynical view,

02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:41.320
power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely.

02:37:41.320 --> 02:37:42.720
And we tend to, in our mind,

02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:45.640
generalize that all humans are corruptible.

02:37:45.640 --> 02:37:47.680
And perhaps that's true to some degree,

02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:51.120
but I think that some people are more corruptible than others.

02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:53.480
And I find that there is, I mean,

02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:58.040
I like to think that Satoshi Nakamura is out there

02:37:58.040 --> 02:38:02.240
and, you know, just like George Washington chose to walk away

02:38:02.240 --> 02:38:03.400
and it's the principle.

02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:05.200
And the principle is more powerful

02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:09.120
than the financial award or any of those kinds of things.

02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:12.400
It's a principle that stands for freedom.

02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:14.040
And there's a lot of people throughout history,

02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:14.960
even recent history,

02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:18.160
that are willing to die for these principles

02:38:18.160 --> 02:38:23.160
or live a life full of suffering and sacrifice

02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:27.040
because they're still living a life of principle

02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:29.160
and choosing that day after day after day.

02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:31.440
So, I mean, there's power to that.

02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:33.960
Money, what's the worth of money in the end

02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:37.960
in terms of just personal financial gain

02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:42.960
versus knowing how much positive impact there is.

02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:46.280
So the person that chooses to walk away like that,

02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:47.600
I think is the same kind of person

02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:52.320
that chooses to live by that principle.

02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:54.200
You have people like that, you know,

02:38:54.200 --> 02:38:58.320
in Grigori Grisha Perlman in mathematics

02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:01.800
who turned down the Fields Medal because he was...

02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:05.680
Yeah, that's a medal, not $50 billion of Bitcoin.

02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:06.880
Well, that's, I...

02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:08.280
No, I know, I know, I'm joking.

02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:09.600
Well, that's actually an interesting,

02:39:09.600 --> 02:39:10.960
just a brief comment.

02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:12.680
You know, when people talk about Bitcoin

02:39:12.680 --> 02:39:14.480
in the cryptocurrency space,

02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:20.040
it's often mixed up financial interest and ideas.

02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:24.360
And I think there's often correlated,

02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:27.600
but that good feeling you get when you win

02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:32.600
or number go up or you just somebody, you know,

02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:35.760
I found 20 bucks on the street the other day

02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:39.840
and just that feeling of just like, ooh, like more money,

02:39:39.840 --> 02:39:42.960
that positive feeling, that's correlated,

02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:45.840
but it is distinct from the power of the idea

02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:49.160
to change a world, to change the world for the better.

02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:51.560
For the, to alleviate, it's like Alex Gladstein

02:39:51.560 --> 02:39:53.040
in the case of Bitcoin,

02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:55.240
that decreased the amount of suffering in the world

02:39:55.240 --> 02:39:56.800
because of the authoritarian regimes.

02:39:56.800 --> 02:40:00.360
And just because your number goes up,

02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:04.280
like that gambling feeling of like, yes, yes, this is good.

02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:07.200
And I mean, short-term number go up.

02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:08.560
There's a long-term number go up,

02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:10.840
that's more like investment and so on.

02:40:10.840 --> 02:40:12.160
And there's a short-term number go up,

02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:14.560
which is a good feeling that you can't,

02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:16.760
you have to, in your mind, keep those distinct

02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:21.360
from the power of the idea to transform the world.

02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:24.240
And if you focus on the power of the idea,

02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:26.760
maybe a billion or billions of dollars

02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:28.880
don't matter as much.

02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:30.440
At least that's what I would like to believe.

02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:32.680
Perhaps, but what matters ultimately

02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:34.320
is that the thing works without him.

02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:35.920
The things worked for 11 years without him.

02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:38.760
And I think this is the really important thing.

02:40:38.760 --> 02:40:41.720
If they had stuck around for whatever reason

02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:43.800
and they had continued to meddle with it,

02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:47.800
it's not clear to me how decentralized it could have been.

02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:49.320
This is the problem with the other currencies.

02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:52.560
It's like, how do you lose control

02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:54.720
of the Frankenstein that you've created?

02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:57.160
The only way that this Frankenstein continues to survive

02:40:57.160 --> 02:41:00.240
is if the person in charge of it continues to feed it.

02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:02.640
And so it continues to be yours.

02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:05.200
And that's the problem with all the other digital currencies.

02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:06.160
If you've heard about any

02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:09.120
of the other 16,000 digital currencies out there,

02:41:09.120 --> 02:41:10.040
you've only heard about it

02:41:10.040 --> 02:41:11.920
because there's a small group of people behind it

02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:14.440
that are working on it, that are promoting it.

02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:16.080
And that's why, and I think,

02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:17.360
Michael Saylor's discussion with you

02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:19.600
was a magnificent illustration

02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:23.040
of the difference between Bitcoin and altcoins

02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:24.840
in that they are securities.

02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:27.280
And I think he makes a very compelling, brilliant case

02:41:27.280 --> 02:41:31.960
for why this makes them categorically different

02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:32.800
from Bitcoin.

02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:34.720
Bitcoin, you're buying property.

02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:36.880
I think he mentioned he's a huge fan of Dogecoin,

02:41:36.880 --> 02:41:38.160
but I might be misremembering.

02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:39.240
You are misremembering.

02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:40.560
Okay, you too.

02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:42.880
Maybe I'm quoting him out of context.

02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:43.720
Okay.

02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:47.840
Let me just ask you about some possible criticisms

02:41:47.840 --> 02:41:49.120
of Bitcoin.

02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:52.520
So on centralization, so there's a criticism

02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:56.000
on the mining and on the node side,

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
or the node is not really the criticism,

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.960
but Bitcoin mining is not fully decentralized

02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:03.040
because a small number of miners

02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:06.200
control a majority of the hashing power.

02:42:06.200 --> 02:42:08.400
I looked it up, there's 10,000, 15,000,

02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:10.480
whatever the number is, of computers

02:42:10.480 --> 02:42:15.480
that are full nodes that are actively connected

02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:16.720
to the network.

02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:18.400
So you could argue that's decentralized

02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:20.520
because it's global, it's all across the world,

02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:25.520
but the miners, they're still, it's more centralized.

02:42:25.640 --> 02:42:27.440
So if you're thinking of making a case

02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:30.280
for Bitcoin being decentralized,

02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:34.480
do you worry about the miners being somewhat centralized?

02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:37.480
Is the nodes the important thing to think about?

02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:38.320
Yeah.

02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:41.400
Is that number of nodes counts as centralized and not?

02:42:42.280 --> 02:42:43.960
The nodes are what matters because the nodes

02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:46.760
are what determines Bitcoin's consensus parameters.

02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:50.760
I think the best way to think about it

02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:54.760
is that miners simply sell a commodity to the nodes

02:42:54.760 --> 02:42:56.960
and that commodity is Bitcoin blocks.

02:42:56.960 --> 02:42:58.960
So what a miner does is they solve

02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:00.400
the proof of work problem.

02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:02.320
So they keep operating their computers

02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:04.920
until they can get a solution to the problem.

02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:07.040
And then they attach that to a bunch of transactions

02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:08.840
and present it to the nodes

02:43:08.840 --> 02:43:11.520
for the nodes to ratify and approve it.

02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:15.920
So therefore, and this is, I strongly recommend people

02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:18.760
learn about the 2017 block size war

02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:21.720
to understand why miners don't control Bitcoin.

02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:25.120
I discussed this briefly in my Bitcoin Standard,

02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:27.760
but there's a recent book that discusses this in detail

02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:30.680
called The Block Size War by Jonathan Beer.

02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:33.840
It's a great description of, in 2017,

02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:36.440
essentially the miners thought that they can control Bitcoin.

02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:41.040
There was one mining company that produced

02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:43.720
the majority of the machines that were on the network

02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:48.320
and their allies had a control of the machines

02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:50.840
that were out there and they control

02:43:50.840 --> 02:43:51.840
the majority of the hash rate.

02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:55.160
And they thought that they could change Bitcoin's supply,

02:43:55.160 --> 02:43:57.800
not supply, sorry, they could change Bitcoin's block size,

02:43:57.800 --> 02:44:01.880
which is a tiny little detail, technical parameters.

02:44:01.880 --> 02:44:05.440
It's not even all that big of a deal for the economics of it.

02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:08.320
But they thought that they could pass this change.

02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:10.600
They could force this change on the network.

02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:13.800
And the members of the network rejected it

02:44:13.800 --> 02:44:15.200
and they weren't able to do it.

02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:17.560
So the nodes are what is sovereign.

02:44:17.560 --> 02:44:20.400
The nodes are what determine the rules of the game.

02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:23.560
The miners are a service provider.

02:44:23.560 --> 02:44:26.160
The miners invest capital upfront.

02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:29.000
They buy the machines, they buy the electricity,

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.600
they buy the storage, they buy the locations,

02:44:31.640 --> 02:44:34.760
they pay the rent, and they invest all of that money

02:44:35.720 --> 02:44:38.000
based on the idea that if they behave

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:39.880
according to what the nodes want,

02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:42.200
the nodes will reward them with Bitcoin.

02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:43.640
So the miners are in no position

02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:45.080
to dictate terms for anyone.

02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:47.840
You know, they've put up their capital upfront

02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:51.680
and they will only recoup it if they do what the nodes want.

02:44:51.680 --> 02:44:53.360
So therefore, what really matters

02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:54.920
is the decentralization of the nodes.

02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:57.960
So you wanna have as many nodes as possible.

02:44:57.960 --> 02:45:01.360
You wanna have a system where there's a large number

02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:04.400
of nodes and this is of course the biggest problem

02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:08.760
with other digital currencies is that, you know,

02:45:08.760 --> 02:45:11.240
because basically Bitcoin has cornered the market

02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:13.680
on a digital currency, the only way

02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:15.400
that you can really get traction

02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:18.160
is to generate a whole bunch of buzzwords

02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:20.480
about, you know, we're doing this and we're doing that.

02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:23.800
And so other digital currencies are optimized

02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:27.960
for bells and whistles and buzzwords.

02:45:27.960 --> 02:45:30.800
And that means adding a computational load

02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:33.720
which makes the nodes bigger, harder to operate

02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:35.720
and therefore you have a very small number of nodes.

02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:39.880
In fact, very few digital currencies are keen

02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:42.080
to publicize how many nodes there are

02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:44.400
and they don't have full nodes in the true sense.

02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:46.600
And it doesn't even matter how many nodes they have

02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:51.600
because de facto, you know, you can spin up a million nodes

02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:57.160
tomorrow on AWS, doesn't really matter.

02:45:57.160 --> 02:46:00.320
What matters is de facto, do the nodes dictate

02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:02.280
the rules of consensus?

02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:04.000
And the fact that with most digital currencies

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.200
you can have hard forks very frequently

02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:08.240
and they can change the supply all the time

02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:09.600
means that there's a small group of people

02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:11.920
who agree amongst themselves how to move forward.

02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:15.360
Yeah, so you threw in a few criticisms of all coins there.

02:46:15.360 --> 02:46:17.240
So one is the small group.

02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:19.800
That one we could talk about, it's a tricky one

02:46:19.800 --> 02:46:22.720
and we talked about that with Satoshi Nakamoto.

02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:26.080
But the other one is a small number of nodes

02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:29.040
to push back on that as computational power increases

02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:32.680
you can argue that that enables more and more

02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:35.800
cheap computers to serve as nodes.

02:46:35.800 --> 02:46:38.960
So at least it paints a future where nodes

02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:41.360
are always increasing because computational power

02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:43.280
is always increasing and getting cheaper

02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:44.640
and cheaper and cheaper.

02:46:44.640 --> 02:46:46.240
So at least there's a hope for the future

02:46:46.240 --> 02:46:49.200
for greater and greater decentralization

02:46:49.200 --> 02:46:50.520
on the node front.

02:46:50.520 --> 02:46:52.920
Yeah, but I mean, ultimately, again,

02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:55.480
it doesn't really matter how many nodes you have

02:46:55.480 --> 02:46:59.560
if the way that the currency is run

02:46:59.560 --> 02:47:01.760
is that you're gonna have a hard fork every few months

02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:03.520
which is the case with most other currencies.

02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:06.120
Bitcoin is the only one that's not have a hard fork.

02:47:07.160 --> 02:47:10.200
Basically, the unique thing about Bitcoin

02:47:10.200 --> 02:47:12.240
in a tactical sense is that you could get

02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:16.880
the original software that Satoshi himself ran in 2009

02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:21.720
to start the network and you could run it today

02:47:21.720 --> 02:47:23.160
and it would sync with the blockchain.

02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:24.880
There's one bug you need to fix,

02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:28.480
one mistake that would have only appeared,

02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:31.600
I think in around 2013 or 14 or something like that

02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:33.040
that he wasn't aware of back then.

02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:35.520
So you just need to fix this one tiny little bug

02:47:35.520 --> 02:47:37.680
and then the consensus parameters are still the same

02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:39.400
so you're able to sync to it.

02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:41.520
This is not true for most other digital currencies,

02:47:41.520 --> 02:47:42.920
I'd say probably all of them

02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:44.880
because they've all had many hard forks

02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:46.360
which they think of as upgrades

02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:49.400
and they market this thing as,

02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:52.480
well, Bitcoin can't upgrade but we upgrade all the time.

02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:55.280
Well, yeah, you know what else upgrades all the time?

02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:58.240
Facebook, Apple, Amazon, anything that centralizes

02:47:58.240 --> 02:48:00.480
very easy to upgrade and that's precisely why,

02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:01.440
as Michael Saylor says,

02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:04.640
these things are somebody's liability, they are security.

02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:07.160
You're carrying on somebody's technical

02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:08.760
and economic liability.

02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:12.720
They can hard fork, they can 10x the supply tomorrow.

02:48:12.720 --> 02:48:17.040
Yeah, they can fall victim to the same

02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:21.840
corrupting forces that governments fall victim to.

02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:23.360
Sure, and for people who don't know, yeah,

02:48:23.360 --> 02:48:28.360
hard fork is a reverse incompatible change

02:48:29.960 --> 02:48:34.280
to the underlying function of a cryptocurrency.

02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:40.120
Of course, there is hard forks of Bitcoin as well.

02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:43.280
I'm sure all of which you love dearly.

02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:44.840
Anyway, but that doesn't matter.

02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:47.200
The original Bitcoin, for the most part,

02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:50.720
has not undergone any changes and that's one of the-

02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:52.000
I mean, it has undergone changes,

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:57.000
but none in the important parameters of the network.

02:48:57.240 --> 02:49:00.080
So another criticism is about energy.

02:49:00.920 --> 02:49:02.720
So the proof of work,

02:49:02.720 --> 02:49:05.200
consensus mechanism uses a lot of energy.

02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:08.720
What's the response to that criticism of Bitcoin?

02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:10.840
Yes, because it's worth it.

02:49:12.240 --> 02:49:13.080
Okay.

02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:15.000
The airplane uses a lot more energy than a kayak.

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:16.880
When you're gonna cross the Atlantic next time,

02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:17.720
what are you gonna take?

02:49:17.720 --> 02:49:19.680
A kayak that is environmentally friendly

02:49:19.680 --> 02:49:21.640
according to this insane definition,

02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:22.840
or are you gonna take an airplane

02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:24.040
that consumes a lot of energy?

02:49:24.040 --> 02:49:26.720
So the cost benefit analysis here

02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:29.520
is such where you have to consider

02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:31.360
both the cost and the benefit.

02:49:31.360 --> 02:49:34.880
Exactly, and I think it's an astonishing testament

02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:38.520
to just how far backward people's scientific

02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:41.400
and technological thinking has devolved

02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:43.360
to the point where we think of energy consumption

02:49:43.360 --> 02:49:44.200
as a bad thing.

02:49:44.200 --> 02:49:46.960
I think it's just, and in the Fiat standard I discussed

02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:48.920
in the whole hysteria around energy,

02:49:48.920 --> 02:49:52.760
and I think it's a product of Fiat inflation

02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:55.200
because it's a way of trying to covering up

02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:58.440
the fact that energy, fuels that are reliable

02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:00.560
and necessary for the current world

02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:03.640
are becoming more and more expensive because of inflation.

02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:05.800
And so governments are always looking for excuses

02:50:05.800 --> 02:50:07.920
for why you should not be using those things.

02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:10.200
And so they promote all kinds of stupid pseudosciences

02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:13.360
that tell you about why these things are bad.

02:50:13.360 --> 02:50:17.720
But really, all technology is, well, not all,

02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:21.080
but the vast majority of technological innovations

02:50:21.080 --> 02:50:24.520
involve economizing on human time and judgment

02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:26.000
and replacing it with machines,

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.440
with reliable machines that spend a lot of energy.

02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:31.040
So that's what a telephone does.

02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:33.200
Instead of having to send somebody across the world

02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:36.120
to tell somebody something else or send a letter,

02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:38.760
a telephone allows you to do it.

02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:39.840
The car is like that.

02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:43.040
You could walk, but a car consumes a lot more energy,

02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:45.320
but it allows you to travel much faster and safer

02:50:45.320 --> 02:50:47.240
and more reliably.

02:50:47.240 --> 02:50:48.760
An airplane is like that.

02:50:48.760 --> 02:50:50.880
Modern telecommunication.

02:50:50.880 --> 02:50:54.720
Human prosperity is an increase in the consumption of energy.

02:50:54.720 --> 02:50:58.800
And I think it is, it is an absolutely criminal thing.

02:50:58.800 --> 02:51:01.680
And I genuinely mean the word criminal

02:51:01.680 --> 02:51:04.840
to portray energy consumption as a bad thing

02:51:04.840 --> 02:51:07.320
because it is truly depriving people of the chance

02:51:07.320 --> 02:51:10.360
to live a life that makes life better, you know?

02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:12.480
It's truly criminal to tell poor countries

02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:15.440
that they should not consume the same energy sources

02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:17.000
that are being used in rich countries

02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:21.840
on which our modern infrastructure and modern life relies.

02:51:21.840 --> 02:51:23.000
That's what life is, you know?

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.720
If you reduce the consumption of energy in the US

02:51:25.720 --> 02:51:28.480
to the levels that you have in poor countries today,

02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:30.280
the US would become desperately poor.

02:51:30.280 --> 02:51:31.360
A lot of people would die.

02:51:31.360 --> 02:51:32.520
Cities would collapse.

02:51:32.520 --> 02:51:34.520
The quality of life would decrease significantly.

02:51:34.520 --> 02:51:37.280
A high quality of life often requires,

02:51:37.280 --> 02:51:38.440
given the current technology,

02:51:38.440 --> 02:51:39.560
a high expenditure of energy.

02:51:39.560 --> 02:51:41.000
Yeah, and I should be clear, you know?

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:42.680
It's not a quality of life in the sense of,

02:51:42.680 --> 02:51:43.840
many people think of this as,

02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:45.160
oh yeah, well, you know,

02:51:46.560 --> 02:51:50.240
taking needless flights for vacations.

02:51:50.240 --> 02:51:53.440
No, no, these are the cherries on top of the cake,

02:51:53.440 --> 02:51:54.960
but the substance of the cake

02:51:54.960 --> 02:51:56.920
and the real benefits of energy

02:51:56.920 --> 02:51:59.840
is the fact that children,

02:51:59.840 --> 02:52:02.760
premature babies survive in countries

02:52:02.760 --> 02:52:05.560
that have reliable 24-hour cheap electricity.

02:52:05.560 --> 02:52:07.160
If your child is born premature,

02:52:07.160 --> 02:52:08.640
that you put it in an incubator,

02:52:08.640 --> 02:52:10.440
put him in an incubator or her,

02:52:10.440 --> 02:52:11.840
they're highly likely to survive.

02:52:11.840 --> 02:52:14.200
If you don't have 24-hour electricity,

02:52:14.200 --> 02:52:16.040
that child is not gonna make it.

02:52:16.040 --> 02:52:18.920
And you see it, you know,

02:52:18.920 --> 02:52:20.760
the level of energy consumption per capita

02:52:20.760 --> 02:52:23.400
has highly correlated, not just to income,

02:52:23.400 --> 02:52:26.280
but also to health outcomes, to infant mortality,

02:52:26.280 --> 02:52:28.480
to all of the things that you care about.

02:52:28.480 --> 02:52:31.840
And Bitcoin is just another technology.

02:52:31.840 --> 02:52:34.640
It does consume a lot more energy than central banks.

02:52:34.640 --> 02:52:37.840
A lot of Bitcoiners like to take a cop out of this

02:52:37.840 --> 02:52:40.120
by saying, well, you know, central banks consume money

02:52:40.120 --> 02:52:42.760
and ATMs consume a lot of energy.

02:52:42.760 --> 02:52:44.240
And I think if you calculate

02:52:44.240 --> 02:52:45.920
how much central banks and banks consume,

02:52:45.920 --> 02:52:47.080
I think it's a rounding error

02:52:47.080 --> 02:52:49.720
next to what Bitcoin consumes.

02:52:49.720 --> 02:52:52.200
I think Bitcoin is just, maybe not a rounding error,

02:52:52.200 --> 02:52:53.840
but it's still, Bitcoin is, I think,

02:52:53.840 --> 02:52:55.240
is going to consume a lot more.

02:52:55.240 --> 02:52:56.280
And that's a good thing.

02:52:56.280 --> 02:52:58.200
You know, what's humbling is to look,

02:52:58.200 --> 02:53:00.120
because even just looking into this

02:53:00.120 --> 02:53:02.480
forces me to look at the energy expenditures

02:53:02.480 --> 02:53:04.680
for many of the things we take for granted.

02:53:04.680 --> 02:53:07.320
Obviously, computers and the digital,

02:53:07.360 --> 02:53:10.360
our digital lives, it just,

02:53:10.360 --> 02:53:12.080
Bitcoin becomes a rounding error

02:53:12.960 --> 02:53:15.120
relative to how much energy spent

02:53:15.120 --> 02:53:16.880
on all the computers in our world.

02:53:16.880 --> 02:53:19.880
But also like things like home appliances,

02:53:19.880 --> 02:53:22.720
microwaves and hair dryers and stuff.

02:53:22.720 --> 02:53:23.560
Yeah.

02:53:24.440 --> 02:53:25.280
Yeah, I mean, this is-

02:53:25.280 --> 02:53:26.760
It starts being hilarious.

02:53:26.760 --> 02:53:28.360
It's like, oh, these things

02:53:28.360 --> 02:53:31.440
that are just part of our modern life,

02:53:31.440 --> 02:53:33.320
they're either the same order,

02:53:33.320 --> 02:53:35.960
at least the same order of magnitude as Bitcoin.

02:53:35.960 --> 02:53:39.360
And they seem like trivial parts of life.

02:53:39.360 --> 02:53:40.640
Yeah, and this is the thing,

02:53:40.640 --> 02:53:41.760
all of the people that complain

02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:43.240
about Bitcoin's energy consumption,

02:53:43.240 --> 02:53:45.120
I presume they use washing machines.

02:53:45.120 --> 02:53:50.120
Now, why should their desire for clean and dry clothes,

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:52.200
could they get to consume energy?

02:53:52.200 --> 02:53:55.000
And I mean, I used to live in Lebanon.

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:56.360
Lebanon had hyperinflation.

02:53:56.360 --> 02:53:58.960
I escaped from hyperinflation.

02:53:58.960 --> 02:54:00.600
I escaped, it prevented,

02:54:01.760 --> 02:54:03.640
my life could have been ruined by hyperinflation.

02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:04.720
And the reason that it wasn't ruined

02:54:04.720 --> 02:54:06.200
is because I have Bitcoin.

02:54:06.200 --> 02:54:10.160
So, I don't know, am I allowed to swear on your podcast?

02:54:10.160 --> 02:54:11.000
Yes, please.

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:12.320
So fuck your washing machine.

02:54:14.800 --> 02:54:17.440
Given a choice between my washing machine and my Bitcoin,

02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:19.080
I'll choose Bitcoin.

02:54:19.080 --> 02:54:21.680
It's a technology that has already saved my life.

02:54:21.680 --> 02:54:22.800
And I think it's gonna save the lives

02:54:22.800 --> 02:54:24.560
of many, many, many, many more people.

02:54:24.560 --> 02:54:27.480
So, but of course I don't have to choose

02:54:27.480 --> 02:54:31.120
between my Bitcoin and my washing machine

02:54:31.120 --> 02:54:33.320
because this is, you know,

02:54:33.320 --> 02:54:35.200
we're just constantly consuming more energy

02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:36.720
and we're gonna continue to consume more energy

02:54:36.720 --> 02:54:37.880
in this world.

02:54:37.880 --> 02:54:39.920
And that's just what progress is.

02:54:39.920 --> 02:54:42.720
And a small remark, so in principle,

02:54:42.720 --> 02:54:43.840
I don't think this is a problem,

02:54:43.840 --> 02:54:45.040
but the other thing about Bitcoin,

02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:47.400
where it is different from washing machines,

02:54:47.400 --> 02:54:48.920
Bitcoin is truly unique in this.

02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:52.880
It's the only thing whose energy consumption

02:54:52.880 --> 02:54:55.240
can be produced absolutely anywhere.

02:54:55.240 --> 02:54:57.320
Your washing machine needs to be in your house

02:54:57.320 --> 02:54:58.160
where you live.

02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:00.760
And you live in a city surrounded by 10 million people

02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:02.960
and they all have their washing machines

02:55:02.960 --> 02:55:04.560
and they're all connected to the grid.

02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:06.560
And they generally tend to do their laundry

02:55:06.560 --> 02:55:08.000
around the same time.

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:11.440
And so you have to put the load of the washing machine

02:55:11.440 --> 02:55:14.440
on the grid at the same time.

02:55:14.440 --> 02:55:16.400
There needs to be one power plant

02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:18.000
and all of the infrastructure needs to work

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:18.840
at the same time.

02:55:18.840 --> 02:55:20.080
And the electricity is pretty expensive

02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:23.400
because it's being done in a place with high demand.

02:55:23.400 --> 02:55:26.320
Bitcoin does not need to buy electricity

02:55:26.320 --> 02:55:28.440
from places where it has high demand

02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:30.360
because it can buy electricity from anywhere.

02:55:30.360 --> 02:55:32.360
This is what's truly mind blowing about it.

02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:35.600
You can buy what you need to,

02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:37.200
the electricity that you need for mining

02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:38.280
can be done anywhere.

02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:43.280
So you can have a waterfall in the north of Canada,

02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:46.480
300 miles away from any population center.

02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:48.520
There's water falling, there's energy.

02:55:48.520 --> 02:55:51.160
You can put a hydroelectric dam there

02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:53.520
and then you can use that energy to operate the miners.

02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:54.800
And then the miners just need

02:55:54.800 --> 02:55:56.720
a satellite internet connection.

02:55:56.720 --> 02:55:58.760
And effectively you're selling that energy

02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:01.160
that is isolated to the grid.

02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:02.920
And because of the way the Bitcoin functions,

02:56:02.920 --> 02:56:04.840
because of the difficulty adjustment,

02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:07.240
the only profitable miners are the ones

02:56:07.240 --> 02:56:09.240
who can get cheap electricity.

02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:11.680
Basically, if you're mining at grid cost,

02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:13.200
if you're mining at around,

02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:16.760
the average electricity price in the world is around 14 cents.

02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:19.160
If you're mining at 14 cents in Bitcoin,

02:56:19.160 --> 02:56:21.360
you're most likely not gonna make it.

02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:23.880
If you're running your miners at 14 cents,

02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:26.040
because everybody could mine at 14 cents.

02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:30.400
And so what happens is if everybody's mining at 14 cents,

02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:32.760
14 cents stops being profitable

02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:34.800
and then only the people mining at a lower price

02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:35.640
are profitable.

02:56:35.640 --> 02:56:38.400
So that's why Bitcoin mining is not competing

02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:39.360
with your washing machine.

02:56:39.360 --> 02:56:41.080
And this is the absurd thing

02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:45.520
about this kind of energy scarcity viewpoint

02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:47.000
where, oh no, it's a catastrophe.

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:48.520
Bitcoin is taking all the electricity

02:56:48.520 --> 02:56:51.040
as if the electricity is just one fixed pie

02:56:51.040 --> 02:56:53.200
that we all have to share and fight over.

02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:55.000
And this is how I keep making fun

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:56.400
of these stupid headlines they put out

02:56:56.400 --> 02:56:59.760
where Bitcoin is consuming more electricity than Portugal.

02:56:59.760 --> 02:57:03.120
All right, well, maybe we should shut down Portugal then.

02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:05.240
What the hell has Portugal given us?

02:57:05.240 --> 02:57:07.240
Obviously, it's not...

02:57:07.240 --> 02:57:09.360
He doesn't mean that I've gotten so much criticism

02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:13.320
for saying Christiano Ronaldo is not in the top five.

02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:16.200
I apologize, I love Portugal.

02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:18.640
That's another discussion we should get into.

02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:21.280
Because you posted a few soccer things.

02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:23.440
I realize how passionate people are about this.

02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:25.040
Listen, it was a joke, all right?

02:57:25.040 --> 02:57:27.560
He deserves to be potential in the top five.

02:57:27.560 --> 02:57:28.960
Yeah, I love Portugal.

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:30.440
And even though I'm a Liverpool fan,

02:57:30.440 --> 02:57:32.480
I still respect Christiano Ronaldo a lot.

02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:35.560
In fact, I hold a very unpopular opinion

02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:37.120
where I think Christiano Ronaldo

02:57:37.120 --> 02:57:39.080
is the greatest football player ever.

02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:41.680
Number one, Overpele and Maradona, Messi.

02:57:41.680 --> 02:57:42.520
Better than Messi.

02:57:42.520 --> 02:57:44.160
Yes, he's been doing it for 20 years at the top.

02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:45.000
Nobody's ever done that.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:46.560
He's won everything everywhere.

02:57:46.560 --> 02:57:49.320
Everywhere he goes, at the top, at the Champions League.

02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:53.120
Really strong argument to be made for him.

02:57:53.120 --> 02:57:55.160
Messi's never done anything outside of Barcelona.

02:57:55.160 --> 02:57:56.000
That's the thing.

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:59.400
So you appreciate performance, long-term,

02:57:59.400 --> 02:58:03.640
versus the genius of the actual play on the field.

02:58:04.640 --> 02:58:07.640
I mean, the genius is Ronaldo's the top scorer of all time.

02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:08.480
He's scored more goals.

02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:09.320
So the genius is in the scoring,

02:58:09.320 --> 02:58:13.480
not the actual dance of the play, the creativity.

02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:14.680
Well, I mean, I don't know.

02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:18.240
Messi's been absolutely mediocre since he's left Barcelona.

02:58:18.240 --> 02:58:20.080
These are strong words.

02:58:20.080 --> 02:58:23.240
He's scored, what, two goals in PSG season this year.

02:58:23.240 --> 02:58:25.000
They're out of the Champions League.

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:26.280
What about Mohamed Salah?

02:58:26.280 --> 02:58:27.400
You've posted a lot of him.

02:58:27.400 --> 02:58:29.160
Oh yeah, he's my boy.

02:58:29.160 --> 02:58:31.560
Is he climbing up to be someone?

02:58:31.560 --> 02:58:33.120
I think he should win the Ballon d'Or this year.

02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:34.800
He probably should have won it last year as well.

02:58:34.800 --> 02:58:36.240
He's been absolutely outstanding.

02:58:36.240 --> 02:58:39.760
But I mean, just people are so crazy about Messi,

02:58:39.760 --> 02:58:40.840
they keep giving him accolades.

02:58:40.840 --> 02:58:42.200
He hasn't deserved, I think, Messi

02:58:42.200 --> 02:58:45.080
the last couple of Ballon d'Ors that he got.

02:58:45.080 --> 02:58:46.400
I mean, he's a great player and everything,

02:58:46.400 --> 02:58:49.360
but no, he did not deserve it last year.

02:58:51.840 --> 02:58:53.960
We can agree to disagree.

02:58:54.720 --> 02:58:56.800
You're a Barca fan or a Messi fan?

02:58:56.800 --> 02:58:59.560
I would say, no, I wouldn't say I'm a Barca fan,

02:58:59.560 --> 02:59:01.240
but a Barca fan because of Messi.

02:59:01.240 --> 02:59:04.680
And I just, I think it's like, there's certain things.

02:59:06.720 --> 02:59:09.800
So when I was growing up in the Soviet Union, Russia,

02:59:09.800 --> 02:59:14.440
I remember Maradona, he was the first person

02:59:14.440 --> 02:59:17.600
I saw that I was like, oh wow, this could be,

02:59:19.480 --> 02:59:22.720
this is greatness in sport, not just football and sport.

02:59:22.880 --> 02:59:25.160
And for some reason, I mean, it's something about like

02:59:25.160 --> 02:59:28.640
Diego Armando Maradona, like the way they were commentating,

02:59:28.640 --> 02:59:31.680
the genius of his play, the mix of ego,

02:59:31.680 --> 02:59:32.960
and again, the performance,

02:59:32.960 --> 02:59:35.400
but being able to carry a team on his shoulders,

02:59:35.400 --> 02:59:38.680
that I just fell in love with whatever he represented.

02:59:38.680 --> 02:59:40.640
And then by that, Argentina.

02:59:40.640 --> 02:59:44.240
And then Messi, I saw when he was like 16, 17,

02:59:44.240 --> 02:59:46.120
when he was just like right in the early days.

02:59:46.120 --> 02:59:49.560
And when you first see a person and you see the genius

02:59:49.560 --> 02:59:52.000
and you notice that, and then it turns out to be

02:59:52.040 --> 02:59:55.320
actually a great player, for some reason you're invested.

02:59:55.320 --> 02:59:59.360
You're emotionally invested, you're, I don't know.

02:59:59.360 --> 03:00:02.280
So you kind of just fall in love and then you get,

03:00:02.280 --> 03:00:03.120
you pick sides.

03:00:03.120 --> 03:00:04.560
I mean, that's the thing about football.

03:00:04.560 --> 03:00:08.760
Part of the fun things about football soccer is like,

03:00:08.760 --> 03:00:12.320
you pick a guy, you pick a team, and fuck everyone else.

03:00:12.320 --> 03:00:13.800
And you just have fun talking shit.

03:00:13.800 --> 03:00:15.480
I mean, there's part of it, you know.

03:00:15.480 --> 03:00:18.360
It's great, it's great because I think, you know,

03:00:18.360 --> 03:00:19.760
obviously it's a very stupid thing to do,

03:00:19.760 --> 03:00:21.800
but I think if you don't do it in football,

03:00:21.800 --> 03:00:22.640
you're gonna do it in real life.

03:00:22.640 --> 03:00:23.760
Elsewhere, that's right.

03:00:23.760 --> 03:00:24.800
That's why it's very good.

03:00:24.800 --> 03:00:27.400
Like, that's it, you know, instead of hating people

03:00:27.400 --> 03:00:30.480
for their religion and for their skin color,

03:00:30.480 --> 03:00:32.440
hate them because they support Manchester United.

03:00:32.440 --> 03:00:33.920
Exactly.

03:00:33.920 --> 03:00:35.120
So you're a Liverpool fan.

03:00:35.120 --> 03:00:37.240
Yes, yes, hardcore, long-term.

03:00:38.840 --> 03:00:41.800
But yeah, so to go back to the original point on Portugal.

03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:42.640
Energy.

03:00:42.640 --> 03:00:43.480
Yeah, energy.

03:00:43.480 --> 03:00:45.880
Bitcoin is not competing with Portugal

03:00:45.880 --> 03:00:47.360
because Bitcoin is buying energy

03:00:47.360 --> 03:00:49.200
from places where we can't buy it.

03:00:49.200 --> 03:00:52.200
Because all the places where we can buy energy

03:00:52.200 --> 03:00:55.320
for our washing machines, we're bidding up the price

03:00:55.320 --> 03:00:57.960
enough to make it non-viable for Bitcoin.

03:00:57.960 --> 03:01:00.200
That's why, you know, you'll see those headlines

03:01:00.200 --> 03:01:02.320
about Bitcoin consuming more energy than Portugal.

03:01:02.320 --> 03:01:04.160
Well, if you look at Portugal, I mean,

03:01:04.160 --> 03:01:06.040
they've got giant power plants in Portugal,

03:01:06.040 --> 03:01:07.360
they've got millions of people,

03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:09.680
and they've got enormous amounts of infrastructure.

03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:13.160
Where are all of these infrastructure for Bitcoin mining?

03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:14.800
You don't see it in the cities.

03:01:14.800 --> 03:01:18.760
It's all isolated, it's all out away from the cities.

03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:21.920
Or it's connected to grids that have serious overcapacity.

03:01:21.920 --> 03:01:25.160
So Bitcoin is not out there buying the expensive energy,

03:01:25.160 --> 03:01:29.120
taking energy away from people who can't afford it.

03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:30.880
It's out there buying its own energy

03:01:30.880 --> 03:01:32.600
because it doesn't need to buy the expensive energy

03:01:32.600 --> 03:01:34.400
that people really need.

03:01:34.400 --> 03:01:37.440
So one other criticism from an investment perspective,

03:01:37.440 --> 03:01:39.440
from a gambling perspective that people see

03:01:39.440 --> 03:01:41.520
is the volatility of Bitcoin.

03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:44.000
Of course, it has been somewhat decreasing over time,

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:48.640
but what's your answer to the sort of criticism

03:01:48.640 --> 03:01:51.400
that Bitcoin is too volatile, I want to stay away,

03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:53.360
it doesn't seem like a safe place for me

03:01:53.360 --> 03:01:57.040
to invest either short-term or long-term?

03:01:57.040 --> 03:01:58.560
There's no denying there's a volatility

03:01:58.560 --> 03:02:00.360
and there's a high oscillation in the value

03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:01.200
in the short-term.

03:02:01.200 --> 03:02:05.400
So I think the safe way to approach that

03:02:05.400 --> 03:02:07.760
is in terms of position sizing.

03:02:07.760 --> 03:02:10.600
If the volatility bothers you,

03:02:10.600 --> 03:02:12.760
then you're over-invested perhaps.

03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:17.520
So maybe you should reduce the size of your position

03:02:17.520 --> 03:02:19.600
so that the volatility doesn't bother you.

03:02:19.600 --> 03:02:24.600
And this is the short answer that like stack

03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:26.720
as much as your conviction

03:02:26.720 --> 03:02:28.920
will allow you to tolerate the volatility.

03:02:31.040 --> 03:02:33.400
And of course, the reason you should try

03:02:33.400 --> 03:02:36.240
and consider tolerating the volatility more

03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:40.480
is the options are you hold fiat assets,

03:02:40.480 --> 03:02:43.840
which only go down stable, relatively stable,

03:02:43.840 --> 03:02:46.160
not a lot of volatility day-to-day,

03:02:46.160 --> 03:02:50.640
the value of your dollar doesn't change 40% overnight,

03:02:50.640 --> 03:02:52.920
20% overnight or something like that,

03:02:52.920 --> 03:02:54.600
but it does go down reliably.

03:02:54.600 --> 03:02:57.000
It's gonna go down 40%, you can count on it.

03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.920
It might take a year, two years, five years, 10 years,

03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:01.800
compared to the things that you want to buy,

03:03:01.800 --> 03:03:06.000
it's gonna go down by 40% and it's not gonna come back

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:07.600
and it's gonna go down another 40%

03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:09.760
and then another 40% and then another 40%.

03:03:09.760 --> 03:03:14.760
So the option really is relatively short-term stability

03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:16.560
with long-term decline

03:03:16.560 --> 03:03:19.720
or short-term volatility with long-term rise.

03:03:19.720 --> 03:03:22.680
And so that's another way in which Bitcoin teaches people

03:03:22.680 --> 03:03:24.800
to have a low time preference and think about the long-term.

03:03:24.800 --> 03:03:29.280
So stack, accumulate and think of it in the long-term.

03:03:29.280 --> 03:03:31.240
It's a function of the fact that Bitcoin is new.

03:03:31.240 --> 03:03:33.000
Bitcoin is currently less than 1%

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:34.200
of the global money market.

03:03:34.200 --> 03:03:36.560
So there's about $100 trillion of money

03:03:36.560 --> 03:03:40.640
out there in the world, $100 trillion roughly of fiat

03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:42.840
and about $10 trillion of gold

03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:44.920
and Bitcoin is less than $1 trillion.

03:03:44.920 --> 03:03:48.440
So one rich guy decides to get into Bitcoin,

03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:50.200
that's gonna show up on the Bitcoin chart.

03:03:50.200 --> 03:03:53.000
You look at it, Elon Musk decides to buy Bitcoin,

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.760
you see the buy, you see the news and it happens

03:03:55.760 --> 03:03:57.880
and you see the pump.

03:03:57.880 --> 03:03:59.920
Elon Musk decides that he doesn't like Bitcoin,

03:03:59.920 --> 03:04:01.240
you see the drop.

03:04:01.240 --> 03:04:03.480
But a few years ago, it used to be that

03:04:03.480 --> 03:04:07.200
one random millionaire would cause that pump.

03:04:07.200 --> 03:04:09.840
Now you have to be the richest guy in the world to do that.

03:04:09.840 --> 03:04:12.400
In a few years, you're gonna have to be the richest country

03:04:12.920 --> 03:04:15.000
to be able to do that to the Bitcoin price,

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.200
maybe many years, maybe not a few years.

03:04:17.200 --> 03:04:19.160
But as Bitcoin grows, think about it

03:04:19.160 --> 03:04:23.440
as a liquid pool of money, currently it's a small pool

03:04:23.440 --> 03:04:25.320
next to a much larger ocean,

03:04:25.320 --> 03:04:26.840
which is the entire money market.

03:04:26.840 --> 03:04:30.560
And so one person jumps from that to this small pool,

03:04:30.560 --> 03:04:32.200
they can make a big splash.

03:04:32.200 --> 03:04:36.160
As the pool grows, essentially the saleability increases

03:04:36.160 --> 03:04:38.840
and the likelihood of one individual purchase

03:04:38.840 --> 03:04:43.320
affecting the price so violently decreases.

03:04:43.320 --> 03:04:46.760
And so over time, as the size of the market increases,

03:04:46.760 --> 03:04:48.880
I think we're gonna see the volatility decline

03:04:48.880 --> 03:04:49.720
more and more.

03:04:49.720 --> 03:04:52.320
Ultimately, if you look at gold,

03:04:52.320 --> 03:04:54.680
historically gold has been very, very stable.

03:04:54.680 --> 03:04:56.320
It did not achieve its stability

03:04:56.320 --> 03:04:58.600
because the central bank was in charge of gold supply

03:04:58.600 --> 03:05:00.840
or because there was a gold committee

03:05:00.840 --> 03:05:02.840
that decided how much gold gets produced.

03:05:03.920 --> 03:05:05.600
It achieved that stability

03:05:05.600 --> 03:05:08.200
because it became the most saleable good

03:05:08.240 --> 03:05:09.880
and so therefore became the good

03:05:09.880 --> 03:05:12.880
that contains the most cash balances in the world.

03:05:12.880 --> 03:05:14.080
And the end of the 19th century,

03:05:14.080 --> 03:05:16.840
everybody held cash balances in gold

03:05:16.840 --> 03:05:20.720
and the new production was a tiny little addition

03:05:20.720 --> 03:05:23.680
to global production, to the supply.

03:05:23.680 --> 03:05:26.880
So that's what made gold the most relatively,

03:05:26.880 --> 03:05:27.920
I shouldn't say stable

03:05:27.920 --> 03:05:29.800
because nothing is stable in economics,

03:05:29.800 --> 03:05:31.920
but relatively it holds onto its value

03:05:31.920 --> 03:05:35.120
and it's much less volatile than digital currency,

03:05:35.120 --> 03:05:36.360
than national currencies.

03:05:37.320 --> 03:05:41.360
That's because it has the highest stock to flow ratio

03:05:41.360 --> 03:05:43.520
and that's because its supply

03:05:43.520 --> 03:05:47.440
is a tiny fraction of the liquid market.

03:05:47.440 --> 03:05:48.920
And as the liquid market grows,

03:05:48.920 --> 03:05:50.480
as the size of cash balances grows

03:05:50.480 --> 03:05:53.000
and trades in Bitcoin cancel each other out,

03:05:54.080 --> 03:05:57.000
you get only slight changes in value.

03:05:57.000 --> 03:06:01.120
So I think as Bitcoin matures, that's going to decline.

03:06:01.120 --> 03:06:04.360
So effectively, I think the end game is Bitcoin

03:06:04.360 --> 03:06:08.840
is huge, Bitcoin is worth something like,

03:06:08.840 --> 03:06:11.800
I think the total addressable market for Bitcoin

03:06:11.800 --> 03:06:15.520
is not just national currencies and gold's addressable market

03:06:15.520 --> 03:06:18.000
but also government bonds, that's the really big one.

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:18.840
So-

03:06:18.840 --> 03:06:20.280
How do banks compare to gold?

03:06:20.280 --> 03:06:23.320
So you're saying it'll surpass gold with the 10 trillion?

03:06:23.320 --> 03:06:24.160
Yeah.

03:06:24.160 --> 03:06:25.320
What's bonds?

03:06:25.320 --> 03:06:27.000
Where's bonds stand?

03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:28.960
So then there's also national currencies,

03:06:28.960 --> 03:06:30.120
which are about a hundred trillion

03:06:30.120 --> 03:06:31.240
and then there's government bonds,

03:06:31.240 --> 03:06:33.960
which are around 120 billion dollars.

03:06:35.360 --> 03:06:37.040
Sorry, trillion dollars, trillion.

03:06:37.040 --> 03:06:37.880
Trillion, sorry.

03:06:37.880 --> 03:06:38.720
Yes, trillion.

03:06:38.720 --> 03:06:40.440
If we were saying billion, we meant trillion.

03:06:40.440 --> 03:06:41.280
Yeah.

03:06:42.840 --> 03:06:46.280
So you think bonds can move to Bitcoin?

03:06:46.280 --> 03:06:48.520
I've always held, this is the prize,

03:06:48.520 --> 03:06:50.160
this is the main dish.

03:06:50.160 --> 03:06:52.720
Gold is the appetizer, bonds are the main dish

03:06:52.720 --> 03:06:53.560
because bonds have replaced gold.

03:06:53.560 --> 03:06:54.760
It's a hell of an appetizer.

03:06:54.760 --> 03:06:56.680
Yeah.

03:06:56.680 --> 03:06:59.880
I mean, bonds have replaced gold in people's portfolio.

03:07:00.320 --> 03:07:02.520
Remember when we were saying gold was,

03:07:02.520 --> 03:07:04.080
you'd hold it as a saving,

03:07:04.080 --> 03:07:05.560
as the secure part of your portfolio

03:07:05.560 --> 03:07:08.120
and then you take risk with the equity.

03:07:08.120 --> 03:07:10.200
Currently, people do that by holding a part

03:07:10.200 --> 03:07:11.520
of their portfolio in bonds.

03:07:11.520 --> 03:07:14.760
That's the part that they treat as their saving account.

03:07:14.760 --> 03:07:18.160
And then the rest they use for, not speculation,

03:07:18.160 --> 03:07:19.920
for investment in which they take risk.

03:07:19.920 --> 03:07:21.360
Yeah, speculation.

03:07:21.360 --> 03:07:26.360
And that's stocks and equity and other high-risk assets.

03:07:27.400 --> 03:07:29.720
I think Bitcoin is not gonna replace equity.

03:07:30.560 --> 03:07:31.400
There will always be equity.

03:07:31.400 --> 03:07:32.220
There will always be companies

03:07:32.220 --> 03:07:34.120
and people will wanna have equity.

03:07:34.120 --> 03:07:35.640
But it'll probably replace a big chunk

03:07:35.640 --> 03:07:36.880
of current equity markets

03:07:36.880 --> 03:07:39.120
because right now if you want to save,

03:07:39.120 --> 03:07:40.560
it used to be that you hold bonds.

03:07:40.560 --> 03:07:43.400
Now if you wanna save, you go into stock indexes.

03:07:43.400 --> 03:07:47.360
So I think Bitcoin likely eats a big chunk of equity markets

03:07:47.360 --> 03:07:51.120
because currently people are using it as saving.

03:07:51.120 --> 03:07:53.440
And I think it eats all the bonds.

03:07:53.440 --> 03:07:56.760
That's my most ambitious statement.

03:07:56.880 --> 03:08:00.600
The question is the scale of time that happens across.

03:08:00.600 --> 03:08:02.280
But the most important statement you're making

03:08:02.280 --> 03:08:03.560
is about trend.

03:08:03.560 --> 03:08:05.640
Yeah, and also, I mean, let's also remember

03:08:05.640 --> 03:08:08.920
currently bonds nominally don't beat inflation.

03:08:08.920 --> 03:08:11.960
And in real terms, they don't come close

03:08:11.960 --> 03:08:13.360
to really beating inflation.

03:08:13.360 --> 03:08:15.840
So currently, you know, with bonds,

03:08:15.840 --> 03:08:19.680
you're taking on credit default risk to buy a bond

03:08:19.680 --> 03:08:23.760
and also getting less money back in real terms.

03:08:23.760 --> 03:08:26.160
Well, Bitcoin doesn't offer you returns,

03:08:26.200 --> 03:08:28.200
but in real terms, it appreciates much more

03:08:28.200 --> 03:08:31.360
and it has, I believe, a lot less risk associated with it

03:08:31.360 --> 03:08:34.040
than any company or government.

03:08:34.040 --> 03:08:36.480
So let's make things spicy and ask

03:08:36.480 --> 03:08:39.440
if Bitcoin fails in the long-term future.

03:08:40.320 --> 03:08:43.280
As all you just said, economics, volatility,

03:08:43.280 --> 03:08:45.000
things happen in this world.

03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:48.480
The human civilization might end in this century.

03:08:48.480 --> 03:08:50.240
I hope it doesn't, but it might.

03:08:50.240 --> 03:08:52.160
There could be catastrophic events.

03:08:52.160 --> 03:08:55.360
If Bitcoin fails, it goes to zero,

03:08:55.360 --> 03:08:57.440
loses its number one spot.

03:08:57.440 --> 03:08:58.920
What would be the reason?

03:08:58.920 --> 03:09:03.920
If you're an alien visiting Earth 100 years from now

03:09:03.920 --> 03:09:05.920
and just were to analyze the situation,

03:09:05.920 --> 03:09:08.000
Bitcoin is a pretty new thing.

03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:10.560
So the possible trajectories of how the world evolves

03:09:10.560 --> 03:09:13.280
together with this new monetary technology

03:09:13.280 --> 03:09:15.160
is nearly infinite.

03:09:15.160 --> 03:09:17.360
So if it fails, one of those trajectories

03:09:17.360 --> 03:09:19.440
surely involves Bitcoin failing.

03:09:19.440 --> 03:09:21.440
What would be the reason?

03:09:21.440 --> 03:09:23.760
I think the most likely reason that it could fail,

03:09:23.760 --> 03:09:25.840
I don't think this is likely in general,

03:09:25.840 --> 03:09:27.320
but I think it is the most likely

03:09:27.320 --> 03:09:30.520
of all the unlikely things that could destroy Bitcoin,

03:09:30.520 --> 03:09:33.280
is governments go back on a gold standard.

03:09:35.400 --> 03:09:38.360
So they make, in your view, a better decision

03:09:38.360 --> 03:09:41.480
than the current system, just not the best decision.

03:09:41.480 --> 03:09:42.320
Yeah.

03:09:42.320 --> 03:09:44.040
I thought you would go much darker.

03:09:44.040 --> 03:09:47.480
But so that's, yeah, okay, interesting.

03:09:47.480 --> 03:09:50.080
So maybe because of Russia, because of China and so on,

03:09:50.080 --> 03:09:52.200
because of the current war,

03:09:52.200 --> 03:09:57.200
they might reconsider the power that America holds

03:09:57.600 --> 03:09:59.280
because of the monetary,

03:09:59.280 --> 03:10:01.160
because it being the primary currency

03:10:01.160 --> 03:10:05.560
and they'll start thinking about going on a gold standard.

03:10:05.560 --> 03:10:08.200
Yeah, but it would also require the US and the Europeans

03:10:08.200 --> 03:10:10.280
and everybody to want to join in this system

03:10:10.280 --> 03:10:13.240
and sing Kumbaya and play nice with each other

03:10:13.240 --> 03:10:15.320
around the gold standard.

03:10:15.320 --> 03:10:18.560
I think, given that gold already is about 10 times larger

03:10:18.560 --> 03:10:21.280
than Bitcoin, so it has a first mover advantage.

03:10:23.440 --> 03:10:25.640
If governments were to go and peg their currencies

03:10:25.640 --> 03:10:30.640
to gold again, the price of gold would shoot up 5, 10X

03:10:30.720 --> 03:10:33.480
and it would rise in value a lot more.

03:10:33.480 --> 03:10:36.120
Of course, that doesn't necessarily kill Bitcoin.

03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:37.800
No, again, I'm not saying it's likely to happen.

03:10:37.800 --> 03:10:41.400
I'm saying it's, I imagine less likely,

03:10:41.400 --> 03:10:44.280
less unlikely than all the other unlikely scenarios

03:10:44.280 --> 03:10:46.560
because even with a nuclear war,

03:10:46.560 --> 03:10:50.320
like 90% of the planet is destroyed,

03:10:50.320 --> 03:10:52.960
the 10% continue to run Bitcoin.

03:10:55.880 --> 03:10:57.160
That's a quote.

03:10:57.160 --> 03:10:59.400
Okay, there's a movement,

03:10:59.400 --> 03:11:03.520
a community of people referred to as Bitcoin maximalists.

03:11:03.520 --> 03:11:05.640
I've seen you referred, at least in the past,

03:11:05.640 --> 03:11:10.160
as the leader of the Bitcoin maximalists,

03:11:10.160 --> 03:11:12.320
probably because of your book,

03:11:12.320 --> 03:11:14.720
Bitcoin Standard, Consider the Bible in general.

03:11:14.720 --> 03:11:16.720
You're one of the leaders in this space.

03:11:18.200 --> 03:11:22.040
Do you regret any of the toxicity and derision

03:11:22.040 --> 03:11:25.160
that often or perhaps sometimes

03:11:25.160 --> 03:11:26.760
originates from this community?

03:11:28.120 --> 03:11:28.960
Definitely not.

03:11:28.960 --> 03:11:31.640
I'm not in the position to regret other people's actions,

03:11:31.640 --> 03:11:33.320
so let's just be clear.

03:11:33.320 --> 03:11:36.280
I think the rhetoric of community is,

03:11:37.400 --> 03:11:41.160
I reject this rhetoric because I think it's a way

03:11:41.160 --> 03:11:45.880
for kind of political manipulation and subversion

03:11:45.880 --> 03:11:49.640
to try and portray people as part of a community

03:11:49.640 --> 03:11:52.120
and hold people responsible for other people's actions,

03:11:52.120 --> 03:11:53.440
which I think is ridiculous.

03:11:53.440 --> 03:11:56.480
So if some guy on the internet said something mean

03:11:56.480 --> 03:11:59.440
to somebody and then, this is very common

03:11:59.440 --> 03:12:03.480
and I always try and not get involved in these things.

03:12:03.480 --> 03:12:05.520
So some guy who identifies as a Bitcoiner

03:12:05.520 --> 03:12:08.360
says something to somebody that's very wrong.

03:12:08.360 --> 03:12:09.520
Of course it happens.

03:12:10.640 --> 03:12:13.440
Tens of millions of people use Bitcoin around the world.

03:12:13.440 --> 03:12:16.680
And a lot of these, I'd say parasites,

03:12:16.680 --> 03:12:18.280
people who don't have anything productive

03:12:18.280 --> 03:12:21.600
to do with their life, outrage merchants,

03:12:21.600 --> 03:12:24.840
they'll come out and say something along the lines of,

03:12:24.840 --> 03:12:27.880
the Bitcoin maximalists are toxic,

03:12:27.880 --> 03:12:30.360
they're holding Bitcoin back and they need,

03:12:30.360 --> 03:12:31.440
and of course it's manipulative.

03:12:31.440 --> 03:12:34.440
The point behind it is they wanna get to you,

03:12:34.440 --> 03:12:36.280
they wanna get people who are,

03:12:36.280 --> 03:12:38.240
not that nobody with 300 followers

03:12:39.080 --> 03:12:40.360
who said something silly,

03:12:40.360 --> 03:12:42.800
they wanna get the notable people

03:12:42.800 --> 03:12:44.600
to basically change their message.

03:12:44.600 --> 03:12:47.680
So the idea is I'm supposed to apologize

03:12:47.680 --> 03:12:49.160
because somebody with 300 followers

03:12:49.160 --> 03:12:50.400
I've never met in my life

03:12:50.400 --> 03:12:53.400
who calls themselves a Bitcoiner said a mean word

03:12:53.400 --> 03:12:55.080
and then I need to apologize

03:12:55.080 --> 03:12:57.160
and I also need to cut down on my rhetoric

03:12:57.160 --> 03:13:00.480
about other digital currencies and I need to do that.

03:13:00.480 --> 03:13:03.600
So I am only responsible for my own actions

03:13:03.600 --> 03:13:07.040
and I don't recall regretting anything.

03:13:07.080 --> 03:13:08.600
Okay, but let me push back

03:13:08.600 --> 03:13:10.280
or push further into that direction.

03:13:10.280 --> 03:13:11.920
Fine, let's leave community aside,

03:13:11.920 --> 03:13:14.360
labels suck for sure.

03:13:14.360 --> 03:13:19.360
But you have a spicy way about you on Twitter.

03:13:19.720 --> 03:13:21.640
Even in this conversation,

03:13:21.640 --> 03:13:26.640
you had some good strong words to say about movement.

03:13:27.520 --> 03:13:29.520
Life is too short to mince words.

03:13:29.520 --> 03:13:32.760
One day I'm gonna be dead and on my deathbed

03:13:32.760 --> 03:13:35.200
I'm not gonna look back and say,

03:13:35.240 --> 03:13:38.040
I wish I was a little bit more circumspect

03:13:38.040 --> 03:13:39.200
in expressing my opinions.

03:13:39.200 --> 03:13:40.920
I'm far more likely to think, you know what,

03:13:40.920 --> 03:13:43.440
I wish I said what I really think.

03:13:44.400 --> 03:13:47.600
Yes, life is too short to hold back your opinion.

03:13:47.600 --> 03:13:50.520
The question is, what is really your opinion?

03:13:50.520 --> 03:13:55.360
Because you're many people in one.

03:13:55.360 --> 03:13:56.800
So there's a person that loves,

03:13:56.800 --> 03:13:58.360
there's kindness for the human beings,

03:13:58.360 --> 03:14:00.160
there's a person that gets annoyed,

03:14:00.160 --> 03:14:03.240
there's a person that enjoys disagreement,

03:14:03.240 --> 03:14:05.760
there's a person that enjoys collaboration.

03:14:05.760 --> 03:14:07.920
And you can emphasize all of those different things,

03:14:07.920 --> 03:14:09.440
each of those different things,

03:14:09.440 --> 03:14:12.280
weigh it differently in your online interaction.

03:14:12.280 --> 03:14:15.160
There are some aspects of online interaction

03:14:15.160 --> 03:14:18.120
that encourages in different communities.

03:14:18.120 --> 03:14:20.600
Online interaction is one community

03:14:20.600 --> 03:14:24.560
that encourages kind of derision and mockery and so on.

03:14:24.560 --> 03:14:26.840
So you can choose if you want to engage

03:14:26.840 --> 03:14:29.320
that part of yourself or some other part of yourself.

03:14:29.320 --> 03:14:31.880
Economics is another community

03:14:31.880 --> 03:14:36.560
that enjoys being very straightforward

03:14:36.560 --> 03:14:39.000
about their disagreements, pretty harsh.

03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:41.120
It's fun to watch because it feels like

03:14:41.120 --> 03:14:43.360
you arrive at the truth much faster

03:14:43.360 --> 03:14:45.000
because you tear each other apart.

03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:49.800
But that's a choice, that's a deliberate choice.

03:14:49.800 --> 03:14:53.760
And I don't want to label an entire community of people

03:14:53.760 --> 03:14:56.520
by its extremes, I don't think you should do that.

03:14:56.520 --> 03:14:59.200
But there's cultural characteristics you start to notice

03:15:00.040 --> 03:15:00.840
when you go to France, it's a certain way.

03:15:00.840 --> 03:15:04.480
When you go to Britain, London is different than rural Britain

03:15:04.480 --> 03:15:08.160
and New York is different than Iowa.

03:15:08.160 --> 03:15:09.240
You start to notice things.

03:15:09.240 --> 03:15:10.640
I mean, you don't want to generalize,

03:15:10.640 --> 03:15:12.080
there's all kinds of people everywhere,

03:15:12.080 --> 03:15:15.120
but there's a certain way of communication

03:15:15.120 --> 03:15:16.800
on crypto, Twitter in general,

03:15:16.800 --> 03:15:19.320
but also Bitcoin maximalists

03:15:19.320 --> 03:15:21.960
that I even early on received a bunch of heat.

03:15:21.960 --> 03:15:23.160
I was like, what the hell?

03:15:24.120 --> 03:15:27.080
So listen, there's definitely a difference

03:15:27.080 --> 03:15:29.000
when I go to the computer science community,

03:15:29.840 --> 03:15:31.360
the machine learning community,

03:15:31.360 --> 03:15:35.040
it's way friendlier than the cryptocurrency community.

03:15:35.040 --> 03:15:39.960
I have much more freedom to actually be what I enjoy being,

03:15:39.960 --> 03:15:42.720
which is asking simple dumb questions.

03:15:42.720 --> 03:15:44.920
Even when I've already spent years,

03:15:44.920 --> 03:15:46.320
sometimes decades with an idea,

03:15:46.320 --> 03:15:48.240
I like asking dumb questions anyway.

03:15:49.520 --> 03:15:52.040
Crypto folks punish you for this,

03:15:52.040 --> 03:15:56.440
for curiosity, for like exploration.

03:15:56.440 --> 03:15:57.800
I understand the mechanism

03:15:57.800 --> 03:16:00.920
because so many other people come into that community

03:16:00.920 --> 03:16:04.280
and they might masquerade as curious,

03:16:04.280 --> 03:16:06.480
but really they're trying to inject,

03:16:06.480 --> 03:16:08.120
they're trying to sell some kind of altcoin,

03:16:08.120 --> 03:16:10.960
there's some scheme, there's some scheme to make money.

03:16:10.960 --> 03:16:12.520
And so I understand,

03:16:12.520 --> 03:16:14.960
maybe that's just the dynamics of the community by nature.

03:16:14.960 --> 03:16:18.240
It's not like you respond appropriately

03:16:18.240 --> 03:16:22.280
to the amount of charlatans in the community.

03:16:22.280 --> 03:16:25.360
So if the fraction of charlatans is low,

03:16:25.360 --> 03:16:28.240
maybe you can afford to be more loving and kind and so on.

03:16:28.240 --> 03:16:30.880
When the fraction of charlatans is high,

03:16:30.880 --> 03:16:32.760
you have to be harsher.

03:16:32.760 --> 03:16:35.040
Perhaps, perhaps, but-

03:16:35.040 --> 03:16:37.440
I think also the stakes are extremely high

03:16:37.440 --> 03:16:38.280
in this situation.

03:16:38.280 --> 03:16:40.360
And I think if you don't like Bitcoiners,

03:16:40.360 --> 03:16:41.840
if you think Bitcoiners are toxic,

03:16:41.840 --> 03:16:43.400
wait until you meet fiaters.

03:16:43.400 --> 03:16:44.480
That's true.

03:16:44.480 --> 03:16:49.160
The fiat community has financed world wars and genocides

03:16:49.160 --> 03:16:53.960
and tyrants and the mass death and destruction.

03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:56.600
The fiat community, if you wanna use that term,

03:16:56.600 --> 03:16:57.840
I don't believe that you should,

03:16:57.840 --> 03:17:01.000
but I mean, fiat has destroyed the savings

03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:02.760
of pretty much anybody who's lived through

03:17:02.760 --> 03:17:03.920
the last 20th century.

03:17:03.920 --> 03:17:05.840
Pretty much anybody who's lived through the 20th century,

03:17:05.840 --> 03:17:07.080
no matter where you lived,

03:17:07.080 --> 03:17:09.960
Switzerland, US, Ethiopia, Russia,

03:17:09.960 --> 03:17:12.520
you've gone through fiat problems.

03:17:12.520 --> 03:17:15.560
You've had hyperinflation, you've had bank confiscation.

03:17:15.560 --> 03:17:17.360
There isn't a family in the world today

03:17:17.360 --> 03:17:21.360
that hasn't had its wealth destroyed over the last century.

03:17:21.360 --> 03:17:24.480
They all have a story about the inflation

03:17:24.480 --> 03:17:25.840
and the hyperinflation.

03:17:25.840 --> 03:17:27.720
And Bitcoin offers us a way out of this.

03:17:27.720 --> 03:17:31.040
And shitcoins, altcoins,

03:17:31.040 --> 03:17:36.040
are essentially fiat world's last gasp attempt

03:17:36.760 --> 03:17:39.280
to try and salvage fiat,

03:17:39.280 --> 03:17:41.440
to try and salvage the idea that some people

03:17:41.440 --> 03:17:43.560
will continue to be able to print money

03:17:43.560 --> 03:17:46.200
and other people will have to use that money.

03:17:46.200 --> 03:17:47.920
You know, this is Twitter.

03:17:47.920 --> 03:17:49.040
It's a free market.

03:17:49.040 --> 03:17:50.240
It's the internet.

03:17:50.240 --> 03:17:51.840
You don't have to follow anybody.

03:17:51.840 --> 03:17:52.680
That's the thing.

03:17:52.680 --> 03:17:56.920
So what I find really objectionable

03:17:56.920 --> 03:17:58.720
about the people who are so butt hurt

03:17:58.720 --> 03:18:01.280
always about Bitcoin maximalists is

03:18:01.280 --> 03:18:04.160
you don't have to click follow on people you don't like.

03:18:04.160 --> 03:18:06.720
There are 300 million Twitter accounts.

03:18:06.720 --> 03:18:09.440
And if you choose to follow the accounts

03:18:09.440 --> 03:18:11.240
that say things that annoy you

03:18:11.240 --> 03:18:12.680
and then complain about the fact

03:18:12.680 --> 03:18:15.360
that they say things that annoy you,

03:18:15.360 --> 03:18:16.520
I'm sorry, but you're an idiot

03:18:16.520 --> 03:18:18.320
that you don't know how to use Twitter.

03:18:18.320 --> 03:18:20.440
Just follow the accounts that you like.

03:18:20.440 --> 03:18:24.040
It's, you know, you don't have to be part of this.

03:18:24.040 --> 03:18:25.320
You don't have to listen to those people.

03:18:25.320 --> 03:18:26.160
You can choose.

03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:28.240
There are a lot of Bitcoiners that don't act like this.

03:18:28.240 --> 03:18:30.400
You can just unfollow the ones that you don't like in blogs.

03:18:30.400 --> 03:18:33.840
Since in the past year, man, time flies,

03:18:33.840 --> 03:18:36.360
I've met a lot of them and I enjoy them a lot.

03:18:36.360 --> 03:18:38.440
And you build that community of people that you enjoy.

03:18:38.440 --> 03:18:40.720
There are less that communicate in the way you enjoy.

03:18:40.720 --> 03:18:42.640
And it's become a meme at this point

03:18:42.640 --> 03:18:44.800
that I block with love, I think.

03:18:44.800 --> 03:18:45.640
Yes.

03:18:45.640 --> 03:18:47.120
Because I did not.

03:18:47.120 --> 03:18:48.640
I block very prolifically

03:18:48.640 --> 03:18:51.200
and I strongly recommend people continue to block.

03:18:51.200 --> 03:18:52.520
I think Twitter is, you know,

03:18:52.520 --> 03:18:53.800
you're not going to get to interact

03:18:53.800 --> 03:18:55.480
with 300 million accounts anyway.

03:18:55.480 --> 03:18:58.520
So you want to be constantly curating the experience

03:18:58.520 --> 03:19:00.480
by getting rid of people you don't like

03:19:00.480 --> 03:19:02.400
and following people that you like.

03:19:02.400 --> 03:19:03.920
And that's just how, you know,

03:19:03.920 --> 03:19:05.720
after 10 years of using Twitter, you know,

03:19:05.720 --> 03:19:08.720
you accumulate the block list, which is very big,

03:19:08.720 --> 03:19:09.880
which I'm very happy for,

03:19:09.880 --> 03:19:11.680
and I'm going to pass on to my children.

03:19:11.680 --> 03:19:13.000
That's right.

03:19:13.960 --> 03:19:17.560
On your deathbed, the grandchildren will gather around

03:19:17.560 --> 03:19:22.560
and your grandfather can finally share the full list.

03:19:22.560 --> 03:19:23.400
Yeah.

03:19:23.400 --> 03:19:25.280
So like, again, it's just a Twitter account.

03:19:25.280 --> 03:19:26.640
If it bothers you so much,

03:19:26.640 --> 03:19:29.880
ask yourself why it bothers you that some people are so...

03:19:29.880 --> 03:19:31.600
I'm not referring to you, obviously,

03:19:31.600 --> 03:19:34.240
but I mean, the people that are constantly aggravated

03:19:34.240 --> 03:19:36.520
about this, I don't get bothered by anything on Twitter.

03:19:36.520 --> 03:19:38.200
I just block immediately.

03:19:38.200 --> 03:19:40.920
And I get to curate the experience that I enjoy.

03:19:40.920 --> 03:19:42.760
And I recommend people do that.

03:19:43.240 --> 03:19:45.000
It's really a lot less pathetic

03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:46.960
than complaining about strangers

03:19:46.960 --> 03:19:49.840
saying things you don't like, which a lot of...

03:19:49.840 --> 03:19:52.040
And of course, the reason for it is, you know,

03:19:52.040 --> 03:19:55.000
I mean, when I say it's stupid, it's not really stupid.

03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:56.320
There's an ulterior motive there.

03:19:56.320 --> 03:19:57.960
And the ulterior motive is,

03:19:57.960 --> 03:19:59.400
hey, I have this shit coin

03:19:59.400 --> 03:20:01.640
that I made with five other friends of mine,

03:20:01.640 --> 03:20:05.280
and I'd like to ride your coattails, Bitcoiners,

03:20:05.280 --> 03:20:07.480
and I'd like you to please help me promote this shit coin.

03:20:07.480 --> 03:20:10.280
Like, I get this practically every week,

03:20:10.280 --> 03:20:12.520
whether through email or through Twitter,

03:20:13.040 --> 03:20:15.120
where, hey, you know, this is our shit coin.

03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:17.440
You know, it's just like Bitcoin,

03:20:17.440 --> 03:20:19.520
but it's better because it does this and this and that.

03:20:19.520 --> 03:20:21.440
And, you know, basically,

03:20:21.440 --> 03:20:24.600
how can we get you to promote this shit coin for us?

03:20:24.600 --> 03:20:27.360
And being straightforward and forthright

03:20:27.360 --> 03:20:29.800
is a great productivity hack,

03:20:29.800 --> 03:20:32.200
because, you know, you just tell those people,

03:20:32.200 --> 03:20:34.040
no, I'm not interested, it's a stupid shit coin,

03:20:34.040 --> 03:20:36.160
and I wish you quick and swift failure

03:20:36.160 --> 03:20:38.680
before you take a lot of people's money.

03:20:39.640 --> 03:20:41.760
And that's what I genuinely think.

03:20:41.800 --> 03:20:44.280
Well, but I'll just be upfront with the fact,

03:20:44.280 --> 03:20:45.680
at least for my taste,

03:20:45.680 --> 03:20:50.680
just labeling everything as a shit coin worries me.

03:20:50.920 --> 03:20:52.200
So that's just my own preference.

03:20:52.200 --> 03:20:53.440
It's not a judgment on you.

03:20:53.440 --> 03:20:54.880
It's just my own preference

03:20:54.880 --> 03:20:57.880
that I'm afraid I'll miss good ideas.

03:20:57.880 --> 03:20:59.480
I think when you're, me personally,

03:20:59.480 --> 03:21:01.640
when I'm too certain about things,

03:21:01.640 --> 03:21:03.880
when I'm too tribal about things,

03:21:03.880 --> 03:21:06.680
I'll miss actually really strong ideas,

03:21:06.680 --> 03:21:09.440
outlier ideas, totally new ideas.

03:21:09.440 --> 03:21:10.960
So that worries me.

03:21:10.960 --> 03:21:15.960
One of the downsides of the way Bitcoin is,

03:21:16.200 --> 03:21:18.600
how much is at stake financially,

03:21:18.600 --> 03:21:20.760
is that it's less open to good ideas.

03:21:20.760 --> 03:21:23.640
Actually, by design, that it's not changing,

03:21:23.640 --> 03:21:25.520
like with the hard forks and so on,

03:21:25.520 --> 03:21:28.120
that there's not a kind of curiosity

03:21:28.120 --> 03:21:29.960
about exploration of ideas.

03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:33.200
Of course, in some way,

03:21:33.200 --> 03:21:35.720
that curiosity can start getting injected

03:21:35.720 --> 03:21:37.560
when you start talking about other layers

03:21:37.560 --> 03:21:39.440
built on top of Bitcoin,

03:21:39.440 --> 03:21:40.920
when you start talking about applications

03:21:40.920 --> 03:21:43.360
or different things like the Lightning Network,

03:21:43.360 --> 03:21:45.480
that's where the curiosity can emerge.

03:21:45.480 --> 03:21:48.080
But still, that's why with cryptocurrency in general,

03:21:48.080 --> 03:21:49.440
I just tried to keep an open mind.

03:21:49.440 --> 03:21:53.520
And just the shit coin as a term is just a good statement

03:21:53.520 --> 03:21:54.920
that I'm gonna close my mind to.

03:21:54.920 --> 03:21:56.640
That's the way I hear it.

03:21:56.640 --> 03:21:59.360
And, but coming out of your mouth,

03:21:59.360 --> 03:22:01.080
because you say a lot of other IG stuff,

03:22:01.080 --> 03:22:02.960
it's just more you having fun.

03:22:02.960 --> 03:22:03.800
That's the way I hear it.

03:22:03.800 --> 03:22:05.200
But if I said something like that,

03:22:05.200 --> 03:22:06.760
that's, I feel like,

03:22:06.760 --> 03:22:08.440
I would feel like I'm closing my mind.

03:22:08.920 --> 03:22:10.560
Let me give you the counter argument to that.

03:22:10.560 --> 03:22:13.000
How much time do you spend emailing back

03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:15.440
all of these Nigerian Prince email scams

03:22:15.440 --> 03:22:16.720
that email you tell you,

03:22:16.720 --> 03:22:19.800
send me $5,000 and I'll send you $15 million?

03:22:19.800 --> 03:22:21.200
None. None.

03:22:21.200 --> 03:22:24.000
Why are you being close-minded to all of these great ideas?

03:22:24.000 --> 03:22:26.080
Well, no, but I'm also...

03:22:26.080 --> 03:22:28.400
Maybe one of them will actually send you $15 million.

03:22:28.400 --> 03:22:29.800
But I don't know if I know the difference

03:22:29.800 --> 03:22:32.000
between the Nigerian Prince

03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:34.120
and many other people I do talk to

03:22:34.120 --> 03:22:35.600
who are colleagues and so on,

03:22:35.600 --> 03:22:37.320
that are also emailing me.

03:22:37.360 --> 03:22:39.840
And they're also offering me things,

03:22:39.840 --> 03:22:42.360
but they don't sound as ridiculously spammy.

03:22:42.360 --> 03:22:44.120
Yeah, but I mean, the moment that somebody tells you,

03:22:44.120 --> 03:22:46.520
hey, I'm gonna give you $15 million for nothing,

03:22:46.520 --> 03:22:48.720
just if you send me $5,000,

03:22:48.720 --> 03:22:49.960
you're getting something for nothing.

03:22:49.960 --> 03:22:53.080
And essentially with all of the digital currencies,

03:22:53.080 --> 03:22:53.920
it's the same pitch.

03:22:53.920 --> 03:22:56.520
Say, hey, come use this thing

03:22:56.520 --> 03:22:58.240
that'll allow you to do things that...

03:22:58.240 --> 03:23:00.400
All of the things that they pretend that they can do

03:23:00.400 --> 03:23:01.880
that can be done with computers

03:23:01.880 --> 03:23:03.480
without having digital currencies.

03:23:03.480 --> 03:23:06.440
We already have AWS that does cloud computing,

03:23:06.440 --> 03:23:09.560
that does everything that shitcoins pretend to do.

03:23:09.560 --> 03:23:11.320
The only difference is AWS doesn't have

03:23:11.320 --> 03:23:13.400
its own monetary system tacked on top of it

03:23:13.400 --> 03:23:17.480
to allow Jeff Bezos to basically print his own money.

03:23:17.480 --> 03:23:19.520
But don't you think there's some gray area?

03:23:19.520 --> 03:23:22.160
So let me go for the historical record

03:23:22.160 --> 03:23:23.560
and let's see if you've changed

03:23:23.560 --> 03:23:27.680
as a philosopher, economist, human being.

03:23:27.680 --> 03:23:29.640
You tweeted three years ago.

03:23:29.640 --> 03:23:30.720
Oh, well.

03:23:30.720 --> 03:23:33.000
Anyone who believes proof of stake can work

03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:35.800
is either one completely clueless

03:23:35.840 --> 03:23:38.120
at how and why Bitcoin works at all,

03:23:38.120 --> 03:23:41.600
or two, a con artist using it as a buzzword

03:23:41.600 --> 03:23:44.720
to promote a worthless scam like Ethereum.

03:23:44.720 --> 03:23:49.720
Do you still believe that Ethereum is a scam

03:23:50.080 --> 03:23:51.680
and in general, proof of stake?

03:23:51.680 --> 03:23:55.280
You're either clueless if you think it's interesting.

03:23:55.280 --> 03:23:57.320
Yeah, no, I still stand by that.

03:23:57.320 --> 03:23:58.160
I think the...

03:23:58.160 --> 03:24:00.240
Would you classify Ethereum as a shitcoin?

03:24:00.240 --> 03:24:03.200
For sure, it's the mother asshole

03:24:03.200 --> 03:24:05.520
from which the shitcoins spring.

03:24:06.080 --> 03:24:07.280
The royal, the king shitcoin.

03:24:07.280 --> 03:24:08.120
Yeah.

03:24:08.120 --> 03:24:10.000
I think the key thing is,

03:24:10.000 --> 03:24:10.840
the way to think about it,

03:24:10.840 --> 03:24:12.440
there's another tweet from a couple of years ago,

03:24:12.440 --> 03:24:14.680
which is essentially proof of work

03:24:14.680 --> 03:24:16.400
was like the invention of flight.

03:24:16.400 --> 03:24:17.480
Like we've got in this machine

03:24:17.480 --> 03:24:20.000
and we managed to get it to fly off the ground.

03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:21.640
And proof of stake is,

03:24:21.640 --> 03:24:24.960
hey, we found a great way to make airplanes

03:24:24.960 --> 03:24:28.000
cheaper and faster by not making them fly.

03:24:30.120 --> 03:24:31.760
By keeping them on the ground.

03:24:31.760 --> 03:24:34.120
Like the invention of proof of work,

03:24:34.120 --> 03:24:38.120
the reason the entire digital currency space exists

03:24:38.120 --> 03:24:40.920
is because Bitcoin operates based on proof of work.

03:24:40.920 --> 03:24:43.080
If Bitcoin was based on proof of stake,

03:24:43.080 --> 03:24:45.720
it would have died or been shut down from day one.

03:24:45.720 --> 03:24:49.320
But that's a hypothesis and a lot of people believe that

03:24:49.320 --> 03:24:51.360
and I think they have a lot of strong support.

03:24:51.360 --> 03:24:56.000
But basically, proof of work is grounded in physics

03:24:56.000 --> 03:24:56.920
in the real world.

03:24:56.920 --> 03:24:59.000
The proof of stake is more about...

03:24:59.000 --> 03:24:59.840
It's politics.

03:24:59.840 --> 03:25:00.920
It's the Federal Reserve.

03:25:00.920 --> 03:25:02.320
It's exactly what we have.

03:25:02.320 --> 03:25:03.520
It's exactly what we have.

03:25:03.760 --> 03:25:06.920
It's just a group of people who get to decide the rules.

03:25:06.920 --> 03:25:09.800
And it's essentially a system that is,

03:25:09.800 --> 03:25:11.120
it's a security, it's a company.

03:25:11.120 --> 03:25:13.680
So it's not an innovation in any sense.

03:25:13.680 --> 03:25:16.000
It's a step backward to what we already had,

03:25:16.000 --> 03:25:18.640
which is you get a bunch of people in charge of the money.

03:25:18.640 --> 03:25:22.360
Now, the only reason it survives in this

03:25:22.360 --> 03:25:24.440
and the reason I call these things a scam

03:25:24.440 --> 03:25:25.880
and I have no problem with calling them a scam

03:25:25.880 --> 03:25:29.520
is because they fraudulently present themselves

03:25:29.520 --> 03:25:31.120
as being decentralized.

03:25:31.120 --> 03:25:33.240
They present themselves as just being a different way

03:25:33.240 --> 03:25:36.600
of doing decentralization than Bitcoin, when it's not.

03:25:36.600 --> 03:25:39.160
It's just they're riding Bitcoin's coattails

03:25:39.160 --> 03:25:40.400
and they're riding the fact

03:25:40.400 --> 03:25:42.400
that most people don't quite understand what Bitcoin is

03:25:42.400 --> 03:25:45.280
and how it works to portray themselves as a cheaper,

03:25:45.280 --> 03:25:48.400
better, more efficient way of doing what Bitcoin does.

03:25:48.400 --> 03:25:49.320
It's not.

03:25:49.320 --> 03:25:52.680
It's a less legally accountable way

03:25:52.680 --> 03:25:54.920
of doing what central banks do.

03:25:54.920 --> 03:25:56.920
Right, so and the basic criticism is that

03:25:56.920 --> 03:25:58.120
there's a group of people,

03:25:58.120 --> 03:25:59.720
sometimes a very small group of people,

03:25:59.720 --> 03:26:01.800
they can control the parameters

03:26:01.840 --> 03:26:03.400
of the operation of the system.

03:26:03.400 --> 03:26:06.880
So over time, you can't trust,

03:26:06.880 --> 03:26:09.160
it's not gold under the mattress.

03:26:09.160 --> 03:26:10.640
It doesn't have that kind of hardness.

03:26:10.640 --> 03:26:11.480
It's not property.

03:26:11.480 --> 03:26:14.040
And I really very strongly recommend your discussion

03:26:14.040 --> 03:26:16.520
with Sailor for people who want to elaborate more on this.

03:26:16.520 --> 03:26:17.840
There's a bunch of people in charge,

03:26:17.840 --> 03:26:20.200
which means that legally,

03:26:20.200 --> 03:26:23.080
they should be doing this under securities law.

03:26:23.080 --> 03:26:24.520
But even as an anarchist,

03:26:24.520 --> 03:26:26.360
if I don't want to care about that,

03:26:26.360 --> 03:26:28.680
the technical implication of it is

03:26:28.680 --> 03:26:30.240
this is never going to be adopted

03:26:30.240 --> 03:26:33.120
as a neutral way of transferring value on the internet

03:26:33.120 --> 03:26:35.480
because you need something

03:26:35.480 --> 03:26:37.480
that enemies can trade with one another.

03:26:37.480 --> 03:26:38.480
You can't have something

03:26:38.480 --> 03:26:40.400
that has a small group of people in charge

03:26:40.400 --> 03:26:43.040
because A, this small group of people themselves

03:26:43.040 --> 03:26:47.240
can be corrupted and B, they can be coerced.

03:26:47.240 --> 03:26:49.160
You can put a bunch of people in a room,

03:26:49.160 --> 03:26:50.160
put a gun to their head,

03:26:50.160 --> 03:26:52.600
and you can change everything

03:26:52.600 --> 03:26:54.000
in any of these digital currencies.

03:26:54.000 --> 03:26:58.280
And that's why I think you'll find a lot more sympathy

03:26:58.280 --> 03:27:01.520
among fiaters to shitcoins.

03:27:01.520 --> 03:27:05.600
The Keynesian economist to Ethereum fanboy pipeline

03:27:05.600 --> 03:27:09.920
is a very strong one because it's the same thing.

03:27:09.920 --> 03:27:11.440
It's like, I mean, you like the idea

03:27:11.440 --> 03:27:13.120
of people being in charge of money,

03:27:13.120 --> 03:27:14.440
and you think you're going to be the one

03:27:14.440 --> 03:27:15.600
who's going to be in charge of money.

03:27:15.600 --> 03:27:18.080
So you see a lot of this phenomena,

03:27:18.080 --> 03:27:20.520
and you see the same people that want gold

03:27:20.520 --> 03:27:23.680
and don't like central banking, they get into Bitcoin.

03:27:23.680 --> 03:27:27.520
Yeah, so just to actually push back on a couple of things.

03:27:27.520 --> 03:27:29.800
So one is fiat-er.

03:27:29.800 --> 03:27:32.800
It sounds like I'm trying to be a sophisticated Brit

03:27:32.800 --> 03:27:34.200
talking about theater.

03:27:34.200 --> 03:27:37.000
But for many reasons,

03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:38.800
it's not making me feel good about that.

03:27:38.800 --> 03:27:42.040
So day by day, things change.

03:27:42.040 --> 03:27:44.600
You used to be one of those.

03:27:44.600 --> 03:27:46.760
So people evolve, people learn.

03:27:46.760 --> 03:27:48.160
People that are supporters of Bitcoin

03:27:48.160 --> 03:27:51.920
might eventually become supporters of Ethereum

03:27:51.920 --> 03:27:53.600
or go back to supporting fiat.

03:27:53.600 --> 03:27:56.440
We don't know, people evolve for different reasons.

03:27:56.440 --> 03:28:00.520
You grow up, you mature, or you become enlightened.

03:28:00.520 --> 03:28:03.000
So I think every single person sort of,

03:28:03.840 --> 03:28:07.600
as this technology is evolving, as this world is evolving,

03:28:07.600 --> 03:28:10.280
as wars break out and geopolitics change,

03:28:10.280 --> 03:28:14.160
as the monetary system is constantly put under stress,

03:28:14.160 --> 03:28:15.080
people will evolve.

03:28:15.080 --> 03:28:17.400
So we're trying to all figure it out together.

03:28:17.400 --> 03:28:20.280
That's why I like open-mindedness here, I think,

03:28:20.280 --> 03:28:23.120
for people like me at least, seems essential.

03:28:23.120 --> 03:28:25.440
I know, so I expect you to be answering

03:28:25.440 --> 03:28:27.600
all of the spam emails you get.

03:28:27.600 --> 03:28:29.640
I will, prince by prince by prince.

03:28:29.640 --> 03:28:32.880
But no, I don't have a clear understanding

03:28:32.880 --> 03:28:34.200
what is a good investment in my time,

03:28:34.200 --> 03:28:36.360
what is a good investment in my money.

03:28:36.360 --> 03:28:37.920
That doesn't seem clear,

03:28:37.920 --> 03:28:42.120
because things are good at promoting themselves.

03:28:42.120 --> 03:28:45.280
I'm not talking about the different kinds of things

03:28:45.280 --> 03:28:47.360
like Ethereum, altcoins, and so on.

03:28:47.360 --> 03:28:52.360
I just mean life, like dating, jobs, friendships.

03:28:53.080 --> 03:28:56.880
Like everybody's advertising themselves

03:28:56.880 --> 03:28:59.320
as a great investment, right?

03:28:59.320 --> 03:29:02.040
But you don't know, and you have to keep an open mind.

03:29:02.040 --> 03:29:06.840
And also, I don't, and be sort of self-introspective

03:29:06.840 --> 03:29:11.840
about what, how biases I operate under

03:29:12.240 --> 03:29:16.000
and ways I delude myself, like hallucinations

03:29:16.000 --> 03:29:16.840
that I'm living under.

03:29:16.840 --> 03:29:19.880
It's like breaking out of all these hallucinations.

03:29:19.920 --> 03:29:22.920
It's very hard to introspect, thinking like,

03:29:22.920 --> 03:29:25.920
what are the assumptions under which I live my entire life

03:29:25.920 --> 03:29:27.960
that might be actually false assumptions?

03:29:27.960 --> 03:29:31.120
That's a really difficult thought process to take.

03:29:31.120 --> 03:29:32.520
It's a dangerous one.

03:29:32.520 --> 03:29:35.320
It's you, the Nietzsche, if you gaze long into the abyss,

03:29:35.320 --> 03:29:37.320
the abyss gazes into you.

03:29:37.320 --> 03:29:40.080
It's like Alex Jones talks about this.

03:29:40.080 --> 03:29:43.720
I mean, he's living, he's got demons in his head.

03:29:43.720 --> 03:29:45.840
So he has like all these conspiracy theories

03:29:45.840 --> 03:29:46.760
that it holds in his head,

03:29:46.760 --> 03:29:48.880
but it begins to really destroy him.

03:29:48.880 --> 03:29:51.160
So it's a psychological burden to carry.

03:29:51.160 --> 03:29:53.480
So if you question, if you question authority,

03:29:53.480 --> 03:29:55.960
if you question government, if you question culture,

03:29:55.960 --> 03:29:58.600
the way things have been done, it's really difficult.

03:29:59.920 --> 03:30:02.360
And the biases you operate under,

03:30:02.360 --> 03:30:03.760
it's really difficult to question them.

03:30:03.760 --> 03:30:07.680
So I think like being constantly open-minded

03:30:07.680 --> 03:30:10.120
and self-critical, not constantly,

03:30:10.120 --> 03:30:12.800
but a little bit every day is important, I think.

03:30:12.800 --> 03:30:15.200
Yeah, but I mean, you're talking to somebody,

03:30:15.200 --> 03:30:18.720
I grew up in Ramallah in Palestine in the West Bank.

03:30:19.720 --> 03:30:22.240
I've changed my mind on all kinds of different things.

03:30:22.240 --> 03:30:25.120
The fact that I was even open to the idea of Bitcoin

03:30:26.680 --> 03:30:29.120
has required an enormous amount of,

03:30:29.120 --> 03:30:30.120
it's a heck of a journey.

03:30:30.120 --> 03:30:34.720
So I'd much rather appreciate direct arguments

03:30:34.720 --> 03:30:37.880
rather than these kind of general fluffy,

03:30:37.880 --> 03:30:40.040
you should be, oh, of course, yes, you should be open-minded,

03:30:40.040 --> 03:30:42.560
but you know, also you come up with conclusions

03:30:42.560 --> 03:30:44.200
and you delete spam emails sometimes

03:30:44.200 --> 03:30:45.360
when you know that it is spam,

03:30:45.360 --> 03:30:47.400
because you have to move on with your life.

03:30:47.480 --> 03:30:48.440
There's an opportunity cost

03:30:48.440 --> 03:30:50.160
to considering every spam email.

03:30:50.160 --> 03:30:52.400
Well, to me, okay, so I'll just say

03:30:52.400 --> 03:30:57.040
from my relatively sort of shallow perspective,

03:30:57.040 --> 03:30:59.360
almost like a technical person, mostly.

03:30:59.360 --> 03:31:01.320
My understanding of economics is weak.

03:31:02.760 --> 03:31:05.120
Proof of stake is not obviously

03:31:07.920 --> 03:31:11.000
weak consensus mechanism relative to proof of work.

03:31:12.200 --> 03:31:14.880
So that's not obvious to me that that goes wrong

03:31:14.880 --> 03:31:16.480
and becomes corrupted in the way

03:31:16.480 --> 03:31:18.160
that governments get corrupted,

03:31:18.160 --> 03:31:21.680
because it still seems decentralized.

03:31:21.680 --> 03:31:24.800
Now, your criticism of governance is an interesting one,

03:31:24.800 --> 03:31:26.680
but if you put that aside,

03:31:26.680 --> 03:31:29.320
it still is a decentralized mechanism,

03:31:29.320 --> 03:31:32.680
and it's more transparent than the mechanism

03:31:32.680 --> 03:31:33.800
that governments operate on.

03:31:33.800 --> 03:31:35.800
It isn't, it's exactly what the Federal Reserve is.

03:31:35.800 --> 03:31:37.680
The Federal Reserve is a proof of stake system.

03:31:37.680 --> 03:31:40.720
The Federal Reserve is owned by its constituent banks.

03:31:40.720 --> 03:31:43.120
And so the rules of the Federal Reserve and the regulations

03:31:43.120 --> 03:31:45.560
are determined by the ownership, which is the banks.

03:31:46.000 --> 03:31:47.800
It's exactly what the Federal Reserve is.

03:31:47.800 --> 03:31:49.560
But it's too backdoor.

03:31:49.560 --> 03:31:53.760
The agreements between the banks and the Federal Reserve,

03:31:53.760 --> 03:31:55.080
it feels like a lot of those agreements

03:31:55.080 --> 03:31:58.760
are made between individuals that are behind the scenes.

03:31:58.760 --> 03:32:01.160
It's not hard to, it's opaque.

03:32:01.160 --> 03:32:03.560
Yes, but the only way that a proof of stake system

03:32:03.560 --> 03:32:05.560
will take off is if you have a military

03:32:05.560 --> 03:32:07.280
to force people to use it.

03:32:07.280 --> 03:32:08.120
That's the thing.

03:32:08.120 --> 03:32:10.360
Ultimately, there's no way that it's going to take off

03:32:10.360 --> 03:32:11.760
on a free market.

03:32:11.760 --> 03:32:14.040
And that's why for all of the bluster

03:32:14.040 --> 03:32:16.240
about wanting to move to a proof of stake system,

03:32:16.240 --> 03:32:19.040
Ethereum have been saying this since 2014.

03:32:19.040 --> 03:32:22.800
It's now been eight years that they've been talking about it.

03:32:22.800 --> 03:32:25.360
We still haven't seen the proof of stake system

03:32:25.360 --> 03:32:26.440
operational in the wild.

03:32:26.440 --> 03:32:28.320
It's vaporware for all practical intents.

03:32:28.320 --> 03:32:29.960
Oh, Cardano's proof of stake.

03:32:29.960 --> 03:32:31.560
It's potential.

03:32:31.560 --> 03:32:33.560
I mean, you can do it in a centralized way,

03:32:33.560 --> 03:32:36.720
but can it survive?

03:32:36.720 --> 03:32:38.800
Can it last for a long time?

03:32:38.800 --> 03:32:39.640
I don't think so.

03:32:39.640 --> 03:32:43.520
And I think it can last perhaps initially

03:32:43.520 --> 03:32:45.320
with marketing, with centralized marketing,

03:32:45.320 --> 03:32:50.320
you can promote it, but ultimately, user demand.

03:32:50.520 --> 03:32:53.160
The people that are not interested in speculating

03:32:53.160 --> 03:32:54.440
because they want to get rich on this,

03:32:54.440 --> 03:32:55.840
the people that are going to use it,

03:32:55.840 --> 03:32:58.280
they're going to want to use it because they can trust

03:32:58.280 --> 03:33:00.800
that it is not going to be messed with.

03:33:00.800 --> 03:33:03.560
Yes, but there's also applications on top,

03:33:03.560 --> 03:33:06.360
so let Lightning Network, but there's applications on top.

03:33:06.360 --> 03:33:09.720
Well, the reason I'm interested in things like Ethereum

03:33:09.720 --> 03:33:11.800
is you might think it's ridiculous.

03:33:11.800 --> 03:33:13.000
I thought it was ridiculous,

03:33:13.120 --> 03:33:18.120
but NFTs, so you can have NFTs probably on top of Bitcoin,

03:33:18.240 --> 03:33:20.520
but you don't because there's no marketing on Bitcoin

03:33:20.520 --> 03:33:23.000
because all of these ideas get promoted

03:33:23.000 --> 03:33:24.720
on proprietary shitcoins because...

03:33:24.720 --> 03:33:27.760
Yes, but there's the network effects of ideas,

03:33:27.760 --> 03:33:30.520
of applications, so they just take off for some reason.

03:33:30.520 --> 03:33:33.440
The human civilization is such that you get excited

03:33:33.440 --> 03:33:35.640
about stuff and large amounts of people believe a thing

03:33:35.640 --> 03:33:38.760
and they start to get excited and it actually has impact.

03:33:38.760 --> 03:33:41.600
The fact that NFTs can have an impact on the art world

03:33:41.600 --> 03:33:46.600
or the world in general is wild to me, but it worked.

03:33:46.640 --> 03:33:47.880
So the question is...

03:33:47.880 --> 03:33:50.360
David Rothkall has an impact on the art world.

03:33:50.360 --> 03:33:52.040
He doesn't say much.

03:33:52.040 --> 03:33:54.120
Well, I'm saying these ideas have,

03:33:54.120 --> 03:33:56.280
we're collective intelligent beings

03:33:56.280 --> 03:33:59.880
and we can believe a thing and that has power,

03:33:59.880 --> 03:34:02.840
that has led to major wars and all those kinds of things.

03:34:02.840 --> 03:34:07.360
So it's interesting to me that NFTs took hold

03:34:07.360 --> 03:34:09.880
and the question is, is there distributed DApps,

03:34:09.920 --> 03:34:11.920
is there distributed apps built on top of different

03:34:11.920 --> 03:34:15.000
blockchains that might somehow transform the world?

03:34:15.000 --> 03:34:17.800
You have to kind of keep an open mind to that

03:34:17.800 --> 03:34:20.880
because right now it's like I'm the same place

03:34:20.880 --> 03:34:23.360
with that as I am with like virtual reality.

03:34:23.360 --> 03:34:26.600
It's like, all right, this seems like a really

03:34:26.600 --> 03:34:29.920
intellectually promising set of ideas here,

03:34:29.920 --> 03:34:31.640
but there's something either technically

03:34:31.640 --> 03:34:33.960
or socially not quite taking hold.

03:34:33.960 --> 03:34:35.560
Why?

03:34:35.560 --> 03:34:37.480
And I don't know what the right answer is.

03:34:37.480 --> 03:34:39.840
So with virtual reality, what's the right answer?

03:34:40.800 --> 03:34:43.960
Is it just technically the latency is too high

03:34:43.960 --> 03:34:46.600
or the games are not good enough

03:34:46.600 --> 03:34:48.560
or is it a fundamentally flawed idea

03:34:48.560 --> 03:34:51.240
that you can live in a virtual world and enjoy it,

03:34:51.240 --> 03:34:54.320
that the physical world is just orders of magnitude better

03:34:54.320 --> 03:34:57.720
or a two dimensional display is just as good

03:34:57.720 --> 03:34:59.160
as a three dimensional world?

03:34:59.160 --> 03:35:01.240
I don't know, why is virtual reality not taking off?

03:35:01.240 --> 03:35:03.280
It's been since the 80s, right?

03:35:03.280 --> 03:35:05.120
I don't have strong opinions on it,

03:35:05.120 --> 03:35:07.720
on the prospects of the technology.

03:35:07.720 --> 03:35:10.640
Personally, I don't wanna ever imagine myself

03:35:10.640 --> 03:35:12.240
having something on my eyes.

03:35:12.240 --> 03:35:15.240
I'd rather just go out into the real world.

03:35:15.240 --> 03:35:17.800
But I don't have strong opinions on virtual reality.

03:35:17.800 --> 03:35:20.040
I do have on dApps and NFTs.

03:35:20.040 --> 03:35:22.680
Yeah, what's your criticism of sort of dApps and NFTs?

03:35:22.680 --> 03:35:23.760
Is this a distraction?

03:35:23.760 --> 03:35:27.800
It's a way to sell a flawed technology?

03:35:27.800 --> 03:35:29.640
The problem with dApps is, I mean,

03:35:29.640 --> 03:35:31.880
it's just the economics of it makes no sense

03:35:31.880 --> 03:35:34.280
in the sense that currently,

03:35:34.640 --> 03:35:37.840
if you wanted to run an application,

03:35:37.840 --> 03:35:39.960
whatever the application is,

03:35:39.960 --> 03:35:41.680
you wanna run it on AWS,

03:35:41.680 --> 03:35:43.040
you pay a specific amount of money,

03:35:43.040 --> 03:35:44.800
you wanna run it on your own laptop,

03:35:44.800 --> 03:35:48.280
you pay a specific amount of money per kilobyte of data.

03:35:48.280 --> 03:35:50.920
If you wanted to run the same thing on a distributed ledger

03:35:50.920 --> 03:35:52.240
where you're distributing the data

03:35:52.240 --> 03:35:54.720
over thousands of computers worldwide,

03:35:54.720 --> 03:35:56.520
it's infinitely more expensive.

03:35:56.520 --> 03:36:00.560
And that's why we haven't seen any of these dApps take off.

03:36:00.560 --> 03:36:03.280
And that's why I've said this many years ago.

03:36:03.280 --> 03:36:06.360
The only working application of blockchain technology

03:36:06.360 --> 03:36:08.280
is Bitcoin, because with Bitcoin,

03:36:09.240 --> 03:36:11.320
with a few hundred bytes of data,

03:36:11.320 --> 03:36:12.400
with a few bytes of data,

03:36:12.400 --> 03:36:17.400
you could move a billion dollars worth of economic value

03:36:17.720 --> 03:36:21.320
from here to China and move it safely and reliably.

03:36:21.320 --> 03:36:24.160
So that power,

03:36:24.160 --> 03:36:27.840
I can't see it being justified for anything

03:36:27.840 --> 03:36:29.360
that is not as mission critical

03:36:29.360 --> 03:36:32.280
as moving large amounts of value,

03:36:32.280 --> 03:36:34.960
which require very little amount of information.

03:36:34.960 --> 03:36:36.480
So when you look at all of the buzzwords

03:36:36.480 --> 03:36:40.400
that Ethereum and other altcoin marketing people

03:36:40.400 --> 03:36:43.160
like to use, and you know,

03:36:43.160 --> 03:36:45.200
if you wanna wonder really why we come

03:36:45.200 --> 03:36:46.840
to this kind of aggression,

03:36:46.840 --> 03:36:48.120
it's because we've heard all of this.

03:36:48.120 --> 03:36:50.160
You know, I've had all of these hucksters come to me

03:36:50.160 --> 03:36:51.920
for years, you know, it's been,

03:36:51.920 --> 03:36:55.200
I've had people in 2016 talk to me

03:36:55.200 --> 03:36:59.360
about how Ethereum blockchain technology

03:36:59.360 --> 03:37:02.120
is gonna revolutionize real estate deeds

03:37:03.080 --> 03:37:03.920
in India.

03:37:03.920 --> 03:37:07.760
I remember this guy, I'm not gonna mention his name,

03:37:07.760 --> 03:37:09.600
but this guy was, you know, 2016,

03:37:09.600 --> 03:37:11.320
and he sold a lot of shitcoins

03:37:11.320 --> 03:37:13.440
and got made a lot of money off of shitcoins

03:37:13.440 --> 03:37:15.840
based on all these silly ideas.

03:37:15.840 --> 03:37:19.040
We can have blackjack on a distributed ledger.

03:37:19.040 --> 03:37:20.400
We're gonna have Indian real estate

03:37:20.400 --> 03:37:22.200
on a distributed ledger.

03:37:22.200 --> 03:37:25.080
And it's just, it's concerned trolling marketing.

03:37:25.080 --> 03:37:28.120
You know, oh, there's a problem with real estate in India,

03:37:28.120 --> 03:37:29.400
real estate deeds.

03:37:29.400 --> 03:37:32.120
Blockchain fixes this by my shitcoin.

03:37:32.120 --> 03:37:33.920
And then people buy the shitcoin,

03:37:33.920 --> 03:37:35.760
Indian real estate isn't fixed,

03:37:35.760 --> 03:37:38.520
and the guy gets rich and they move on.

03:37:38.520 --> 03:37:42.520
But I mean, I'm still waiting for a DAP to actually emerge.

03:37:42.520 --> 03:37:44.880
Like, you know, it's,

03:37:44.880 --> 03:37:46.800
the promise that we keep hearing

03:37:46.800 --> 03:37:51.040
is something completely world-changing, world-transforming.

03:37:51.040 --> 03:37:53.240
And the reality is not one app.

03:37:53.240 --> 03:37:56.160
Like there's one of my good friends, Jimmy Song,

03:37:56.160 --> 03:37:57.800
eventually they refused to go ahead with the bet.

03:37:57.800 --> 03:38:00.560
He wanted to bet with one of the Ethereum people

03:38:00.560 --> 03:38:02.880
about these DAPs.

03:38:02.880 --> 03:38:04.360
You know, the Ethereum people are constantly saying

03:38:04.360 --> 03:38:05.400
those DAPs are gonna grow

03:38:05.400 --> 03:38:07.520
and they're gonna have so many applications

03:38:07.520 --> 03:38:09.160
and they're gonna have so many ideas.

03:38:09.160 --> 03:38:11.760
And the reality is all the apps that work

03:38:11.760 --> 03:38:13.080
are centralized apps, you know.

03:38:13.080 --> 03:38:16.600
So there is no Uber on the blockchain.

03:38:16.600 --> 03:38:20.440
There is no Twitter on the blockchain.

03:38:20.440 --> 03:38:21.680
There is no social media on the blockchain

03:38:21.680 --> 03:38:23.240
because these are businesses

03:38:23.240 --> 03:38:25.600
and businesses require a centralized authority

03:38:25.600 --> 03:38:26.840
to make decisions.

03:38:26.840 --> 03:38:28.800
You can't have it be decentralized.

03:38:28.800 --> 03:38:30.680
Yeah, listen, you're frustrated

03:38:30.680 --> 03:38:33.000
and I could see it over a few years

03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:38.000
of just having dealt with a humongous influx of charlatans.

03:38:38.000 --> 03:38:39.800
I wouldn't say frustrated, I'm amused.

03:38:39.800 --> 03:38:43.480
And it's no, it's water off my back.

03:38:43.480 --> 03:38:45.080
No, but a man that uses,

03:38:45.080 --> 03:38:47.920
and a community that uses the word shitcoin

03:38:47.920 --> 03:38:50.800
is a little bit, you have, you call it amusement.

03:38:50.800 --> 03:38:52.560
And I think amusement is the way

03:38:53.520 --> 03:38:55.880
to deal with the frustration.

03:38:55.880 --> 03:38:57.720
It's a channeling of frustration.

03:38:57.720 --> 03:39:01.720
Like, sometimes when you have to deal with bullshit,

03:39:01.720 --> 03:39:04.240
the best way is just to laugh at the absurdity of it all.

03:39:04.240 --> 03:39:07.200
And that's what you mean by amusement.

03:39:07.200 --> 03:39:09.040
But the fact is like,

03:39:10.360 --> 03:39:12.680
there's things like artificial intelligence

03:39:12.680 --> 03:39:15.360
for, what is it?

03:39:15.360 --> 03:39:18.440
How many decades, six, seven decades

03:39:18.440 --> 03:39:23.440
has been off and on promising to change everything.

03:39:23.560 --> 03:39:28.120
And it has failed time and time again

03:39:28.120 --> 03:39:30.360
to deliver to the promise.

03:39:30.360 --> 03:39:32.600
But that doesn't mean there's something fundamental

03:39:32.600 --> 03:39:34.720
and really powerful about both the small

03:39:34.720 --> 03:39:38.480
and the big things going on within the actual research

03:39:38.480 --> 03:39:40.400
and development within those communities.

03:39:40.400 --> 03:39:42.000
There's a lot of exciting developments

03:39:42.000 --> 03:39:44.360
and the scale at which those developments

03:39:44.360 --> 03:39:46.760
might actually have a transformative impact,

03:39:46.760 --> 03:39:49.000
the time scale, is unclear.

03:39:49.000 --> 03:39:51.800
It seems like we're certainly over-promised.

03:39:51.840 --> 03:39:54.440
We dream too big and too aggressively

03:39:54.440 --> 03:39:55.960
in the AI community, but in a lot of communities.

03:39:55.960 --> 03:39:58.520
Yeah, and I'm happy to give people the benefit of the doubt

03:39:58.520 --> 03:39:59.920
when they're over-promising,

03:39:59.920 --> 03:40:01.760
but not when they're making their own money.

03:40:01.760 --> 03:40:03.720
When you start making your own currency,

03:40:03.720 --> 03:40:05.760
then you don't get the benefit of the doubt.

03:40:05.760 --> 03:40:08.480
Because if your idea needs you to have a new currency

03:40:08.480 --> 03:40:10.640
that you print when Bitcoin is out there,

03:40:10.640 --> 03:40:12.640
then I'm gonna go ahead and assume

03:40:12.640 --> 03:40:13.480
that you're doing this for the money printing.

03:40:13.480 --> 03:40:14.440
It's a good time to mention

03:40:14.440 --> 03:40:19.160
that I am actually launching my new coin called Lexcoin.

03:40:19.160 --> 03:40:20.520
You mean shitcoin, yes.

03:40:21.200 --> 03:40:24.120
Oh, God, I'm gonna have to block you with love.

03:40:26.120 --> 03:40:30.240
Okay, one thing I wanted to ask you about is the Feds,

03:40:31.600 --> 03:40:34.160
this paper they released in January 20th

03:40:35.320 --> 03:40:39.200
on the potential central bank digital currency, CBDC.

03:40:39.200 --> 03:40:40.360
What are your thoughts about that?

03:40:40.360 --> 03:40:43.600
Is it just another, like is there pros and cons to this?

03:40:43.600 --> 03:40:45.200
Is it all interesting to you

03:40:45.200 --> 03:40:47.200
that they're even considering this kind of thing?

03:40:47.200 --> 03:40:51.800
I used to think that it's just basically waffle.

03:40:51.800 --> 03:40:55.160
It's meaningless because as it exists,

03:40:55.160 --> 03:40:57.560
the dollar is a central bank digital currency.

03:40:57.560 --> 03:40:59.600
The vast majority of dollars are digital.

03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:03.280
But I think the way that over the last couple of years

03:41:03.280 --> 03:41:04.280
I've changed my mind on this,

03:41:04.280 --> 03:41:08.360
I think there's some serious substance behind these ideas.

03:41:08.360 --> 03:41:10.800
And what they mean effectively

03:41:10.800 --> 03:41:14.080
is the disintermediation of the banking system

03:41:14.080 --> 03:41:17.080
and giving everybody an account at the Federal Reserve.

03:41:18.080 --> 03:41:21.240
This is kind of the really dangerous idea.

03:41:21.240 --> 03:41:22.880
And I think this is enormously significant.

03:41:22.880 --> 03:41:25.840
Effectively, as somebody who's lived in the Soviet Union,

03:41:25.840 --> 03:41:27.920
what this is is the return of the GOS bank

03:41:27.920 --> 03:41:30.720
on a global scale with modern technology.

03:41:30.720 --> 03:41:31.800
So under the Soviet Union,

03:41:31.800 --> 03:41:34.800
there was something called the GOS bank or the People's Bank.

03:41:34.800 --> 03:41:36.320
And that was the only bank in the country.

03:41:36.320 --> 03:41:39.480
And you had an account with the national bank.

03:41:39.480 --> 03:41:42.800
And if you said something wrong,

03:41:42.800 --> 03:41:45.920
your money got terminated from the GOS bank.

03:41:45.960 --> 03:41:47.520
Now, imagine that combined

03:41:47.520 --> 03:41:50.600
with the power of digital technology.

03:41:50.600 --> 03:41:52.440
And you can see that this could be

03:41:52.440 --> 03:41:56.160
an enormously powerful technology really,

03:41:56.160 --> 03:41:58.880
because if banks are out of the picture,

03:41:58.880 --> 03:42:03.240
then we changed the fundamental reality of fiat

03:42:03.240 --> 03:42:05.920
as being the creation of money through lending.

03:42:05.920 --> 03:42:08.880
And then it becomes the creation of money truly by fiat,

03:42:08.880 --> 03:42:10.120
by government fiat.

03:42:10.120 --> 03:42:13.240
So we moved to a system in which money is just basically,

03:42:14.120 --> 03:42:16.600
it's like we have money that is pieces of paper.

03:42:16.600 --> 03:42:18.120
And every time we've had money,

03:42:18.120 --> 03:42:20.480
we've had fiat money that was just pieces of paper,

03:42:20.480 --> 03:42:21.960
it collapsed very quickly.

03:42:22.880 --> 03:42:25.200
With the current system, money is credit,

03:42:25.200 --> 03:42:28.280
and the creation of credit is restricted to some point.

03:42:28.280 --> 03:42:30.200
And the creation of credit is self-correcting.

03:42:30.200 --> 03:42:32.080
I discussed this in the fiat standard.

03:42:32.080 --> 03:42:35.200
If the central bank allows banks to create too much credit,

03:42:35.200 --> 03:42:36.040
that creates a bubble,

03:42:36.040 --> 03:42:38.360
and then there's a collapse in the money supply,

03:42:38.360 --> 03:42:40.360
which prevents hyperinflation from happening,

03:42:40.360 --> 03:42:44.240
because the money creation is self-destructive,

03:42:44.240 --> 03:42:45.880
it's self-correcting.

03:42:45.880 --> 03:42:49.920
So you end up with an average of like 7% per year increase,

03:42:49.920 --> 03:42:52.920
because you have 10% for five years,

03:42:52.920 --> 03:42:55.920
and then you get negative 20% for one year,

03:42:55.920 --> 03:42:57.840
and it's correcting.

03:42:57.840 --> 03:43:00.080
But now if you get rid of the credit creation mechanism,

03:43:00.080 --> 03:43:02.320
and it's just assigning money directly,

03:43:02.320 --> 03:43:04.920
we're likely gonna get much faster inflation.

03:43:04.920 --> 03:43:08.240
And I think that's obviously a huge problem,

03:43:08.240 --> 03:43:10.320
and perhaps an even bigger problem

03:43:10.320 --> 03:43:14.200
is the enormous amount of power that it gives to governments.

03:43:14.200 --> 03:43:18.080
It allows them to create an awful dystopia,

03:43:18.080 --> 03:43:22.560
where you've got your money on your phone,

03:43:22.560 --> 03:43:27.200
and anything you do is completely supervised

03:43:27.200 --> 03:43:28.760
and controlled through your spending.

03:43:28.760 --> 03:43:31.920
So they wanna introduce a new lockdown,

03:43:31.920 --> 03:43:34.120
then they'll just make your money not work.

03:43:34.120 --> 03:43:37.000
Your money's broken today, you can't spend money,

03:43:37.000 --> 03:43:39.480
or you can only spend money in your local supermarket

03:43:39.480 --> 03:43:40.400
for the next three months,

03:43:40.400 --> 03:43:42.600
because you can't leave your neighborhood,

03:43:42.600 --> 03:43:45.200
your money stops working outside of your neighborhood.

03:43:45.200 --> 03:43:48.080
This Chinese social credit score system

03:43:48.080 --> 03:43:50.080
is an example of this.

03:43:50.080 --> 03:43:53.720
And I think, I don't know, I don't have a crystal ball,

03:43:53.720 --> 03:43:55.200
so I don't know what the likelihood is

03:43:55.200 --> 03:43:58.200
of implementing something like this in the US.

03:43:58.200 --> 03:43:59.960
I've discussed it with Michael Saylor,

03:43:59.960 --> 03:44:02.040
he thinks it's highly unlikely,

03:44:02.040 --> 03:44:05.320
he thinks the people who've been pushing this

03:44:05.320 --> 03:44:07.200
are very far from the position of power,

03:44:07.200 --> 03:44:10.720
and the traditional monetary and financial system

03:44:10.720 --> 03:44:13.640
is going to survive intact.

03:44:13.640 --> 03:44:16.920
I certainly hope so, I think this would be a terrible thing

03:44:16.920 --> 03:44:18.560
if it comes to pass, but I don't think,

03:44:18.560 --> 03:44:20.240
many people think that it is something

03:44:20.240 --> 03:44:21.440
that would undermine Bitcoin,

03:44:21.440 --> 03:44:24.600
like a lot of common objection to Bitcoin is,

03:44:24.600 --> 03:44:26.200
well, governments are just gonna launch

03:44:26.200 --> 03:44:28.960
their own digital currencies, and then Bitcoin is gonna die.

03:44:28.960 --> 03:44:31.080
And I think this is completely missing the point,

03:44:31.080 --> 03:44:33.560
people think Bitcoin is important because it's digital,

03:44:33.600 --> 03:44:36.960
it's not, national currencies can be digital.

03:44:36.960 --> 03:44:39.600
Bitcoin is important because it's not inflationary,

03:44:39.600 --> 03:44:41.440
and because nobody controls it.

03:44:41.440 --> 03:44:42.800
Central bank digital currencies

03:44:42.800 --> 03:44:44.920
are likely to be very inflationary,

03:44:44.920 --> 03:44:47.880
and they're likely to have very strong control at the top.

03:44:47.880 --> 03:44:50.560
So if anything, they are an advertisement for Bitcoin

03:44:50.560 --> 03:44:52.800
rather than a replacement for it.

03:44:52.800 --> 03:44:54.080
If it's Bitcoin, if it's gold,

03:44:54.080 --> 03:44:57.000
it's a way for multiple nations to partake.

03:44:57.000 --> 03:44:59.640
So if you were to imagine a future

03:44:59.640 --> 03:45:03.800
where we move from the fiat standard

03:45:03.800 --> 03:45:06.840
back to the gold standard, and then to the Bitcoin standard,

03:45:06.840 --> 03:45:10.400
or skipping that going directly to the Bitcoin standard,

03:45:10.400 --> 03:45:12.240
what would it take?

03:45:12.240 --> 03:45:14.840
Is it gradual, is it immediate?

03:45:14.840 --> 03:45:17.560
What are possible trajectories that take us,

03:45:17.560 --> 03:45:19.240
well, basically where the final sort of

03:45:19.240 --> 03:45:22.240
empirical observation is that you overtake,

03:45:22.240 --> 03:45:26.680
Bitcoin overtakes first gold and then bonds

03:45:26.680 --> 03:45:31.680
in terms of its monetary power in the world.

03:45:31.840 --> 03:45:34.840
But like just specifically from a government perspective,

03:45:34.840 --> 03:45:37.960
how do we move the United States, China, Russia, India,

03:45:39.080 --> 03:45:43.400
European Union to Bitcoin standard?

03:45:43.400 --> 03:45:45.080
I'm not entirely concerned about

03:45:45.080 --> 03:45:46.280
whether governments move or not.

03:45:46.280 --> 03:45:49.920
In fact, I'd be very happy for them not to move

03:45:49.920 --> 03:45:53.400
as long as possible so that individuals can accumulate

03:45:53.400 --> 03:45:56.440
more and more Bitcoin while it's still cheap.

03:45:56.440 --> 03:46:01.360
So the people will move and the governments will catch up.

03:46:01.360 --> 03:46:04.000
Yeah, and I think this is kind of what I allude to.

03:46:04.000 --> 03:46:05.720
I mean, the point of the fiat standard,

03:46:05.720 --> 03:46:07.880
the fiat standard is really a Bitcoin book,

03:46:07.880 --> 03:46:10.080
and it talks about fiat most of the time,

03:46:10.080 --> 03:46:13.960
but it does so to analyze Bitcoin and the rise of Bitcoin.

03:46:13.960 --> 03:46:15.680
In the final chapter, I discuss

03:46:15.680 --> 03:46:18.040
how I think this relationship plays out.

03:46:22.040 --> 03:46:23.760
The way that I tend to think of it is that

03:46:23.760 --> 03:46:25.240
most likely what's going to happen is

03:46:25.240 --> 03:46:28.720
we're going to have the kind of financial apartheid

03:46:28.720 --> 03:46:31.080
where there's going to be two monetary systems.

03:46:31.080 --> 03:46:33.640
One is government controlled,

03:46:33.640 --> 03:46:35.520
and it comes with increasing amounts

03:46:35.520 --> 03:46:37.720
of surveillance and inflation.

03:46:37.720 --> 03:46:41.360
And then if you want, you can just opt out of that

03:46:41.360 --> 03:46:45.040
and get into Bitcoin, and it's likely going to be difficult

03:46:45.040 --> 03:46:48.360
for governments to stop people from getting into Bitcoin

03:46:48.360 --> 03:46:49.840
for all of the technical reasons

03:46:49.840 --> 03:46:52.280
that make it very hard to stop Bitcoin.

03:46:52.280 --> 03:46:54.120
So then we have this alternative that is Bitcoin,

03:46:54.120 --> 03:46:56.040
which is not inflationary

03:46:56.040 --> 03:47:00.840
and does not have a central authority that can censor it.

03:47:00.840 --> 03:47:04.800
I think gradually is my hope,

03:47:04.800 --> 03:47:07.320
and I also think my most likely scenario,

03:47:07.320 --> 03:47:10.920
but maybe I am biased because everybody thinks

03:47:10.920 --> 03:47:13.000
what they want is what's going to happen.

03:47:13.000 --> 03:47:16.280
I think we're just going to witness the same relationship

03:47:16.280 --> 03:47:18.760
because governments make their currency

03:47:18.760 --> 03:47:20.680
so that they can devalue them,

03:47:20.680 --> 03:47:22.560
and Bitcoin thrives on that.

03:47:22.560 --> 03:47:24.080
And more and more people are going to learn

03:47:24.080 --> 03:47:26.120
and more and more people are going to find out.

03:47:26.120 --> 03:47:29.880
And whether it's through curiosity or self-interest

03:47:29.880 --> 03:47:32.400
or through the destruction of the national currency,

03:47:32.400 --> 03:47:34.840
all roads lead to Bitcoin.

03:47:34.840 --> 03:47:36.520
So more and more people are going to buy Bitcoin.

03:47:36.520 --> 03:47:38.040
The price of Bitcoin is going to go up.

03:47:38.040 --> 03:47:41.160
And as it goes up, Bitcoin becomes a more significant part

03:47:41.160 --> 03:47:42.080
of the world economy.

03:47:42.080 --> 03:47:45.400
And this is something that skeptics don't get.

03:47:45.400 --> 03:47:48.840
Like a lot of the academic skeptics to Bitcoin,

03:47:48.840 --> 03:47:50.880
they offer up all of these theories

03:47:50.880 --> 03:47:53.600
about why they think Bitcoin can't work,

03:47:53.600 --> 03:47:56.160
and then they present it and they think,

03:47:56.160 --> 03:47:58.080
they've delivered the knockout blow

03:47:58.080 --> 03:47:59.680
as if Bitcoin needs their permission

03:47:59.680 --> 03:48:01.200
or the world is going to need their permission.

03:48:01.200 --> 03:48:02.920
Well, the reality is people are going to join Bitcoin

03:48:02.920 --> 03:48:05.040
out of greed, out of self-interest.

03:48:05.040 --> 03:48:07.800
Number go up technology is really

03:48:07.800 --> 03:48:10.000
what's going to get everybody in.

03:48:10.000 --> 03:48:14.560
And that's really the Trojan horse for fixing the world.

03:48:14.560 --> 03:48:16.920
Come for the greed and stay for the revolution.

03:48:16.920 --> 03:48:18.680
It's going to keep going up

03:48:18.680 --> 03:48:21.240
because people don't like to be poor,

03:48:21.240 --> 03:48:23.600
except for most economists and academics.

03:48:24.600 --> 03:48:25.760
People don't like to be poor.

03:48:25.760 --> 03:48:28.440
People don't enjoy getting their wealth destroyed.

03:48:28.440 --> 03:48:30.440
And they care more about their self-interest

03:48:30.440 --> 03:48:32.560
than they care about economic theories

03:48:32.560 --> 03:48:34.600
about whether this works as money or not.

03:48:34.600 --> 03:48:37.320
They see their cousin escaped hyperinflation

03:48:37.320 --> 03:48:38.520
and managed to get a bigger house

03:48:38.520 --> 03:48:40.360
because they bought Bitcoin five years ago.

03:48:40.360 --> 03:48:43.760
They realized maybe I should stop mocking my cousin

03:48:43.760 --> 03:48:45.120
and start buying more Bitcoin.

03:48:45.120 --> 03:48:47.560
And this is, I think, an indomitable force

03:48:47.560 --> 03:48:49.280
that's going to continue.

03:48:49.280 --> 03:48:53.960
And one thing, most Bitcoiners tend to lean

03:48:53.960 --> 03:48:57.240
toward an apocalyptic transition.

03:48:57.240 --> 03:48:58.080
Fiat's going to collapse.

03:48:58.080 --> 03:48:59.040
We're going to get hyperinflation.

03:48:59.040 --> 03:49:00.320
Everything is going to be terrible.

03:49:00.320 --> 03:49:02.640
And then we're going to move to Bitcoin.

03:49:02.640 --> 03:49:05.440
And I present the case for why I think

03:49:05.440 --> 03:49:07.040
maybe that might not be the case.

03:49:07.040 --> 03:49:10.840
Maybe we won't get this kind of apocalyptic scenario.

03:49:10.840 --> 03:49:14.440
And this was like the conclusion of the fiat standard,

03:49:14.440 --> 03:49:18.360
which is once you realize that mining fiat is creating debt,

03:49:19.280 --> 03:49:22.400
and Bitcoin is allowing, so in order to have fiat money,

03:49:22.400 --> 03:49:23.960
we need to have people borrow.

03:49:23.960 --> 03:49:26.080
We need to have people make loans.

03:49:26.080 --> 03:49:29.840
And the problem that fiat money runs into today

03:49:29.840 --> 03:49:31.920
is that if you want to save money,

03:49:31.920 --> 03:49:34.240
if you want to hold the savings,

03:49:34.240 --> 03:49:35.360
you have a problem.

03:49:35.360 --> 03:49:36.720
Where do you put your savings?

03:49:36.720 --> 03:49:38.840
So you put your savings in debt,

03:49:38.840 --> 03:49:41.040
in the creation of more bonds.

03:49:41.040 --> 03:49:42.600
Wherever you take your savings,

03:49:42.600 --> 03:49:44.240
you create a bubble in those things.

03:49:44.240 --> 03:49:46.040
And this is why we see a bubble in the stock market,

03:49:46.040 --> 03:49:48.840
a bubble in the bond market, a bubble in housing.

03:49:48.840 --> 03:49:51.080
It's because people are looking for savings,

03:49:51.080 --> 03:49:52.360
looking for a place where they can save.

03:49:52.360 --> 03:49:54.760
All of those things are crappy saving instruments

03:49:54.760 --> 03:49:58.480
because they're like copper

03:49:58.480 --> 03:50:00.720
in that there's nothing to stop the people behind them

03:50:00.720 --> 03:50:01.840
to make more of them.

03:50:01.840 --> 03:50:05.200
House builders can build more houses.

03:50:05.200 --> 03:50:06.880
Governments can issue more bonds.

03:50:07.800 --> 03:50:10.840
The crappy fraudulent companies can list on the stock market

03:50:10.840 --> 03:50:12.320
and make more stocks.

03:50:12.320 --> 03:50:14.480
Well, Bitcoin finally offers us an outlet.

03:50:14.480 --> 03:50:16.800
We don't need to keep creating more debt.

03:50:16.800 --> 03:50:20.560
We can invest in this asset that is hard

03:50:20.560 --> 03:50:23.040
and that is internationally liquid

03:50:23.040 --> 03:50:25.120
and that nobody can make more of.

03:50:25.120 --> 03:50:26.840
So there is no bubble in it.

03:50:26.840 --> 03:50:30.160
There is no mechanism for somebody to increase the supply

03:50:30.160 --> 03:50:31.880
and bring the price crashing down,

03:50:31.880 --> 03:50:34.520
like with copper and real estate and bonds.

03:50:34.520 --> 03:50:36.440
So Bitcoin is the way out.

03:50:36.440 --> 03:50:38.840
And this is why I think there's a good case to be made

03:50:38.840 --> 03:50:42.560
for why the fiat authorities might embrace Bitcoin

03:50:42.560 --> 03:50:44.400
because they'll see it is their way out

03:50:44.440 --> 03:50:49.040
of this enormous debt bubble that everybody is stuck in.

03:50:49.040 --> 03:50:51.080
Particularly the richest and most powerful people

03:50:51.080 --> 03:50:54.200
in the world and the richest and most powerful governments

03:50:54.200 --> 03:50:56.320
in the world are the world's biggest borrowers.

03:50:56.320 --> 03:50:57.840
They're the ones in a lot of debt.

03:50:57.840 --> 03:51:02.840
So a continuous slow devaluation of the value of that debt

03:51:02.960 --> 03:51:05.440
as people upgrade and move on to a hard asset

03:51:05.440 --> 03:51:10.440
that continues to appreciate is the peaceful way

03:51:10.680 --> 03:51:12.960
that we wind down the fiat Ponzi, I think.

03:51:13.000 --> 03:51:15.320
You can see it being like a political,

03:51:15.320 --> 03:51:18.280
part of a political platform for future people

03:51:18.280 --> 03:51:21.920
that run for president, those kinds of things to address.

03:51:21.920 --> 03:51:26.120
Obviously, it's not just for the powerful and the rich.

03:51:26.120 --> 03:51:28.400
The people are bothered by the debt.

03:51:28.400 --> 03:51:30.240
The people are bothered by everything

03:51:30.240 --> 03:51:31.920
that you describe with fiat.

03:51:31.920 --> 03:51:35.520
And if you wanna sell yourself in a democracy

03:51:35.520 --> 03:51:38.200
as a good leader, you might want to make

03:51:38.200 --> 03:51:39.720
that part of the platform.

03:51:39.720 --> 03:51:41.440
You mentioned you know Michael Malus.

03:51:41.480 --> 03:51:46.360
He just texted me asking me to ask you,

03:51:46.360 --> 03:51:49.080
what do you like best about Michael Malus?

03:51:49.080 --> 03:51:52.840
If you can spend five to 10 to 20 to an hour

03:51:52.840 --> 03:51:54.800
talking about the genius of Michael Malus,

03:51:54.800 --> 03:51:57.280
what do you like?

03:51:57.280 --> 03:51:58.440
Where does one even start?

03:51:58.440 --> 03:52:00.240
Well, obviously the haircut first.

03:52:01.440 --> 03:52:04.040
Yeah, he just gets sexier with age, that's for sure.

03:52:04.040 --> 03:52:04.880
That's good.

03:52:06.360 --> 03:52:10.840
His ideas, his trolling and humor,

03:52:11.000 --> 03:52:13.000
have you gotten a chance to interact with him?

03:52:13.000 --> 03:52:17.400
Yes, yes, I've met Michael maybe 10, 12 years ago in New York.

03:52:17.400 --> 03:52:19.920
I used to live in New York when he used to live in New York.

03:52:19.920 --> 03:52:21.080
I met him a couple of times.

03:52:21.080 --> 03:52:24.440
There was a bunch of anarchists in New York

03:52:24.440 --> 03:52:27.320
used to throw a happy hour once a month.

03:52:27.320 --> 03:52:29.520
It was called the high time preference,

03:52:29.520 --> 03:52:34.040
a Hoppe hour in honor of Hans Hermann Hoppe.

03:52:34.040 --> 03:52:35.440
So I met him there a couple of times

03:52:35.440 --> 03:52:39.320
and we followed each other on Twitter for a while.

03:52:39.360 --> 03:52:41.240
Is there interesting that you're aware

03:52:41.240 --> 03:52:43.960
of philosophical differences in your worldviews?

03:52:45.160 --> 03:52:47.400
No, I think we pretty much see eye to eye.

03:52:48.800 --> 03:52:52.480
I think the difference is mainly that he spends a lot of time

03:52:52.480 --> 03:52:55.360
focusing on American politics and American pop culture,

03:52:55.360 --> 03:52:57.880
which I don't pay much attention to, I guess.

03:52:57.880 --> 03:53:00.400
So you look more at the monetary system,

03:53:00.400 --> 03:53:02.720
the economics of it all and just the history

03:53:02.720 --> 03:53:07.360
and just looking at zooming out at the big picture of it all.

03:53:07.400 --> 03:53:09.480
Although recently he's working on a book called

03:53:09.480 --> 03:53:14.160
The White Pill and he's been, every time I see him,

03:53:14.160 --> 03:53:18.960
I mean, he's in some dark aspect of the 20th century.

03:53:18.960 --> 03:53:22.200
He's just like, I just finished writing about Hall and Amor.

03:53:22.200 --> 03:53:25.520
As you might imagine, he's not taking much, I believe,

03:53:25.520 --> 03:53:27.920
of a monetary perspective on things.

03:53:27.920 --> 03:53:30.640
His book, his writing at least for time,

03:53:30.640 --> 03:53:34.280
his kind of philosophical ideology perspective

03:53:34.280 --> 03:53:37.200
that's outside of the monetary system.

03:53:38.040 --> 03:53:41.640
But you argue that those are actually inextricably linked.

03:53:41.640 --> 03:53:43.680
Yeah, and I don't think he would disagree.

03:53:43.680 --> 03:53:48.680
But a book has to be, can only be so long, I suppose.

03:53:49.200 --> 03:53:52.720
It can only focus on so many things.

03:53:52.720 --> 03:53:56.080
If you can put on your wise sage hat

03:53:56.080 --> 03:53:58.600
and give some advice to young people.

03:53:58.600 --> 03:54:02.040
I mean, the past four hours have been a kind of advice,

03:54:02.040 --> 03:54:05.360
but if you can focus and if somebody in high school

03:54:05.360 --> 03:54:09.440
or college is thinking about what to do with their career,

03:54:09.440 --> 03:54:11.720
can have a successful career or to have a life

03:54:11.720 --> 03:54:13.720
they can be proud of, what would you tell them?

03:54:13.720 --> 03:54:15.680
I'd say probably the most important advice

03:54:15.680 --> 03:54:17.360
that I would give is to find a way

03:54:17.360 --> 03:54:20.120
to give value to other people.

03:54:20.120 --> 03:54:21.680
And this is really the key thing.

03:54:21.680 --> 03:54:23.720
You need to wake up every morning

03:54:23.720 --> 03:54:25.680
and figure out how to serve others.

03:54:25.680 --> 03:54:30.280
This is the key to everything you want in life.

03:54:30.280 --> 03:54:32.480
Everything that you want is on the other side

03:54:32.480 --> 03:54:34.480
of you serving others.

03:54:34.480 --> 03:54:37.560
So figure out how you can serve others in a good way,

03:54:37.560 --> 03:54:39.640
how you can do it in a way that they value.

03:54:39.640 --> 03:54:42.320
And you've got an incredible mechanism

03:54:42.320 --> 03:54:45.080
for figuring that out, which is the market.

03:54:45.080 --> 03:54:47.200
Go out there and do things for other people.

03:54:47.200 --> 03:54:49.800
And the market will tell you.

03:54:49.800 --> 03:54:51.640
The market will tell you exactly.

03:54:51.640 --> 03:54:53.520
If you're young, you have the enormous advantage

03:54:53.520 --> 03:54:56.880
of being able to make mistakes essentially

03:54:56.880 --> 03:54:58.160
and learn from them.

03:54:58.160 --> 03:55:02.160
So go out there, do things of value for others,

03:55:02.160 --> 03:55:06.440
figuring out how you can do something that,

03:55:06.440 --> 03:55:08.000
what is it that you can do that contributes

03:55:08.000 --> 03:55:10.200
the most value to other people's lives?

03:55:10.200 --> 03:55:13.280
And increasingly, I think with the modern technology,

03:55:13.280 --> 03:55:15.560
this is increasingly becoming online.

03:55:15.560 --> 03:55:18.880
And it's, I think you should consider

03:55:18.880 --> 03:55:21.440
how you can create value online,

03:55:21.440 --> 03:55:25.360
because that scales beyond anything that you can do

03:55:25.360 --> 03:55:27.960
in the physical world in a very, very,

03:55:27.960 --> 03:55:29.360
well, maybe not beyond, obviously.

03:55:29.360 --> 03:55:33.200
There are profitable businesses in the physical world.

03:55:33.200 --> 03:55:36.640
But I think online is enormous potential.

03:55:36.640 --> 03:55:39.080
And coding, I think, is enormously powerful.

03:55:39.080 --> 03:55:41.040
I'm not a coder myself, but I strongly recommend

03:55:41.040 --> 03:55:44.120
people get into learning how to code.

03:55:44.120 --> 03:55:46.400
And I think it's probably the thing

03:55:46.400 --> 03:55:48.680
that carries the most power.

03:55:48.680 --> 03:55:51.560
So initially, we were working with our hands.

03:55:51.560 --> 03:55:52.760
We started working with machines.

03:55:52.760 --> 03:55:54.480
Machines are much more productive.

03:55:54.480 --> 03:55:57.600
While code is an even higher level of productivity

03:55:57.600 --> 03:56:00.880
where you basically program the machines to produce things.

03:56:00.880 --> 03:56:05.240
So, you know, few clicks of a keyboard,

03:56:05.240 --> 03:56:08.000
and you can move millions of machines around the world

03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:09.240
in certain ways.

03:56:09.240 --> 03:56:11.280
So it carries an enormous amount of value.

03:56:11.280 --> 03:56:15.200
I think I always tell all young people to learn to code.

03:56:15.200 --> 03:56:16.360
It's the best thing.

03:56:16.360 --> 03:56:19.160
I used to tell it to my students when I was at university,

03:56:19.160 --> 03:56:21.600
tell them to drop out and go learn to code.

03:56:21.600 --> 03:56:23.640
It's probably a better use of their time and money.

03:56:23.640 --> 03:56:25.440
We could probably do both.

03:56:25.440 --> 03:56:26.280
Yeah.

03:56:26.280 --> 03:56:28.120
University has an interesting function.

03:56:28.120 --> 03:56:30.960
I mean, probably you and I have different perspectives on this.

03:56:30.960 --> 03:56:33.400
It probably has to do with a little bit of a different journey

03:56:33.400 --> 03:56:35.840
in terms of fields,

03:56:35.840 --> 03:56:39.640
because I've stayed engineering focused for a long time.

03:56:39.640 --> 03:56:41.880
And there's less some of the troubles you might highlight

03:56:41.880 --> 03:56:43.400
in the education system.

03:56:43.400 --> 03:56:46.800
There's less troubles of that kind in engineering,

03:56:46.800 --> 03:56:49.960
because math hasn't changed for a long time.

03:56:49.960 --> 03:56:53.440
So a lot of it is just doing hard things,

03:56:53.440 --> 03:56:55.640
being forced to do hard things,

03:56:55.680 --> 03:56:57.720
becoming a bit of a generalist,

03:56:57.720 --> 03:57:00.600
while on the side, you're also becoming a specialist

03:57:01.800 --> 03:57:04.360
based on your own passion, driven by your own passion.

03:57:04.360 --> 03:57:06.720
So school, at least high school,

03:57:06.720 --> 03:57:09.360
I don't know about the university, but high school,

03:57:09.360 --> 03:57:13.560
that's a really nice, one of the only times in your life,

03:57:13.560 --> 03:57:17.240
at least in my life, I was forced,

03:57:17.240 --> 03:57:20.840
but now I see, given the opportunity

03:57:20.840 --> 03:57:24.440
to spend my entire day learning broadly.

03:57:24.480 --> 03:57:26.960
And that's something, I don't know, the way time works,

03:57:26.960 --> 03:57:28.000
it just runs away from you,

03:57:28.000 --> 03:57:30.160
and you never really get a chance to do,

03:57:30.160 --> 03:57:33.720
learn quite that broadly again.

03:57:33.720 --> 03:57:35.320
That's the curse of specialization,

03:57:35.320 --> 03:57:39.200
is you never get a chance to study biology, chemistry,

03:57:39.200 --> 03:57:42.680
if you're a physicist, time runs away from you.

03:57:42.680 --> 03:57:46.960
So enjoy the broad education of it.

03:57:46.960 --> 03:57:48.760
But yeah, like you said,

03:57:48.760 --> 03:57:52.200
find the things that are valued by the market.

03:57:53.120 --> 03:57:56.160
And on the other side of it, you said all the good stuff,

03:57:56.160 --> 03:57:58.480
so that's also a way to get happiness.

03:57:58.480 --> 03:57:59.920
Yeah, and I'll also add,

03:57:59.920 --> 03:58:01.720
the horse that I like to whip all the time

03:58:01.720 --> 03:58:04.200
is the low time preference aspect of things,

03:58:04.200 --> 03:58:06.040
saving with Bitcoin.

03:58:06.040 --> 03:58:08.600
So I think my advice to young people is,

03:58:08.600 --> 03:58:11.080
when you're young, you think of the world

03:58:11.080 --> 03:58:13.680
in a very short term, generally.

03:58:13.680 --> 03:58:15.760
You're focused on the present,

03:58:15.760 --> 03:58:17.360
and you think that everything that's happening

03:58:17.360 --> 03:58:18.880
in the present is the most important thing

03:58:18.880 --> 03:58:21.600
that's ever gonna happen in the history of humanity.

03:58:21.640 --> 03:58:23.640
Lower your time preference, think about the future,

03:58:23.640 --> 03:58:25.640
think further down the line,

03:58:25.640 --> 03:58:28.360
think about the consequences of the things you do,

03:58:28.360 --> 03:58:29.200
and then what.

03:58:29.200 --> 03:58:31.120
And so you do this now, it feels good today,

03:58:31.120 --> 03:58:33.520
but then what happens tomorrow?

03:58:33.520 --> 03:58:35.880
You go out, you drink, you enjoy yourself,

03:58:35.880 --> 03:58:37.400
think about the hangover.

03:58:37.400 --> 03:58:40.280
But more long-term, think about the implication

03:58:40.280 --> 03:58:42.320
of living this kind of life.

03:58:42.320 --> 03:58:43.920
Think about every decision

03:58:43.920 --> 03:58:46.080
that you make, the long-term implication of it.

03:58:46.080 --> 03:58:47.640
And part of that is Bitcoin,

03:58:47.640 --> 03:58:49.560
part of that is save in Bitcoin.

03:58:49.560 --> 03:58:53.280
I urge everybody to put savings in Bitcoin

03:58:53.280 --> 03:58:54.480
for the long term.

03:58:54.480 --> 03:58:56.360
Don't buy Bitcoin for the short term.

03:58:56.360 --> 03:58:59.200
Don't buy Bitcoin today so that you can sell it.

03:58:59.200 --> 03:59:00.720
Don't put your savings in Bitcoin today

03:59:00.720 --> 03:59:04.200
so that you can sell it all next month and buy a house.

03:59:04.200 --> 03:59:07.520
Put money in Bitcoin that you expect to keep in Bitcoin

03:59:07.520 --> 03:59:11.600
for another five, 10 years or so,

03:59:11.600 --> 03:59:13.920
at least four years, is what I recommend for people.

03:59:13.920 --> 03:59:15.920
So keep a low time preference,

03:59:15.920 --> 03:59:18.280
focus on the future, and save in Bitcoin.

03:59:18.320 --> 03:59:21.320
And learn about how to buy Bitcoin,

03:59:21.320 --> 03:59:23.400
how to learn about all this technology.

03:59:23.400 --> 03:59:24.800
Part of this is this conversation,

03:59:24.800 --> 03:59:26.520
but there's so much awesome material out there.

03:59:26.520 --> 03:59:28.240
And thank you, by the way,

03:59:28.240 --> 03:59:30.520
for this gift of a hardware wallet.

03:59:30.520 --> 03:59:31.360
Nice.

03:59:31.360 --> 03:59:33.840
So you should definitely invest in it yourself.

03:59:33.840 --> 03:59:36.760
And what would you call this?

03:59:36.760 --> 03:59:37.600
These are-

03:59:37.600 --> 03:59:38.440
Open dimes.

03:59:38.440 --> 03:59:39.400
Open dimes, yeah.

03:59:39.400 --> 03:59:41.800
So this is like USB that you can,

03:59:41.800 --> 03:59:44.080
like a hardware device that stores Bitcoin.

03:59:44.080 --> 03:59:45.560
Yeah, so you don't have to worry

03:59:45.560 --> 03:59:47.720
about us knowing the password.

03:59:47.760 --> 03:59:50.440
It contains the password within it and it's tamper-proof.

03:59:50.440 --> 03:59:52.280
So you can save the Bitcoin on it and-

03:59:52.280 --> 03:59:54.400
So when the apocalypse comes,

03:59:54.400 --> 03:59:56.920
you need the value to be stored,

03:59:56.920 --> 03:59:59.880
an actual thing that you can have in your physical possession.

03:59:59.880 --> 04:00:00.720
Yeah.

04:00:00.720 --> 04:00:02.240
That's exactly what this is.

04:00:02.240 --> 04:00:04.640
You've had a heck of a life.

04:00:04.640 --> 04:00:07.880
You've been in a bunch of places in this world.

04:00:07.880 --> 04:00:08.960
A lot of places.

04:00:08.960 --> 04:00:12.840
Life is not easy in some of those places.

04:00:12.840 --> 04:00:17.280
What has been, if you can take a step to maybe

04:00:17.280 --> 04:00:19.320
a bit of a dark step for a short time,

04:00:19.320 --> 04:00:23.720
what has been maybe the darkest time, period,

04:00:23.720 --> 04:00:26.040
place you ever got in your mind,

04:00:26.040 --> 04:00:28.520
a dark period of your life,

04:00:28.520 --> 04:00:32.160
a struggle you had to overcome, you had to survive?

04:00:32.160 --> 04:00:33.680
Well, I'm Palestinian,

04:00:33.680 --> 04:00:36.560
so that is the tragedy of my life.

04:00:36.560 --> 04:00:37.960
I'm Palestinian-Jordanian.

04:00:38.960 --> 04:00:43.920
My family's suffered a lot because of this historically.

04:00:43.920 --> 04:00:47.040
I grew up in Ramallah in the West Bank.

04:00:47.040 --> 04:00:50.440
It wasn't ideal to see that.

04:00:51.520 --> 04:00:54.160
People like to think of it as this intractable conflict

04:00:54.160 --> 04:00:55.760
between two bitter enemies,

04:00:55.760 --> 04:00:59.760
but the reality of the matter is that it's not.

04:00:59.760 --> 04:01:02.000
A foreign ideology came in with the idea

04:01:02.000 --> 04:01:04.960
that this country needs to be occupied by people

04:01:04.960 --> 04:01:08.880
from only one religion and the existing population,

04:01:08.880 --> 04:01:11.720
which, I mean, Jews had always lived in Palestine,

04:01:11.720 --> 04:01:15.000
historically, and at the turn of the 20th century,

04:01:15.000 --> 04:01:16.880
they were only 10% of the population,

04:01:17.720 --> 04:01:19.680
but then with the birth of fiat money,

04:01:19.680 --> 04:01:21.920
incidentally, the link with all of this

04:01:21.920 --> 04:01:26.040
is that when the Bank of England went off gold,

04:01:26.040 --> 04:01:28.240
big reason why they were able to pull that off

04:01:28.240 --> 04:01:31.080
was that the Rothschild banking family supported them,

04:01:31.080 --> 04:01:33.520
and in exchange, the Rothschilds got Palestine,

04:01:33.520 --> 04:01:37.680
and the Balfour Declaration was written

04:01:37.680 --> 04:01:42.680
by the government of Britain to the Rothschild family,

04:01:42.720 --> 04:01:47.600
telling them that they'd like to make Palestine

04:01:47.600 --> 04:01:49.480
a homeland for Jews.

04:01:49.480 --> 04:01:51.880
So, obviously, that's not very convenient

04:01:51.880 --> 04:01:54.680
for people who are not Jewish for whom that is a homeland,

04:01:54.680 --> 04:01:59.680
and the past 80 years has been a very painful struggle

04:01:59.760 --> 04:02:01.360
if you happen to not be Jewish,

04:02:01.360 --> 04:02:05.680
and obviously, Palestinians have done all kinds of things,

04:02:05.680 --> 04:02:06.680
trying to fight back,

04:02:06.680 --> 04:02:09.080
and they've done all kinds of wrong things,

04:02:09.080 --> 04:02:12.040
but I don't think you can escape the fundamental reality

04:02:12.040 --> 04:02:15.040
underlying this, which is that if you're not Jewish,

04:02:15.040 --> 04:02:18.120
you are being moved out of the land,

04:02:18.120 --> 04:02:21.120
and so it's happened in 1947, 48.

04:02:21.120 --> 04:02:24.640
It happened in 1976, 1967.

04:02:24.640 --> 04:02:26.520
More land was taken over by Israel.

04:02:26.520 --> 04:02:28.280
Now you see it with the settlements.

04:02:29.280 --> 04:02:31.080
If you ignore the day-to-day headlines

04:02:31.080 --> 04:02:33.080
and you ignore the media propaganda

04:02:33.080 --> 04:02:34.760
and you ignore all of this,

04:02:34.760 --> 04:02:36.600
there's a very clear thing that is happening,

04:02:36.600 --> 04:02:41.600
which is more land owned by an exclusive ideology

04:02:42.320 --> 04:02:43.960
that believes this land needs to be owned

04:02:43.960 --> 04:02:45.520
by people from one religion,

04:02:45.520 --> 04:02:47.880
and everybody else is being kicked out,

04:02:47.880 --> 04:02:52.640
and so that is the tragedy of my life,

04:02:52.640 --> 04:02:55.960
and my wife is also a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon,

04:02:55.960 --> 04:02:59.560
and her family was evicted from Yaffa,

04:02:59.560 --> 04:03:02.920
which is today on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.

04:03:02.920 --> 04:03:05.520
They still have their homes in Yaffa.

04:03:05.520 --> 04:03:06.800
Their homes are being lived.

04:03:06.800 --> 04:03:08.160
They got kicked out of their homes,

04:03:08.160 --> 04:03:09.760
and their lands, and their property.

04:03:09.760 --> 04:03:11.640
They became refugees in Lebanon.

04:03:11.640 --> 04:03:14.960
So my children, you know, it's an ongoing tragedy.

04:03:14.960 --> 04:03:16.440
It's not something that is,

04:03:18.200 --> 04:03:20.960
a lot of the people that think of it as,

04:03:20.960 --> 04:03:22.800
you know, they think Palestinians are just out there

04:03:22.800 --> 04:03:25.160
to get Israelis because they hate them,

04:03:25.160 --> 04:03:27.760
but it's an inescapable tragedy.

04:03:27.760 --> 04:03:29.240
I don't have a home anywhere.

04:03:29.240 --> 04:03:31.640
Is there an escape from this tragedy

04:03:31.640 --> 04:03:33.520
in the future that you see?

04:03:33.520 --> 04:03:36.680
If you zoom out across the scale of decades,

04:03:38.520 --> 04:03:39.920
will we see

04:03:41.880 --> 04:03:44.360
I hesitate to say peace,

04:03:44.360 --> 04:03:45.200
but

04:03:47.840 --> 04:03:50.120
a significant decrease in human suffering

04:03:50.120 --> 04:03:52.200
in this part of the region?

04:03:52.200 --> 04:03:55.320
I certainly hope so, and I think, you know,

04:03:55.320 --> 04:03:58.160
my interest in Bitcoin comes from,

04:03:58.160 --> 04:04:02.040
came from a place of desperation with the situation there.

04:04:02.040 --> 04:04:05.000
Traditional politics is a dead end.

04:04:05.920 --> 04:04:08.120
I don't see what I can be doing

04:04:08.120 --> 04:04:09.840
to make things better there

04:04:09.840 --> 04:04:11.920
using traditional politics.

04:04:11.920 --> 04:04:14.640
And I think a good friend of mine, Pierre Rochard,

04:04:14.640 --> 04:04:16.160
you may know him on Twitter,

04:04:16.160 --> 04:04:18.680
one of the brightest minds in Bitcoin, in my opinion,

04:04:18.680 --> 04:04:21.040
he told me his theory is that Bitcoin

04:04:21.040 --> 04:04:22.600
is gonna bring peace to the Middle East

04:04:22.600 --> 04:04:24.120
because land is a shit coin.

04:04:24.120 --> 04:04:26.400
And-

04:04:26.400 --> 04:04:27.600
Land is a shit coin.

04:04:27.600 --> 04:04:28.440
I love it.

04:04:28.440 --> 04:04:30.080
And I think he's got a very good point there

04:04:30.080 --> 04:04:32.400
that this fixation with land

04:04:32.400 --> 04:04:35.840
and the bitterness with which people have to the land

04:04:35.840 --> 04:04:39.680
is likely to decline when people are gonna have

04:04:40.520 --> 04:04:42.280
a form of property that they can keep.

04:04:42.280 --> 04:04:45.040
And so hopefully that will help in one way.

04:04:45.040 --> 04:04:47.720
And of course, the more obvious way is that

04:04:48.600 --> 04:04:50.120
this is a conflict of governments

04:04:50.120 --> 04:04:53.040
and it's a conflict that is financed by fiat.

04:04:53.040 --> 04:04:56.600
From day one, you know, the entirely insane notion

04:04:56.600 --> 04:05:01.600
that you could build a national, an ethnic homeland.

04:05:01.680 --> 04:05:03.920
And of course, you know, this is the early 20th century.

04:05:03.920 --> 04:05:08.920
So the idea behind Zionism is coming from the same place

04:05:09.000 --> 04:05:11.160
where all these other ethnic nationalisms

04:05:11.160 --> 04:05:12.560
of Europe were emerging.

04:05:12.560 --> 04:05:16.520
And we saw how well, how horribly these worked out.

04:05:16.520 --> 04:05:19.280
But the idea that you could, you know,

04:05:19.280 --> 04:05:21.240
it's one thing to say we wanna build a homeland

04:05:21.240 --> 04:05:23.600
for Germans in Germany.

04:05:23.600 --> 04:05:25.240
It's one thing to say we wanna build a homelands

04:05:25.240 --> 04:05:28.040
for Germans somewhere else.

04:05:28.040 --> 04:05:32.400
And that was Palestine, that was Zionism.

04:05:32.400 --> 04:05:34.640
And that was only possible thanks to fiat,

04:05:34.640 --> 04:05:36.600
thanks to the ability of the British government

04:05:36.600 --> 04:05:38.480
and all these other governments

04:05:38.480 --> 04:05:42.120
to continue to finance this colonialist effort over time.

04:05:42.120 --> 04:05:45.880
And, you know, it continues to finance war

04:05:45.880 --> 04:05:48.680
and it continues, you know, we see war all over the world

04:05:48.680 --> 04:05:52.600
continue to escalate because the people

04:05:52.600 --> 04:05:54.360
who'd make the decision to escalate the war

04:05:54.360 --> 04:05:55.760
are not the ones who are paying for it

04:05:55.760 --> 04:05:57.160
and they're not the ones who are fighting.

04:05:57.160 --> 04:05:58.960
They're the ones who sit in offices.

04:05:58.960 --> 04:06:00.320
And in the case of, you know,

04:06:00.320 --> 04:06:02.040
most of Middle Eastern conflict,

04:06:02.040 --> 04:06:05.320
it's people who live abroad, you know.

04:06:05.320 --> 04:06:07.040
It's people who are abroad who are not part of it

04:06:07.040 --> 04:06:09.200
who just are emotionally charged to it

04:06:09.200 --> 04:06:11.200
because they watch it on TV.

04:06:11.200 --> 04:06:14.320
So, you know, you have billions of Muslims around the world

04:06:14.320 --> 04:06:16.560
and Jews around the world

04:06:16.560 --> 04:06:19.400
who feel extremely emotionally attached to it.

04:06:19.400 --> 04:06:20.360
They're not the ones fighting.

04:06:20.360 --> 04:06:22.520
They're not the ones paying their own money.

04:06:22.520 --> 04:06:24.880
They're just getting governments to send money

04:06:24.880 --> 04:06:27.520
and to send weapons and to take part.

04:06:27.520 --> 04:06:32.520
And it's fun as a spectator sport

04:06:32.520 --> 04:06:33.960
for most of these people

04:06:33.960 --> 04:06:35.440
because they don't get to live in it.

04:06:35.520 --> 04:06:36.520
But I got to live in it.

04:06:36.520 --> 04:06:37.360
I saw it.

04:06:37.360 --> 04:06:38.200
I grew up there.

04:06:38.200 --> 04:06:40.800
I saw the settlement expansion.

04:06:40.800 --> 04:06:42.360
And, you know, recently, a few weeks ago,

04:06:42.360 --> 04:06:45.320
I went back to Ramallah and it's just,

04:06:45.320 --> 04:06:47.400
it's amazing every time you go,

04:06:47.400 --> 04:06:50.880
the settlements are just growing in an astonishing way.

04:06:50.880 --> 04:06:55.200
Like it's not just housing units that are going up.

04:06:55.200 --> 04:06:57.560
It's an entire attempt to build,

04:06:58.680 --> 04:07:01.600
to basically suffocate Palestinian areas

04:07:01.600 --> 04:07:03.040
and force Palestinians to leave

04:07:03.040 --> 04:07:06.280
or keep them living in horrific conditions.

04:07:07.560 --> 04:07:11.760
And if I may, just because I have family in Ukraine,

04:07:11.760 --> 04:07:13.920
I have family in Russia,

04:07:13.920 --> 04:07:17.760
since this war, echoes of similar things are happening

04:07:17.760 --> 04:07:19.600
in that part of the world too.

04:07:19.600 --> 04:07:23.600
And I shudder to think about the decades to come

04:07:23.600 --> 04:07:25.400
of the hate that is brewing,

04:07:25.400 --> 04:07:27.240
the suffering that is brewing

04:07:27.240 --> 04:07:29.920
based on decisions and pressures

04:07:29.920 --> 04:07:34.920
and from not always people directly impacted by this.

04:07:36.840 --> 04:07:41.000
So again, it feels like that military conflict

04:07:41.000 --> 04:07:45.400
is not just a creation of like people on the ground.

04:07:45.400 --> 04:07:48.200
It's a creation of leaders, power centers.

04:07:48.200 --> 04:07:52.480
And perhaps, again, I'm not smart enough,

04:07:52.480 --> 04:07:55.640
but even the monetary system probably has a role to play.

04:07:55.640 --> 04:07:56.920
I absolutely think it does.

04:07:56.920 --> 04:08:00.640
Monetary system is what allows people

04:08:00.640 --> 04:08:04.160
to just continue to treat war as a spectator sport.

04:08:04.160 --> 04:08:06.000
That's really what it comes down to.

04:08:06.000 --> 04:08:09.120
And it starts with World War I and it's continued.

04:08:09.120 --> 04:08:13.320
And this is why really, I think I've said this before,

04:08:13.320 --> 04:08:15.720
I've tweeted this before and it was a pretty popular tweet,

04:08:15.720 --> 04:08:17.200
but it also got a lot of people

04:08:18.640 --> 04:08:22.040
to dismiss the idea with mockery, of course.

04:08:22.040 --> 04:08:24.320
But I really think Bitcoin is the only technology

04:08:24.320 --> 04:08:26.400
that's going to end World War I.

04:08:26.440 --> 04:08:28.480
Once World War I started,

04:08:28.480 --> 04:08:30.160
we got into this endless conflict

04:08:30.160 --> 04:08:32.280
that's been ongoing since then.

04:08:32.280 --> 04:08:33.840
If you look at all the world's conflicts today,

04:08:33.840 --> 04:08:36.480
pretty much they all trace back to World War I.

04:08:36.480 --> 04:08:39.800
And it's because when that Pandora's box

04:08:39.800 --> 04:08:42.600
of government control of money was opened,

04:08:42.600 --> 04:08:44.960
there was no longer a real restraint on war

04:08:44.960 --> 04:08:47.680
except complete defeat and complete destruction

04:08:47.680 --> 04:08:48.520
and complete death.

04:08:48.520 --> 04:08:50.240
The war had to be total.

04:08:50.240 --> 04:08:53.280
Before that, under the gold standard,

04:08:54.280 --> 04:08:57.040
kings would send professional armies

04:08:57.040 --> 04:08:59.760
to fight each other in battlefields.

04:08:59.760 --> 04:09:02.080
And as soon as it became clear

04:09:02.080 --> 04:09:04.640
that one side was establishing an advantage,

04:09:04.640 --> 04:09:05.720
the fighting would stop

04:09:05.720 --> 04:09:10.720
and the kings would agree to new terms

04:09:12.240 --> 04:09:13.440
because it was extremely expensive

04:09:13.440 --> 04:09:16.480
to build a professional army and you ran out of money.

04:09:16.480 --> 04:09:18.280
So it was always the smartest thing to do

04:09:18.280 --> 04:09:20.960
is to just stop fighting whenever you could.

04:09:20.960 --> 04:09:23.040
And wars would take place.

04:09:23.760 --> 04:09:25.400
And countries would fight each other in the battlefield.

04:09:25.400 --> 04:09:28.200
But in the cities, life went on as normal.

04:09:28.200 --> 04:09:30.040
And people within the same cities,

04:09:30.040 --> 04:09:31.680
within the cities of the two countries

04:09:31.680 --> 04:09:33.760
would be trading with one another.

04:09:33.760 --> 04:09:35.480
Life would go on, but the war would be there.

04:09:35.480 --> 04:09:40.480
And it was just an independent part of politics

04:09:40.960 --> 04:09:43.920
that, all right, we have a problem over this piece of land.

04:09:43.920 --> 04:09:46.200
Let's take it outside.

04:09:46.200 --> 04:09:48.680
We don't fight in the civilian areas.

04:09:48.680 --> 04:09:50.080
We go to the battlefield.

04:09:50.080 --> 04:09:51.520
We fight with professional armies.

04:09:51.520 --> 04:09:53.920
And in fact, sometimes the conflicts would be,

04:09:53.920 --> 04:09:55.760
the armies would line up

04:09:55.760 --> 04:09:59.040
and they would just have a small contingent

04:09:59.040 --> 04:10:00.720
of the two armies fight with one another.

04:10:00.720 --> 04:10:03.120
And as soon as one of them establishes an advantage,

04:10:03.120 --> 04:10:05.960
then, all right, well, you won.

04:10:05.960 --> 04:10:07.080
Let's move on with it.

04:10:08.080 --> 04:10:10.320
Governments were far, far, far more careful

04:10:10.320 --> 04:10:14.800
about their monetary policy and their,

04:10:14.800 --> 04:10:15.960
sorry, their war policy

04:10:15.960 --> 04:10:17.600
when they couldn't print their money.

04:10:17.600 --> 04:10:19.640
And that has changed with Fiat.

04:10:19.640 --> 04:10:22.040
And that has allowed this new emergence

04:10:22.040 --> 04:10:24.920
of this class of what I like to call chicken hawks

04:10:24.920 --> 04:10:26.680
of people who sit in offices,

04:10:26.680 --> 04:10:29.400
like the entire foreign policy establishment

04:10:29.400 --> 04:10:31.240
in Washington, D.C.,

04:10:31.240 --> 04:10:33.040
people who have never fought a war,

04:10:33.040 --> 04:10:35.080
whose children will never fight a war,

04:10:35.080 --> 04:10:37.080
who'll never pay to fight a war,

04:10:37.080 --> 04:10:40.360
who'll never suffer a broken window in their house

04:10:40.360 --> 04:10:41.720
because of war.

04:10:41.720 --> 04:10:45.560
Sitting there and based on these fucking moronic garbage

04:10:45.560 --> 04:10:48.520
that they teach at moronic Fiat universities

04:10:48.520 --> 04:10:50.560
about politics and geopolitics,

04:10:50.560 --> 04:10:53.400
making decisions about we need to invade that country

04:10:53.400 --> 04:10:54.520
and we need to send war there.

04:10:54.520 --> 04:10:55.920
And they can do that

04:10:55.920 --> 04:10:58.320
because they have this endless money printer.

04:10:58.320 --> 04:11:01.520
And that's why back under gold,

04:11:01.520 --> 04:11:03.200
if you were a warrior,

04:11:03.200 --> 04:11:05.480
you went and actually joined the war.

04:11:05.480 --> 04:11:09.360
And the people who pontificated about war

04:11:09.360 --> 04:11:10.920
were the people who had experience with war,

04:11:10.920 --> 04:11:13.600
the people who were sending their own children to war,

04:11:13.600 --> 04:11:15.840
the people who were fighting with their own money.

04:11:15.880 --> 04:11:18.760
Now you have all these fat parasitics come

04:11:18.760 --> 04:11:20.680
sitting in Washington, D.C., deciding.

04:11:20.680 --> 04:11:22.360
And Washington is just an example,

04:11:22.360 --> 04:11:24.200
but all over the world this exists.

04:11:24.200 --> 04:11:25.160
People who have never fought,

04:11:25.160 --> 04:11:26.840
who'll never carry the consequences

04:11:26.840 --> 04:11:30.040
are going to devalue the world's money

04:11:30.040 --> 04:11:33.240
in order to go and have other people's children

04:11:33.240 --> 04:11:36.120
fight each other because of stupid garbage

04:11:36.120 --> 04:11:39.280
they learned about politics in university.

04:11:40.800 --> 04:11:44.400
You said you value low time preference,

04:11:44.400 --> 04:11:48.200
but I have news for you that one day you will die.

04:11:48.200 --> 04:11:50.280
As far as we know, you're a mortal being.

04:11:51.240 --> 04:11:52.600
Do you think about your death?

04:11:52.600 --> 04:11:54.360
Do you think about your mortality?

04:11:55.280 --> 04:11:56.440
Are you afraid of it?

04:11:57.960 --> 04:12:02.600
I've spent a lot of time introspecting

04:12:02.600 --> 04:12:03.720
and thinking about these things.

04:12:03.720 --> 04:12:06.120
And I value life a lot.

04:12:06.120 --> 04:12:08.360
I valued my time on earth a lot.

04:12:08.360 --> 04:12:11.200
And you'll see this in my dealings with people.

04:12:11.200 --> 04:12:13.160
You know, go back to Twitter.

04:12:13.160 --> 04:12:15.400
Why am I so brash and straightforward?

04:12:15.400 --> 04:12:17.480
It really is because life is short.

04:12:17.480 --> 04:12:19.160
Because I don't want to waste.

04:12:19.160 --> 04:12:20.720
I think, you know, on my,

04:12:22.120 --> 04:12:25.120
I've said this before,

04:12:25.120 --> 04:12:27.640
on my tombstone, let it be written.

04:12:27.640 --> 04:12:30.720
He never let anyone waste his time twice in his life.

04:12:32.080 --> 04:12:32.920
You can-

04:12:32.920 --> 04:12:33.760
His life is short.

04:12:33.760 --> 04:12:35.040
Yeah, you can waste my time once.

04:12:35.040 --> 04:12:36.280
You can get me to do something

04:12:36.280 --> 04:12:37.720
and then I realize that was a waste of time.

04:12:37.720 --> 04:12:39.800
You will never get me to waste my time twice.

04:12:39.800 --> 04:12:42.920
And so you show up in my Twitter with something stupid.

04:12:43.600 --> 04:12:45.440
You're never showing up in my Twitter ever again.

04:12:45.440 --> 04:12:47.640
You give people a chance, but you're a fast learner.

04:12:47.640 --> 04:12:50.720
Yeah, and I try and use my time very wisely.

04:12:50.720 --> 04:12:52.840
And I'm unapologetic about it.

04:12:52.840 --> 04:12:54.320
My time is the most precious thing.

04:12:54.320 --> 04:12:56.800
And like the way to get on my shit side,

04:12:56.800 --> 04:13:01.080
on my shit list forever is to try and take away my time

04:13:01.080 --> 04:13:02.240
and to abuse my time.

04:13:02.240 --> 04:13:07.240
If you do that, it's the one unforgivable sin for me.

04:13:08.680 --> 04:13:09.880
And I think that's really,

04:13:09.880 --> 04:13:13.000
I think that's my way of coming to terms with mortality.

04:13:13.000 --> 04:13:14.280
We're all gonna die.

04:13:14.280 --> 04:13:15.640
And so let's make the most out of it

04:13:15.640 --> 04:13:16.600
while we're still here.

04:13:16.600 --> 04:13:17.960
And of course, the other way you come to terms

04:13:17.960 --> 04:13:19.760
with mortality is you have children.

04:13:21.200 --> 04:13:26.000
Given what you just said, doubly so,

04:13:26.000 --> 04:13:27.560
it's a huge honor that you would spend

04:13:27.560 --> 04:13:29.440
your valuable time with me.

04:13:29.440 --> 04:13:30.880
This is the first time you did it,

04:13:30.880 --> 04:13:32.800
so you probably regret all of it.

04:13:32.800 --> 04:13:35.160
So we'll probably never see each other again.

04:13:35.160 --> 04:13:38.240
But I'm glad you at least took the chance to do it.

04:13:38.240 --> 04:13:40.880
It's a huge honor, and I've been a huge fan of yours.

04:13:40.880 --> 04:13:44.160
I think you have impact on the world

04:13:44.160 --> 04:13:46.040
that you probably are not even aware of.

04:13:46.040 --> 04:13:47.640
It's tremendous.

04:13:47.640 --> 04:13:50.280
And a lot of people love you, and your work is important.

04:13:50.280 --> 04:13:53.560
Even, you know, I disagree with some things you say,

04:13:53.560 --> 04:13:55.080
and there's people that disagree with you,

04:13:55.080 --> 04:13:57.000
but everybody respects you.

04:13:57.000 --> 04:13:58.240
And thank you so much for spending

04:13:58.240 --> 04:14:00.120
your really valuable time with me today, brother.

04:14:00.120 --> 04:14:00.960
Thank you, sir.

04:14:00.960 --> 04:14:01.800
I really appreciate it.

04:14:01.800 --> 04:14:02.760
This was not a waste of time,

04:14:02.760 --> 04:14:04.840
and I'd be happy to do it again.

04:14:04.840 --> 04:14:06.400
Thanks for listening to this conversation

04:14:06.400 --> 04:14:07.800
with Saved Dina Moose.

04:14:07.840 --> 04:14:09.040
To support this podcast,

04:14:09.040 --> 04:14:11.560
please check out our sponsors in the description.

04:14:11.560 --> 04:14:13.720
And now, let me leave you with some words

04:14:13.720 --> 04:14:16.560
from the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek.

04:14:17.480 --> 04:14:19.960
Economic control is not merely control

04:14:19.960 --> 04:14:21.520
of a sector of human life,

04:14:21.520 --> 04:14:23.520
which can be separated from the rest.

04:14:23.520 --> 04:14:27.660
It is the control of the means for all our ends.

04:14:28.640 --> 04:14:31.680
Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.

04:14:37.800 --> 04:14:38.640
Thank you.
