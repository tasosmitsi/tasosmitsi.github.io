00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
The following is a conversation with John Mearsheimer,

00:02.960 --> 00:07.760
a professor at University of Chicago and one of the most influential

00:07.760 --> 00:09.840
and controversial thinkers in the world.

00:10.480 --> 00:16.160
He teaches, speaks, and writes about the nature of power and war on the global stage,

00:16.800 --> 00:18.320
in history and today.

00:19.520 --> 00:24.480
Please allow me to say, once again, my hope for this little journey I'm on.

00:25.440 --> 00:33.520
I will speak to everyone, on all sides, with compassion, with empathy, and with backbone.

00:34.400 --> 00:40.000
I will speak with Vladimir Putin and with Volodymyr Zelensky, with Russians and with

00:40.000 --> 00:45.200
Ukrainians, with Israelis and with Palestinians, with everyone.

00:46.320 --> 00:51.280
My goal is to do whatever small part I can to decrease the amount of suffering in the world,

00:52.160 --> 00:55.280
by trying to reveal our common humanity.

00:56.480 --> 01:01.280
I believe that in the end, truth and love wins.

01:02.960 --> 01:08.160
I will get attacked for being naive, for being a shill, for being weak.

01:09.520 --> 01:10.800
I am none of those things.

01:11.840 --> 01:15.280
But I do make mistakes and I will get better.

01:16.880 --> 01:17.680
I love you all.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.400
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.600
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:23.600 --> 01:27.200
And now, dear friends, here's John Mishammer.

01:28.400 --> 01:33.680
Can you explain your view on power in international politics as outlined in your book,

01:33.680 --> 01:38.000
The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, and in your writing since then?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.160
Yeah, I'll make two sets of points there.

01:40.160 --> 01:45.200
First of all, I believe that power is the currency of international relations.

01:46.160 --> 01:50.720
And by that, I mean that states are deeply interested in the balance of power.

01:50.720 --> 01:54.640
And they're interested in maximizing how much power they control.

01:55.360 --> 01:59.360
And the question is, why do states care so much about power?

02:00.320 --> 02:03.920
In the international system, there's no higher authority.

02:04.560 --> 02:10.480
So if you get into trouble and you dial 911, there's nobody at the other end.

02:11.280 --> 02:18.240
In a system like that, you have no choice but to figure out for yourself

02:18.240 --> 02:19.840
how best to protect yourself.

02:20.560 --> 02:24.080
And the best way to protect yourself is to be powerful.

02:24.080 --> 02:30.560
To have as much power as you can possibly gain over all the other states in the system.

02:30.560 --> 02:38.480
Therefore, states care about power because it enhances or maximizes their prospects for survival.

02:39.120 --> 02:43.520
Second point I would make is that in the realist story or in my story,

02:44.080 --> 02:48.240
power is largely a function of material factors.

02:49.280 --> 02:56.080
The two key building blocks of power are population size and wealth.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.440
You want to have a lot of people and you want to be really wealthy.

02:59.440 --> 03:03.200
Of course, this is why the United States is so powerful.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.720
It has lots of people and it has lots of wealth.

03:07.280 --> 03:14.080
China was not considered a great power until recently because it didn't have a lot of wealth.

03:14.080 --> 03:18.000
It certainly had population size, but it didn't have wealth.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.160
And without both a large population and much wealth, you're usually not considered a great power.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.760
So I think power matters.

03:29.200 --> 03:33.120
But when we talk about power, it's important to understand

03:33.120 --> 03:37.280
that it's population size and wealth that are underpinning it.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.360
So there's a lot of interesting things there.

03:39.360 --> 03:48.240
First, you said nations in relation to each other are essentially in a state of anarchism.

03:49.280 --> 03:54.000
Well, anarchy basically means the opposite of hierarchy.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.320
Sometimes people think when you're talking about anarchy, you're talking about murder and mayhem,

03:58.320 --> 04:02.240
but that's not what anarchy means in the realist context.

04:02.240 --> 04:05.440
Anarchy simply means that you don't have hierarchy.

04:05.440 --> 04:08.960
There's no higher authority that sits above states.

04:08.960 --> 04:12.880
States are like pool balls on a table, right?

04:12.880 --> 04:22.240
And in an anarchic world, there's no higher authority that you can turn to if you get into trouble.

04:22.240 --> 04:28.160
And of course, the political philosopher who laid this all out was Thomas Hobbes.

04:28.800 --> 04:32.160
And Hobbes talked about life in the state of nature.

04:32.160 --> 04:35.440
And in the state of nature, you have individuals.

04:36.080 --> 04:39.520
And those individuals compete with each other for power.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.600
And the reason that they do is because in the state of nature, by definition,

04:43.600 --> 04:45.200
you have no higher authority.

04:45.760 --> 04:51.360
And Hobbes' view is that the way to get out of this terrible situation

04:51.360 --> 04:57.120
where individuals are competing with each other and even killing each other is to create a state.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.280
It's what he calls the Leviathan.

04:59.280 --> 05:02.640
And that, of course, is the title of his famous book.

05:02.640 --> 05:09.360
So the idea is to escape anarchy, you create a state.

05:09.360 --> 05:12.720
And that means you go from anarchy to hierarchy.

05:13.280 --> 05:18.080
The problem in international politics is that there is no world state.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.840
There is no hierarchy.

05:19.840 --> 05:26.560
And if you have no hierarchy and you're in an anarchic system, you have no choice.

05:26.560 --> 05:32.880
But to try to maximize your relative power, to make sure you are, as we used to say when

05:32.880 --> 05:37.680
I was a kid on New York City playgrounds, the biggest and baddest dude on the block.

05:38.560 --> 05:43.520
Not because you necessarily want to beat up on other kids or on other states,

05:43.520 --> 05:47.520
but because, again, that's the best way to survive.

05:47.520 --> 05:51.920
And as I like to point out to people, the best example of what happens

05:52.000 --> 05:57.280
when you're weak in international politics is what the Chinese call the century of

05:57.280 --> 05:58.480
national humiliation.

05:59.280 --> 06:05.120
From the late 1840s to the late 1940s, the Chinese were remarkably weak.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.080
And the great powers in the system preyed upon them.

06:08.640 --> 06:13.280
And that sends a very important message to not only the Chinese,

06:13.280 --> 06:15.120
but to other states in the system.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.160
Don't be weak.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.440
Be as powerful as you can.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.920
And we'll talk about it, but humiliation can lead to resentment or resentment leads to

06:22.880 --> 06:26.400
something you've also studied, which is Nazi Germany in the 1930s.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.080
We'll talk about it.

06:30.080 --> 06:36.960
But staying to the psychology and philosophy picture, what's the connection

06:36.960 --> 06:42.320
between the will to power in the individual, as you mentioned, and the will to power in a nation?

06:43.280 --> 06:48.000
The will to power in an individual has a lot to do with individual psychology.

06:48.720 --> 06:53.440
The story that I tell about the pursuit of power is a structural argument.

06:53.440 --> 06:57.520
It's an argument that says when you are in a particular structure,

06:58.320 --> 07:05.840
when you're in a system that has a specific architecture, which is anarchy,

07:06.640 --> 07:12.160
the states have no choice but to compete for power.

07:13.120 --> 07:16.640
So structure is really driving the story here.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.920
Will to power has a lot more to do with an individual

07:22.000 --> 07:25.520
in the Nietzschean story where that concept comes from.

07:26.080 --> 07:32.400
So it's very important to understand that I'm not arguing that states are inherently aggressive.

07:33.520 --> 07:40.560
My point is that as long as states are in anarchy, they have no choice

07:41.120 --> 07:43.840
but to behave in an aggressive fashion.

07:44.400 --> 07:51.440
But if you went to a hierarchic system, there's no reason for those states to worry about the

07:51.440 --> 07:52.640
balance of power.

07:52.640 --> 07:57.040
Because if they get into trouble, there is a higher authority that they can turn to.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.800
There is, in effect, the Leviathan.

07:59.520 --> 08:06.000
So what is the role of military might in this will to power on the national level?

08:06.560 --> 08:08.880
Well, military might is what ultimately matters.

08:08.880 --> 08:15.280
As I said to you before, the two building blocks of power are population size and wealth.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.200
You didn't mention military might.

08:17.200 --> 08:17.760
I did not.

08:17.760 --> 08:18.560
No, that's right.

08:18.560 --> 08:23.200
And it's good that you caught that because if you have a large population

08:23.200 --> 08:29.680
and you're a wealthy country, what you do is you build a large military.

08:29.680 --> 08:33.040
And it's ultimately the size of your military that matters

08:34.080 --> 08:36.560
because militaries fight wars.

08:36.560 --> 08:42.400
And if states are concerned about survival, which I argue is the principal goal of every

08:42.400 --> 08:46.720
state in the international system, for what I think are obvious reasons,

08:47.360 --> 08:53.200
then they're going to care about having a powerful military that can protect them

08:53.200 --> 08:55.040
if another state comes after them.

08:55.680 --> 09:00.400
What's not obvious that a large nation with a lot of people and a lot of money

09:00.480 --> 09:06.640
should necessarily build a gigantic army and seek to attain super power,

09:07.520 --> 09:11.040
like dominant sole super power status to military might.

09:11.600 --> 09:16.320
But you're saying as you see the world today, it has to be that way.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.000
Yeah, I'm arguing it is obvious.

09:19.360 --> 09:23.440
If you're a state in the international system, do you want to be weak?

09:24.800 --> 09:28.720
If you live next door to Nazi Germany or Imperial Germany

09:28.720 --> 09:31.760
or Napoleonic France or even the United States,

09:31.760 --> 09:33.840
the United States is a ruthless great power.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.920
You surely recognize that.

09:35.920 --> 09:39.440
And if you're dealing with the United States of America and you're Vladimir Putin,

09:39.440 --> 09:41.920
you want to make sure you're as powerful as possible

09:41.920 --> 09:45.920
so that the United States doesn't put its gun sights on you and come after you.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.600
Same thing is true with China.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.240
You want to be powerful in the international system.

09:50.240 --> 09:53.680
States understand that and they go to great lengths to become powerful.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.240
Just take the United States of America.

09:56.240 --> 10:02.000
When it started in 1783, it was comprised of 13 measly colonies

10:02.000 --> 10:04.240
strung out along the Atlantic seaboard.

10:04.880 --> 10:11.920
Over time, the various leaders of the United States went to great lengths

10:11.920 --> 10:17.120
to turn that country into the dominant power in the Western hemisphere.

10:17.840 --> 10:23.520
And then once that was achieved in 1900, we've gone to great lengths to make sure

10:23.520 --> 10:27.280
that there's no peer competitor in the system.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.080
We just want to make sure that we're number one.

10:33.280 --> 10:37.600
And my argument is that this is not peculiar to the United States.

10:39.360 --> 10:46.080
If I'm China, for example, today, I would want to dominate Asia

10:46.080 --> 10:49.520
the way the United States dominates the Western hemisphere.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.120
They'd be fools not to.

10:51.120 --> 10:55.040
If I were Imperial Germany, I'd want to dominate all of Europe

10:55.040 --> 10:58.320
the way the United States dominates the Western hemisphere.

10:58.320 --> 10:58.560
Why?

10:58.560 --> 11:02.720
Because if you dominate all of Europe, assuming you're Imperial Germany

11:02.720 --> 11:07.920
or Napoleonic France, then no other state in the area or in the region

11:07.920 --> 11:10.480
can threaten you because you're simply so powerful.

11:11.840 --> 11:16.080
And again, what I'm saying here is that the structure of the international system

11:16.080 --> 11:17.440
really matters.

11:17.440 --> 11:22.720
It's the fact that you're in this anarchic system where survival is your principal goal

11:22.720 --> 11:25.600
and where I can't know your intentions.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.480
You're another state.

11:27.040 --> 11:31.040
I can't know that at some point you might not come after me.

11:31.040 --> 11:31.600
You might.

11:32.240 --> 11:36.880
And if you're really powerful and I'm not, I'm in deep trouble.

11:37.600 --> 11:43.440
Yeah, so some of the ideas underlying what you've said, offensive realism,

11:43.440 --> 11:48.560
which I would love to talk to you about sort of the history of realism versus liberalism.

11:48.560 --> 11:53.520
But some of the ideas you already mentioned, anarchy between states,

11:54.880 --> 11:57.520
everybody's trying to develop military capabilities.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.720
Uncertainty, such an interesting concept.

12:01.520 --> 12:05.440
States cannot be sure that other states will not use military capabilities against them.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.120
That's of enormous importance in the story.

12:09.120 --> 12:14.880
And so interesting because you also say that this makes realists more cautious and more peaceful.

12:16.720 --> 12:21.440
The uncertainty, because of all the uncertainty involved here,

12:22.240 --> 12:26.400
it's better to approach international politics with caution.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.960
It's really interesting to think about.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.800
Again, survival, most states interested in survival.

12:32.800 --> 12:36.880
And the other interesting thing is you assume all the states are rational.

12:40.080 --> 12:40.640
Which-

12:40.640 --> 12:41.680
Most of the time.

12:41.680 --> 12:42.480
Most of the time.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.320
You call this framework offensive realism.

12:46.960 --> 12:55.200
Can you just give an overview of the history of the realism versus liberalism debate as worldviews?

12:56.000 --> 13:05.600
Well, I think for many centuries now, the big divide within the world of international relations

13:05.680 --> 13:11.040
theory is between realism and liberalism.

13:11.040 --> 13:15.040
These are time-honored bodies of theory.

13:15.040 --> 13:19.760
And before I tell you what I think the differences are between those two bodies of theory,

13:19.760 --> 13:26.640
it is important to emphasize that there are differences among realists and differences

13:26.640 --> 13:28.000
among liberals.

13:30.400 --> 13:35.120
So when you talk about me as an offensive realist, you should understand that there

13:35.120 --> 13:41.680
are also defensive realists out there, and there are a panoply of liberal theories as well.

13:42.560 --> 13:49.360
But basically realists believe that power matters, that states compete for power,

13:49.920 --> 13:53.920
and that war is an instrument of statecraft.

13:54.640 --> 14:03.680
And liberals, on the other hand, have what I would say is a more idealistic view of the world.

14:05.120 --> 14:11.360
This is not to say that they're naive or foolish, but they believe there are aspects

14:11.360 --> 14:20.960
of international politics that lead to a less competitive and more peaceful world than most

14:20.960 --> 14:22.000
realists see.

14:23.760 --> 14:30.720
And I'll lay out for you very quickly what are the three major liberal theories today

14:31.280 --> 14:38.000
that I think will give you a sense of the more optimistic perspective that is inherent in the

14:38.000 --> 14:39.040
liberal enterprise.

14:40.480 --> 14:45.120
The first and most important of the liberal theories is democratic peace theory.

14:46.080 --> 14:53.120
And this is a theory that says democracies do not fight against other democracies.

14:53.840 --> 14:58.080
So the more the world is populated with democracies,

14:58.080 --> 15:01.840
the less likely it is that we will have wars.

15:02.960 --> 15:08.560
And this basic argument is inherent in Francis Fukuyama's The End of History.

15:08.560 --> 15:15.280
He argues that democracy triumphed first over fascism in the 20th century.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.840
It then triumphed over communism.

15:18.400 --> 15:25.120
And that means that in the future we're going to have more and more liberal democracies on the

15:25.120 --> 15:25.920
planet.

15:25.920 --> 15:30.960
And if you have more and more liberal democracies and those democracies don't fight each other,

15:30.960 --> 15:33.200
then you have a more peaceful world.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.480
That was his argument.

15:34.480 --> 15:36.560
It's a very liberal argument.

15:36.560 --> 15:44.720
A realist like me would say that it doesn't matter whether a state is a democracy or not.

15:45.280 --> 15:51.120
All states behave the same way because the structure of the system, getting back to our

15:51.120 --> 15:56.880
earlier discussion about international anarchy, the structure of the system leaves those states

15:56.880 --> 16:01.760
no choice, whether they're democracies or autocracies.

16:01.760 --> 16:07.360
And again, the liberal view, this first liberal theory, is that democracies don't fight other

16:07.360 --> 16:08.480
democracies.

16:08.480 --> 16:11.920
And therefore, the more democracies you have, the more peaceful the world.

16:11.920 --> 16:15.120
RG Can I just sort of try to unpack that a little bit?

16:15.200 --> 16:22.160
So the democratic peace theory, I guess, would say that in democracies leaders are elected

16:23.120 --> 16:26.720
and the underlying assumption is most people want peace.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.600
And so they will elect peacemakers.

16:29.600 --> 16:33.280
So the more democracies you have, the more likely you have peace.

16:33.280 --> 16:38.720
And then the realist perspective, what says that it doesn't matter if the majority of

16:38.720 --> 16:39.600
people want peace.

16:40.240 --> 16:48.000
The structure of international politics is such that superpowers want to become more

16:48.000 --> 16:49.680
super and powerful.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.960
And they do that through war.

16:50.960 --> 16:56.400
CB You can't make that argument that you're making about democracies because if you're

16:56.400 --> 17:04.080
saying that democracies are inclined toward peace and that the electorate picks leaders

17:04.080 --> 17:11.440
who are inclined towards peace, then you have to show that democracies are in general

17:11.440 --> 17:14.640
more peaceful than non-democracies.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.720
And you can't support that argument.

17:17.280 --> 17:23.200
You can find lots of evidence to support the argument that democracies don't fight

17:23.200 --> 17:24.320
other democracies.

17:25.280 --> 17:30.960
So the argument I believe that you have to make if you're going to support democratic

17:30.960 --> 17:39.600
peace theory, the main argument you have to make is that liberal democracies have a healthy

17:39.600 --> 17:45.840
respect for each other and they can assess each other's intentions.

17:45.840 --> 17:51.600
If you're a liberal democracy and I'm a liberal democracy, we know we have value systems

17:52.400 --> 17:59.360
that argue against aggression and argue for peaceful resolution of crises.

17:59.360 --> 18:03.920
And therefore, given these norms, we can trust each other.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.640
We can know each other's intentions.

18:06.640 --> 18:11.760
Remember, for realists like me, uncertainty about intentions really helps drive the train.

18:12.400 --> 18:18.320
But if you're talking about two democracies, the argument there is that they know each

18:18.320 --> 18:19.360
other's intentions.

18:19.360 --> 18:25.120
CB And for you, sure, maybe democracies reduce uncertainty a little bit, but not enough

18:25.120 --> 18:26.000
to stop the train.

18:26.160 --> 18:27.200
I think that's right.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.640
Yeah, that's right.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.200
So that's democratic peace theory.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.080
The second theory is economic interdependence theory.

18:34.080 --> 18:39.680
And that's the argument that in a globalized world like the one that we live in and have

18:39.680 --> 18:44.000
lived in for a long time, there's a great deal of economic interdependence.

18:44.000 --> 18:50.160
And if you and I are two countries, or if you and me are two countries and we're economically

18:50.160 --> 18:55.920
interdependent and we're both getting prosperous as a result of this economic intercourse,

18:55.920 --> 19:00.720
the last thing that we're going to do is start a war, either one of us, because who would kill

19:00.720 --> 19:02.640
the goose that lays the golden eggs?

19:02.640 --> 19:04.400
It's that kind of argument.

19:04.400 --> 19:08.560
So there you have an argument that economic interdependence leads to peace.

19:09.200 --> 19:14.880
And then the third liberal argument has to do with institutions, sometimes referred to

19:14.880 --> 19:16.720
as liberal institutionalism.

19:16.720 --> 19:24.800
This is the argument that if you can get states into institutions where they become rule-abiding

19:24.800 --> 19:32.800
actors, they will obey the rules that dictate that war is not acceptable.

19:34.160 --> 19:43.680
So if you get them to accept the UN rules on when you can and cannot initiate a war,

19:44.400 --> 19:47.520
then you'll have a more peaceful world.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.520
So those are the liberal theories.

19:50.080 --> 19:56.880
And as you can tell, they're very different from realism as articulated by somebody like me.

19:56.880 --> 20:03.360
Can you maybe argue against the economic interdependence and in the institutions,

20:03.360 --> 20:06.560
that institutions follow rules a little bit?

20:06.640 --> 20:14.560
So the golden goose with the golden egg, you're saying that nations are happy to

20:14.560 --> 20:19.520
kill the goose because, again, they want power?

20:19.520 --> 20:26.640
If they think it's necessary to kill the golden goose because of security concerns,

20:26.640 --> 20:27.440
they will do it.

20:28.080 --> 20:37.680
The point is that economic interdependence at its root has prosperity as the core variable.

20:38.400 --> 20:43.440
In the realist story, the core variable is survival.

20:44.160 --> 20:47.520
And survival always trumps prosperity.

20:48.400 --> 20:54.720
So if you go back to the period before World War I, we're in Europe.

20:54.800 --> 20:58.800
It's 1913 or early 1914.

20:59.520 --> 21:06.800
What you see is that you have an intense security competition between all of the great powers.

21:06.800 --> 21:12.000
On one side, you have the Triple Alliance, and on the other side, you have the Triple Entente.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.720
You have these two alliances, and you have an intense security competition between them.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.760
At the same time, you have a great deal of economic interdependence.

21:21.760 --> 21:27.760
It's amazing how much economic intercourse is taking place in Europe among all the actors.

21:28.800 --> 21:30.080
People are getting prosperous.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.640
Our countries are getting prosperous as a result.

21:33.200 --> 21:41.280
But nevertheless, in the famous July Crisis of 1914, this economic prosperity is unable to

21:41.280 --> 21:46.960
prevent World War I because security concerns or survival is more important.

21:47.920 --> 21:54.160
So there are going to be lots of situations where prosperity and survival

21:54.160 --> 21:55.840
come into conflict.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.480
And in those cases, survival will win.

21:59.280 --> 22:04.720
And maybe you can speak to the different camps of realists.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.800
You said offensive and defensive.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.880
Can you draw a distinction between those two?

22:08.880 --> 22:09.600
Yeah.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.080
Let me just back up a bit on that one.

22:12.080 --> 22:15.680
And you were talking about will to power before.

22:17.200 --> 22:26.080
The first big divide between realists is structural realists and human nature realists.

22:27.680 --> 22:37.040
And Hans Morgenthau, who was influenced by nature and therefore had that will to power logic

22:37.040 --> 22:42.720
embedded in his thinking about how the world works, he was a human nature realist.

22:43.360 --> 22:43.860
Okay.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.480
I'm a structural realist.

22:47.440 --> 22:50.880
And I believe it's not human nature.

22:50.880 --> 22:56.400
It's not individuals and some will to power that drives competition and war.

22:57.120 --> 23:02.160
What drives competition and war is the structure of the system.

23:02.160 --> 23:03.200
It's anarchy.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.680
So you're not as romantic as the human nature realists.

23:06.320 --> 23:06.560
Yeah.

23:06.560 --> 23:09.520
There's just a world of difference between the two.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.160
It's just important to understand that.

23:12.160 --> 23:17.680
So within that, from the structural, there's a subdivision also of offensive and defensive.

23:17.680 --> 23:18.080
Yes.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.880
Inside the structural realist world, right?

23:21.760 --> 23:30.960
And you have a handful of realists who believe that the structure of the system

23:32.240 --> 23:36.080
fosters competition for sure, security competition,

23:36.720 --> 23:42.560
but it really rules out great power war almost all the time.

23:43.440 --> 23:48.640
So it makes sense to care about the balance of power,

23:48.640 --> 23:53.600
but to focus on maintaining how much power you have.

23:53.600 --> 23:58.160
That's the defense of realism, maintaining how much power you have,

23:58.160 --> 24:03.360
not trying to gain more power because the argument the defense of realists make is

24:03.360 --> 24:07.840
that if you try to gain more power, the system will punish you.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.520
The structure will punish you.

24:10.880 --> 24:13.520
I'm not a defensive realist.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.360
I'm an offensive realist.

24:15.360 --> 24:22.000
And my argument is that states look for opportunities to gain more power.

24:22.000 --> 24:28.880
And every time they see or almost every time they see an opportunity to gain more power

24:29.600 --> 24:35.280
and they think the likelihood of success is high and the cost will not be great,

24:35.280 --> 24:37.680
they'll jump at that opportunity.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.560
Just to linger on the human nature perspective,

24:44.160 --> 24:47.200
how do you explain Hitler and Nazi Germany?

24:50.400 --> 24:57.600
Just one of the more recent aggressive expansions through military might.

24:58.240 --> 25:03.200
How do you explain that in the framework of offensive realism?

25:04.480 --> 25:10.800
Well, I think that Nazi Germany was driven in large part by structural considerations.

25:11.520 --> 25:14.240
And I think if you look at Imperial Germany,

25:14.240 --> 25:17.840
which was largely responsible for starting World War I,

25:17.840 --> 25:21.600
and of course Nazi Germany is largely responsible for starting World War II,

25:22.640 --> 25:26.160
what that tells you is you didn't need Adolf Hitler to start World War I.

25:26.960 --> 25:31.360
And I believe that there is a good chance you would have had World War II

25:32.000 --> 25:34.880
in the absence of Hitler.

25:34.880 --> 25:37.600
I believe that Germany was very powerful.

25:37.600 --> 25:41.040
It was deeply worried about the balance of power in Europe.

25:41.040 --> 25:50.400
And it had strong incentives to behave aggressively in the late 1930s, early 1940s.

25:51.040 --> 25:53.840
So I believe that structure mattered.

25:53.920 --> 25:58.240
However, I want to qualify that in the case of Adolf Hitler,

25:58.240 --> 26:02.560
because I do think he had what you would call a will to power.

26:02.560 --> 26:05.600
I've never used that word to describe him before,

26:05.600 --> 26:09.760
but it's consistent with my point that I often make,

26:09.760 --> 26:16.080
that there are two leaders or there have been two leaders in modern history

26:16.080 --> 26:18.000
who are congenital aggressors.

26:19.120 --> 26:22.720
And one was Napoleon and the other was Hitler.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.920
Now, if you want to call that a will to power, you can do that.

26:25.920 --> 26:30.000
I'm more comfortable referring to Hitler as a congenital aggressor

26:30.000 --> 26:33.200
and referring to Napoleon as a congenital aggressor,

26:33.200 --> 26:36.240
although there were important differences between the two,

26:36.240 --> 26:42.560
because Hitler was probably the most murderous leader in recorded history,

26:42.560 --> 26:46.080
and Napoleon was not in that category at all.

26:46.800 --> 26:53.200
But both of them were driven by what you would call a will to power,

26:53.840 --> 27:00.720
and that has to be married to the structural argument in Hitler's case

27:00.720 --> 27:02.240
and also in Napoleon's case.

27:02.240 --> 27:05.440
Is there some degree on the human psychology side

27:05.440 --> 27:10.880
that resentment because of what happened after World War I

27:11.840 --> 27:17.280
led to Hitler wielding so much power and then Hitler starting World War II?

27:17.280 --> 27:18.880
So this is the human side.

27:19.440 --> 27:21.760
Perhaps the reason I asked that question is also

27:21.760 --> 27:24.880
because you mentioned the century of humiliation on the China side.

27:26.000 --> 27:33.040
So to which degree does humiliation lead to Hitler and lead to World War II?

27:33.040 --> 27:37.440
Well, the question of what led to Hitler is a very different question

27:37.440 --> 27:40.000
than the question of what led to World War II.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.520
Once Hitler was in power, I mean, after January 30th, 1933, he's in power,

27:45.520 --> 27:49.760
and then the question of what is driving him comes racing to the fore.

27:51.280 --> 27:56.320
Is there resentment over the Versailles Treaty and what happened to Germany?

27:56.960 --> 27:59.280
Yes. Did that matter? Yes.

27:59.920 --> 28:04.560
But my argument is that structure was the principal factor

28:05.680 --> 28:08.560
driving the train in Hitler's case.

28:08.560 --> 28:13.680
But what I'm saying here is that there were other factors as well.

28:13.680 --> 28:19.040
Resentment being one of the will to power or the fact that he was a congenital aggressor

28:19.040 --> 28:23.520
in my lexicon certainly mattered as well.

28:23.520 --> 28:29.600
So I don't want to dismiss your point about resentment.

28:29.600 --> 28:34.800
So Hitler in particular, the way he wielded, the way he gained so much power

28:34.800 --> 28:40.880
might have been the general resentment of the German populace.

28:41.680 --> 28:49.200
I think that as a result of defeat in World War I and all the trials and tribulations

28:49.200 --> 28:54.880
associated with Weimar Germany and then the coming of the Great Depression,

28:55.680 --> 28:59.840
all of those factors definitely account for his coming to power.

29:00.640 --> 29:10.800
I think that one of the reasons that he was so successful at winning over the German people

29:10.800 --> 29:17.920
once he came to power was because there was a great deal of resentment

29:18.720 --> 29:23.120
in the German body politic, and he played on that resentment.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.280
That surely helped him get elected too.

29:25.280 --> 29:32.000
But I think having studied the case, it was even more important once he took over.

29:32.720 --> 29:40.160
I also believe that one of the principal reasons that he was so popular and he was wildly popular

29:40.160 --> 29:45.520
inside Nazi Germany is because he was the only leader of an industrialized country who pulled

29:45.520 --> 29:54.800
his country out of the Depression, and that really mattered, and it made him very effective.

29:54.800 --> 29:59.120
It's also worth noting that he was a remarkably charismatic individual.

29:59.760 --> 30:03.600
I find that hard to believe because every time I look at him or listen to his speeches,

30:04.400 --> 30:11.520
he does not appear to be charismatic to me, but I've talked to a number of people who are experts

30:11.520 --> 30:16.240
on this subject who assure me that he was very charismatic.

30:16.240 --> 30:20.080
And I would note to you, if you look at public opinion polls in Germany,

30:20.800 --> 30:28.400
in the late 1940s, this is the late 1940s after the Third Reich is destroyed in 1945,

30:28.400 --> 30:31.040
he is still remarkably popular in the polls.

30:31.760 --> 30:35.600
Stalin is still popular in many parts of Eastern Europe.

30:36.160 --> 30:41.520
Yeah, yeah. And Stalin's popular in many quarters inside Russia.

30:43.120 --> 30:49.440
And Stalin murdered more of his own people than he murdered people outside of the Soviet Union.

30:50.240 --> 30:55.440
And still to you, the ties of history turn not on individuals, but on

30:56.000 --> 31:02.640
structural considerations. So Hitler may be a surface layer

31:04.240 --> 31:08.880
characteristics of how Germany started war, but not really the reason.

31:09.680 --> 31:14.400
Well, history is a multi-dimensional phenomenon.

31:14.400 --> 31:14.960
So I hear.

31:15.680 --> 31:21.760
We're talking about interstate relations. And realism is a theory about how states

31:21.760 --> 31:27.360
interact with each other. And there are many other dimensions to international politics.

31:27.360 --> 31:33.120
And if you're talking about someone like Adolf Hitler, why did he start World War II

31:34.160 --> 31:41.440
is a very different question than why did he start the Holocaust or why did he push forward

31:41.440 --> 31:48.640
a Holocaust? I mean, that's a different question and realism doesn't answer that question.

31:48.640 --> 31:54.800
So I want to be very clear that I'm not someone who argues that realism answers every question

31:54.800 --> 32:02.320
about international politics, but it does answer what is one of the big, if not the

32:02.320 --> 32:08.480
biggest questions that IR scholars care about, which is what causes security competition

32:08.480 --> 32:10.640
and what causes great power war.

32:10.640 --> 32:16.880
Does offensive realism answer the question why Hitler attacked the Soviet Union?

32:16.880 --> 32:17.200
Yes.

32:17.840 --> 32:24.800
Because from a military strategy perspective, there's pros and cons to that decision.

32:25.440 --> 32:29.760
Pros and cons to every decision. The question is, did he think that he could win a quick and

32:29.760 --> 32:37.680
decisive victory? And he did, as did his generals. It's very interesting. I've spent a lot of time

32:37.680 --> 32:44.160
studying German decision making in World War II. If you look at the German decision

32:45.520 --> 32:52.880
to invade Poland on September 1st, 1939, and you look at the German decision to invade France on

32:52.880 --> 33:00.160
May 10th, 1940, and then the Soviet Union on June 22nd, 1941, what you see is there was actually

33:00.160 --> 33:07.040
quite a bit of resistance to Hitler in 1938 at the time of Czechoslovakia, Munich.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.800
And there was also quite a bit of resistance in September 1939.

33:13.600 --> 33:14.800
Internally or you mean?

33:14.800 --> 33:21.120
Internally. Internally, for sure. Yeah. People had doubts. They didn't think the Wehrmacht was ready

33:21.120 --> 33:28.800
and given the fact that World War I had just ended about 20 years before the thought of starting

33:28.800 --> 33:34.400
another European war was not especially attractive to lots of German policymakers,

33:34.400 --> 33:43.120
including military leaders. And then came France, 1940. In the run up to May 10th, 1940,

33:43.680 --> 33:54.560
there was huge resistance in the German army to attacking France. But that was eventually eliminated

33:54.560 --> 34:01.760
because they came up with a clever plan, the Manstein plan. If you look at the decision to

34:01.760 --> 34:08.960
invade the Soviet Union on June 22nd, 1941, which is the only case where they fail, they succeeded

34:08.960 --> 34:17.280
in France, they succeeded in Poland, they succeeded at Munich in 1938. Soviet Union is where they fail.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.920
There's hardly any resistance at all. Right?

34:20.880 --> 34:25.760
Well, and to say that they failed the Soviet Union, I mean, my grandfather, I mean, from the

34:25.760 --> 34:31.200
Soviet Union, you know, there was a lot of successes early on. So there's poor military,

34:32.320 --> 34:40.480
I would say, strategic decisions along the way. But it caught Stalin off guard.

34:42.240 --> 34:44.560
Maybe you can correct me, but from my perspective,

34:44.560 --> 34:52.000
if terrifyingly so, they could have been successful if certain different decisions

34:52.000 --> 34:57.520
were made from a military perspective. Yeah, I've always had the sense they

34:57.520 --> 35:03.680
came terrifyingly close to winning. You can make the opposite argument that they were doomed.

35:04.320 --> 35:12.080
But I'm not terribly comfortable making that argument. I think the Wehrmacht by the summer

35:12.080 --> 35:21.840
of 1941 was a finely tuned instrument for war. And the Red Army was in quite terrible shape.

35:22.800 --> 35:30.240
Stalin had purged the officer corps. They had performed poorly in Finland. And

35:31.840 --> 35:36.560
there were all sorts of reasons to think that they were no match for the Wehrmacht.

35:36.560 --> 35:40.560
And if you look at what happened in the initial stages of the conflict,

35:40.560 --> 35:49.440
that proved to be the case. The Germans won a lot of significant tactical victories early on.

35:49.440 --> 35:55.760
And if they focused and went to Moscow as quickly as possible, it's, again, terrifyingly

35:56.560 --> 36:03.600
so could have been a basically topple, topple Stalin. And one thing that-

36:03.600 --> 36:04.480
That's possible.

36:04.480 --> 36:05.120
That's possible.

36:05.120 --> 36:09.840
Fortunately, we're not going to run the experiment again. But one could argue that

36:10.880 --> 36:16.880
had they concentrated, as the generals wanted to do in going straight from Moscow,

36:16.880 --> 36:22.000
that they would have won. I mean, what Hitler wanted to do is he wanted to go into the Ukraine.

36:22.000 --> 36:27.920
I mean, Hitler thought that the main axis, there were three axes. The northern axis went

36:27.920 --> 36:33.600
towards Leningrad. The central axis, of course, went to Moscow. And then the southern axis,

36:33.600 --> 36:41.440
Army Group South, headed towards Ukraine and deep into the Caucasus. And Hitler believed that

36:42.160 --> 36:48.800
that should have been the main axis. And in fact, in 1942, the Soviets, excuse me,

36:48.800 --> 36:55.920
the Germans go back on the offensive in 1942. This is Operation Blue. And the main axis in

36:55.920 --> 37:02.800
1942 is deep into the Ukraine and into the Caucasus. And that fails. But one could argue

37:02.800 --> 37:10.240
that had they done that in 41, had they not gone to Moscow, had they concentrated on going

37:10.240 --> 37:15.360
deep into Ukraine and into the Caucasus, they could have knocked the Soviets out that way.

37:16.880 --> 37:23.120
I'm not sure that in the end, I believe that. I think in the end, the Soviets would have won

37:23.120 --> 37:27.680
no matter what. But I'm not 100% sure of that.

37:28.240 --> 37:35.280
So sometimes, maybe you can educate me. But sometimes, you know, they say,

37:35.840 --> 37:42.720
just like with Napoleon, Winter defeated Hitler in Russia. I think not often enough people tell

37:42.720 --> 37:51.760
the story of the soldiers and the motivation and how hard they fight. So it turns out that

37:51.760 --> 37:56.560
Ukrainians and Russians are not easy to conquer. They're the kinds of people that

37:57.680 --> 38:05.040
don't roll over and fight bravely. There seems to be a difference in certain peoples in how

38:05.040 --> 38:09.920
they see war, how they approach war, how proud they are to fight for their country, to die for

38:09.920 --> 38:15.040
their country, these kinds of things. So I think Battle of Stalingrad tells, at least to me,

38:15.040 --> 38:22.400
a story of extremely brave fighting on the Soviet side. And that's a component of war too.

38:22.960 --> 38:29.520
It's not just structural. It's not just military strategy. It's also the humans involved.

38:30.400 --> 38:35.760
But maybe that's a romantic notion of war. No, I think there's a great deal of truth in that. But

38:36.560 --> 38:44.400
let's just unpack it a bit in the case of the Soviet Union in World War II. The counter argument

38:44.480 --> 38:52.080
to that is that in World War I, the Russian army disintegrated.

38:54.800 --> 39:01.760
If you look at what happened when Napoleon invaded in 1812, and you look at what happened

39:01.760 --> 39:09.680
in 1917, and then you look at what happened between 1941 and 1945, the Napoleon case looks

39:09.680 --> 39:16.080
a lot like the Hitler case, and it fits neatly with your argument. But World War I does not fit

39:16.080 --> 39:23.200
neatly with your argument because the Russians lost and surrendered. And you had the infamous

39:23.200 --> 39:28.880
Treaty of Brest-Litovsk where the Soviet Union then, because it went from Russia to the Soviet

39:28.880 --> 39:36.560
Union in October 1917, the Soviet Union surrendered large amounts of Soviet territory because it had

39:36.560 --> 39:42.160
suffered a humiliating defeat. My argument for why the Russians, let me take that back,

39:42.160 --> 39:48.960
why the Soviets fought like wild dogs in World War II is that they were up against the genocidal

39:48.960 --> 39:57.520
adversary. You want to understand that the Germans murdered huge numbers of Soviet POWs.

39:58.480 --> 40:08.240
The overall total was 3.7 million. And by December of 1941, remember the invasion is June 41,

40:08.240 --> 40:15.280
by December of 1941, the Germans have murdered 2 million Soviet POWs. At that point in time,

40:15.280 --> 40:21.920
they had murdered many more POWs than they had murdered Jews. And this is not to deny for one

40:21.920 --> 40:27.200
second that they were on a murderous rampage when it came to Jews. But they were also on

40:27.200 --> 40:36.000
a murderous rampage when it came to Soviet citizens and Soviet soldiers. So those Soviet

40:36.000 --> 40:42.240
soldiers quickly came to understand that they were fighting for their lives. If they were

40:42.240 --> 40:47.360
taken prisoner, they would die. So they fought like wild dogs.

40:48.000 --> 40:54.400
Yeah, you know, the story of the Holocaust with the six million Jews is often told extensively.

40:54.400 --> 41:02.240
If Hitler won, conquered the Soviet Union, it's terrifying to think on a much grander

41:02.240 --> 41:07.920
scale than the Holocaust. What would have happened to the Slavic people, to the Soviet people?

41:08.640 --> 41:14.160
Absolutely. All you have to do is read the hunger plan, right? And they also had a plan,

41:15.120 --> 41:25.040
I forget the exact name of it, which made it clear that they were going to murder many tens

41:25.040 --> 41:30.640
of millions of people. And by the way, I believe that they would have murdered all the Poles

41:30.640 --> 41:37.200
and all the Roma. I mean, my view is that the Jews were number one on the genocidal hit list,

41:37.200 --> 41:43.360
the Roma or the gypsies were number two, and the Poles were number three. And of course,

41:43.360 --> 41:48.800
I just explained to you how many POWs they had killed. So they would have ended up murdering

41:48.800 --> 41:56.480
huge numbers of Soviet citizens as well. But people quickly figured out that this was happening.

41:57.120 --> 42:02.800
That's my point to you. And that gave them, needless to say, very powerful incentives to

42:02.800 --> 42:08.480
fight hard against the Germans and to make sure that they did not win.

42:09.440 --> 42:13.600
To fast forward in time, but not in space.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.200
Let me ask you about the war in Ukraine.

42:21.760 --> 42:29.440
Why did Russia invade Ukraine on February 24, 2022? What are some of the explanations given

42:29.440 --> 42:32.320
and which do you find the most convincing?

42:33.120 --> 42:40.160
Well, clearly, the conventional wisdom is that Putin is principally responsible. Putin is an

42:40.160 --> 42:44.480
imperialist. He's an expansionist. That's the conventional thinking.

42:44.480 --> 42:54.160
Yeah. Yeah. And the idea is that he is bent on creating a greater Russia. And even more so,

42:54.240 --> 43:02.640
he's interested in dominating Eastern Europe, if not all of Europe. And that Ukraine was the first

43:02.640 --> 43:10.960
stop on the train line. And what he wanted to do was to conquer all of Ukraine, incorporate it into

43:10.960 --> 43:17.360
a greater Russia, and then he would move on and conquer other countries. This is the conventional

43:17.360 --> 43:25.520
wisdom. My view is there is no evidence, let me emphasize, zero evidence to support that argument.

43:26.240 --> 43:33.280
Which part that he would, the imperialist part, the sense that he sought to conquer

43:33.280 --> 43:38.240
all of Ukraine and move on and conquer? There's no evidence he was interested

43:38.240 --> 43:45.760
in conquering all of Ukraine. There's no evidence beforehand that he was interested in conquering

43:45.760 --> 43:54.400
any of Ukraine. And there's no way that an army that had 190,000 troops at the most

43:56.240 --> 44:01.040
could have conquered all of Ukraine. Just impossible. As I like to emphasize,

44:01.040 --> 44:07.040
when the Germans went into Poland in 1939, and the Germans, you want to remember,

44:07.040 --> 44:11.920
were only intent on conquering the western half of Poland because the Soviets

44:12.880 --> 44:17.360
who came in later that month were going to conquer the eastern half of Poland.

44:18.000 --> 44:26.400
So the western half of Poland is much smaller than Ukraine. And the Germans went in with 1.5

44:26.400 --> 44:35.120
million troops. If Vladimir Putin were bent on conquering all of Ukraine, he would have needed

44:35.120 --> 44:40.480
at least 2 million troops. I would argue he'd need 3 million troops because not only do you need

44:40.480 --> 44:47.440
to conquer the country, you then have to occupy it. But the idea that 190,000 troops was sufficient

44:47.440 --> 44:52.720
for conquering all of Ukraine is not a serious argument. Furthermore, he was not interested

44:52.720 --> 45:00.320
in conquering Ukraine. And that's why in March 2022, this is immediately after the war starts,

45:00.880 --> 45:09.040
he is negotiating with Zelensky to end the war. There are serious negotiations taking place

45:09.040 --> 45:15.200
in Istanbul involving the Turks, and Naftali Bennett, who was the Israeli Prime Minister at

45:15.200 --> 45:21.520
the time, was deeply involved in negotiating with both Putin and Zelensky to end the war.

45:22.400 --> 45:29.040
Well, if he was interested, Putin, in conquering all of Ukraine, why in God's name would he be

45:29.040 --> 45:35.680
negotiating with Zelensky to end the war? And of course, what they were negotiating about was

45:35.680 --> 45:40.240
NATO expansion into Ukraine, which was the principal cause of the war.

45:41.680 --> 45:46.800
People in the West don't want to hear that argument because if it is true, which it is,

45:47.360 --> 45:52.560
then the West is principally responsible for this bloodbath that's now taking place.

45:52.560 --> 45:57.760
And of course, the West doesn't want to be principally responsible. It wants to blame

45:57.760 --> 46:04.400
Vladimir Putin. So we've invented this story out of whole cloth that he is an aggressor,

46:04.400 --> 46:09.840
that he's the second coming of Adolf Hitler, and that what he did in Ukraine was try to

46:10.800 --> 46:17.040
conquer all of it. And he failed, but with a little bit of luck, he probably would have

46:17.040 --> 46:24.240
conquered all of it, and he'd now be in the Baltic states and eventually end up dominating

46:24.240 --> 46:28.240
all of Eastern Europe. As I said, I think there's no evidence to support this.

46:28.800 --> 46:33.840
So maybe there's a lot of things to ask there. Maybe just to linger on NATO expansion.

46:35.600 --> 46:41.280
What is NATO expansion? What is the threat of NATO expansion and why is it such a concern for Russia?

46:42.720 --> 46:50.320
NATO was a mortal enemy of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It's a military alliance

46:50.960 --> 46:56.240
which has at its heart the United States of America, which is the most powerful state on

46:56.240 --> 47:06.080
the planet. It is perfectly understandable that Russia is not going to want that military alliance

47:06.080 --> 47:11.040
on its doorstep. Here in the United States, we have, as you well know, what's called the

47:11.040 --> 47:18.240
Monroe Doctrine. And that basically says no great powers from Europe or Asia are allowed to come

47:18.240 --> 47:23.360
into our neighborhood and form a military alliance with anybody in this neighborhood.

47:24.160 --> 47:28.720
When I was young, there was this thing called the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Soviets had the

47:28.720 --> 47:35.200
audacity to put nuclear-armed missiles in Cuba. We told them in no uncertain terms that that was not

47:35.200 --> 47:42.320
acceptable and that those missiles had to be removed. This is our backyard and we do not tolerate

47:42.320 --> 47:47.760
distant great powers coming into our neighborhood. Well, what's good for the goose is good for the

47:47.760 --> 47:55.200
gander. And if we don't like great powers coming into our neighborhood, it's hardly surprising

47:55.200 --> 48:01.760
that the Russians did not want NATO on their doorstep. They made that manifestly clear

48:03.840 --> 48:11.360
when the Cold War ended and they exacted a promise from us that we would not expand NATO.

48:11.360 --> 48:17.920
And then when we started expanding NATO, they made it clear after the first tranche in 1999

48:17.920 --> 48:25.200
that they were profoundly unhappy with that. They made it clear in 2004 after the second tranche

48:25.200 --> 48:32.960
that they were profoundly unhappy with that expansion. And then in April 2008, when NATO

48:32.960 --> 48:40.320
announced that Ukraine and Georgia would become part of NATO, they made it unequivocally clear,

48:40.320 --> 48:46.400
not just Putin, that that was not going to happen. They were drawing a red line in the sand.

48:46.400 --> 48:54.160
And it is no accident that in August 2008, remember the Bucharest Summit is April 2008,

48:54.160 --> 49:01.440
in August 2008, you had a war between Georgia and Russia and that involved at its core NATO expansion.

49:02.240 --> 49:11.760
So the Americans and their allies should have understood by at least August 2008 that continuing

49:11.760 --> 49:18.960
to push to bring Ukraine into NATO was going to lead to disaster. And I would note that there were

49:18.960 --> 49:24.960
all sorts of people in the 1990s, like George Kennan, William Perry, who was Bill Clinton's

49:24.960 --> 49:30.480
Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Paul Netza, and so forth and so

49:30.480 --> 49:37.360
on, who argued that NATO expansion would end up producing a disaster, which it has.

49:38.000 --> 49:48.080
I would note that at the famous April 2008 Bucharest Summit, where NATO said that Ukraine

49:48.080 --> 49:55.040
would be brought into the alliance, Angela Merkel and Nicholas Sarkozy, the German and French

49:55.040 --> 50:02.560
leaders respectively, opposed that decision. Angela Merkel later said that the reason she

50:02.560 --> 50:09.200
opposed it was because she understood that Putin would interpret it as a declaration of war.

50:09.200 --> 50:16.880
Just think about that. Merkel is telling you that she opposed NATO expansion into Ukraine because

50:16.880 --> 50:23.520
she understood correctly that Putin would see it as a declaration of war. What did the United States

50:23.520 --> 50:30.000
and its friends in Europe do? They continued to push and push because we thought that we could

50:30.000 --> 50:38.000
push NATO expansion down their throat after 2008, the same way we did in 1999 and 2004.

50:38.000 --> 50:45.760
But we were wrong, and it all blew up in our face in 2014. And when it blew up in our face in 2014,

50:45.760 --> 50:52.240
what did we do? Did we back off and say, well, maybe the Russians have some legitimate security

50:52.240 --> 50:59.280
interests? No, that's not the way we operate. We continued to double down. And the end result is

50:59.280 --> 51:08.320
that in 2022, you got a war. And as I've argued for a long time now, we, the West, are principally

51:08.320 --> 51:15.120
responsible for that, not Vladimir Putin. So the expansion of NATO is primarily responsible.

51:15.120 --> 51:21.520
Yeah. To put it in more general terms, what we were trying to do was turn Ukraine into a

51:21.520 --> 51:28.720
Western bulwark on Russia's border. And it really wasn't NATO expansion alone. NATO expansion was

51:28.720 --> 51:34.160
the most important element of our strategy. But the strategy had two other dimensions.

51:34.720 --> 51:42.240
One was EU expansion, and the third was the color revolution. We were trying to force

51:42.240 --> 51:50.320
orange revolution in Ukraine. And the basic goal there was to turn Ukraine into a pro-Western

51:50.320 --> 51:57.280
liberal democracy. And that meant that you'd have Ukraine, if it worked, as a pro-Western

51:57.280 --> 52:06.160
liberal democracy that was in the EU and that was in NATO. This was our goal. And the Russians made

52:06.160 --> 52:11.920
it unequivocally clear Ukraine was not going to become a Western bulwark on their border.

52:11.920 --> 52:18.800
And most importantly, they made it clear that Ukraine in NATO was unacceptable.

52:19.520 --> 52:25.760
Can we talk about the mind of Vladimir Putin? You've mentioned that this idea that he has

52:25.760 --> 52:35.840
aspirations for imperialist conquest, that he dreams of empire is not grounded in reality.

52:36.480 --> 52:44.080
He wrote an essay in 2021 about one people. Do you think there is some degree to which

52:44.080 --> 52:48.960
he still dreams of the former Soviet Union reuniting?

52:50.000 --> 52:59.120
No. He's made it clear that anybody with a triple-digit IQ understands that it's nuts

52:59.120 --> 53:05.040
to think about recreating the Soviet Union. He thinks it's a tragedy that the Soviet Union

53:05.040 --> 53:13.040
fell apart. But as he made clear in that essay, the July 12, 2021 essay, and as he made clear

53:13.040 --> 53:23.840
in speeches immediately before he invaded Ukraine, he accepted the breakup of the Soviet Union and he

53:23.840 --> 53:31.520
accepted the status quo in Europe, save for the fact he did not accept the idea that Ukraine would

53:31.520 --> 53:38.560
become part of NATO. He's been in power for over two decades. Is there a degree that power can affect

53:39.840 --> 53:41.920
a leader's ability to see the world clearly?

53:43.200 --> 53:52.000
As they say, corrupt. Do you think power has corrupted Vladimir Putin to a degree?

53:52.800 --> 53:59.440
It's very hard for me to answer that question because I don't know him and I've not studied

53:59.440 --> 54:08.560
him carefully in terms of his overall performance over the course of the 23 years that he's been

54:08.560 --> 54:18.080
in power. I've studied him as a strategist and I've studied how he deals with the West

54:19.360 --> 54:30.640
and deals with the international system more generally since 2014. I think he is a first-class

54:30.640 --> 54:37.600
strategist. This is not to say he doesn't make mistakes and he admits he's made some mistakes.

54:39.520 --> 54:45.280
But I think that the West is dealing with a formidable adversary here

54:46.560 --> 54:54.560
and I don't see any evidence that he's either lost speed off his fastball or that power has

54:54.560 --> 55:04.000
corrupted his thinking about strategic affairs. So he has consistently put as a primary concern

55:04.640 --> 55:09.760
security as does the United States. He's put for Russia's security,

55:09.760 --> 55:12.480
making sure that NATO doesn't get close to its borders.

55:12.480 --> 55:19.680
I think that's clear, yeah. I think as I emphasized early on in our conversation

55:19.680 --> 55:27.840
that leaders privilege security or survival over everything else. By the way, he gave a number of

55:27.840 --> 55:36.320
talks and press conferences in addition to writing that famous article that you referred

55:36.320 --> 55:45.360
to on July 12, 2021. So we have a pretty clear record of what he was saying and I would argue

55:45.360 --> 55:53.680
what he was thinking in the run-up to the war in February 2022. If you read what he said,

55:53.680 --> 56:00.640
it's quite clear that he privileged security or survival. He was deeply concerned about the

56:00.640 --> 56:07.840
security of Russia. Russia is a quite vulnerable state in a lot of ways, especially if you think

56:07.840 --> 56:14.480
back to what it looked like in the 1990s. You know better than I do. It was in terrible shape.

56:15.520 --> 56:20.640
The Chinese talk about the century of national humiliation. One could argue that for the Russians

56:20.640 --> 56:28.160
that was the decade of national humiliation. It took Putin, I think, quite a bit of time to

56:28.160 --> 56:34.240
bring the Russians back from the dead. I think he eventually succeeded, but it took a considerable

56:34.240 --> 56:40.480
amount of time. I think he understood that he was not playing a particularly strong hand. He was

56:40.480 --> 56:46.640
playing something of a weak hand and he had to be very careful, very cautious, and I think he was.

56:47.360 --> 56:53.040
And I think that's very different than the United States. The United States was the

56:53.040 --> 56:57.360
Unipol. It was the most powerful state in the history of the world. The most powerful state

56:57.360 --> 57:06.160
relative to all its possible competitors from, you know, roughly 1989, certainly after December 1991

57:06.160 --> 57:12.720
when the Soviet Union fell apart, up until I would argue about 2017. We were incredibly powerful and

57:12.720 --> 57:19.040
even after 2017 up to today the United States remains the most powerful state in the system

57:19.040 --> 57:29.600
and because of our geographical location we are in a terrific situation to survive in any

57:29.600 --> 57:37.200
great power competition. So you have a situation involving the United States that's different than

57:37.200 --> 57:44.640
the situation involving Russia. They're just much more vulnerable than we are and therefore

57:44.640 --> 57:50.800
I think Putin tends to be more sensitive about security than any American president in recent

57:50.800 --> 57:57.200
times. Europe on one side, China on the other side. It's a complicated situation. Yeah and we

57:57.200 --> 58:04.240
talked before about 1812 when Napoleon invaded and Moscow got burned to the ground. We talked

58:04.240 --> 58:11.040
about World War I where the Russians were actually defeated and surrendered and then we

58:11.040 --> 58:23.440
talked about 1941 to 1945 where although thankfully the Soviets prevailed it was a close call and

58:24.080 --> 58:31.680
I mean the casualties, the destruction that the Soviet Union had inflicted on it by the Germans

58:31.680 --> 58:41.680
is just almost almost hard to believe. So they are sensitive. You can understand full well or

58:41.680 --> 58:47.120
at least you should be able to understand full well why the idea of bringing Ukraine up to their

58:47.120 --> 58:53.600
border really spooked them. I don't understand why more Americans don't understand that. It just

58:53.600 --> 58:58.640
it befuddles me. I think it has to do with the fact that Americans are not very good at putting

58:58.640 --> 59:05.200
themselves in the shoes of other countries and you really if you're going to be a first-class

59:05.200 --> 59:09.520
strategist in international politics you have to be able to do that. You have to put yourself in

59:09.520 --> 59:16.000
the shoes of the other side and think about how they think so you don't make foolish mistakes.

59:16.000 --> 59:23.120
And as a starting point Americans tend to see themselves as the good guys and a set of others

59:23.200 --> 59:28.720
as the bad guys and you have to be able to empathize that Russians think of themselves

59:28.720 --> 59:35.600
as the good guys, the Chinese think of themselves as the good guys and just be able to empathize

59:35.600 --> 59:43.200
if they are the good guys. It's like that funny skit, are we the baddies? Consider the United

59:43.200 --> 59:49.760
States could be the bad guys. First of all see the world if the United States is the bad guys

59:49.760 --> 59:55.680
and China is the good guys. What does that world look like? Be able to just exist with that thought

59:55.680 --> 01:00:02.080
because that is what the Chinese leadership and many Chinese citizens if not now maybe in the

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:08.160
future will believe and you have to kind of do the calculation the simulation forward from that

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:15.120
and same with Russia same with with other nations. Yeah I agree with you 100% and just you know I

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:21.440
always think of Michael McFaul at Stanford who was the American ambassador to Russia I think

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:32.720
between 2012 and 2014 and he told me that he told Putin that Putin didn't have to worry about NATO

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:42.080
expansion because the United States was a benign hegemon and I asked Mike what Putin's response was

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:52.640
to that and Mike said that Putin didn't believe it but Mike believed that he should believe it

01:00:52.640 --> 01:01:00.160
and that we could move NATO eastward to include Ukraine and in the end we'd get away with it

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:08.160
because we are a benign hegemon but the fact is that's not what Putin saw. Putin saw us as a malign

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:15.280
hegemon and what Mike thinks or any American thinks doesn't matter what matters is what Putin

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:22.080
thinks. But also the drums of war have been beating for some reason NATO expansion has been

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:29.440
threatened for some reason so you've talked about NATO expansion being dead so like it doesn't make

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:36.080
sense from a geopolitical political perspective on the Europe side to expand NATO but nevertheless

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:46.160
that threat has been echoed so why has NATO expansion been pushed from your perspective?

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:53.760
There are two reasons one is first of all we thought it was a wonderful thing to bring more

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:59.760
and more countries into NATO we thought that it facilitated peace and prosperity it was ultimately

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:11.520
all for the good and we also thought that countries like Ukraine had a right

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:16.480
to join NATO these are sovereign countries that can decide for themselves and the Russians have

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:25.600
no say in what Ukraine wants to do and then finally and this is a point I emphasized before

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:31.440
we were very powerful and we thought we could shove it down their throat so it's a combination

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:38.240
of those factors that led us to pursue what I think was ultimately a foolish policy.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:46.480
We've talked about how wars get started how do you hope the war in Ukraine ends what are the ways to

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:55.520
end this war what are the ways to achieve peace there to end the I would say senseless

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:02.400
death of young men as always happens in war?

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:12.720
I'm sad to say I don't have a good answer to that I don't think there's any real prospect

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:19.360
of a meaningful peace agreement I think it's almost impossible I think the best you can hope

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:29.200
for at this point is it's some point the shooting stops you have a ceasefire and then you have a

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:40.080
frozen conflict and that frozen conflict will not be highly stable and the Ukrainians in the west

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:46.880
will do everything they can to weaken Russia's position and the Russians will go to great lengths

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:54.000
to not only damage that dysfunctional rump state that Ukraine becomes but the Russians

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.720
will go to great lengths to sow dissension within the alliance and that includes in terms of

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:08.240
transatlantic relations so you'll have this continuing security competition between Russia

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:12.720
on one side and Ukraine in the west on the other even when you get a frozen peace

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:21.120
and or you get a frozen conflict and the potential for escalation there will be great

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:31.120
so I think this is a disaster. That's a very realist perspective let me ask you sort of

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:39.920
a the human side of it do you think there's some power to leaders sitting down having a

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:47.840
conversation man to man leader to leader about this there's there is just a lot of death happening

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:53.920
it seems that from an economic perspective from a historic perspective from a human perspective

01:04:53.920 --> 01:05:00.480
both nations are losing is it possible for Vladimir Zelensky and Vladimir Putin to sit down

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:12.000
and talk and to figure out a way where the security concerns are addressed and both nations can

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:19.520
minimize the amount of suffering that's happening and and and create a path towards future flourishing

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:27.680
I think the answer is no even with the United States involved three people in the room

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:33.200
well I think if the United States is involved the answer is definitely no you have to get

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:41.280
the Americans out and then I think if you have Zelensky and Putin talking you know you have a

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:48.400
sliver of a chance there the Americans are a real problem look let's go back to what happens right

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:55.600
after the war starts okay as I said before this is we're talking March early April of 2022 the

01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:05.760
war starts on February 24th 2022 and as I said to you the two sides were negotiating in Istanbul

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:12.480
and they were also negotiating through Naftali Bennett and the Bennett track and the Turkish

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:19.600
track were operating together I mean they were not at cross purposes at all what happened

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:27.840
and Bennett tells the story very clearly that they had made significant progress

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:35.760
in reaching an agreement this is Zelensky on one side and Putin on the other Bennett is talking

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:46.560
in person to both Putin and Zelensky and what happens to produce failure the answer is the

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:52.640
United States and Britain get involved and tells Zelensky to walk they tell Zelensky to walk

01:06:53.440 --> 01:07:00.000
if they had come in and encouraged Zelensky to try to figure out a way with Putin to shut this one

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.760
down and worked with Bennett and worked with Erdogan we might have been able to shut the war

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:12.880
down then but it was the United States well let me sort of push back on that you're you're correct

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:20.320
but sort of United States paints this like picture that everybody's aligned so I maybe

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:23.920
you can correct me but I believe in the power of individuals especially individual leaders

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:33.120
again whether it's Biden or Trump or whoever goes into a room and says in a way that's convincing

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:39.200
that no more NATO expansion and actually just on a basic human level

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:46.400
ask the question of why are we doing all this senseless killing

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:54.000
and look at the interest of one Russia look at the interest of the other Ukraine their interests

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.600
are pretty simple and say the United States is going to stay out of this we're not going to

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:05.280
expand NATO and say all that in a way that's convincing which is NATO expansion is silly at

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:13.280
this point China is the big threat we're not going to do this kind of conflict escalation

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:19.840
with Russia the Cold War is over let's let's normalize relations

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:28.640
let me just embellish your argument okay thank you I need it if we say there's a sliver of a

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:34.000
chance that you can do this and I do think there is a sliver of a chance let me just embellish

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.440
your point thank you need all the help I can get two things have to be done here in my opinion

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:52.160
one is Ukraine has to become neutral and it has to completely sever all security ties with the West

01:08:52.960 --> 01:09:01.600
right it's not like you can say we're not going to expand NATO to include Ukraine but we're going

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:09.200
to continue to have some loose security arrangement with Ukraine none of that has to be completely

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:17.840
severed Ukraine has to be on its own okay and number two Ukraine has to accept the fact that

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:24.960
the Russians are going to keep the four oblasts that they've now annexed and Crimea right the

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:31.760
Russians are not going to give them back and what you really want to do if you're Zelensky or

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:37.440
who's ever running Ukraine in this scenario that we're positing is you want to make sure the

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:46.240
Russians don't take another four oblasts to include Kharkiv and Odessa right if I'm playing

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:52.880
Putin's hand and this war goes on I'm thinking about taking four more oblasts I want to take

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:59.840
about 43 percent of Ukraine and annex it to Russia right and I certainly want Odessa

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:07.200
and I certainly want Kharkiv and I want the two oblasts in between as well literally or as

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:16.080
leverage and negotiation no I want them literally I want to conquer them literally

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:26.160
but my point to you is if we can begin to talk about cutting a deal now you may be able to head

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:33.840
that kind of aggression off at the pass in other words you may be able to limit Putin and Russia

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:39.840
to annexing the four oblasts that they've now annexed plus Crimea that's the best I think you

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:45.200
can hope for but the point is you have to get the Ukrainians to accept that you have to get the

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:52.240
Ukrainians to accept becoming a truly neutral state and conceding that the Russians keep a big

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:57.040
chunk of territory it's about 23 percent of Ukrainian territory that they've annexed

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.800
and I find it hard to imagine any Ukrainian leader agreeing to that well there there there could be

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:11.440
more nuanced things like no military involvement between the United States and Ukraine but economic

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:18.800
involvement sort of financial support so normalizing economic relationships with Ukraine

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:24.640
with Russia I think you could probably get away with that I think that the tricky question there

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:31.360
that you would have to answer is what about EU expansion right and I think EU expansion is

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:37.360
probably a no-no for the Russians because most people don't recognize this but there is a military

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:47.360
dimension built into EU expansion it's not purely an economic alliance or relationship

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:51.920
or institution whatever word you want to use there's a military dimension to that

01:11:52.480 --> 01:12:00.480
and in the run-up to the war actually in the run-up to the 2014 crisis when it first broke out

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:10.400
uh the Russians made it clear they saw EU expansion as a stalking horse for NATO expansion

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:18.080
so EU expansion is tricky but I I think your point of close economic relations between

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:26.800
or healthy economic relations to use a better term between Ukraine and the west is possible

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:32.960
I think the Russians have a vested interest in if it's a neutral Ukraine they have a vested

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:38.640
interest in that Ukraine flourishing but that then brings us back to the territorial issue

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:46.640
well so do you believe it's possible for individual human relations to counteract the structural

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:54.400
forces that you talk about so meaning the leaders being able to pick up the phone and make agreements

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:59.360
that are good for humanity as a whole and for their individual nations in the long term I think

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:08.640
leadership matters here I mean one of the real problems here is that there's no trust and on

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:18.080
the Russian side and that has to do with the Minsk agreements the the Minsk agreements which

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:26.320
were designed to shut down the civil war in eastern Ukraine in the Donbass

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:35.040
really mattered to the Russians and there were four players involved in the the Minsk process

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:43.040
four main players Russia and Ukraine of course and then Germany and France and I believe the

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:49.520
Russians took the Minsk Accords seriously I believe Putin took them very seriously he wanted to shut

01:13:49.520 --> 01:14:00.640
down that conflict and Angela Merkel Francois Hollande he was the French leader and Poroshenko

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:07.040
who was the Ukrainian leader those were the three key players besides Putin again Hollande from

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:15.840
France Merkel from Germany and Poroshenko from Ukraine have all explicitly said they were not

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:23.200
seriously interested in reaching an agreement in all of the discussions with Putin they were

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:30.320
bamboozling him they were trying to trick him so that they would buy time to build up Ukraine's

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:41.040
military Putin is profoundly upset about these admissions by these three leaders he believes he

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:48.560
was fooled into thinking that Minsk could work he believes that he negotiated in good faith and they

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:57.920
did not and he believes that the level of trust now between Russia and the West is virtually zero

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:05.360
as a result of this experience over Minsk I only bring this up because it cuts against your

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:13.520
argument that leaders could pick up the phone and talk to each other and trust each other at least

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:23.280
somewhat to work out a meaningful deal if you're Putin at this point in time trusting the West is

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:29.360
not an idea that's going to be very attractive at all in fact you're going to distrust anything

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:35.920
they say yeah distrust anything the West say but there is individual humans the way human nature

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:41.280
works is when you're sitting across from a person you can trust a human being while still distrusting

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:47.280
the West I mean I believe in the power of that I think with the right leaders you can sit down

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:54.080
and talk like over override the general structural distrust of the West

01:15:55.040 --> 01:16:03.760
and say you know what I like this guy or gal whatever I do hope Zelensky and Putin sit down

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:11.760
together and talk have multiple talks just remember they were doing that in March and the Americans

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:17.600
came in and the British came in yeah and they scotched a potential deal well

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:23.200
the other beautiful thing about human nature there's forgiveness and there's

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:33.280
trying again when you're the leader of a country in an anarchic system you have to be very careful

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:43.200
not to let your trust in a foreign leader take you too far because if that foreign leader betrays you

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:49.120
or betrays your trust and stab you in the back you could die and again you want to remember that the

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:56.160
principal responsibility of any leader I don't care what country it is is to ensure the survival

01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:01.920
of their state and that means that you know trust is only going to buy you so much

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:10.800
and when you've already betrayed the trust of a leader you really are not going to be able to

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:18.000
rely on trust very much to help you moving forward now you disagree with that I hope you're right and

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:25.440
if they can shut down the Ukraine-Russia war it would be wonderful if I'm proved

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:33.440
dead wrong that would be wonderful news my my prediction that this war is going to go on for

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:44.080
a long time and an end in an ugly way is a prediction that I don't like at all so I hope

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:49.280
I'm wrong you wrote that many in the west believe that the best hope for ending the Ukraine wars to

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:58.640
remove Vladimir Putin from power but you argue that this isn't the case can you explain well

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:07.200
a lot of people thought when they were having all that trouble the Russians were having all

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:14.480
that trouble with Pugosian and the Wagner group that Putin was vulnerable and was likely to be

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:24.880
overthrown and what would happen is a peace-loving leader would replace Putin I made two points at

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:33.120
the time and I would make those same two points now number one he's not likely to be overthrown

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:41.440
he was not likely then to be overthrown and I think you know as long as his health

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:48.960
holds up I think he will remain in power my second point is if he doesn't remain in power

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:55.440
and he's replaced I would bet a lot of money that his replacement will be more hawkish and more

01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:04.000
hardline than Putin is I actually think one could argue that Putin was too trusting of the west

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:12.160
before the war started and number two I think one could argue that he has not waged the war

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:22.320
against Ukraine as vigorously as one might have expected he was slow to mobilize the nation for

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:33.680
war and he has pursued a limited war in all sorts of ways the Israelis for example have killed more

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:43.120
civilians in Gaza in one month than the Russians have killed over 18 months in Ukraine the idea

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:50.720
that Vladimir Putin is waging a punishment campaign and killing on purpose large numbers of civilians

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:59.120
is simply not true all this is to say that I would imagine that if Putin leaves office

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:06.080
and someone else comes in to replace him that someone else will be at least if not more hardline

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:12.480
than him in terms of waging the war and certainly will not trust the west any more than he has

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:21.360
this by way of advice let me ask you if I were to have a conversation interview Vladimir Putin

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:32.000
and Zelensky individually what should I ask them if you me and Vladimir Putin are having a chat

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:40.240
what are good ideas to explore what are good questions to ask what are good things to say

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:47.520
on or off the mic once again that could potentially even slightly lessen the amount

01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:54.080
of suffering in the world caused by this war oh I think if you get an interview with Vladimir Putin

01:20:54.640 --> 01:21:00.320
there's just all sorts of questions you could ask him and my sense is that Putin is a straight

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:06.160
shooter he's also very knowledgeable about history and he has simple theories in his head about how

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:11.680
the world works and I think he would level with you and all you would have to do is just you know

01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:18.400
figure out what all the right questions are and that would not be hard to do right you know you

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:27.040
could ask him why was he so foolish this is for example why was he so foolish is to trust

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:34.160
uh Poroshenko Hollande and Merkel uh in the Minsk accords

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:44.240
you know why after his famous talk at Munich in 2007 where he made it clear that he was so unhappy

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:52.720
with the west did he continue to you know in a very important way trust the west why didn't he

01:21:52.720 --> 01:22:01.120
mobilize the Russian military before late September 2022 you know once the negotiations

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:09.120
that we were talking about before involving Istanbul and Naftali bin and once they broke down

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:15.680
you know why didn't he immediately mobilize more of the Russian population to fight the war just

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:19.920
all sorts of questions like that and then you could ask him questions about you know where

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:27.120
uh he sees this one headed what's the best strategy for Russia

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:37.040
if the Ukrainians will not agree to neutrality right yeah you know people like John Mearsheimer

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:45.120
say you'll probably take uh close to half of Ukraine is that true does it make sense to take

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:53.040
Odessa and John Mearsheimer also has questions about China your future relationships with China

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:59.440
yeah I mean one really important question that I would ask him is if the United States had basically

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:04.800
not driven you into the arms of the Chinese if there had been no war over Ukraine and the

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:10.560
United States had and its European allies had gone to considerable lengths to create some sort of

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:19.360
security architecture in Europe that resulted in you Vladimir Putin having good relations with

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:27.040
Ukraine what would your relations with China be and you know how would you think about that

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:37.440
so there are just plenty of questions you could ask him well hope burns eternal in my heart I

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:45.680
think probably in Putin's heart and Zelensky's heart I hope because hope is uh the leap of

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:49.280
trust that we've talked about I think is necessary for de-escalation and for peace

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:57.120
well you realize I have from the beginning argued for different policies that were all

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:02.800
designed to prevent this war from ever happening yes I don't know if you know this but in 1993

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:08.240
I argued that Ukraine should keep its nuclear weapons I was probably the only person in the

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:16.320
West who made that argument and my argument in 1993 this is in foreign affairs was that there may

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:22.960
come the day when Russia thinks about invading Ukraine and should that day come it would be

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:30.800
very helpful for preventing war if Ukraine had nuclear weapons so military might is essential

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:36.160
for maintaining a balance of power and peace well if you're interested in deterring an adversary

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:42.080
if I'm worried about you coming after me the best way to deter you is to have military might

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:48.880
and if you're Russia and I'm Ukraine I'm far weaker than you yeah right and having a nuclear

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:55.760
deterrent would be very effective at convincing you not to attack me because if you attack me

01:24:55.760 --> 01:25:00.880
you're threatening my survival and that's the one circumstance where it is likely

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:08.000
that I would use nuclear weapons to defend myself and given the consequences of nuclear use you

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:15.920
would be reluctant in the extreme to attack me so that's why I argued in 93 that if Ukraine kept

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:21.520
its nuclear weapons that made war down the road much less likely and I believe I was correct

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:28.320
and in fact Bill Clinton who played the key role in forcing Ukraine to give up its nuclear weapons

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:34.960
now says he has said it publicly you can find it on YouTube that he made a mistake doing that

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:43.120
furthermore I argued in 2014 that it made eminently good sense not to continue

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:49.120
to push to bring Ukraine into NATO because the end result is that Ukraine would be destroyed

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:55.440
and Ukraine is being destroyed so I was deeply interested at time in making sure that that

01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:02.240
didn't happen for the good of the Ukrainians not to mention because stability in Europe is a net

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:09.120
positive for almost everybody involved but people did not listen to me then either how do nuclear

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:15.280
weapons change the calculus of offensive realism because of mutually assured destruction I mean

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:22.480
it's not just military might it's just so destructive that you basically can't use

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:29.600
nuclear weapons unless you want complete destruction there's no question that the

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:35.840
presence of nuclear weapons makes it much less likely I'm choosing my words carefully here

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:42.400
much less likely that a great power would aggress against another great power it doesn't take that

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:49.120
possibility off the table but it makes it much less likely because of the reasons that you

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:56.800
articulated but with regard to nuclear use it's an interesting question how you think

01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:01.040
about nuclear use in a mad world I mean your point that we're in a mad world is

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:08.720
that's mad capital M.A.D. as well as M.A.D. small letters but let's stick to the capital letters

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:14.720
we're in a world of mutually assured destruction there's no question that in that world

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:25.200
it's unlikely that nuclear weapons would be used but the way you use nuclear weapons in that world

01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:34.480
is you use them for manipulation of risk purposes demonstration effect you you put both sides out on

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:40.320
the slippery slope now what exactly am I saying here let me talk about NATO doctrine during the

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:47.680
cold war we lived in a mad world United States and Soviet Union or the Warsaw Pact in NATO both had

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:51.840
an assured destruction capability so you had mutual assured destruction

01:27:53.040 --> 01:28:00.080
if the Warsaw Pact were to invade western Europe and here we're talking about west Germany

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:07.680
and NATO was losing the war we said that we would use nuclear weapons

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:14.000
how would we use nuclear weapons given that we were in a mad world the argument was that we would

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:23.040
use a handful of nuclear weapons against the Warsaw Pact not to not necessarily against

01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:30.000
their military forces could be in a remote area we would use a small number of nuclear weapons

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:37.680
to signal to the Soviets that we were deadly serious about putting an end to their offensive

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:48.320
and that we were throwing both sides out on the slippery slope to oblivion in other words we were

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:57.920
manipulating risk and the last clear chance to avoid Armageddon rested with them and then

01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:02.880
we would tell them that if you retaliated with a handful of nuclear weapons and you didn't

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:11.360
cease your offensive against west Germany we would launch a small another nuclear attack we would

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:20.240
explode a handful more of nuclear weapons all for the purposes of showing you our resolve

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:26.880
right so this is the manipulation of risk strategy and a lot of the language I just used in describing

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:34.720
it to you is language that Thomas Shelley invented right now fast forward to the present

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:41.360
if Russia were you losing in Ukraine that's the one scenario I think where Russia would have used

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:47.120
nuclear weapons and the question is how would Russia have used nuclear weapons again we're

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:53.760
assuming that the Russians are losing to the Ukrainians I believe they would have pursued a

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:59.040
manipulation of risk strategy they would have used four or five three or four who knows nuclear

01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:05.280
weapons maybe just one in a rural area that kills very few people yes exactly and basically

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:12.240
that would spook everybody the Americans the mushroom cloud yeah the it's because of the threat

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:18.400
of escalation right again your point is we're in a mad world I accept that and if you have limited

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:28.000
nuclear use right we understand hardly anything about nuclear escalation because thank goodness

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:34.160
we've never had a nuclear war so once you throw both sides out on the slippery slope even if you

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:41.280
only use one nuclear weapon in your scenario you don't know what the escalation dynamics look like

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:47.600
so everybody has a powerful incentive to put an end to the conflict right away

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:54.960
I might add to you that there were people who believed that we would not even initiate

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:03.920
a manipulation of risk strategy in Europe if we were losing to the Warsaw Pact during the cold war

01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:12.800
both Henry Kissinger and Robert McNamara said after leaving office that they would not have

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:18.480
done it they would have not initiated nuclear use even limited nuclear use that's what we're

01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:25.680
talking about here they would rather be red than dead right that was the argument too risky too

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:33.120
risky that's exactly right but if they had used one nuclear weapon in your story or three or four

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:40.480
in my story everybody would have said oh my god we've got to shut this one down immediately

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:47.200
I only tell you this story or lay out this scenario as an answer to your question of

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:55.360
how you use nuclear weapons in a mad world and this is the answer I this is all very terrifying

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:59.280
perhaps in part it's terrifying to me because I can see in the 21st century

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:08.560
China, Russia, Israel, United States using a nuclear weapon in this way

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:17.280
blowing it up somewhere in the middle of nowhere that kills maybe nobody but I'm terrified of

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:24.000
seeing the mushroom cloud and not knowing what you know given social media given how fast news

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:32.640
travels what the escalation looks like there just you know in a matter of minutes how the

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:40.560
news travels and how the leaders react it's terrifying that this little demonstration

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:49.200
of power the ripple effects of it in a matter of minutes seconds what that leads to because

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:54.560
it's like it's human emotions it's like you see the landscape of human emotions

01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:00.480
the leaders and the populace and the and the way news are reported and then the landscape of risk

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:06.640
as you mentioned shifting like the world's most intense non-linear dynamical system

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:14.160
and it is just terrifying because the the the entirety of human civilizations hangs in the

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:20.960
balance there and it's like like this like hundreds of millions of people could be dead.

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:31.440
Let's just talk about this in the context of the Ukraine war if if the Russians were losing as I

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:39.920
said before which is not the case anymore but in 2022 it did look like that if the Russians are

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:47.680
losing and they turn to nuclear weapons the question is how do they use them and they would

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:57.520
use them in Ukraine and because Ukraine has no nuclear weapons of its own Ukraine cannot retaliate

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:04.080
it's not a mutual assured destruction world it's a case where one side has nuclear weapons and the

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:11.360
other doesn't that means that the Russians are likely to think that they can get away

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:17.360
with using nuclear weapons in ways that would not be the case if they were attacking NATO

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:23.760
and therefore it makes nuclear use more likely okay that's point one point two is let's assume

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:28.960
that the Russians use two or three nuclear weapons in a remote area my palms are sweating by the way

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:35.920
just this is a commentary the question terrifying yeah the question then is what does the West do

01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:43.680
now Macron has said and Biden is also I think implicitly made this clear we would not retaliate

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:48.400
with nuclear weapons if the Russians were to attack with a handful of nuclear weapons in

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:56.560
western Ukraine but then the question is what would we do and if you listen to David Petraeus

01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:03.200
what David Petraeus says is that we should attack the Russian naval assets

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:13.760
in the Black Sea and attack Russian forces in Ukraine well once you do that you have a great

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:19.760
power of war you have NATO versus Russia which is another way of saying you have the United States

01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:25.680
versus Russia we're now in a great power war they have nuclear weapons we have nuclear weapons

01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:32.320
they've used nuclear weapons what is the happy ending here and just to take it a step further

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:40.160
and go back to our earlier discussion about moving NATO up to Russia's borders the point I made

01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:46.640
which you surely agree with is that the Russians are very fearful when they see NATO coming up to

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:53.040
their border well here's a case where not only is NATO come up to their border but they're in a war

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:59.440
with NATO right on their border what do the escalation dynamics look like there

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:05.360
you know what the answer is who knows that should scare the living bejesus out of you

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:11.440
right and some of it could be like you mentioned unintended there could be unintended consequences

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:18.720
there could be a Russian missile misses and hits Poland these kinds of things that just escalate

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:26.400
misunderstandings miscommunications even a I mean nuclear weapon could be boy it could have been

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:32.640
planned to go location x and it went to a location y that ended up actually killing a very large

01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:41.440
number of people I mean uh just that the the escalation that happens there just happens in

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:47.920
a matter of minutes and the only way to stop that is communication between leaders and that to me is

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:54.720
a big argument for ongoing communication you know there's a story during the Cuban missile crisis

01:36:55.520 --> 01:37:04.160
Kennedy put out the word no aircraft under any circumstances or to penetrate Soviet airspace

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:12.640
and he then found out a few days later that some guy hadn't gotten the message

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:22.480
and had penetrated in an aircraft deep into Soviet airspace yeah and this supports your basic point

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:30.000
that you know bad things happen yeah and uh and again the overarching point here is we've never

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:36.320
done this before thankfully therefore we don't have a lot of experience as to how it plays itself out

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:42.080
it's really a theoretical enterprise because there's no empirical basis

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:49.120
for talking about escalation uh you know in a nuclear crisis and that of course is a wonderful

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:57.680
thing well in general the uh the human species as a whole is a one-off is a theoretical enterprise

01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:04.000
the survival of the human species you know we've seen empires rise and fall but we haven't seen

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.760
the human species rise and fall so far it's been rising but uh it's not obvious that it doesn't

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:17.360
end in fact i think about aliens a lot and the fact that we don't see aliens makes me suspect

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:23.840
it's not so easy to survive in this complicated world of ours switching gears a little bit and

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:30.720
going to a different part of the world also engulfed in war let me ask you about the

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:40.560
uh situation in israel why did hamas attack israel on october 7th 2023 as you understand the

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:51.840
situation what was the reason that attack happened well i think the main reason was that you had this

01:38:52.320 --> 01:39:02.560
suffocating occupation i think as long as the occupation persists the palestinians are going

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:10.560
to resist uh as you well know this is not the first time there has been a palestinian uprising

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:16.640
there was the first intifada there was the second intifada now there's october 7th and their

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:27.120
uprisings besides those three so this is not terribly surprising a lot of people hypothesize

01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:35.520
that this attack was due to the fact that the israelis the saudis and the americans were

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:43.600
working together to foster another abraham accord and that the palestinians would in effect be sold

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:51.840
down the river i think given the fact that this was in the planning stages for probably about

01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:59.840
two years and the abraham accords with regard to saudi arabia are relatively new phenomenon i don't

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:07.600
think that's the main driving force here i think the main driving force is that the palestinians

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:16.000
uh feel oppressed as they should and that this was a resistance move they were

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:23.680
resisting the israeli occupation so that resistance the attack involved killing

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:31.600
a large number of israeli civilians there's many questions asked there but one is do you think

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:38.560
hamas fully understood what the retaliation will involve from israel into gaza

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:51.440
they had to understand i mean you had you know operation cast led in 2008 2009 it started i

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:57.120
think right after christmas 2008 and it ended right before president obama took office

01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:08.160
in january 2009 and the israelis periodically do what they call mowing the lawn where they go

01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:15.120
into gaza and they pound the palestinians to remind them that they're not supposed to

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:25.680
rise up and cause any problem so there's no question in my mind that the the hamas

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:33.360
forces understood full well that the israelis would retaliate and they would retaliate for us

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:40.320
as they have done yeah even the metaphor of mowing the lawn is disturbing to me in many ways

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:51.360
i actually saw uh norman filkestein i think say that well then if you use that metaphor then you

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:59.200
could say that hamas was also mowing the lawn and it's such a horrific image because the result

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:05.360
on either side is just the death of civilians i mean let me ask you about the death of civilians

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:13.840
so during the attack 1400 israelis were killed over 240 were taken hostage and then in response

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:21.440
as we sit today israel's military response has killed over 10 000 people in gaza

01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:28.720
and given the nature of the demographics it's a very heavily young population over 40 percent

01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:35.280
of them are under the age of 18 of those killed that's of course according to ministry of health

01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:43.120
of palestinian authority so what do you think is the long-term effect on the prospect of

01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:51.280
peace once so many civilians die i mean i think it's disastrous uh i mean

01:42:54.240 --> 01:43:00.160
the only way you're going to get peace here is if you have a two-state solution

01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:08.160
where the palestinians have a sovereign state of their own and there is a sovereign jewish state

01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:14.880
and these two states live side by side american presidents since jimmy carter have understood

01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:20.320
this full well and this is why we have pushed very hard for two-state solution indeed many

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:26.800
american jews and many israelis have pushed for a two-state solution because they think that that

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:36.960
is the only way you're going to get peace between the two sides but what's happened here is that in

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:43.920
recent years the israelis have lost all interest in a two-state solution and it's in large part

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:48.320
because the political center of gravity in israel has steadily moved to the right

01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:56.240
when i was a young boy the political center of gravity in israel was much further to the left

01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:05.680
than it is today and it is in it is in a position now the political center of gravity where there's

01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:12.640
hardly any support for two-state solution and netanyahu and the rest of the people in his

01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:18.240
government were in favor or are in favor of a greater israel there's just no question about that

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:30.400
well on top of that you now have had a war where as you described huge numbers of civilians have

01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:37.360
been killed and you already had bad blood between the palestinians and the israelis

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:46.480
before this conflict and you could imagine how people on each side now feel about people on the

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:52.720
other side so even if you didn't have this opposition inside israel to a two-state solution

01:44:52.720 --> 01:45:01.520
and how could you possibly get the israelis now to agree to a two-state solution i think for the

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:08.560
foreseeable future the animosity inside israel towards the palestinians is so great that it

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:13.760
is impossible to move the israelis in that direction and the israelis here are the key

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:20.480
players more so than the palestinians because it's the israelis who control greater israel

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:25.760
it's the israelis who you have to convince now i want to be clear here you also ultimately have

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:32.880
to get around the fact that hamas right is not committed to a two-state solution but i think

01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:39.520
that problem could be dealt with it's important to understand that arafat and the plo was once

01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:45.600
adamantly opposed to a two-state solution but arafat came around to understand that that was

01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:52.960
really the only hope for settling this and he became a proponent of a two-state solution

01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:59.040
and that's true of makhmud abbas who runs the pa in the west bank it's not true of hamas at

01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:04.640
this point in time they want a one-state solution they want a palestinian state and of course

01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:09.680
the israelis want a one-state solution too which is a jewish state that controls all of

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:18.240
um all of greater israel so the question is can you get some sort of agreement and i think

01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:21.840
to get to your the nub of your question given what's just happened

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:29.680
it's almost impossible to imagine that happening anytime soon the cynical perspective here is that

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:37.840
those in power benefit from conflict while the people on both sides suffer is there a degree

01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:44.720
of truth to that or for the people in power to maintain power conflict needs to continue no i

01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:49.680
don't believe that i mean just to take the netanyahu government or any israeli government that

01:46:49.680 --> 01:47:00.400
maintains the occupation what you want is you want a palestinian population that submits to israeli

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:05.840
domination of greater israel you don't want resistance you don't want an intifada you don't

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:11.760
want what happened on october 7th in fact i think one of the principal reasons that the israelis

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:19.920
are pounding gaza and killing huge numbers of civilians punishing the civilian population

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:27.040
in ways to clearly violate the laws of war is because they want the palestinians to understand

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:33.680
that they are not allowed to rise up and resist the occupation that's their goal so i think the

01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:42.160
israelis would prefer that the palestinians roll over and accept submission in terms of the people

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:47.840
who live in gaza to include the elites and the people who live in the west bank to include

01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:56.240
the elites they would much prefer to move to some sort of situation where the palestinians have a

01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:03.440
state of their own i think in the case of the pa under abbas they would accept a two-state solution

01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:09.440
i think what at this point in time hamas wants is a one-state solution but they want peace

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:16.720
all of them want peace you know the two different sets of leadership in palestine and the israelis

01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:22.640
so you think hamas wants peace sure but on its own terms that's the point what does peace look

01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:28.720
like for hamas at this point in time i think peace basically means a greater israel controlled by

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:36.720
palestine or palestinians okay so essentially i mean it's the whole land is called palestine

01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:42.480
and there's no israel i think at this point in time that's their principal goal i do believe

01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:48.800
and there have been hints over time jimmy carter has said this that hamas can be convinced that a

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:55.520
two-state solution assuming that the palestinians get a viable uh state of their own that hamas

01:48:55.520 --> 01:49:01.840
would buy into that can we say that with a high degree of certainty no but i think i think the

01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:06.960
israelis should have pursued that possibility they should have worked with the boss they should have

01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:12.880
worked with hamas to do everything they can to facilitate a two-state solution because i think

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:18.720
ultimately that's in israel's interest now the israeli government and most israelis at this

01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:25.200
point in time i believe don't agree with that what do you think of israel starting the ground

01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:36.320
invasion of gaza recently on october 27th the question is uh should they continue

01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:46.080
until they have finally defeated hamas there are all sorts of reports in the media including in

01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:52.720
the israeli media that they're not going to be allowed by the united states to continue this

01:49:52.720 --> 01:50:01.600
offensive uh from much more than a few weeks the israelis have been saying it would it's going to

01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:11.200
take in the best of all possible worlds a number of months if not a year to finish off hamas well

01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:17.120
it doesn't look like they're going to have enough time to do that i doubt whether they can finish

01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:22.960
off hamas even if they're given the time i think they're going to run into fierce resistance

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:28.000
and when they run into fierce resistance and large numbers of israelis going to

01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:37.120
start to die they'll lose their appetite for this and they the israelis surely know at this

01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:42.080
point in time that even if they finish off hamas even if i'm wrong and they're able to finish off

01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:50.400
hamas another group is going to rise up to uh resist the occupation the idea that you can use

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:57.680
with zeve yabotinsky called the iron wall to beat the palestinians into submission

01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:04.720
is delusional it's just not going to happen the palestinians want a state of their own they don't

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:12.640
want to live under occupation and uh there's no military solution for israel here there has to be

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:19.760
a political solution and the only viable political solution is a two-state solution i mean you can't

01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:25.360
go to democracy you can't go to a situation where you give the palestinians equal rights

01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:33.120
inside of greater israel in large part because there are now as many palestinians as there are

01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:39.360
israeli jews and over time the balance the demographic balance shifts against the israeli

01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:44.880
jews and in favor of the palestinians in which case you'll end up with a palestinian state in

01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:54.000
greater israel so you know democracy for all doesn't work uh the israelis i believe are

01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:01.920
quite interested in ethnic cleansing i think they saw this uh this recent set of events as an

01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:08.000
opportunity to cleanse gaza but that's not going to happen uh the jordanians and the egyptians have

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:13.520
made it clear that that's not happening the united states has now made it clear that that's not

01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:22.560
happening and and the palestinians will not leave uh they'll die in place uh so uh ethnic cleansing

01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:27.760
doesn't work so you're really left with two alternatives a two-state solution or a greater

01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:34.160
israel that is effectively an apartheid state i mean that's what the occupation has led to

01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:40.320
and all sorts of people have been predicting this for a long long time and you've now reached the

01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:45.680
point you know here in the united states if you say that israel is an apartheid state that's going

01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:52.800
to get you into all sorts of trouble but the fact is that human rights watch amnesty international

01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:58.800
and bit selem which is the leading israeli human rights group all three of those institutions

01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:06.480
or organizations have issued detailed reports making the case that israel is an apartheid

01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:13.760
state furthermore if you read the israeli media right all sorts of israelis including israeli

01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:20.640
leaders refer to israel as an apartheid state it's it's not that unusual to hear that term used in

01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:26.080
israel this is disastrous for israel in my opinion and steve walt and i said this by the

01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:32.800
way when we wrote the israel lobby that israel is an apartheid state which is equivalent to israel

01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:40.720
as an occupier is not good for israel and that brings us back to the two-state solution but as

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:46.960
you and i were talking about a few minutes ago it's hard to see how you get a two-state solution

01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:54.480
and the end result of this conversation is utter despair because the path to a two-state solution

01:53:55.440 --> 01:54:02.000
is blocked by the amount of hate that's created by civilian deaths that plus the fact that the

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:09.120
israeli government is filled with people who have no interest in a two-state solution they're

01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:18.240
ideologically deeply committed to a greater israel they want all the land between the jordan

01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:26.800
river and the mediterranean sea to be part of a jewish state they're just ideologically committed

01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:34.080
to that and uh and of course as we were talking about before with regard to hamas hamas wants

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:40.400
everything between the river and the sea to be a palestinian state and you know when you have

01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:49.840
two sides with those kinds of views right you're in deep trouble because there's a little room for

01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:55.440
compromise so what you have to do to get this to work is you have to convince the israelis that

01:54:55.440 --> 01:55:02.320
it's in their interest to have a two-state solution and you have you've already taken care of the pa

01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:07.760
on this front the palestinian authority but you've got to convince hamas that its uh its

01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:13.840
maximalist goals are are not going to work and it's in its interest to follow in the footsteps

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:20.880
of arafat and accept a two-state solution but uh even if you do that at this point let's say that

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:28.000
you know there's a lot of willingness uh intellectually on both sides to do that the

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:36.000
problem is that the hatred that has been fueled by this recent con uh this ongoing conflict is

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:41.520
so great that it's just hard to imagine how you can make a two-state solution work at this juncture

01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:48.080
that's why i've sort of taken to sane and i hope i'm wrong here that you know on the two-state

01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:54.240
solution uh that that boat has sailed it's just you know it's no longer possible well again i

01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:59.920
believe in leadership and there's other parties that play here other nations jordan saudi arabia

01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:05.360
other other players in the in the middle east that could help they could help through a normalization

01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:10.800
of relationships and these kinds of things there's there's always hope like you said slither of hope

01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:16.400
slither of hope i think human civilization progresses forward by taking advantage of the

01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:21.840
all the slithers it can get uh let me ask you about you mentioned the israel lobby you wrote a book

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:29.840
probably your most controversial book on the topic not probably clearly the most controversial book

01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:34.560
i ever wrote so you've uh criticized the israel lobby in the united states for influencing u.s

01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:42.160
policy um in the middle east can you explain what the israel lobby is their influence and

01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:49.840
your criticism over the past let's say a couple decades well the argument that steve walt and i

01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:55.680
made actually we wrote an article first and which appeared in the london review of books

01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:05.920
and then we wrote the book itself our argument is that the lobby is a loose coalition of

01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:15.760
individuals and organizations that push american policy in a pro israel direction

01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:23.760
uh and uh basically the lobby is interested in getting israel excuse me getting the united

01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:29.040
states and here we're talking mainly about the american government to support israel no matter

01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:35.600
what israel does and our argument is that if you look at the relationship between the united states

01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:44.880
and israel it's unprecedented in modern history uh this is the closest relationship that you can

01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:54.880
find between any two countries in recorded history it's truly amazing the extent to which israel and

01:57:54.880 --> 01:58:02.720
the united states are joined at the hip and we support israel no matter what almost all the time

01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:11.200
and uh our argument is that that is largely due to the influence of the lobby the lobby is

01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:19.440
is an extremely powerful interest group now it's very important to understand that the american

01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:28.320
political system is set up in ways that allow interest groups of all sorts to wield great

01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:34.480
influence so in the united states you have an interest group or a lobby like the national

01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:39.680
rifle association that makes it well nigh impossible to get gun control

01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:50.960
and so with the israel lobby you have this group of individuals and organizations that wield

01:58:51.520 --> 01:59:01.360
enormous influence on u.s policy toward the middle east and this is not surprising given the nature

01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:08.400
of the american political system so our argument is that the lobby is not doing anything that's

01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:18.080
illegal or illicit or immoral or unethical it's just a good old-fashioned american interest group

01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:26.800
and it just happens to be extremely powerful and our argument is that this is not good for the

01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:34.400
united states because no two countries have the same interests all the time and when our

01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:39.760
interests conflict with israel's interests we should be able to do what we think is in our

01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:45.920
national interest in america's national interest but the lobby tends to conflate america's national

01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:51.680
interests with israel's national interests and wants the united states to support israel no

01:59:51.680 --> 01:59:57.680
matter what we also argue and i cannot emphasize this enough given what's going on in the world

01:59:57.680 --> 02:00:07.920
today that the lobby's effects the lobby has not been pushing policies that are in israel's

02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:15.680
interest so our argument is that the lobby right the lobby pushes policies that are not in america's

02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:20.960
interest or not in israel's interest now you're saying to yourself what exactly does he mean by

02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:29.120
that what every president since jimmy carter has tried to do as i said before is to foster a two

02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:38.640
state solution to push israel which is the dominant player in greater israel push israel to accept the

02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:47.920
two-state solution and we have run into huge resistance from the lobby whenever we tried to

02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:53.440
let's be blunt about it coerce israel right in a perfect world where there was no lobby and

02:00:54.320 --> 02:01:00.320
an american president was free to put pressure on israel to coerce israel i believe we would

02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:06.480
have gone a long way towards getting two-state solution and i believe this would have been in

02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:13.360
israel's interest but we couldn't get a two-state solution because it was almost impossible to put

02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:20.080
meaningful pressure on israel because of the lobby so this was not in israel's interest and it was

02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:26.320
not in america's interest and that was the argument that we made and we of course got

02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:31.840
huge pushback for making that argument what's the underlying motivation of the lobby is it religious

02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:40.000
in nature is it similar to the way war hawks are sort of militaristic in nature is it nationalistic

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:45.840
in nature what's if you were to describe this loose coalition of people well what would you say

02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:51.360
is their motivation well first of all i think you have to distinguish between jews and christians

02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:57.120
you want to remember that there are a huge number of christian zionists who are deeply committed to

02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:03.280
israel no matter what right and then there are a large number of jews the jews they're obviously

02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:08.960
the most important of those two groups in the israel lobby but you know one of the arguments

02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:14.080
that we made in the book is that you should not call it the jewish lobby

02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:21.360
because it's not populated just by jews and christian zionists are an important part of

02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:27.920
that lobby but furthermore there are a good number of jews who are opposed to the lobby

02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:35.920
and the policies that the lobby pervades and there are a number of jews who are

02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:43.120
prominent anti-zionists right so and they're obviously not in the lobby or if you take a

02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:49.840
group like jewish voice for peace right jewish voice for peace is not in the lobby so it's

02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:57.440
wrong to call it a jewish lobby but with regard to the american jews who are in that lobby

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:04.240
uh i think that really this is all about nationalism it's not so much religion many

02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:10.320
of those jews who are influential in the lobby are not religious in any meaningful sense of that

02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:17.200
term but they self-identify as jewish in the sense that they feel they're part of a jewish nation

02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:24.640
and that in addition to being an american right they are part of this tribe this nation called

02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:33.040
jews and that they have a responsibility to push the united states in ways that support

02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:41.520
uh the jewish state so i think that's what drives most if not almost all the jews this is not to

02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:46.720
say there's not a religious dimension for some of them but i think that the the main connection

02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:53.120
is much more tribal in nature so i had a conversation with benjamin and yahoo and he said

02:03:53.120 --> 02:04:02.560
fundamentally if you're anti-zionist you're anti-semitic so the the the zionist project is

02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:10.240
tied to the hip to the jewish project what do you have to say to that look you can define

02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:22.080
anti-semitism any way you want right and you can define anti-semitism to incorporate anti-zionism

02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:29.280
uh and uh i think we have reached the point where anti-semitism

02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:39.040
is identified today not just with anti-zionism but with criticism of israel if you criticize israel

02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:45.760
people will say some people will say you're an anti-semite and if that's your definition of

02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:55.520
anti-semitism it's taken an important term and stretched it to the point where it's meaningless

02:04:56.400 --> 02:05:03.200
right so when steve and i wrote the book uh wrote the article and then wrote the book all sorts of

02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:10.880
people said that we were anti-semites this is a ludicrous charge but what they meant was you're

02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:16.000
criticizing the lobby you're criticizing israel and therefore you're an anti-semite

02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:23.360
okay if that's what an anti-semite is somebody who criticizes israel you know probably half the

02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:28.240
jewish community if not more in the united states is anti-semitic and of course you get into all

02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:33.440
these crazy games where people are calling jews self-hating jews and anti-semites because they're

02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:39.440
critical of israel but even people who are anti-zionist i don't think they're anti-semitic at

02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:46.880
all you can argue they're misguided that's fine but many of these people are jewish and proud of

02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:54.320
the fact that they're jewish they just don't believe that nationalism and jewish nationalism

02:05:54.320 --> 02:06:01.120
is a force that should be applauded and you want to understand that in the american context there

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:08.080
is a rich tradition of anti-zionism right and these were not people who were anti-semites if

02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:13.760
you go back to the 30s 40s 50s and the same thing was even true in europe there were all sorts of

02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:21.040
european jews who were opposed to zionism were they anti-semites i don't think so but we've gotten

02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:28.640
to the point now where people are so interested in stopping any criticism of israel that they

02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:40.640
wield this weapon of calling people anti-semites so loosely that the term has kind of lost

02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:49.680
meaning so i i think netanyahu is wrong-headed to equate anti-zionism with anti-semitism

02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:56.000
alan dershowitz was one of the people that called you specifically anti-semitic so just

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:05.520
just looking at the space of discourse how do you where's the slither of hope for healthy

02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:14.960
discourse about u.s relationships with israel uh between you and alan dershowitz and others like

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:23.120
him well i think until there is a settlement of the israeli-palestinian conflict there's

02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:30.320
no hope of putting an end to this nonsense right so these are just uses of terms to kind of

02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:38.080
cheat your way through the through the discourse it's shortcut no it's the silence people right

02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:42.880
it's very very important to understand that one of the lobby's principal goals is to make sure we

02:07:42.880 --> 02:07:49.120
don't have an open discourse a freewheeling discourse about israel because they understand

02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:54.080
people in the lobby understand that if you have an open discourse israel will end up looking very

02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:58.800
bad right you don't want to talk about the occupation you don't want to talk about how

02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:08.800
israel was created right all these subjects are ones that will cause problems for israel

02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:18.560
see just to go to the present crisis okay when you have a disaster and what happened on october

02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:26.880
7th is a disaster one of the first things that happens is that people begin to ask the question

02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:34.640
how did this happen right what's the root cause of this problem this is a disaster we have to

02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:42.720
understand what caused it so that we can work to uh to make sure it doesn't happen again so we can

02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:48.480
work to shut it down and then make sure it doesn't happen again but once you start talking about the

02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:57.200
root causes right you end up talking about how israel was created right and that means telling

02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:05.520
a story that is not pretty about how the zionists conquered palestine uh and number two it means

02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:13.520
talking about the occupation right it's not like uh hamas attacked on october 7th because there

02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:19.840
were just a bunch of anti-semites who hated jews and wanted to kill jews this is not you know nazi

02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:26.640
germany right this is directly related to the occupation and to what was going on inside of

02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:32.240
gaza and it's not in israel's interest or the lobby's interest to have an open discourse

02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:39.040
about what the israelis have been doing to the palestinians since i would say roughly 1903 when

02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:45.920
the second aliyah came to israel or came to what was then palestine right you want to talk about

02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:51.520
that and we don't want to talk about from the lobby's point of view the influence that the

02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:59.040
lobby has right uh it's better from the lobby's point of view if most americans think that uh

02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:04.720
american support of israel is just done for all the right moral and strategic reasons not because

02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:09.920
of the lobby and when john meersheimer and steve walt come along and say you have to understand

02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:16.560
that this special relationship is due in large part to the lobby's influence that is not an

02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:22.240
argument that people in the lobby want to hear so the point is you have to go to great lengths for

02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:30.000
all these reasons you have to go to great lengths to silence people like me and steve walt and one

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:35.360
of the ways to do that is to call us anti-semites i think the chapter or the section of the book

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:42.160
where we talk about this charge of anti-semitism is called the great silencer that's what we call

02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:48.960
the charge of anti-semitism the great silencer who wants to be called an anti-semite especially in

02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:57.440
the wake of the holocaust do i want to be called an anti-semite oh my god no uh and uh so it's very

02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:06.160
effective but you know it is important to talk about these issues in my humble opinion and i

02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:13.440
think if we had talked about these issues uh way back when it would have gone a long way towards

02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:20.880
you know maybe getting a two-state solution which i think was the best alternative here

02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:27.120
it's complicated and i wonder if you can comment on the complexity of this because

02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:37.280
criticizing israel and you know criticizing the lobby can um for a lot of people be a dog whistle

02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:46.480
for sort of anti-semitic conspiracy theories that you know this idea that jews run everything run

02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:56.320
the world or this kind of cabal and you know it's it's also very true that people who are legitimately

02:11:56.320 --> 02:12:03.040
anti-semitic are also critics of israel in the same kind of way and so it's such a complicated

02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:11.760
landscape in which to have discussions because um uh you know even people like david duke

02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:20.560
uh who are you know racist don't sound racist on the surface i haven't listened to him enough but

02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:25.360
like you know there's dog whistles it's a complicated space in which to have discussions

02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:34.800
because it uh i mean i wonder if you can sort of speak to that um because there's this silencing

02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:42.320
effect of calling everybody anti-semitic but it's also true that there is anti-semitism in the world

02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:48.000
like there is the size of population of people that hate jews there's probably a sizeable

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.920
population of people who hate muslims too but you know i a lot of hate out there a lot of hate out

02:12:53.920 --> 02:13:00.720
there uh but the hatred of jews has like a long history and so you have like you know rolling

02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:06.560
stones have a set of great hits and there's just a set of great hits of the ways conspiracy theories

02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:12.480
they can make up about the jews that are used as part of the hatred uh so there's like nice

02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:20.800
templates for that and i just wonder if you can comment on operating as a historian as an analyst

02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:28.080
as a strategic thinker in this kind of space yeah we obviously when we wrote the article

02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:33.760
which we did before the book gave the subject a great deal of thought i mean uh what you say

02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:37.760
just now is music to our ears and i'm talking for me and about me and steve

02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:42.720
uh i mean i think that you know your point about dog whistles is correct

02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:52.720
in fact look we went to great lengths to make it clear that this is not a cabal

02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:59.360
it's not a conspiracy and in fact in a very important way the lobby operates out in the

02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:09.200
open right uh they brag about their power right and this was true before we wrote the article

02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:19.280
right and um and we said in the article and the book and you heard me say it here first of all

02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:28.960
it's not a jewish lobby right um secondly it's not a cabal right it's an american interest group

02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:34.720
and an american system is designed such that interest groups are perfectly legal and

02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:40.880
some of them are super effective exactly i mean you hit the nail right on the head that's exactly

02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:50.560
right and you know and it was nothing that we said that was anti-semitic by any reasonable

02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:57.600
definition of that term and you know huge numbers of jews have known me and steve over the years

02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:05.040
and nobody ever ever said that we were anti-semitic before march 2006 when the

02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:11.840
article appeared because we're not anti-semitic but look you've got this interest group

02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:21.840
right that has a significant influence on american policy and on israeli policy and

02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:29.280
and you want to talk about it it's just important to talk about it it's important for jews

02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:36.480
right in the united states for jews and israel to talk about this the idea that you want to silence

02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:43.840
critics is not a smart way to go about doing business in my opinion if we were wrong if

02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:51.120
steve and i were so wrong and their arguments were so foul they could have easily exposed

02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:58.560
those arguments they could have gone into combat with this in terms of the marketplace of ideas

02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:05.920
and easily knocked us down the problem was that our arguments were quite powerful and instead of

02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:14.880
engaging us and defeating our arguments they wanted to silence us and this is not good right

02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:19.840
it's not good for israel it's not good for the united states and i would argue in the end if

02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:25.760
anything it's going to foster anti-semitism i think you don't want to run around telling people

02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:32.240
that they can't talk about israel without being called an anti-semite it's just not it's not

02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:40.080
healthy in terms of the issue that you're raising right but i still agree with you that it is

02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:46.240
tricky issue it's i i don't want to make light of that you know i know that there's this

02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:53.200
piece of literature out there called the protocols of the elders of zion and i fully understand that

02:16:53.200 --> 02:17:00.640
if you're not careful you can come close to writing volume two of the protocol but i don't

02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:08.400
believe that we wrote anything that was even close to that and again i think that a healthy debate

02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:13.360
on the issues that we were raising would have been in not only in america's interest but it

02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:20.800
would have been in israel's interest yeah i mean uh underneath it all is just i wonder why

02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:26.560
there is so much hate against groups why it's such a sticky way of thinking

02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:33.360
not just tribalism like proud of your country and kind of hating another country but

02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:38.480
really deeply hating like hating in a way where it's part of your identity kind of hate

02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:47.520
me well just to make a general point on this issue in our conversation here today you often

02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:53.760
talk about individual leaders and the word individual often pops up in your vocabulary

02:17:54.480 --> 02:18:00.960
i believe that we are ultimately social animals before we are individuals i believe we're born

02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:07.840
into tribes we're heavily socialized and that we carve out space for our individualism

02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:16.000
but we are part of tribes and or social groups or nations call them what you want ethnic groups

02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:22.880
religious groups but the fact is that these tribes often crash into each other and when

02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:30.000
they crash into each other they end up hating each other if you go to a place like bosnia right the

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:38.560
croats and the serbs oh my god and then throw in the bosniaks or which is the term for bosnian

02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:49.760
muslims and you know muslims croats serbs oh and the tribes you know hate each other uh and uh

02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:58.240
in a funny way that hatred almost never goes away uh and uh i guess there are some exceptions

02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:05.040
to that if you look at the germans after world war two they've gone a long way towards reducing

02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:12.640
i wouldn't want to say completely eliminating but reducing a lot of the hatred that existed between

02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:20.800
germans and their neighbors but that's really kind of an anomalous case i mean you go around

02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:27.520
east asia today and the hatred of japan in a place like china the hatred of japan in a place

02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:34.560
like korea just not to be underestimated and uh so but i think a lot of it just has to do with

02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:37.840
the fact that you're dealing with social groups that have crashed into each other

02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:44.000
at one point or another and there are those lingering effects and by the way this gets back

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:49.520
to our discussion a few minutes ago about trying to get a two-state solution between the palestinians

02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:58.160
and the israeli jews now that you have had uh this horrible war which is ongoing

02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:06.800
it's interesting to ask to go back to world war two now you said uh you studied nazi germany in

02:20:06.800 --> 02:20:14.400
in the 30s from a perspective of maybe offensive realism but just to look at the holocaust

02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:20.960
it's sometimes popular in public discourse today to compare certain things to the holocaust

02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:28.160
people have compared the hamas attack on israel to the holocaust saying things like it's the

02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:39.280
the the biggest attack on jews since the holocaust which kind of implies that there's a comparison

02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:44.320
there's a comparison people have made that same comparison in the other direction

02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:51.840
what do you make of this comparison is it comparable is it is the use of the holocaust

02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:58.560
have any accuracy in comparisons of modern day international politics

02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:08.320
is it possible that you could have another genocide yes and i would argue that what you

02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:16.560
had in rwanda was a genocide right the holocaust is not the only genocide i believe the word

02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:25.840
genocide is used too loosely today uh and as you know lots of people and i mean lots of people

02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:33.200
who are pro-palestinian accuse the israelis of engaging in genocide in gaza i think what the

02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:42.560
israelis are doing in gaza represents a massacre i would use that term given the number of civilians

02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:47.040
that they've killed and the fact that they've been indiscriminate in terms of how they've been

02:21:47.760 --> 02:21:56.800
bombing gaza but i would not use the word genocide for me a genocide is where one side attempts to

02:21:56.800 --> 02:22:05.200
eliminate another group from the planet i think that what happened with the holocaust was clearly

02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:13.520
a genocide and that the germans were bent on destroying all of european jewelry and if they

02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:20.080
could have gotten their hands on jews outside of europe they would have murdered them as well that's

02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:25.600
a genocide and i think with the hutus and the tootsies you had a similar situation

02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:31.920
i think with the turks and the armenians during world war one that was a genocide

02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:36.720
but i have a rather narrow definition of what a genocide is and i don't think there are many

02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:46.720
cases that qualify as a genocide the holocaust certainly does okay now what hamas did doesn't

02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:58.160
even come close to what happened to european jewelry between let's say 1939 and 1945 although

02:22:58.160 --> 02:23:04.720
i date the start of the holocaust to 1941 if we were you know looking at it closely but let's just

02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:14.240
say 1939 when they invaded poland from 1939 to 1945 what hamas did pales in comparison it's hard

02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:22.000
to believe anybody would make that argument right yes a lot of jews died but hardly

02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:31.040
hardly any compared to the number that died you know at the hands of the germans i mean it's just

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:39.440
no parallel at all and furthermore hamas was in no position to kill all the jews

02:23:39.440 --> 02:23:45.280
in the middle east just not not going to happen yeah but there's also levels of things you know

02:23:45.280 --> 02:23:54.080
using uh germans using uh human skin for lamps there's just levels of evil in this world yes

02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:59.440
but you don't see that with i mean that's not what hamas is doing i mean i i want to be very

02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:05.360
clear here i am not justifying the kill hamas's killing of civilians okay not for one second

02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:10.080
but i'm just saying and and by the way just to go to the israelis

02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:16.320
and what they're doing in gaza right as i said to you before i do believe that is a massacre

02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:23.200
and i believe that's to be condemned the killing of civilians this is not legitimate collateral

02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:30.400
damage they're directly punishing the population but i would not call that a genocide right and

02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:36.960
i would not compare that to the holocaust for for one second i just want to be very clear on that

02:24:37.600 --> 02:24:43.360
do you think uh if israel could they would avoid the death of any civilians

02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:48.720
so you're saying there's some degree of punishment of collective they're purposely

02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:53.280
killing civilians it's this is the iron wall they're trying to beat the palestinians in a

02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:59.360
submission right there's no way you kill this many civilians

02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:10.480
if you're trying to precisely take out hamas fighters and by the way the israeli spokesman

02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:17.680
the idf spokesman has explicitly said that we are not pursuing precision bombing and that what we

02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:23.680
are doing is trying to you know maximize the amount of destruction and damage that we can

02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:32.640
inflict on the palestinians and i i think this is a major mistake on the part of israel first of all

02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:40.160
it ends up being a moral stain on your reputation number one and number two it doesn't work it

02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:48.080
doesn't work the the palestinians are not going to roll over and submit to israeli domination

02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:57.440
of their life so you know the whole concept of the iron wall yabotinsky's term was misguided

02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:03.280
and and by the way the iron if you look at what the israelis are doing they're trying to do two

02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:07.920
things one is the iron wall and that's where you punish the civilian population in gaza and get

02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:12.560
them to submit the other thing that they're trying to do is get hamas they want to destroy

02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:17.760
hamas and the belief there is that if they destroy hamas they've solved the problem

02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:24.080
but as many israelis know including people on the hard right even if you destroy hamas

02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:34.240
they are going to be replaced by another group another resistance group and that resistance group

02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:39.760
will employ terror yeah i think you i think you've said that other terrorist organizations

02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:44.480
have used the situation in palestine as a kind of a recruit recruitment mechanism

02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:50.800
for for a long time osama bin lad made it clear that this was one of those

02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:59.840
principal reasons for attacking the united states right and the united states attacked back

02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:09.040
and got us into a 20-year war that cost the lives of millions of people not not american but

02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:17.360
human beings yeah and uh engaged in torture torture yeah no i think

02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:26.080
if you look at how we reacted to 9 11 and how the israelis are reacting to what happened on

02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:35.200
october 7th there's quite a bit of similarity in that both sides the israeli side and the american

02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:44.720
side are enraged right and they lash out and they go on a rampage and the end result is not good

02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:53.040
is there a capacity within israel or within the united states after 9 11 to do something

02:27:53.040 --> 02:28:01.360
approximating turn the other cheek of understanding the root of terror is hate

02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:11.920
and fighting that hate with uh not to sound naive but compassion well i don't think in

02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:19.280
either case you're going to turn the other cheek uh i think well some i what i mean by that is

02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:27.120
some limited powerful military response but very limited yeah coupled with a smart political

02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:31.840
strategy political strategy diplomacy that's what they should have done yeah right but is

02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:39.040
their capacity for that or from your offensive realism perspective it's just the odds are really

02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:45.840
low from my offensive realist perspective or my realist perspective that's what you should do

02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:51.680
right okay my view is states are rational actors they should be cunning right they should think

02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:57.760
about uh the strategic situation they're in and choose the appropriate response and

02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:04.720
what happens and this is why my theory is not always correct is that sometimes states are not

02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:15.040
rational and they misbehave i would argue in the israeli case that it would have been good after

02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:24.000
october 7th or starting on october 7th if the united states had uh tried to hold the israelis

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:35.040
back and countenance a more moderate response a more with uh to take some time just to think

02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:40.800
about how to deal with this problem instead of lashing out i think given what happened to

02:29:40.800 --> 02:29:47.280
the israelis given how shocked they were given the level of fear given the level of rage they

02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:52.640
were going to lash out and i don't believe that was in their interest i think it would have been

02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:59.280
made it would have made sense to to think about it and to think about a smarter strategy than

02:29:59.280 --> 02:30:04.960
they're now employing and i think you know the americans blew it the americans gave them a bear

02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:10.560
hug and a green light and said we'll give you all the weaponry you need and go out and do it

02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:17.440
and uh i don't think that was the smart thing to do look in the wake of october 7th

02:30:18.400 --> 02:30:24.160
the israelis had no good strategy right it's it's not like there's a magic formula that they just

02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:28.640
didn't see and we should have told them what the magic formula was right that's not true

02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:33.600
they were in a sense caught between a rock and a hard place in terms of what to do

02:30:34.240 --> 02:30:38.400
but they're smarter things than number things and i think the israelis

02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:48.720
lashed out in ways that are counterproductive i think you know going on a rampage and you know

02:30:48.720 --> 02:30:56.320
killing huge numbers of civilians is not it's obviously morally wrong but it's also just not

02:30:56.320 --> 02:31:03.040
in their strategic interest right i mean uh because it's it's not going to buy them anything

02:31:03.040 --> 02:31:09.440
right and in fact it's going to cost them right because people all over the planet are turning

02:31:09.440 --> 02:31:17.600
against israel i saw you know an israeli think tank today that has been tracking

02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:26.080
protests around the world gave some figures for what it looked like

02:31:27.040 --> 02:31:34.240
between october 7th and october 13th in terms of the number of protests around the world that

02:31:34.240 --> 02:31:42.080
were pro israel versus pro palestine and then it looked at the numbers from october 13th up to the

02:31:42.080 --> 02:31:50.560
present and i think the numbers were 69 percent were pro-palestinian in the first six days after

02:31:50.560 --> 02:31:57.200
october 7th 69 percent and i think 31 take these numbers with a grain of salt

02:31:57.200 --> 02:32:01.440
31 percent were pro-israel so i think it was 69 and 31

02:32:04.080 --> 02:32:11.440
and since then since october 13th if you look at the number of protests around the world

02:32:11.440 --> 02:32:15.920
95 percent have been pro-palestinian and five percent have been pro-israel

02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:23.680
uh and what this tells you is that public opinion around the world has shifted against israel

02:32:23.680 --> 02:32:28.480
and if you look at some of the demonstrations in places like london and washington dc

02:32:29.040 --> 02:32:34.000
it's truly amazing the number of people who are coming out in support of the palestinians

02:32:34.960 --> 02:32:41.760
and uh all of this again is just to support my point that it was just not smart for israel to

02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:47.840
launch this bombing campaign right you can make an argument for going after hamas

02:32:48.480 --> 02:32:52.640
and doing it in a surgical way or a surgical way as possible

02:32:53.920 --> 02:33:00.960
but uh that's not what they did and again my point to you is i think that this punishment campaign

02:33:00.960 --> 02:33:05.840
is not going to work strategically in other words they're not going to beat the palestinians into

02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:11.040
submission they're not going to finish off hamas and at the same time by pursuing this strategy

02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:19.280
they're doing huge damage to their reputation around the world well i just uh yeah in the

02:33:19.280 --> 02:33:30.000
wake of october 7th given the geopolitical context i think there's a lot of leverage

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:36.480
to be the great ethical superpower that demonstrate power without killing any civilians

02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:43.120
and use that leverage diplomatic leverage to push forward something like abrahamic accords

02:33:43.680 --> 02:33:51.040
with more nations with saudi arabia push for peace aggressively peace agreements this kind of stuff

02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:57.040
economic relationships all this kind of stuff and thereby pressure the palestinian authority

02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:05.920
you know towards uh perhaps a two-state solution but i think what you're missing here just in the

02:34:05.920 --> 02:34:10.640
israeli case is that the israeli government is not interested in the two-state solution

02:34:10.640 --> 02:34:18.720
and you want to remember that benjamin netanyahu who looks very hawkish when you look at him in

02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:25.600
isolation doesn't look so hawkish when you look at him compared to the rest of the people in his

02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:33.680
cabinet right he he almost looks like a moderate he's got a lot of people who are way out to the

02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:41.200
right of him and these people and this of course includes netanyahu are not interested in the two

02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:46.000
state solution so the question you have to ask yourself is you if you're if you're benjamin

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:54.320
netanyahu and it's july 7th late in the excuse me october 7th late in the day what do you do

02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:59.120
you're not thinking about a two-state solution you're thinking about an occupation that's not

02:34:59.120 --> 02:35:04.320
going to end and the question is how do you deal with the palestinians given what's just happened

02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:10.720
well there's people in the cabinet and then there's history and history remembers great leaders and so

02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:18.000
uh benjamin netanyahu can look in the streets of israel and see the protests and think of how

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:24.640
history will remember him and i think a two-state solution is on the table for a great leader well

02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:31.200
it was there was he the person who was gonna take advantage of it i don't think so but

02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:36.480
well he's a student of history well at this point or the will see does any is very at this point

02:35:36.480 --> 02:35:43.920
it's very difficult um like you said 95 now or whatever the number is of protests i think

02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:51.760
the the window in which israel has the ears of the world they can do the

02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:59.440
the big ethical peace action action towards peace is uh i think has closed or maybe there's still a

02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:09.360
slither but it's just uh uh the slippery slope of hate is has taken off yeah it's quite depressing

02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:15.440
to watch what's going on i agree 100 unequivocally depressing but you know of course as you talk

02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:21.600
about the the role of you the u.s involvement is of critical importance here for the united states

02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:29.840
and the argument you make is that we should not be involved in ukraine at least to the degree we are

02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:36.800
we being the united states and we should not be involved in israel to the degree we are because

02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:44.480
it's stretching us too thin when uh the big geopolitical contender in the 21st century

02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:52.960
united states is china is that a correct summary yeah i i think just on ukraine we should not have

02:36:52.960 --> 02:37:01.600
pushed ukraine to join nato sure uh and once the war started we should have worked over time to

02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:07.840
shut it down immediately march yeah march right and and you remember by the way not to go back

02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:16.800
to ukraine in great detail in the fall early fall of 2022 the war starts february 2022

02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:22.880
is march 2022 which we've talked about which is in negotiations in the fall of 2022 i think it

02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:30.960
was in september uh the uh ukrainians had won two major tactical victories one in hirsan and the

02:37:30.960 --> 02:37:36.160
other in harkiv and at that point in time general milley who was the chairman of the joint chiefs of

02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:43.440
staff said now is the time to negotiate because this is the high water mark for the ukrainians

02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:50.000
milley understood that things were only going to get worse and the white house shut milley down

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:57.120
and said we're not negotiating so we have blown a number of opportunities here to head this problem

02:37:57.120 --> 02:38:05.440
off at the pass uh and uh but that's my view there and uh with regard to the israelis my only point

02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:11.840
about israel is that it would be better for israel and better for the united states if we the

02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:17.840
united states were in it was in a position the united states was in a position to put pressure

02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:23.920
on israel from time to time as steve and i say in the book we should be able to treat israel like

02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:30.640
a normal country right the fact is that countries sometimes do stupid things this includes the united

02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:36.960
states and israel and if israel is pursuing a policy that we think is unwise we should be in

02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:44.320
a position where we could put pressure on israel yeah that's our argument right but anyway we

02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:51.600
goofed both with regard to ukraine and with regard to the middle east and we're now up to our eyeballs

02:38:51.600 --> 02:39:01.040
in alligators in both of those regions and as you describe my view this is not good because

02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:07.440
the area of the most strategic importance for the united states today is east asia and that's

02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:14.000
because china is there and china is the most serious threat the united states faces do you

02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:22.880
think there will be a war with china in the 21st century i don't know my argument is there will be

02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:30.960
there is right now a serious security competition and at the same time there is a real possibility

02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:37.840
of war whether or not we avoid it is very hard to say i mean we did during the cold war we had a

02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:46.560
serious security competition from roughly 1947 to 1989 and and we thankfully avoided war

02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:56.240
probably came the closest in 1962 with the cuban missile crisis but we avoided it and i think we

02:39:56.240 --> 02:40:04.160
can avoid it here is it for sure no you've said that china won't move on taiwan militarily in

02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:10.960
part because it's uh as you said amphibious operations are difficult why will china not

02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:18.560
move on taiwan is in your sense in the near future well it's because there's this body of

02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:24.960
water called the taiwan strait which is a big body of water and getting across water

02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:31.440
is very difficult unless you can walk on water so geography still has a role to play in the

02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:37.040
21st century oh yeah i think geography is very important big bodies of water really matter

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:43.280
in an ideal world you'd like to have the pacific ocean between you and any potential adversary you

02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:50.880
know 6 000 miles yes 6 000 miles of water hard to get across if you're a country and i'm a country

02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:57.040
and there's land between us i can take my panzer divisions and i can go right across the land

02:40:57.040 --> 02:41:02.320
and get into your country or attack your country and you of course can take your panzer divisions

02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:07.600
and come across that same piece of land but if there's a big body of water between us

02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:12.960
your panzer divisions can't go across the water and then the question is how do you get them across

02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:20.080
the water and that's very tricky and in a world we have lots of submarines and you have lots of

02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:26.000
aircraft and you have missiles that are land-based that can hit those surface ships

02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:33.680
is very very hard to you know to attack across a body of water and all you have to do is think

02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:42.080
about uh normandy you know the american invasion of normandy june 6 1944 coming in on omaha beach

02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:49.200
right uh oh boy that was really difficult but there is a growing asymmetry of military power

02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:57.520
there that even though it's difficult that is correct so i i guess that is correct

02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:07.040
so i was sitting at a conversation with elon musk and he says that uh you know china is quite

02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:14.720
serious about the one china policy and it seems inevitable that taiwan will have to be if you look

02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:19.920
at this pragmatically in the 21st century it seems inevitable that taiwan will have to be a

02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:28.400
part of china and so we can get there either diplomatically or militarily like um what do

02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:34.320
you think about the inevitability of that kind of idea when a nation says this is a top priority

02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:44.800
for us what do you think about them meaning it and what do we do about that

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:50.240
there's no question it's a top priority for them and there's no question they mean it

02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:56.720
but it's also a top priority for us not to let them take taiwan why exactly because it's an

02:42:56.720 --> 02:43:02.880
important strategic asset many people will say it's because taiwan's a democracy but that doesn't

02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:13.840
matter that much it's because of two strategic reasons the first is that if we were to let taiwan

02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:21.760
go it would have hugely negative consequences for our alliance structure in east asia

02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:28.000
to contain china we need allies we have an alliance structure and our allies japanese

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:34.960
south koreans filipinos australians they're all counting on us to be there for them

02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:41.840
and if we say we're not going to defend taiwan the chinese attack they're going to say

02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:49.360
i bet if the chinese attack us the americans won't be there for us so the it would have

02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:57.760
a damaging effect on our alliance structure which we cannot afford because because containing

02:43:57.760 --> 02:44:02.720
china is a wicked problem it's a powerful state you were getting to this before when you talked

02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:09.920
about china versus taiwan so that's the first reason second reason is you want to bottle up

02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:16.480
the chinese navy in the chinese air force inside the first island chain you don't want to let them

02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:23.680
get out into the pacific you don't want them dominating the waters of east asia

02:44:23.680 --> 02:44:27.920
you want to bottle them up again inside the first island chain and you can only do that if you

02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:34.560
control taiwan you don't control taiwan they get out into the philippine sea into the pacific and

02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:40.880
the western pacific and cause all sorts of problems well you saying all that you've also

02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:46.160
said the century of humiliation japan and the united states are a source of that humiliation

02:44:46.160 --> 02:44:55.920
for china don't you think they see the other side of that absolutely and in the interest of

02:44:55.920 --> 02:45:04.480
avoiding a world war i guess the question is how do we avoid a world war it doesn't

02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:12.480
seem like the military involve involvement in the conflict between china and taiwan is the way

02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:19.680
well i don't want there's no good answers here i'm just saying there are no which is the the less bad

02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:28.000
option well what you want to do is you want to make sure that you deter china from invading taiwan you

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:32.320
want to avoid a war you and i are in complete agreement on that we don't want a war but we

02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:38.400
want to contain china we do not want to let china dominate asia that that's what the americans are

02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:43.360
principally concerned with here and it's what china's neighbors are principally concerned with

02:45:43.360 --> 02:45:49.840
this includes the japanese the south koreans the philippinos australians and the taiwanese we they

02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:57.760
don't want and we don't want china to dominate the region so we have to contain it but at the same

02:45:57.760 --> 02:46:02.640
time and this should be music to your ears we not only want to contain it we want to make sure we

02:46:02.640 --> 02:46:06.640
don't end up in a shooting match with the chinese because this could be disastrous

02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:12.560
so you have to have a very smart policy you have to build powerful military forces and you have

02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:18.320
to make sure you don't do anything that's provocative on taiwan for example the last

02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:23.680
thing you want is for the taiwanese government to declare its independence because the chinese have

02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:29.920
said if taiwan does that we'll go to war and of course we don't want that so my view is you want

02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:36.480
to smartly build up your military forces and you want to do everything you can to contain china

02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:39.520
and at the same time not be provocative

02:46:41.760 --> 02:46:48.400
so a big component of that is making sure your military the u.s military is bigger than the

02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:58.960
chinese military not necessarily it's an interesting question a lot of people think

02:46:58.960 --> 02:47:06.400
that to make deterrence work right you have to be able to beat the chinese and therefore you need

02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:13.680
a much bigger military and i don't think over time that's possible right i think it's probably

02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:20.800
not even possible now to beat the chinese in a war over taiwan or in a war in the south china sea

02:47:21.680 --> 02:47:28.320
i think what you want to do is make it clear to the chinese either that there will be no winner

02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:31.200
in other words you don't have to win but you want to make sure they don't win

02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:39.280
okay it's it's it's a lose lose proposition if they go to war over taiwan or what have you

02:47:40.400 --> 02:47:45.120
and if you can't do that right you think that they're so powerful that they're ultimately

02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:51.440
going to win you want to convince them that victory would be a pyrrhic victory in other words

02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:59.680
they would pay a god-awful price to win the war you follow what i'm saying so excuse me the best

02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:07.440
strategy for deterrence is you win china loses second best strategy is a stalemate

02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:14.960
nobody wins third best strategy is they win but they pay a god-awful price and the fourth

02:48:14.960 --> 02:48:23.520
possibility which you don't want is they went quickly and decisively right if that's the case

02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:25.280
then you don't have much deterrence

02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:36.000
what does a world with china's the sole dominant superpower look like i mean a little bit underlying

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:40.160
our discussion is this kind of idea that us is the good guys and china is the bad guys

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:46.480
first of all you know they're you know dividing the world to good guys and bad guys seems to

02:48:46.480 --> 02:48:53.920
somehow miss the nuance of this whole human civilization project we're undertaking

02:48:54.720 --> 02:49:00.000
but what does the world look like where china is the dominant sole superpower in a unipolar world

02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:06.080
well i don't tend to think of the world in terms of good guys and bad guys

02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:12.800
as a good realist i think that you know states are states they're all black boxes you know i

02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:18.400
don't discriminate between democracies and autocracies but having said that i am an

02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:25.520
american and as an american i'm interested in the security of my country the survival

02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:31.760
of my country so i want the united states to be the most powerful state in the world

02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:38.000
which means i want the united states to dominate the western hemisphere i want us to be a regional

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:44.000
hegemon and i want to make sure that china does not dominate asia the way we dominate the western

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:48.880
hemisphere it's not because i think we're the good guys and they're the bad guys

02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:57.440
if i were chinese and i were in beijing and i was zhi jing ping's national security advisor

02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:03.040
i'd tell him what we got to do is make sure we dominate the world or dominate our region

02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:08.160
and then do everything we can to undermine america's position in the western hemisphere

02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:14.720
right that that'd be my view so i guess you could say i do view the world in terms of good guys and

02:50:14.720 --> 02:50:20.480
bad guys because i'm an american and more like us and them yeah it's us that's that's a nice way

02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:25.200
to put it yeah it's us versus them not so much good guys versus bad guys is it possible to have

02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:34.240
a stable peaceful world with a good balance of power with where it's china and u.s as superpowers

02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:39.840
you know it's a bipolar world no longer unipolar yeah okay so you're hypothesizing a world where

02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:45.600
they dominate asia yeah and we dominate the western hemisphere yeah i believe there would be

02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:53.040
a great deal of security competition intense security competition between those two super

02:50:53.040 --> 02:51:00.160
powers the definition of intense matters here so it could be small small military conflicts

02:51:00.960 --> 02:51:07.520
or it could be extremely large unstable military conflicts well conflict let's use the word war

02:51:08.080 --> 02:51:12.800
okay so i i distinguish between security competition and war and what i'm telling you

02:51:12.800 --> 02:51:18.160
you'll have an intense security competition where there's no shooting where if there's

02:51:18.240 --> 02:51:23.680
shooting it's mainly proxies that are doing the fighting much like the vietnam war right

02:51:24.720 --> 02:51:30.800
or you could have a case where one of those superpowers was involved in a war against a

02:51:30.800 --> 02:51:36.960
proxy of the other superpower korean war think the korean war the united states fought the chinese

02:51:36.960 --> 02:51:44.320
who were allied with the soviets at the time but a war between the united states and china just like

02:51:44.320 --> 02:51:49.520
a war between the united states and the soviet union during the cold war that's what you really

02:51:49.520 --> 02:51:55.440
want to avoid avoid so i think you'd have an intense security competition right you'd have

02:51:55.440 --> 02:52:02.800
wars involving proxies of each of those two superpowers and you would probably have some

02:52:02.800 --> 02:52:10.000
wars where one of the superpowers was involved in a proxy right with the other super one of the super

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:15.760
other superpowers proxies so it seems likely then if that's the case then it would be taiwan is the

02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:22.960
proxy and us fighting china through the proxy of taiwan what yeah well that would assume the

02:52:22.960 --> 02:52:28.640
united states but you want to remember you're hypothesizing a situation where china dominates

02:52:28.640 --> 02:52:36.560
asia oh it already has dominated yes already dominated taiwan uh i see we we well where do

02:52:36.560 --> 02:52:44.080
you find the proxies well the middle east could be a good case oh wow right persian golf oh boy

02:52:44.080 --> 02:52:49.280
and then our discussion of israel becomes even more dramatically yeah well israel israel gets

02:52:49.280 --> 02:52:54.320
involved i think i think in this scenario if you're talking about a u.s china competition

02:52:55.040 --> 02:53:00.320
right and you're talking about the middle east i think it's the gulf it's it's the saudis the

02:53:00.320 --> 02:53:05.920
iranians the iraqis it's the oil don't you think it could be israel versus iran with

02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:15.520
some very 1984 kind of dramatic partnership of iran russia and china versus the united states

02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:23.280
europe and israel i think that's possible yeah i think that's possible yeah now that i i mean i

02:53:23.280 --> 02:53:29.440
hadn't thought about it until you said it but yeah i think that that that is possible isn't that

02:53:29.440 --> 02:53:36.720
terrifying yeah well that you know in your scenario where china already dominates asia

02:53:36.720 --> 02:53:43.200
and we dominate the western hemisphere i think you start talking about where the most likely places

02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:51.200
that the united states and china go head to head or or fight through proxies i think it is the

02:53:51.200 --> 02:53:58.160
gulf for the middle east and the scenario that you posit i mean one one question i have

02:53:59.920 --> 02:54:06.640
i don't know about you but for me unlike with the soviet union and i know i was born there but

02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:15.120
even outside of that the cultural gap the the the loss in translation the communication gap between

02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:22.160
china and the united states seems to be much greater than that of what was the former soviet

02:54:22.160 --> 02:54:30.000
union and the united states i see two cultures intermingling and communicating as one of the

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:38.480
ways to de-escalate future conflict it's an interesting question i mean it it is sort of

02:54:38.480 --> 02:54:46.320
an abstract theoretical level my argument is that great powers act according to realist dictates

02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:54.320
and they understand those realist dictates and that can lead to cooperation or it can lead to

02:54:55.280 --> 02:55:04.640
war it depends i would say just in the case of the soviets a lot of people describe the

02:55:05.680 --> 02:55:12.320
cold war as an ideological competition above all else it was communism versus

02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:20.560
uh liberal democracy or communism versus liberal capitalism whatever i actually don't believe that

02:55:20.560 --> 02:55:28.880
i i believe the soviets were realist to the core i believe stalin was a realist par excellence

02:55:29.760 --> 02:55:36.240
and that ideology did not matter much in stalin's foreign policy and i believe if you look at soviet

02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:41.440
foreign policy after world war two you know throughout the cold war they were realist to

02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:49.600
the core and and i think in those days the americans were realists right a lot of liberal

02:55:49.600 --> 02:55:53.840
ideology floating around out there but the americans were realists and i think one of

02:55:53.840 --> 02:56:00.800
the reasons you avoided a shooting match between the united states and the soviet union from 47 to

02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:08.720
89 was because both sides i think understood basic balance of power logic

02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:16.240
u.s china competition is somewhat different first of all the chinese are realist to the core

02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:22.720
uh i've spent a lot of time in china i basically have rock and roll i'm basically a rock and roll

02:56:22.720 --> 02:56:30.560
star in china uh the chinese you're kind of a big deal in china i love it the chinese are my kind of

02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:37.600
people yeah they're realists right they speak my language yeah it's the united states that is not

02:56:37.760 --> 02:56:44.240
very realist american leaders uh have a very powerful liberal bent and tend not to see the

02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:49.760
world in realist terms i believe by the way just going back to our discussion of nato expansion

02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:56.880
i think our inability to understand that nato expansion was anathema to the soviet to the

02:56:56.880 --> 02:57:02.880
russians was doing large parts of the fact that we just during the unipolar moment didn't think of

02:57:02.880 --> 02:57:08.160
international politics from a realist perspective and didn't respect anyone who thought about

02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:15.360
international politics from a realist perspective if those various american administrations starting

02:57:15.360 --> 02:57:20.080
with the clinton administration and put their realist hat on they would have understood nato

02:57:20.080 --> 02:57:25.840
expansion into ukraine was not a good idea but we had this thoroughly liberal view of the world

02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:32.320
that dominated our thinking and it's gone away somewhat since we've moved into multipolarity

02:57:32.320 --> 02:57:39.440
but not completely and this makes me a little nervous right to pick up on your point i mean

02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:45.120
the united states is thinking about the world in ways that are somewhat different than the chinese

02:57:45.120 --> 02:57:51.120
who are realist par excellence so that's fascinating so the chinese are pragmatic

02:57:52.800 --> 02:57:59.200
about thinking of the world in the as the competition of military powers all the ways

02:57:59.200 --> 02:58:03.600
in which you describe the realist perspective so that i mean that's a that's a that's a hopeful

02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:10.480
thing right if we can achieve stability and a balance of powers through that military

02:58:10.480 --> 02:58:15.920
competition yeah i i actually think that's right i think if the united states just let me talk a

02:58:15.920 --> 02:58:21.680
little bit about the united states to get at the issue you're raising if the united states pursues

02:58:21.680 --> 02:58:29.120
a smart containment strategy given what you just said and i said about the chinese i think we will

02:58:29.200 --> 02:58:37.520
avoid war the problem with the americans is it's not just the liberalism it's the possibility that

02:58:37.520 --> 02:58:46.960
we will pursue a rollback policy in other words during the cold war we pursued containment it was

02:58:46.960 --> 02:58:51.200
whenever anybody talked about american grand strategy towards the soviet unions containment

02:58:51.200 --> 02:58:55.920
containment containment we now know from the historical record that the united states was

02:58:55.920 --> 02:59:01.920
not only pursuing containment it was pursuing rollback we were trying to roll back soviet

02:59:01.920 --> 02:59:09.360
power to put it bluntly we were trying to wreck the soviet union okay and i would not be surprised

02:59:09.360 --> 02:59:15.680
moving forward with regard to china if the united states pursues a serious rollback policy

02:59:16.480 --> 02:59:20.640
and so you're saying throughout history united states was always doing that always

02:59:21.120 --> 02:59:25.600
well where's that from why why can't we respect the power of other nations

02:59:26.560 --> 02:59:34.080
because they may be a threat to us well i mean you don't look you don't respect the power of

02:59:34.080 --> 02:59:39.360
other nations you fear the power of other nations well fear and respect the next-door neighbors

02:59:39.360 --> 02:59:44.000
depending on the neighborhood you're living in but i i just mean it's it could be very

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:49.600
counterproductive to try because if you can empathize with their if you assume they're

02:59:49.600 --> 02:59:56.560
rational actors you try to roll back will create um would lean into the uncertainty

02:59:57.600 --> 03:00:02.320
of potential conflicts you want to avoid the uncertainty of potential conflict caution right

03:00:03.520 --> 03:00:08.400
well yes and no look your point is you want to empathize you want to be able to put yourself

03:00:08.400 --> 03:00:14.560
in the shoes of the other side yes i agree 100 with that right it's very important if

03:00:14.560 --> 03:00:19.200
you're a first-class strategist to be able to do that but at the same time there is this

03:00:19.200 --> 03:00:25.760
competition for power taking place and what you want to do is maximize how much power you have

03:00:25.760 --> 03:00:31.360
relative to the other side and the other side wants to maximize how much power it has relative

03:00:31.360 --> 03:00:40.080
to you so you have this competition for power right uh that's taking place all the time and

03:00:40.080 --> 03:00:44.160
that's taking place at the same time you want to have empathy or you want to be able to put

03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:50.240
yourself in the shoes of the other side so those two things kind of go together right it just feels

03:00:50.240 --> 03:00:58.800
less threatening to build up your thing versus try to hurt the other person's thing the other

03:00:58.800 --> 03:01:05.520
group's thing right but if you build up your own power you are building up your capability to hurt

03:01:05.520 --> 03:01:11.840
the other side right but like you i guess you don't rattle the saber just just work on manufacturing

03:01:11.840 --> 03:01:20.720
sabers well that i agree with i i think that you know the united states you know uh wants to make

03:01:20.720 --> 03:01:27.840
sure it has a big stick in east asia for purposes of containing china and avoiding a war right again

03:01:27.840 --> 03:01:34.240
i want to be clear i'm not advocating uh that we start world war three but the point is you want to

03:01:34.240 --> 03:01:40.640
have a big stick and you want to make sure that you don't overstep your bounds in terms of using

03:01:40.640 --> 03:01:46.960
that big stick this is the danger with rollback right that you get too aggressive and you precipitate

03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:53.200
a war right and you also just have to be very careful what you say and to go back to your

03:01:53.200 --> 03:01:59.440
favorite argument you want to be able to have empathy or put yourself in the shoes of the other

03:01:59.440 --> 03:02:05.360
side because if you do something you want to think smartly about what that other side how that other

03:02:05.360 --> 03:02:11.360
side is going to see your action and how they're going to react right and and mostly focus on the

03:02:11.360 --> 03:02:16.960
carrots have a giant stick laying around but never mention it just focus on the carrots well

03:02:16.960 --> 03:02:22.640
occasionally you have to mention the stick everyone knows the stick is there there is some truth in

03:02:22.640 --> 03:02:31.200
that right i mean yeah uh but you know and words matter a lot it feels you know this uh our current

03:02:31.200 --> 03:02:35.680
president biden is meeting with shi jing ping and i think the wars exchanged there are really

03:02:35.680 --> 03:02:42.480
important i have a notion that leaders can stop wars just as much as they can start wars well

03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:49.440
leaders matter there's no question about that no question but just on on rhetoric you want to

03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:58.000
remember that putin has on more than one occasion very subtly rattled the nuclear sword oh yeah and

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:04.080
it has been very effective yeah because joe biden has paid attention and joe biden wants to make

03:03:04.080 --> 03:03:10.560
sure we don't end up in a thermonuclear war and thank goodness he's thinking that way so all

03:03:10.560 --> 03:03:15.840
putin has to do is mention the possibility of nuclear war just to go back to taiwan you know

03:03:16.480 --> 03:03:23.280
switch areas of the world if you're interested in containing china and you're interested in

03:03:23.280 --> 03:03:30.720
deterrence and let's go back to those various scenarios where the chinese win we win chinese

03:03:30.720 --> 03:03:39.360
win but they do it at a costly at great cost one could argue that that discussion that i laid out

03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:46.320
before it didn't take into account nuclear weapons and all president biden or any of his

03:03:46.320 --> 03:03:57.360
successors has to do is just very subtly rattle or employ the nuclear threat you know

03:04:00.080 --> 03:04:05.920
and just sort of remind the chinese that you know you start a war over taiwan it could easily

03:04:05.920 --> 03:04:11.520
escalate into a nuclear war you want to understand we both have nuclear weapons and if either one of

03:04:11.520 --> 03:04:17.600
us is put into a desperate situation we may turn to those nuclear weapons and oh by the way

03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:22.800
xi Jinping you want to understand that we're out here in the water and using nuclear weapons in

03:04:22.800 --> 03:04:30.800
the water it's not that it's not the same as using war nuclear weapons on land so we may very well

03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:37.600
use them i'm not saying we will but anyway a little saber rattling yeah right let me just

03:04:37.600 --> 03:04:43.360
zoom out on human history what makes empires collapse and what makes them last when they do

03:04:45.360 --> 03:04:47.680
when you look at human history in your sense

03:04:48.960 --> 03:04:54.880
thinking about the united states perhaps as an empire i don't view the united states as an empire

03:04:55.680 --> 03:05:02.240
what's the what's the definite so to you empire is a thing that seeks expansion constantly

03:05:02.240 --> 03:05:09.120
yeah i i think it's a country uh that incorporates different

03:05:10.720 --> 03:05:18.160
regions or areas around the world uh into sort of a giant sphere of influence

03:05:18.800 --> 03:05:26.160
without incorporating those territories actually into the state itself

03:05:26.800 --> 03:05:32.560
so you had this thing called the british empire and it controlled areas like india

03:05:34.640 --> 03:05:35.840
north america

03:05:38.160 --> 03:05:45.280
and kenya just to pick a couple instances at different points singapore would be another

03:05:45.280 --> 03:05:52.720
example australia would be another example so these were all entities that were part of the

03:05:52.720 --> 03:06:00.800
british empire right and the united states has taken a stab at empire after the spanish

03:06:00.800 --> 03:06:09.200
american war for example with regard to the philippines and cuba and puerto rico but we

03:06:09.200 --> 03:06:14.320
never got serious about it there's never been an american empire this is not to say the united

03:06:14.320 --> 03:06:20.400
states is not an incredibly powerful country that goes all around the world building military bases

03:06:20.400 --> 03:06:26.800
and stationing troops here there and everywhere but we're not running an empire the way the british

03:06:27.680 --> 03:06:35.840
empire was run or the french empire so the question for me is why did those empires go away

03:06:37.200 --> 03:06:43.760
why did the british empire go away if you ever look at a map of the world in 1922 after world

03:06:43.760 --> 03:06:50.800
war one it's truly amazing how much of that map is controlled by britain right they had a huge

03:06:50.800 --> 03:06:57.600
empire and it's disappeared probably by far the biggest in terms of area empire in human history

03:06:57.600 --> 03:07:05.600
i think so i think that's right it almost has to be yeah right it's crazy crazy yeah and then no

03:07:05.600 --> 03:07:11.360
longer no longer is the case yeah now i want to be clear the the americans have wielded

03:07:11.360 --> 03:07:16.960
it maybe even greater influence than britain did when it had its empire but i don't believe

03:07:16.960 --> 03:07:23.280
we have an empire that bears any resemblance to the british empire so the question is what

03:07:23.280 --> 03:07:28.320
happened to that british empire what happened to the french empire what happened to the belgian

03:07:28.320 --> 03:07:33.600
empire what happened to the dutch empire these were countries that had colonies all over the

03:07:33.600 --> 03:07:42.320
planet the dutch east indies right vietnam was you know french indo china where did those empires

03:07:42.320 --> 03:07:49.440
go two factors finished them off number one nationalism nationalism became a very powerful

03:07:49.440 --> 03:07:54.880
force in the 19th century it began to rear its head in the late 18th century and became a very

03:07:54.880 --> 03:07:59.920
powerful force in the 19th and certainly in the 20th can you explain nationalism here nationalism

03:07:59.920 --> 03:08:06.880
is the idea that these different nations that were part of the empire like the canyons wanted

03:08:06.880 --> 03:08:12.320
their own state nation state this is my point about the palestinians right this palestinian

03:08:12.320 --> 03:08:20.000
nationalism what is zionism zionism is jewish nationalism jewish nationalism think of theodor

03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:27.120
herzl's famous book it's called the jewish state nation state think of the word nation state that

03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:33.920
embodies nationalism nation state jewish state palestinians want their own state two-state solution

03:08:33.920 --> 03:08:40.400
right can't beat the palestinians into submission right the indians wanted their own state the

03:08:40.400 --> 03:08:45.600
pakistanis wanted their own state the kenyans wanted their own state singapore wanted its own

03:08:45.600 --> 03:08:50.320
state oh the americans wanted their own state this is called the american revolution yeah right

03:08:51.040 --> 03:08:58.000
so that's the first reason nationalism that these empires disappeared the second reason is

03:08:58.000 --> 03:09:04.480
that from a cost-benefit analysis they no longer made any sense and it was the coming of the

03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:10.000
industrial revolution once the industrial revolution comes an empire is basically an

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:14.960
albatross around your neck i would argue that the british empire was an albatross around britain's

03:09:14.960 --> 03:09:19.680
neck in most of the 20th century some of my friends disagree with that and think there were

03:09:19.680 --> 03:09:26.480
all sorts of benefits from the british empire but you want to remember that in the 20th century

03:09:26.480 --> 03:09:34.080
the three countries that really were powerful were the united states germany and the soviet union

03:09:34.080 --> 03:09:41.760
those were the big three did any of them have an empire no that's a good card in the industrial

03:09:41.840 --> 03:09:49.600
world yes you don't need you know uh an empire right what you need is a powerful manufacturing

03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:54.160
base well the the cost-benefit analysis is different before the industrial revolution

03:09:54.160 --> 03:10:00.240
there's been many empires there's no question empires came and went right i mean

03:10:01.120 --> 03:10:08.480
right and all you have to do is just look at the british and the french in the seven years war 1756

03:10:08.480 --> 03:10:17.840
to 1763 the british win they get canada right and that's why you know cubac montreal all these big

03:10:17.840 --> 03:10:28.400
french-speaking areas are now part of uh canada right uh so borders change in you know countries

03:10:28.400 --> 03:10:34.000
got established the united states being won and remember south america and central america were

03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:39.600
once completely dominated by the spanish and in the case of brazil the portuguese

03:10:40.400 --> 03:10:48.000
but uh they all in the 19th century got their independence right and what i'm saying to you is

03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:53.840
in the 19th and in the 20th century there were two forces that were really driving the train one is

03:10:53.840 --> 03:11:00.240
nationalism and then the other is the industrial revolution which changes the cost-benefit analysis

03:11:01.120 --> 03:11:07.440
i'm almost too crazy of a question but if you look let me calculate let's say 500 years from now

03:11:08.160 --> 03:11:13.920
and you you you you john mr somehow traveled through time and are at a bookstore

03:11:14.560 --> 03:11:19.520
looking at the uh entire history of human civilization in a single book what role does

03:11:19.520 --> 03:11:25.600
us play like what's the story of us over the next 100 200 300 years

03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:29.600
years is it a big role small role

03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:39.760
well that's a long time if you were you asked me let's just say the next 100 years yeah that's

03:11:39.760 --> 03:11:46.320
okay that's still tough that's still tough but actually you know i think we're in excellent

03:11:46.320 --> 03:11:53.920
shape and here's the reason going back to the beginning of our conversation you asked me

03:11:54.720 --> 03:12:01.120
you know about power and i told you the two principal building blocks of power are population

03:12:01.120 --> 03:12:08.880
size and wealth okay and therefore you want to look around the world and you want to look at

03:12:09.520 --> 03:12:16.880
what you think the demographics are of countries like britain the united states

03:12:17.280 --> 03:12:26.320
uh iran uh china russia pick your country moving forward right what the demographics look like

03:12:26.320 --> 03:12:32.720
and how wealthy of those are those countries likely to be what you discover very quickly

03:12:32.720 --> 03:12:40.400
and is that almost every country around the world is depopulating over time right russia's going to

03:12:40.400 --> 03:12:46.480
be much smaller china's going to be much smaller 100 years from now than both of those countries

03:12:47.440 --> 03:12:55.120
are as best we can tell the united states american women are not having lots of babies these days

03:12:55.920 --> 03:13:01.680
no question about that but we have immigration we're an immigrant culture you're a perfect

03:13:01.680 --> 03:13:07.440
manifestation of that yeah perfect you're now an american that's wonderful we need more people

03:13:07.440 --> 03:13:14.240
like you right so when i hear donald trump and others arguing that immigration is a terrible

03:13:14.240 --> 03:13:21.360
thing this is ridiculous error immigration is what made us great right it's when my relatives

03:13:21.360 --> 03:13:27.120
came over in the middle of the 19th century from germany and ireland right that's fascinating like

03:13:27.120 --> 03:13:33.360
you know because it's you know there's been a huge concern that america and other developed nations

03:13:33.360 --> 03:13:40.640
are not having enough children but you you just made me realize in the long arc of history the

03:13:40.640 --> 03:13:47.200
united states has gotten really damn good at integrating immigrants and you and like helping

03:13:47.200 --> 03:13:53.360
them flourish the whole diversity of uh that makes up america right there's a machinery of

03:13:53.360 --> 03:14:00.560
integrating other cultures yeah just very quickly on this that's sam honeyton's book who are we

03:14:02.720 --> 03:14:09.760
which in many ways i love that book but it has one fundamental flaw and a number of people told

03:14:09.760 --> 03:14:16.240
him beforehand that that flaw existed and he didn't fix it but sam argues in the book that

03:14:16.240 --> 03:14:23.280
we have large numbers of hispanics in this country and we're doing a very poor job of

03:14:23.280 --> 03:14:29.360
integrating them into the mainstream and they're not becoming americans and because many of them

03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:34.080
are concentrated in the southwest of the united states unlike other ethnic groups that were

03:14:34.080 --> 03:14:40.720
spread out all over god's little green acre right we're going to have this cohesive group

03:14:40.720 --> 03:14:48.000
of spanish-speaking americans right who are going to want to break away and the united states is

03:14:48.640 --> 03:14:56.960
no longer going to be you know a reasonably coherent nation state he's wrong the all the

03:14:57.040 --> 03:15:02.640
evidence is that hispanics are integrating into the american mainstream

03:15:04.080 --> 03:15:10.080
more quickly and more effectively than the european and economic the european immigrant groups that

03:15:10.080 --> 03:15:15.840
came starting around 1835 if you look at immigration from europe into the united states

03:15:15.840 --> 03:15:21.760
leaving aside the original wasps who came over and founded the place the immigrants start coming in

03:15:21.760 --> 03:15:28.960
large numbers in 1835 and we really don't shut the door until 1924 right starting this is a

03:15:28.960 --> 03:15:36.720
crude overview starting in 1835 and running up to about 1885 it's mainly germans and irish that's

03:15:36.720 --> 03:15:41.840
why germans are the largest ethnic group to ever come to the united states and the irish are right

03:15:41.840 --> 03:15:48.560
behind them these are the european ethnic groups we're talking about then starting in 1885 poles

03:15:48.560 --> 03:15:55.520
jews and italians start coming right and the germans and irish keep coming and this is why

03:15:55.520 --> 03:16:02.800
ellis island is opened i think it's 1893 ellis island is open because castle garden in new york

03:16:02.800 --> 03:16:08.640
which had handled all the previous immigrants coming across the pond castle garden couldn't

03:16:08.640 --> 03:16:14.880
handle them all so they opened up ellis island that's why somebody like me i can't find my

03:16:14.880 --> 03:16:20.400
distant relatives records in ellis island because they came through castle garden

03:16:20.400 --> 03:16:26.560
right whereas lots of jews i know lots of italians i know they could find their relatives records

03:16:26.560 --> 03:16:31.440
in ellis island because they came through ellis island the point is you had all these immigrants

03:16:31.440 --> 03:16:37.760
who came in roughly between 1835 and 1924 when we shut the gates this is the only time we've ever

03:16:37.760 --> 03:16:43.840
really shut the gates in a meaningful way right and this is what made america great right all

03:16:43.840 --> 03:16:49.360
these people and they made lots of babies right so in some sense make america great again means

03:16:49.360 --> 03:16:56.400
getting in getting more immigrants in well we opened the gates again in 65 closed them in 24

03:16:56.400 --> 03:17:01.280
opened them in 65 i'm oversimplifying the story here because we didn't completely shut them we

03:17:01.280 --> 03:17:08.240
almost completely shut them in 24 opened in 65 and we've had huge numbers of immigrants flowing

03:17:08.240 --> 03:17:14.640
in these immigrants who have been flowing in since 65 are not europeans they're not

03:17:14.640 --> 03:17:22.000
mainly europeans they're mainly hispanics and asians if you look at those hispanics and asians

03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:29.760
they're integrating into the american mainstream at a much faster and more effective clip

03:17:29.760 --> 03:17:35.760
than was the case with those immigrants who come it came in in the 19th century and early 20th

03:17:35.760 --> 03:17:42.480
century the irish oh my god you know they were treated horribly there's a book a very famous

03:17:42.480 --> 03:17:48.320
book that's been written called when the irish became white just think about the title of that

03:17:48.320 --> 03:17:53.680
book there was discrimination against all these groups right and the worst discrimination of

03:17:53.680 --> 03:18:02.080
course was against chinese americans right but we've gotten much better and what we should do

03:18:02.080 --> 03:18:08.800
moving forward is redouble our efforts to integrate immigrants into the american

03:18:08.800 --> 03:18:17.440
mainstream you know hispanics you know asians of all sorts because the fact is that america

03:18:17.440 --> 03:18:25.040
is rapidly reaching the point where it's not going to be an all white country right i have

03:18:25.040 --> 03:18:30.560
five children and two of my children are i was a generation z gen z

03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:34.800
gen z is the last majority white

03:18:37.360 --> 03:18:41.840
generation right subsequent generations are not majority white

03:18:43.440 --> 03:18:48.720
so for anybody who's bothered by this i'm not bothered by that but for anybody who is bothered

03:18:48.720 --> 03:18:57.280
by this they better get used to it because americans aren't making enough babies that we

03:18:57.280 --> 03:19:04.960
can continue to grow population wise in a robust way so we need immigration and we're an immigrant

03:19:04.960 --> 03:19:11.600
culture and this is a great virtue it has been a great virtue over time should be a source of hope

03:19:11.600 --> 03:19:20.480
not worry that's my view that's my view and america when it works is a place that is very

03:19:20.480 --> 03:19:27.200
attractive to immigrants and immigrants can do very well here and and then the real key moving

03:19:27.200 --> 03:19:33.840
forward is intermarriage right and you have a huge amount of intermarriage right somebody was

03:19:33.840 --> 03:19:38.320
telling me not too long ago that the highest intermarriage rates in the united states are among

03:19:38.320 --> 03:19:45.440
asian women asian american women asian women and anglos right and i say wonderful

03:19:46.800 --> 03:19:53.600
and great yeah no the more of love is the fastest way to integrate yeah well you don't

03:19:54.240 --> 03:20:00.160
what you want to do is you want to eliminate difference right you want to eliminate difference

03:20:00.160 --> 03:20:06.640
right it's like you know people who say i'm an anti-semi right i have two grandsons

03:20:07.200 --> 03:20:13.040
who adolf hitler would have thrown into a gas chamber one of whose first name is john and

03:20:13.040 --> 03:20:20.800
middle name is meersheimer right yeah this is what you want yeah right steve waltz wife

03:20:20.800 --> 03:20:26.480
and his two children would have been thrown into a gas chamber by adolf hitler right this is what

03:20:26.480 --> 03:20:31.200
you want you want intermarriage now there are a good number of people in some of those groups

03:20:31.200 --> 03:20:37.280
especially among jews who don't like intermarriage right but they've lost because i

03:20:37.280 --> 03:20:44.560
haven't looked recently at the data the data among for intermarriage rates among basically

03:20:44.560 --> 03:20:51.840
secular jews but it used to be around 62 large numbers of jews marry goyum and they've lost

03:20:51.840 --> 03:20:58.480
because of intermarriage intermarriage helps fight tribalism destructive kind of tribalism

03:20:58.480 --> 03:21:05.920
that's nice calling me an anti-semite they haven't met my grandsons my son-in-law nieces

03:21:05.920 --> 03:21:13.440
that i a niece that i have nephews that i have brother-in-laws that i have jewish right come on

03:21:14.480 --> 03:21:19.840
and then this this gives a really nice hopeful view of america is is is the integration of

03:21:19.840 --> 03:21:25.360
different different cultures different kinds of peoples that is a unique property of america yes

03:21:25.360 --> 03:21:30.640
but just to go back to where we started it was not smooth in the beginning all things are rough

03:21:30.640 --> 03:21:36.400
in the beginning all things are rough in the beginning what advice would you give to a young

03:21:36.400 --> 03:21:42.640
person today about how to have a career they can be proud of our life they can be proud of well i

03:21:42.640 --> 03:21:51.920
think it's very important to make sure that you do something in life that really interests you my

03:21:51.920 --> 03:21:56.800
mother used to use this phrase floats your boat you want to do something that floats your boat

03:21:56.800 --> 03:22:02.240
or to use another one of my mother's phrase phrases you want to get up you want to do something where

03:22:02.240 --> 03:22:08.160
you get up out of bed in the morning with a bounce in your step right so i think that you know if your

03:22:08.160 --> 03:22:12.160
mother and father want you to be a lawyer and they're pushing you to be a lawyer and you don't

03:22:12.160 --> 03:22:18.960
want to be a lawyer you want to be a policeman be a policeman right don't do what other people want

03:22:18.960 --> 03:22:26.560
you to do because it's very important to find a job and occupation that you really love the second

03:22:26.560 --> 03:22:35.360
thing i would say and this has to do with your point about humility you want to think about the

03:22:35.360 --> 03:22:42.480
humility hubris index my friend steve van ever who teaches at mit he and i invented this concept we

03:22:42.560 --> 03:22:49.760
call it the hubris humility index and you want to have a healthy dose of humility but you also

03:22:49.760 --> 03:22:56.400
want to have a healthy dose of hubris you want to think you can change the world you want to think

03:22:56.400 --> 03:23:02.480
you can make things better for yourself you want to take chances you want to think sometimes that

03:23:02.480 --> 03:23:08.400
you know better than other people do hubris is not a bad thing but at the same time you have to have

03:23:08.400 --> 03:23:15.440
humility yeah you have to understand that a man or a woman has his or her limits and you want to

03:23:15.440 --> 03:23:21.760
listen to other people you want to be a good listener right so always remember the importance

03:23:21.760 --> 03:23:30.320
of the hubris humility index and the importance of having healthy doses of both hubris and humility

03:23:30.960 --> 03:23:37.600
speaking of humility you're mortal like all humans are do you ponder your mortality

03:23:38.240 --> 03:23:43.920
are you afraid of it are you afraid of death i'm not sure i'm afraid of death

03:23:45.360 --> 03:23:54.560
i i don't want to die because i enjoy life so much fun yeah i you know given how horrible the

03:23:54.560 --> 03:24:02.800
world is today i hate to it i hate to say that i'm having too much fun but do i find what i do

03:24:03.600 --> 03:24:13.520
interesting and gratifying i i do i just love what i do and i love studying you know international

03:24:13.520 --> 03:24:20.000
politics and i love being intellectually curious about all sorts of subjects i love talking to you

03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:25.680
about this and that i mean this is really wonderful and i often tell people you know

03:24:25.680 --> 03:24:31.680
thank goodness i'm only 28 years old because i do try to behave like i'm only 28 years old

03:24:31.680 --> 03:24:39.040
but i am well aware of the fact that as my mother used to say nothing is forever and that includes

03:24:39.040 --> 03:24:45.360
me and when you're 75 going on 76 you understand that you have a limited number of years left

03:24:46.320 --> 03:24:54.160
and i find that depressing because i've been i've been very lucky and and i feel like i've won the

03:24:54.160 --> 03:25:00.960
lottery and i'm very thankful for that and i'd like to you know make it last for as long as

03:25:00.960 --> 03:25:09.120
possible but i do understand that you know nothing is forever yeah the finiteness of things yeah

03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:13.280
you never think that when you're young i mean you know you think

03:25:14.480 --> 03:25:20.320
you're gonna live forever and you're just not gonna get old i never thought this would happen

03:25:20.320 --> 03:25:26.320
that i would become 75 years old well you you got you got so much energy and boldness and

03:25:26.320 --> 03:25:33.040
fearlessness and and excitement to you that i'm really grateful to see that especially given how

03:25:33.040 --> 03:25:40.800
much i'm sure you've been attacked for having uh bold ideas and presenting them and not losing

03:25:42.080 --> 03:25:48.960
yeah not losing that youthful energy is beautiful to see thank you not becoming cynical john it's

03:25:48.960 --> 03:25:54.080
