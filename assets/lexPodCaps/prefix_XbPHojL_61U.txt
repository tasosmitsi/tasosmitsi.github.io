WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
Whenever we start a new project, it has to have these ingredients of simultaneous complexity.

00:06.160 --> 00:11.360
It has to be novel in terms of the synthetic biology, material science, robotics, engineering.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.800
All of these elements that are discipline-based or rooted must be novel.

00:16.800 --> 00:22.000
If you can combine novelty in synthetic biology with a novelty in robotics,

00:22.000 --> 00:25.760
with a novelty in material science, with a novelty in computational design,

00:25.760 --> 00:28.000
you are bound to create something novel.

00:30.560 --> 00:36.640
The following is a conversation with Neri Oxman, an engineer, scientist, designer, architect,

00:36.640 --> 00:42.240
artist, and one of the kindest, most thoughtful, and brilliant human beings I've gotten to know.

00:42.240 --> 00:48.400
For a long time, she led the mediated matter group at MIT that did research and built incredible

00:48.400 --> 00:53.920
stuff at the intersection of computational design, digital fabrication, material science,

00:53.920 --> 00:59.600
and synthetic biology, doing so at all scales, from the microscale to the building scale.

01:00.240 --> 01:06.000
Now, she's continuing this work at a very new company for now called Oxman, looking to

01:06.000 --> 01:12.080
revolutionize how humans design and build products working with nature, not against it.

01:12.880 --> 01:18.080
On a personal note, let me say that Neri has for a long time been a friend and someone who,

01:18.080 --> 01:22.960
in my darker moments, has always been there with a note of kindness and support.

01:22.960 --> 01:28.000
I am forever grateful to her. She's a brilliant and a beautiful human being.

01:28.720 --> 01:36.560
Oh, and she also brought me a present, War and Peace by Tolstoy, and Meditations by Marcus

01:36.560 --> 01:42.560
Aurelius. It doesn't get better than that. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it,

01:42.560 --> 01:48.400
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Neri Oxman.

01:49.520 --> 01:53.520
Let's start with the universe. Do you ever think of the universe as a kind of machine

01:53.520 --> 01:56.160
that designs beautiful things at multiple scales?

01:56.800 --> 02:05.920
I do. And I think of nature in that way, in general, in the context of design, specifically.

02:06.800 --> 02:13.440
I think of nature as everything that isn't anthropomast, everything that is not produced

02:13.440 --> 02:19.680
by humankind. The birds and the rocks and everything in between, fungi, elephants, whales.

02:19.680 --> 02:23.920
Do you think there's an intricate way in which there's a connection between humans and nature?

02:23.920 --> 02:30.320
Yes. And we're looking for it. I think that from, let's say, from the beginning of mankind,

02:31.120 --> 02:39.040
going back 200,000 years, the products that we have designed have separated us from nature.

02:39.760 --> 02:45.520
And it's ironic that the things that we designed and produced as humankind, those are exactly the

02:45.520 --> 02:52.720
things that separated us. Before that, we were totally and completely connected. And I want to

02:52.720 --> 02:57.040
return to that world. But bring the tools of engineering and computation to it.

02:57.040 --> 03:05.120
Yes. Yes. I absolutely believe that there is so much to nature that we still have not leveraged

03:05.920 --> 03:10.880
and we still have not understood and we still haven't. And so much of our work is design,

03:10.880 --> 03:19.360
but a lot of it is science, is unveiling and finding new truths about the natural world that

03:19.360 --> 03:26.160
we were not aware of before. Everybody talks about intelligence these days, but I like to think that

03:26.160 --> 03:33.920
nature has a kind of wisdom that exists beyond intelligence or above intelligence. And it's that

03:33.920 --> 03:40.400
wisdom that we're trying to tap into through technology. If you think about humans versus

03:40.400 --> 03:46.880
nature, at least in the realm, at least in the context of definition of nature as everything but

03:48.400 --> 03:54.080
anthropomast, and I'm using Ron Milo, who is an incredible professor from the Weizmann Institute,

03:54.080 --> 04:01.920
who came up with this definition of anthropomast in 2020, when he identified that 2020 was the

04:01.920 --> 04:09.920
crossover year when anthropomast exceeded biomass on the planet. So all of the design goods that we

04:09.920 --> 04:16.800
have created and brought into the world now outweigh all of the biomass, including, of course,

04:16.800 --> 04:24.640
all plastics and wearables building cities, but also asphalt and concrete all outweigh the scale

04:24.640 --> 04:28.640
of the biomass. And actually that was a moment. You know how in life there are moments that,

04:29.600 --> 04:36.640
there may be a handful of moments that get you to course correct. And my, it was a Zoom

04:36.640 --> 04:43.280
conversation with Ron, and that was a moment for me when I realized that that imbalance,

04:43.840 --> 04:50.800
now we've superseded the biomass on the planet. Where do we go from here? And you've heard the

04:50.800 --> 04:55.040
expression more phones than bones and the anthropomast and the anthropocene

04:55.440 --> 05:03.360
and the technosphere sort of outweighing the biosphere. But now we are really trying to look

05:03.360 --> 05:12.160
at is there a way in which all things technosphere are designed as if they are part of the biosphere,

05:12.160 --> 05:19.120
meaning if you could today grow instead of build everything and anything, if you could grow an

05:19.840 --> 05:26.800
iPhone, if you could grow a car, what would that world look like? Where the Turing test for sort

05:26.800 --> 05:32.960
of this kind of, I call this material ecology approach, but this notion that everything

05:32.960 --> 05:41.760
material, everything that you design in the physical universe can be read and written to

05:43.120 --> 05:48.480
or thought of or perceived of as nature grown. That's sort of the Turing test for the company,

05:48.480 --> 05:52.800
or at least that's how I started. I thought, well, grow everything. That's sort of the slogan.

05:52.800 --> 06:00.880
Let's grow everything. And if we grow everything, is there a world in which driving a car is better

06:00.880 --> 06:08.560
for nature than a world in which there are no cars? Is it possible that a world in which

06:09.680 --> 06:14.960
you build buildings in cities, that those buildings and cities actually augment and

06:14.960 --> 06:21.760
heal nature as opposed to their absence? Is there a world in which we now go back to that kind of

06:21.760 --> 06:28.160
synergy between nature and humans, where you cannot separate between grown and made,

06:28.160 --> 06:34.080
and it doesn't even matter? Is there a good term for the intersection between biomass and

06:34.080 --> 06:40.080
anthropomass, like things that are grown? Yes. So in 2005, I called this material ecology. I

06:40.080 --> 06:46.400
thought, well, what if all things materials would be considered part of the ecology and would have

06:46.400 --> 06:53.120
a positive impact on the ecology, where we work together to help each other, all things nature,

06:53.120 --> 06:59.360
all things human? And again, you can say that that wisdom in nature exists in fungi. Many mushroom

06:59.360 --> 07:06.400
lovers always contest my thesis here saying, well, we have the mushroom network and we have

07:06.400 --> 07:11.840
the mother trees and they're all connected. And why don't we just simply hack into mushrooms?

07:11.840 --> 07:18.080
Well, first of all, yes, they're connected, but that network stops when there is a physical gap.

07:18.080 --> 07:25.680
That network does not necessarily enable the whales in the Dominican to connect with an olive

07:25.680 --> 07:30.320
tree in Israel, to connect with a weeping willow in Montana. And that's sort of a world that I'm

07:30.320 --> 07:37.520
dreaming about. What does it mean for nature to have access to the cloud? The kind of bandwidth

07:37.520 --> 07:46.960
that we're talking about, sort of think Neuralink for nature. Since the first computer, and you know

07:46.960 --> 07:54.400
this by heart, probably better than I do, but we're both MIT lifers. We today have computational

07:54.400 --> 08:03.760
power that is one trillion times the power that we had in those times. We have 26.5 trillion times

08:03.760 --> 08:14.400
the bandwidth and 11.5 quintillion times the memory, which is incredible. So humankind,

08:14.400 --> 08:22.320
since the first computer, has approached and accessed such incredible bandwidth. And we're

08:22.320 --> 08:28.720
asking, well, what if nature had that bandwidth? So beyond genes and evolution, if there was a way

08:28.720 --> 08:35.200
to augment nature and allow it access to the world of bits, what does nature look like now?

08:35.920 --> 08:43.120
And can nature make decisions for herself as opposed to being guided and guarded and

08:43.120 --> 08:50.480
abused by humankind? So nature has this inherent wisdom that you spoke to, but you're also referring

08:50.480 --> 08:57.840
to augmenting that inherent wisdom with something like a large language model. Exactly. So compress

08:57.840 --> 09:05.200
human knowledge, but also maintain whatever is that intricate wisdom that allows plants, bacteria,

09:05.200 --> 09:11.200
fungi to grow incredible things at arbitrary scales, adapting to whatever environment and

09:11.200 --> 09:15.920
just surviving and thriving no matter where, no matter how. Exactly. So I think of it as

09:15.920 --> 09:22.320
large molecule models. And those large molecule models, of course, large language models are

09:22.320 --> 09:30.000
based on Google and search engines and so on and so forth. And we don't have this data currently.

09:30.000 --> 09:39.040
And part of our mission is to do just that, trying to quantify and understand the language

09:39.680 --> 09:43.760
that exists across all kingdoms of life, across all five kingdoms of life.

09:44.560 --> 09:50.960
And if we can understand that language, is there a way for us to first make sense of it, find logic

09:50.960 --> 09:59.200
in it, and then generate certain computational tools that empower nature to build better crops,

09:59.200 --> 10:05.280
to increase the level of biodiversity? In the company, we're constantly asking, what does nature

10:05.280 --> 10:14.480
want? What does nature want from a compute view? If it knew it, what could aid it in whatever the

10:14.480 --> 10:21.840
heck it's wanting to do? Yeah. So we keep coming back to this answer of nature wants to increase

10:22.640 --> 10:30.000
information, but decrease entropy, right? So find order, but constantly increase the information

10:30.080 --> 10:36.160
scale. And this is true for what our work also tries to do, because we're constantly trying to

10:37.200 --> 10:42.080
fight against the dimensional mismatch between things made and things grown, right? And as

10:42.080 --> 10:47.120
designers, we are educated to think in X, Y, and Z. And that's pretty much where architectural

10:47.120 --> 10:53.280
education ends and biological education begins. So in reducing that dimensional mismatch, we're

10:53.280 --> 10:57.920
missing out on opportunities to create things made as if grown. But in the natural environment,

10:57.920 --> 11:05.840
we're asking, can we provide nature with these extra dimensions? And again, I'm not sure what

11:05.840 --> 11:12.240
nature wants, but I'm curious as to what happens when you provide these tools to the natural

11:12.240 --> 11:16.720
environments, obviously with responsibility, obviously with control, obviously with ethics

11:16.720 --> 11:25.760
and moral code. But is there a world in which nature can help fix itself using those tools?

11:26.240 --> 11:30.160
And by the way, we're talking about a company called Oxman.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.880
Yeah. I'll just, just a few words about the team.

11:32.880 --> 11:36.880
Yeah. What kind of humans work at a place like this? They're trying to figure out what nature

11:36.880 --> 11:42.880
wants. You know, I think they're first like you, they're humanists first. They come from

11:42.880 --> 11:49.040
different disciplines and different disciplinary backgrounds. And just as an example, we have a

11:49.040 --> 11:54.560
brilliant designer who is just a mathematical genius and a computer scientist and a mechanical

11:54.560 --> 12:02.720
engineer who is trained as a synthetic biologist. And now we're hiring a microbiologist

12:03.360 --> 12:10.160
and a chemist, architects, of course, and designers, roboticists. So it's really,

12:11.040 --> 12:15.680
it's Noah's Ark, right? Two of each. And always dancing between this line of the

12:15.680 --> 12:20.880
artificial, the synthetic and the real. What's the term for it? And the natural.

12:20.880 --> 12:25.120
Yeah, the built and the grown, nature and culture, technology and biology. But

12:26.320 --> 12:34.320
we're constantly seeking to ask how can we build, design, and deploy products in three scales.

12:34.880 --> 12:41.680
The molecular scale, which I briefly hinted to. And there, in the molecular scale, we're really

12:41.680 --> 12:47.840
looking to understand whether there is a universal language to nature and what that language is.

12:48.480 --> 12:55.760
And then build a tool that I think and dream of it as the iPhone for nature. If nature had an

12:55.760 --> 13:02.480
iPhone, what would that iPhone look like? Does that mean creating an interface

13:03.840 --> 13:06.960
between nature and the computational tools we have?

13:06.960 --> 13:13.760
Exactly. It goes back to that 11.5 quintillion times the bandwidth that humans have now arrived

13:13.760 --> 13:20.320
at and giving that to nature and seeing what happens there. Can animals actually use this

13:21.120 --> 13:27.520
interface to know that they need to run away from fire? Can plants use this interface to increase

13:27.520 --> 13:32.800
the rate of photosynthesis in the presence of a smoke cloud? Can they do this quote unquote

13:32.800 --> 13:40.720
automatically without a kind of a top down brute force policy based method that's authored and

13:40.720 --> 13:45.840
deployed by humans? And so this work really relates to that interface with the natural world.

13:45.840 --> 13:50.560
And then there's a second area in the company which focuses on growing products.

13:52.000 --> 13:59.520
And here we're focusing on a single product that starts from CO2. It becomes a product,

13:59.520 --> 14:08.400
it's consumed, it's used, it's worn by a human, and then it goes back to the soil and it grows

14:08.400 --> 14:12.880
an edible fruit plant. So we're talking about from CO2 to fruit.

14:12.880 --> 14:16.880
Yeah. It starts from CO2 and it ends with something that you can literally eat.

14:18.400 --> 14:24.320
So the world's first entirely biodegradable, biocompatible, biorenewable product.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.080
That's grown. Yes.

14:26.080 --> 14:32.080
Either using plant matter or using bacteria. But we are really looking at carbon recycling

14:32.080 --> 14:38.480
technologies that start with methane or wastewater and end with this wonderful

14:38.480 --> 14:46.160
reincarnation of a thing that doesn't need to end up in a composting site but can just be thrown

14:46.160 --> 14:51.680
into the ground and grow olive and find peace. And there's a lot of textile-based work out there

14:51.680 --> 14:59.360
that is focused on one single element in this long chain, like, oh, let's create leather out

14:59.360 --> 15:05.600
of mycelium or let's create textile out of cellulose. But then it stops there and you get

15:05.600 --> 15:10.800
to assembling the shoe or the wearable and you need a little bit of glue and you need a little

15:10.800 --> 15:15.440
bit of this material and a little bit of that material to make it water-resistant and then it's

15:15.440 --> 15:21.520
over. So that's one thing that we're trying to solve for is how to create a product that is

15:21.520 --> 15:28.640
materially, computationally, robotically novel and goes through all of these phases from the creation,

15:28.640 --> 15:35.840
from this carbon recycling technology to the product, to literally how do you think about

15:36.800 --> 15:43.200
reinventing an industry that is focused on assembly and putting things together and using

15:43.200 --> 15:48.640
humans to do that? Can that happen just using robots and microbes and that's it?

15:48.640 --> 15:52.960
And doing it end to end. I would love to see what this factory looks like.

15:53.600 --> 15:59.440
And the factory is great too. I'm very, very excited. In October, we'll share first

16:00.720 --> 16:05.360
renditions of some of this work and in February, we'll invite you to the lab.

16:05.360 --> 16:10.960
I'm there. I've already applied. I can't, I haven't heard back. I don't understand. Okay.

16:12.480 --> 16:17.120
Just before we get to number three, it'd be amazing to just talk about what it takes

16:17.120 --> 16:22.160
with robotic arms or in general, the whole process of how to build the life form,

16:22.160 --> 16:26.080
stuff you've done in the past, maybe stuff you're doing now, how to use bacteria,

16:26.080 --> 16:30.400
it's kind of synthetic biology, how to grow stuff by leveraging bacteria.

16:30.400 --> 16:35.520
Is there examples from the past? Yes, and just take a step back over the 10 years,

16:35.520 --> 16:42.480
the mediated matter group, which was my group at MIT, has sort of dedicated itself to,

16:43.280 --> 16:47.760
biobased design would be a suitcase word, but sort of thinking about that synergy between

16:48.320 --> 16:54.320
nature and culture, biology and technology. And we attempted to build a suite of embodiments,

16:54.320 --> 17:00.880
let's say that they ended up in amazing museums and amazing shows. And we wrote patents and papers

17:00.880 --> 17:07.440
on them, but they were still N of ones. Again, the challenge, as you say, was to grow them.

17:07.440 --> 17:13.760
And we classified them into fibers, cellular solids, biopolymers, pigments. And in each of

17:13.760 --> 17:18.640
the examples, although the material was different, sometimes we used fibers, sometimes we used silk

17:18.640 --> 17:23.920
with silkworms and honey with bees or comb as the structural material. With Vespers, we used

17:23.920 --> 17:29.360
synthetically engineered bacteria to produce pigments. Although the materials were different

17:29.360 --> 17:33.440
and the hero organisms were different, the philosophy was always the same. The approach

17:33.440 --> 17:39.760
was really an approach of computational templating. That templating allowed us to create

17:39.840 --> 17:43.840
templates for the natural environment where nature and technology could

17:45.520 --> 17:50.400
do it, could dance together to create these products. So just as a few examples with

17:51.200 --> 17:57.440
silk pavilion, we've had a couple of pavilions made of silk. And the second one, which was the

17:57.440 --> 18:02.240
bigger one, which ended up at the Museum of Modern Art with my friend and incredible mentor,

18:02.240 --> 18:10.400
Paolo Antonelli, that pavilion was six meter tall and it was produced by silkworms. And there we had

18:11.440 --> 18:15.760
different types of templates. There were physical templates that were basically just these water

18:15.760 --> 18:20.720
soluble meshes upon which the silkworms were spinning. And then there were environmental

18:20.720 --> 18:26.400
templates, which was a robot basically applying a variation of environmental conditions such as

18:26.400 --> 18:30.720
heat and light to guide the movement of the silkworm. You're saying so many amazing things,

18:30.720 --> 18:35.440
and I'm trying not to interrupt you, but one of the things you've learned by observing, by

18:35.440 --> 18:43.040
doing science on these is that the environment defines the shape that they create or contributes

18:43.040 --> 18:48.480
or intricately plays with the shape they create. And that's one of the ways you can get to guide

18:48.480 --> 18:54.720
their work is by defining that environment. By the way, you said hero organism, which is an epic term.

18:55.600 --> 19:00.800
That means whatever is the biological living system that's doing the creation.

19:00.800 --> 19:05.280
And that's what's happening in pharma and biomaterials and by the way, precision ag and

19:06.560 --> 19:12.480
new food design technologies as people are betting on a hero organism is the sort of how I think of

19:12.480 --> 19:20.640
it. And the hero organism is sometimes it's the palm oil or it's the mycelium. There's a lot of

19:20.640 --> 19:28.880
mushrooms around for good and bad. And it's cellulose or it's fake bananas or the workhorse

19:28.880 --> 19:36.880
E. coli. But these hero organisms are being bedded on as like the, what's the one answer that solves

19:36.880 --> 19:44.640
everything? The tiker's guide? 42. 42. These are sort of the 42s of the enchanted new universe. And

19:45.280 --> 19:52.960
back at MIT, we said instead of betting on all of these organisms, let's approach them as almost

19:52.960 --> 19:58.560
like movement in a symphony. And let's kind of lean into what we can learn from each of these

19:58.560 --> 20:04.400
organisms in the context of building a project in an architectural scale. And those usually were

20:04.400 --> 20:11.360
pavilions. And then the computational templating is the way you guide the work of this. How many

20:11.360 --> 20:18.800
did you say? 17,000? 17,532. So each of these silkworms threads are about one mile

20:20.160 --> 20:25.600
in distance. And they're beautiful. And just thinking about the amount of material,

20:27.360 --> 20:34.800
it's a bit like thinking about the length of capillary vessels that grow in your belly when

20:34.800 --> 20:41.360
you're pregnant to feed that incredible new life form. It's just nature is amazing. But

20:41.360 --> 20:46.960
back to the silkworms, I think I had three months to build this incredible pavilion, but

20:48.240 --> 20:53.200
we couldn't figure out how we were thinking of emulating the process of how a silkworm goes

20:53.200 --> 20:58.720
about building its incredible architecture, this cocoon over the period of 24 to 72 hours.

20:59.520 --> 21:05.760
And it builds a cocoon basically to protect itself. It's a beautiful form of architecture.

21:05.760 --> 21:10.560
And it uses pretty much just two materials, two chemical compounds, sericin and

21:11.200 --> 21:17.120
fibrin. The sericin is sort of the glue of the cocoon. The fibrin is the fiber-based

21:17.120 --> 21:21.440
material of the cocoon and through fibers and glue. And that's true for so many systems in nature,

21:21.440 --> 21:28.400
lots of fiber and glue. And that architecture allows them to metamorphosize. And in the process,

21:28.400 --> 21:34.800
they vary the properties of that silk thread. So it's stiffer or softer depending on where it is

21:34.800 --> 21:41.040
in the section of the cocoon. And so we were trying to emulate this robotically with a 3D

21:41.040 --> 21:46.960
printer that was a six-axis kooka arm, one of these baby kookas. And we're trying to emulate

21:46.960 --> 21:52.880
that process computationally and build something very large when one of my students now, a brilliant

21:52.880 --> 21:58.720
industrial engineer, a roboticist on my team, Marcus said, well, we were just playing with

21:58.720 --> 22:07.040
those silkworms and enjoying their presence when we realized that if they're placed on a desk or a

22:07.040 --> 22:13.760
horizontal surface, they will go about creating their cocoon. Only the cocoon would be flat

22:15.520 --> 22:21.680
because they're constantly looking for a vertical post in order to use that post as an anchor to

22:21.680 --> 22:29.360
spin the cocoon. But in the absence of that post, on surfaces that are less than 21

22:29.360 --> 22:36.160
millimeters and flat, they will spin flat patches. And we say, aha, let's work with them

22:36.800 --> 22:46.400
to produce this dome as a set of flat patches. And a silkworm, mind you, is quite an egocentric

22:46.400 --> 22:52.640
creature. And actually, the further you go, you move forward in evolution by natural selection,

22:52.640 --> 22:59.360
the more egoism you find in creatures. So when you think about termites,

23:00.720 --> 23:08.240
their material sophistication is actually very primitive, but they have incredible ability to

23:08.240 --> 23:12.960
communicate and connect with each other. So if you think about the entire, all of nature,

23:12.960 --> 23:19.200
let's say all of living systems as a matrix that runs across two axes, one is material

23:19.200 --> 23:23.760
sophistication, which is terribly relevant for designers, and the other is communication.

23:26.720 --> 23:32.000
The termites ace on communication, but their material sophistication is crap. It's just saliva

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
and feces and some soil particles that are built to create these incredible termite mounds at the

23:38.000 --> 23:45.680
scale that, when compared to human skyscrapers, transcend all of buildable scales, at least in

23:45.680 --> 23:50.320
terms of what we have today in architectural practice, just relative to the size of the termite.

23:50.320 --> 23:55.840
But when you look at the silkworm, the silkworm has zero connection and communication across

23:55.840 --> 24:00.560
silkworms. They were not designed to connect and communicate with each other. They're sort of a

24:00.560 --> 24:09.120
human design species because the domesticated silk moth creates the cocoon. We then produce

24:09.120 --> 24:17.520
the silk of it and then it dies. So it has dysfunctional wings. It cannot fly. And that's

24:18.160 --> 24:25.760
another problem that the sericulture industry has is why did we in the first place author this

24:25.760 --> 24:32.720
organism 4,000 years ago that is unable to fly and is just there to basically live as,

24:34.080 --> 24:40.000
to serve a human need, which is textiles. And so here we were fascinated by the computational

24:40.960 --> 24:46.320
biology dimension of silkworms. But along the way, by the way, this is great. I never get

24:46.320 --> 24:53.280
to tell the full story. I'm so great. I'm always like people say, I always speak in Nietzschean

24:53.920 --> 24:56.640
paragraphs. They're way too long. And this is wonderful. This is like heaven.

24:59.040 --> 25:04.960
You're dropping so many good lines. I love it. But really those silkworms are not, yes,

25:04.960 --> 25:09.360
they're not designed to be like humans, right? They're not designed to connect, communicate,

25:09.360 --> 25:13.440
and build things that are bigger than themselves through connection and communication.

25:13.440 --> 25:16.000
So what happens when you had 17,000 of them communicating?

25:16.800 --> 25:23.680
That's a really great question. What happens is that at some point the templating strategies,

25:23.680 --> 25:28.800
and as you said correctly, there were geometrical templating, material templating,

25:28.800 --> 25:33.280
environmental templating, chemical templating, if you're using pheromones to guide the movement of

25:33.280 --> 25:40.720
bees in the absence of a queen where you have a robotic queen. But whenever you have these

25:40.720 --> 25:46.240
templating strategies, you have sort of control over nature, right? But the question is,

25:46.240 --> 25:50.240
is there a world in which we can move from templating, from providing these computational

25:51.040 --> 25:57.760
material and immaterial physical and molecular platforms that guide nature, almost guiding a

25:57.760 --> 26:04.160
product, almost like a gardener to a problem or an opportunity of emergence where that

26:04.160 --> 26:11.440
biological organism assumes agency by virtue of accessing the robotic code and saying,

26:11.440 --> 26:16.480
now I own the code, I get to do what I want with this code. Let me show you what this pavilion

26:16.480 --> 26:21.280
may look like or this product may look like. And I think one of the exciting moments for us is when

26:21.280 --> 26:29.040
we realized that these robotic platforms that were designed initially as templates actually inspired,

26:29.680 --> 26:35.920
if I may, a kind of collaboration and cooperation between silkworms that are

26:36.640 --> 26:40.880
not a swarm-based organism. They're not like the bees and the termites. They don't

26:41.520 --> 26:46.320
work together and they don't have, you know, social orders amongst them, the queen and the

26:46.320 --> 26:54.080
drones, et cetera. They're all the same in a way, right? And here what was so exciting for us is

26:54.080 --> 27:00.960
that these computational and fabrication technologies enable the silkworm to kind of

27:02.160 --> 27:09.200
hop from the branch in ecology of worms to the branch in ecology of maybe human-like

27:09.840 --> 27:15.520
intelligence where they could connect and communicate by virtue of feeling or rubbing

27:15.520 --> 27:22.160
against each other in an area that was hotter or colder. So the product that we got at the end,

27:22.160 --> 27:28.320
the variation of density of fiber and the distribution of the fiber and the transparency,

27:28.320 --> 27:35.280
the product at the end seems like it was produced by a swarm silk community, but of course it wasn't.

27:35.280 --> 27:39.600
It's a bunch of biological agents working together to assemble this thing. That's really,

27:39.600 --> 27:49.200
really fascinating to us. How can technology augment or enable a swarm-like behavior in

27:49.200 --> 27:56.640
creatures that have not been designed to work as swarms? So how do you construct a computational

27:56.640 --> 28:04.160
template from which a certain kind of thing emerges? So how can you predict what emerges,

28:04.160 --> 28:09.680
I suppose? So if you can predict it, it doesn't count as emergence. Actually,

28:11.840 --> 28:16.960
that's a deeply poetic line. We can talk about it. I mean, it's a bit like if you measure it,

28:16.960 --> 28:23.840
it doesn't count. Speaking of emergence and empowerment because we're constantly

28:26.000 --> 28:31.920
moving between those as if they're equals on the team. One of them, Christoph, shared with me

28:31.920 --> 28:38.720
a mathematical equation for what does it mean to empower nature and what does empowerment in nature

28:38.720 --> 28:44.880
look like? And that relates to emergence and we can go back to emergence in a few moments,

28:44.880 --> 28:52.240
but I want to say it so that I know that I've learned it. And if I've learned it,

28:52.240 --> 28:56.880
I can use it later. And maybe you'll figure something out as you say it also.

28:56.880 --> 29:03.680
Of course, Christoph is the master here, but really we were thinking, again, what does nature

29:03.680 --> 29:12.480
want? Nature wants to increase the information dimension and reduce entropy. What do we want?

29:12.480 --> 29:20.560
We kind of want the same thing. We want more, but we want order, right? And this goes back to

29:20.560 --> 29:25.680
your conversation with Josje about stochastic versus deterministic languages or processes.

29:26.320 --> 29:37.040
His definition or the definition he found was that an agent is empowered if the entropy of the

29:37.040 --> 29:45.920
distribution of all of its states is high, while the entropy of the distribution of a single state

29:45.920 --> 29:56.080
given a choice, given an action is low. Meaning it's that kind of duality between opportunity,

29:56.080 --> 30:03.120
starting like this and going like this, opening and closing. And this really I think is analogous to

30:03.120 --> 30:09.920
human empowerment. Given an infinite wide array of choices, what is the choice that you make

30:13.520 --> 30:18.800
to enable, to empower, to provide you with the agency that you need?

30:18.800 --> 30:23.920
And how much does making that choice actually control the trajectory of the system? That's

30:23.920 --> 30:28.000
really nice. So this applies to all the kinds of systems you're talking about.

30:28.080 --> 30:34.640
Yeah, and the cool thing is it can apply to a human on an individual basis, but or a silkworm

30:34.640 --> 30:43.440
or a bee or a microbe, a microbe that has agency or by virtue of a template. But it also applies

30:43.440 --> 30:49.440
to a community of organisms like the bees. And so we've done a lot of work sort of moving from,

30:49.440 --> 30:56.480
you've asked how to grow things. So we've grown things using co-fabrication, where we're

30:57.120 --> 31:03.840
digitally fabricating with other organisms that live across the various kingdoms of life. And

31:03.840 --> 31:12.240
those were silkworms and bees. And with bees, which we've sent to outer space and returned

31:12.240 --> 31:15.920
healthily and they were reproductive. You're going to have to tell that story.

31:15.920 --> 31:18.560
You're going to have to talk about the robotic queen and the pheromones.

31:20.560 --> 31:25.440
So we've built what we call a synthetic apiary. And the synthetic apiary was designed

31:25.920 --> 31:32.320
as an environment that was a perpetual spring environment for the bees of Massachusetts.

31:33.120 --> 31:37.920
They go on hibernation, of course, during the winter season. And then we lose 80% of them or

31:37.920 --> 31:42.880
more during that period. We're thinking, okay, what if we created this environment where

31:44.640 --> 31:49.680
before you template, right, before you can design with, you have to design for, right,

31:49.680 --> 31:56.800
you have to create this space of mutualism, space of sort of shared connection between

31:56.800 --> 32:00.160
you and the organism. And with bees, it started as the synthetic apiary.

32:00.720 --> 32:08.560
And we have proven that curated environment where we designed the space with high levels of control

32:08.560 --> 32:15.040
of temperature, humidity, and light. And we've proven that they were reproductive and alive.

32:15.040 --> 32:21.280
And we realized, wow, this environment that we created can help augment bees in the winter

32:21.280 --> 32:28.480
season in any city around the world where bees survive and thrive in the summer and spring

32:28.480 --> 32:34.240
seasons. And could this be a kind of a new urban typology, an architectural typology of symbiosis

32:34.240 --> 32:39.280
of mutualism between organisms and humans where these are, by the way, the synthetic apiary was

32:39.280 --> 32:48.880
in a co-op in nearby Somerville. We had robots, our team slept there every day with our tools

32:48.880 --> 32:53.200
and machines and we made it happen. And the neighbors were very happy and they got to get

32:53.200 --> 32:58.800
a ton of honey at the end of the winter. And those bees, of course, were released into the wild at

32:58.800 --> 33:05.040
the end of the winter alive and kicking. So then in order to actually experiment with the robotic

33:05.040 --> 33:12.160
queen and idea or concept, we had to prove obviously that we can create this space for

33:13.200 --> 33:18.880
bees. And then after that, we had this amazing opportunity to send the bees to space on Blue

33:18.880 --> 33:24.640
Shepherd mission that is part of Blue Origin. And we of course said, yes, we'll take a slot.

33:24.640 --> 33:30.240
We said, okay, can we outdo NASA? So NASA in 1982 had an experiment where they sent bees to

33:31.200 --> 33:39.280
outer space. The bees returned, they were not reproductive. And some of them died. And we

33:39.280 --> 33:44.880
thought, well, is there a way in which we can create a life support system almost like a small

33:44.880 --> 33:53.040
mini bio lab of a queen and her retinue that would be sent in this Blue Origin, New Shepherd mission

33:53.840 --> 33:59.440
in this one cell? And so if the synthetic apiary was an architectural project, in this case,

33:59.440 --> 34:06.400
the second synthetic apiary was a product. It was from an architectural controlled environment

34:06.400 --> 34:12.960
to a product scale controlled environment. And this bio lab, this life support system for bees

34:12.960 --> 34:19.360
was designed to provide the bees with all the conditions that they needed. And we looked at

34:19.360 --> 34:26.880
that time at the Nasinov pheromone that the queen uses to guide the other bees. And we looked at

34:26.880 --> 34:31.840
pheromones that are associated with a bee and thinking of those pheromones being released

34:31.840 --> 34:39.520
inside the capsule that goes to outer space. They returned back to the Media Lab roof.

34:40.400 --> 34:46.880
And those bees were alive and kicking and reproductive. And they continued to create

34:46.880 --> 34:53.600
comb. And it ended with a beautiful nature paper that the team and I published together.

34:54.400 --> 34:59.840
We gave them gold nanoparticles and silver nanoparticles because we were interested if

34:59.840 --> 35:07.600
bees recycle wax. It was known forever that bees do not recycle the wax. And by feeding them these

35:07.600 --> 35:14.800
gold nanoparticles, we were able to prove that the bees actually do recycle the wax.

35:14.800 --> 35:22.640
The reason I'm bringing this forward is because we don't view ourselves as designers of consumable

35:22.640 --> 35:28.720
products and architectural environments only. But we love that moment where these technologies,

35:28.720 --> 35:34.560
and by the way, every one of these projects that we created involved the creation of a new

35:34.560 --> 35:42.800
technology, whether it be a glass printer or the spinning robot or the life support system for the

35:42.800 --> 35:48.160
bee colony. They all involved a technology that was associated with the project. And I never,

35:48.160 --> 35:52.560
ever, ever, ever want to let that part go because I love technology so much.

35:54.400 --> 35:59.520
But also another element of this is that always these projects, if they're great,

35:59.520 --> 36:06.720
they reveal new knowledge about or new science about the topic that you're investigating,

36:06.720 --> 36:14.800
be it silkworms or bees or glass. That's why I say I always tell my team it should be at MoMA and

36:14.800 --> 36:18.960
the cover of Nature or Science at the same time. We don't separate between the art and the science.

36:19.840 --> 36:24.400
It's one of the same. So as you're creating the art, you're going to learn something about

36:24.400 --> 36:28.720
these organisms or something about these materials. Is there something that stands out to you about

36:28.720 --> 36:34.560
these hero organisms like bees, silkworms? You mentioned E. coli has its pros and cons,

36:34.560 --> 36:41.440
its bacteria. What have you learned that small or big that's interesting about these organisms?

36:41.440 --> 36:46.160
Yeah, that's a beautiful question. What have I learned? I've learned that

36:49.840 --> 36:54.160
we also worked with shrimp shells with Aguaja. We built this tower on the roof of Asif MoMA,

36:54.160 --> 37:01.200
which by a couple of months ago, until it was on the roof, we've shown the structure completely

37:01.200 --> 37:06.960
biodegrade into the, well, not completely, but almost completely biodegrade to the soil. And

37:06.960 --> 37:16.720
this notion that a product or an organism or part of that organism can reincarnate is a very,

37:16.720 --> 37:23.280
very moving thought to me because I want to believe that I believe in reincarnation.

37:23.920 --> 37:25.840
I want to believe that I believe.

37:25.840 --> 37:30.720
Yeah, that's my relationship with God. I like to believe in believing.

37:31.360 --> 37:38.880
Most great things in life are second derivatives of things, but that's part of another conversation.

37:38.880 --> 37:42.720
I feel like that's a quote that's going to take weeks to really internalize.

37:43.440 --> 37:50.960
That notion of I want you to want, or I need you to need, or that there's always something,

37:50.960 --> 37:57.200
a deeper truth behind what is on the surface. And so I like to go to the second and tertiary

37:57.760 --> 38:02.640
derivative of things and discover new truths about them through that. But

38:02.640 --> 38:04.560
what have I learned about organisms?

38:05.280 --> 38:07.040
And why don't you like E. coli?

38:07.040 --> 38:14.560
I like E. coli. And a lot of the work that we've done was not possible without our working on E.

38:14.560 --> 38:19.280
coli or other workhorse organisms like cyanobacteria.

38:19.280 --> 38:20.480
How are bacteria used?

38:20.480 --> 38:22.960
Death masks, the death masks.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.320
So what are death masks?

38:24.320 --> 38:30.000
So we did this project called Vespers, and those were basically death masks that was

38:30.000 --> 38:38.720
set as a process for designing a living product. What happens? I looked at, I remember looking at

38:38.720 --> 38:44.160
Beethoven's death masks and Agamemnon's death masks and just studying how they were created.

38:44.160 --> 38:49.440
And really, they were sort of geometrically attuned to the face of the dead.

38:49.520 --> 38:58.720
And what we wanted to do is create a death mask that was not based on the shape of the wearer,

38:58.720 --> 39:06.240
but rather was based on their legacy and their biology. And maybe we could harness a few stem

39:06.240 --> 39:12.880
cells there for future generations or contain the last breath. Lazarus, which preceded Vespers,

39:12.880 --> 39:18.800
was a project where we designed a mask to contain a single breath, the last breath of the wearer.

39:19.840 --> 39:25.680
And again, if I had access to these technologies today, I would totally reincorporate my

39:25.680 --> 39:32.240
grandmother's last breath in a product. So it was like an air memento. So with Vespers,

39:34.480 --> 39:44.640
we actually used E. coli to create pigmented masks, masks whose pigments would be recreated

39:44.640 --> 39:51.280
at the surface of the mask. And I'm skipping over a lot of content, but basically there were

39:51.280 --> 39:57.520
15 masks and they were created as three sets, the masks of the past, the mask of the present,

39:57.520 --> 40:03.360
and the mask of the future. The masks, there were five, five and five, and the masks of the past were

40:03.360 --> 40:13.520
based on ornaments and they were embedded with natural minerals like gold. Yes, yes, yes.

40:13.520 --> 40:19.200
And we're looking at pictures of these and they're gorgeous. Yes. Extremely delicate

40:19.200 --> 40:25.200
and interesting fractal patterns that are symmetrical. They look symmetrical, but they're

40:25.200 --> 40:32.080
not. We intended for you to be tricked and think that they're all symmetrical. But there's

40:32.080 --> 40:40.560
imperfections. There are imperfections by design. All of these forms and shapes and

40:41.360 --> 40:47.920
distribution of matter that you're looking at was entirely designed using a computational program.

40:47.920 --> 40:56.240
So none of it is manual. But long story short, the first collection is about the surface of the mask

40:56.240 --> 41:01.360
and the second collection, which you're looking at, is about the volume of the mask and what

41:01.360 --> 41:07.840
happens to the mask when all the colors from the surface, yes, enter the volume of the mask inside,

41:07.840 --> 41:13.760
create pockets and channels to guide life through them. They were incorporated with

41:13.760 --> 41:20.800
pigment-producing living organisms and then those organisms were templated to recreate the patterns

41:20.800 --> 41:27.280
of the original death masks. And so life recycles and re-begins and so on and so forth. The past

41:27.280 --> 41:33.120
meets the future, the future meets the past. From the surface to the volume, from death to life to

41:33.120 --> 41:39.120
death to life to death to life. And that, again, is a recurring theme in the projects that we take

41:39.120 --> 41:45.440
on. But there, from a technological perspective, what was interesting is that we embedded chemical

41:45.440 --> 41:54.000
signals in the jet, in the printer, and those chemical signals basically interacted with the

41:55.200 --> 42:02.240
pigment-producing bacteria, in this case E. coli, that were introduced on the surface of the mask.

42:02.240 --> 42:09.040
And those interactions between the chemical signals inside the resins and the bacteria

42:09.040 --> 42:13.920
at the surface of the mask at the resolution that is native to the printer, in this case,

42:13.920 --> 42:20.960
20 microns per voxel, allowed us to compute the exact patterns that we wanted to achieve.

42:20.960 --> 42:25.440
And we thought, well, if we can do this with pigments, can we do this with antibiotics?

42:25.440 --> 42:29.840
If we can do this with antibiotics, could we do it with melanin? And what are the implications?

42:29.840 --> 42:36.080
Again, this is a platform technology. Now that we have it, what are the actual real world

42:36.080 --> 42:43.600
implications and potential applications for this technology? And we started a new area.

42:43.600 --> 42:52.080
One of my students, Rachel, her PhD thesis was titled after this new class of materials

42:52.080 --> 42:58.720
that we created through this project, Vespers, hybrid living materials, HLMs. And these hybrid

42:58.720 --> 43:05.520
living materials really paved the way towards a whole other set of products that we've designed,

43:07.840 --> 43:12.480
like the work that we did with melanin for the Mandela Pavilion that we presented at SFMOMA,

43:13.440 --> 43:18.320
where, again, we're using the same principles of templating, in this case, not silkworms and

43:18.320 --> 43:27.120
not bees, but we're templating bacteria at a much, much, much more finer resolution.

43:27.120 --> 43:32.640
And now instead of templating using a robot, we're templating using a printer.

43:32.640 --> 43:38.640
But compute is very, very much part of it. And what's nice about bacteria, of course, is that

43:39.920 --> 43:45.280
from an ethical perspective, I think there's a range, right? So at the end of the silk pavilion,

43:45.280 --> 43:50.720
I got an email from a professor in Japan who has been working on transgenic silk and said,

43:50.720 --> 43:58.720
well, if you did this amazing silk pavilion, why don't we create, you know, glow-in-the-light silk

43:58.720 --> 44:08.880
dresses? And in order to create this glow-in-the-light silk, we need to apply genes

44:08.880 --> 44:15.280
that are taken from a spider to a silkworm. And this is what is known as a transgenic operation.

44:15.280 --> 44:22.080
And we said no. And that was for us a clear decision that no, we will work with these

44:22.080 --> 44:29.520
organisms as long as we know that what we are doing with them is not only better for humans,

44:29.520 --> 44:36.400
but it's also better for them. And again, just to remind you, I forget the exact number,

44:36.400 --> 44:43.440
but it's around a thousand cocoons per single shirt that are exterminated in India and China,

44:44.400 --> 44:54.160
in those sericulture industries that are being abused. Now, yes, this organism was designed

44:54.960 --> 45:07.040
to serve the human species, and maybe it's time to retire that conception of organisms that are

45:07.040 --> 45:13.120
designed for a human-centric world or human-centric set of applications. I don't feel the same way

45:13.120 --> 45:21.520
about E. coli. Not that I'm agnostic, organism agnostic, but still, I believe there's so much

45:21.520 --> 45:28.240
for us to do on this planet with bacteria. And so in general, your design principle is to

45:29.680 --> 45:36.560
grow cool stuff as a byproduct of the organism flourishing, so not using the organism.

45:36.560 --> 45:40.000
The win-win, the synergy, a whole that's bigger than the sum of its parts.

45:40.000 --> 45:46.800
It's interesting. I mean, it just feels like a gray area where genetic modification of an organism.

45:48.320 --> 45:55.120
It just feels like, I don't know, if you genetically modified me to make me glow

45:55.760 --> 46:00.400
in the light, I kind of like it. I think you have enough of an aura.

46:01.120 --> 46:04.800
Thank you. I was just fishing for compliments. Thank you. I appreciate it.

46:04.800 --> 46:11.680
Absolutely right. And by the way, the gray area is where some of us like to live and like to thrive,

46:11.680 --> 46:17.520
and that's okay. And thank goodness that there's so many of us that like the black and white and

46:17.520 --> 46:21.280
that thrive in the black and white. My husband is a good example for that.

46:22.160 --> 46:26.400
Just to clarify, in this case, you're also trying to thrive in the black and white,

46:26.400 --> 46:33.760
in that you're saying the silkworm is a beautiful, wonderful creature. Let us not modify it.

46:33.760 --> 46:39.040
Is that the idea or is it okay to modify a little bit as long as we can see that it benefits the

46:39.040 --> 46:44.640
organism as well as the final creation? So with silkworms, absolutely, let's not modify

46:44.640 --> 46:52.800
genetically. Let's not modify genetically. And then some, because why did we get there to begin

46:52.800 --> 47:00.160
with 4,000 years ago in the Silk Road? And we should never get to a point where we evolve life

47:00.160 --> 47:08.640
for the service of mankind at the risk of these wonderful creatures across the kingdom of life.

47:08.640 --> 47:16.000
I don't think about the same kind of ethical range when I think about bacteria.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.480
Nevertheless, bacteria are pretty wonderful organisms.

47:18.480 --> 47:20.000
I'm moving to my second cup here.

47:20.960 --> 47:23.520
Take two. Things are getting serious now.

47:23.520 --> 47:25.760
Bacteria are, yeah, for sure.

47:25.760 --> 47:29.520
Let's give bacteria all the love they deserve. We wouldn't be here without them. They were here for

47:30.160 --> 47:32.480
I don't know what it is, like a billion years before anything else showed up.

47:32.480 --> 47:37.280
But in a way, if you think about it, they create the matter that we consume and then

47:40.080 --> 47:46.080
reincarnates or dissolves into the soil and then creates a tree and then that tree creates more

47:46.080 --> 47:51.840
bacteria. And then that bacteria could, I mean, again, that's why I like to think about not

47:51.840 --> 48:00.000
recycling but reincarnating because that assumes a kind of imparting upon nature that dimension of

48:00.000 --> 48:06.800
agency and maybe awareness. But yeah, lots of really interesting work happening with bacteria.

48:08.960 --> 48:14.480
Directed evolution is one of them. We're looking at directed evolution, so high throughput directed

48:14.480 --> 48:20.960
evolution of bacteria for the production of products. And again, those products can be

48:20.960 --> 48:27.440
a shoe, wearables, biomaterials, therapeutics. And doing that direction computationally.

48:27.520 --> 48:33.360
Totally computationally, obviously, in the lab with the hero organism, the hero bacteria.

48:35.280 --> 48:41.680
And what's happening today in ecromicrobial synthetic biology, synthetic biology that

48:41.680 --> 48:46.080
lends itself to ecology. And again, all of these fields are coming together. It's such

48:46.080 --> 48:50.880
a wonderful time to be a designer. I can't think of a better time to be a designer in this world.

48:51.520 --> 48:59.440
But with high throughput directed evolution, and I should say that the physical space in our

49:00.240 --> 49:06.800
new lab will have these capsules which we have designed that are

49:09.040 --> 49:15.280
designed like growth chambers or grow rooms. And in those grow rooms, we can basically

49:15.600 --> 49:22.240
program top-down environmental templating, top-down environmental control of lights,

49:22.240 --> 49:28.080
humidity, light, etc. So light, humidity, and temperature while doing bottom-up genetic

49:28.080 --> 49:34.400
regulation. So it is a wet lab, but in that wet lab, you could do at the same time genetic

49:34.400 --> 49:40.480
modulation, regulation, and environmental templating. And then again, the idea is that

49:40.480 --> 49:47.440
in one of those capsules, maybe we grow transparent wood for architectural application. In another

49:47.440 --> 49:54.720
capsule, we grow a shoe. And in another capsule, we look at that large language model that we

49:54.720 --> 49:58.320
talked about. And there is a particular technology associated with that, which

49:58.320 --> 50:04.400
we're hoping to reveal to the world in February. And each of those capsules is basically a

50:05.040 --> 50:11.760
high-throughput computational environment, like a breadboard that has, think of sort of a physical

50:11.760 --> 50:18.880
breadboard environment that has access to oxygen and nitrogen and CO2 and nutritional dispensing.

50:19.600 --> 50:26.960
And these little capsules could be stressed. They're sort of an ecology in a box. And they

50:26.960 --> 50:31.520
could be stressed to produce the food of the future or the products of the future or the

50:31.520 --> 50:37.440
construction materials of the future. Food is a very interesting one, obviously because of food

50:37.440 --> 50:43.920
insecurity and the issues that we have around both in terms of food insecurity, but also in

50:43.920 --> 50:49.120
terms of the future of food and what will remain after we can't eat plants and animals anymore.

50:49.120 --> 50:57.120
And all we can eat is these false bananas and insects as our protein source. So there,

50:57.120 --> 51:02.080
we're thinking, you know, can we design these capsules to stress an environment and

51:02.080 --> 51:09.680
see how that environment behaves? Think about a kind of an ecological, a biodiversity chamber,

51:09.680 --> 51:16.320
right? A kind of a time capsule that is designed as a biodiversity chamber where you can program

51:16.880 --> 51:23.680
the exact temperature, humidity, and light combination to emulate the environment from

51:23.680 --> 51:30.480
the past. So Ohio, 1981, December 31st at 5 a.m. in the morning, what did tomatoes taste like?

51:31.280 --> 51:37.440
To all the way in the future, 200 years ago, these are the environmental inputs. These are some

51:37.440 --> 51:42.720
genetic regulations that I'm testing and what might be the food of the future or the products

51:42.720 --> 51:48.320
of the future or the construction materials of the future feel like, test like, behave like,

51:48.320 --> 51:52.880
etc. And so these capsules are designed as part of a lab. That's why it's been taking us such a long

51:52.880 --> 51:59.280
time to get to this point because we started designing them in 2019 and they're currently,

51:59.280 --> 52:05.280
literally as I speak to you, under construction. How well is it understood how to do this dance

52:05.280 --> 52:10.000
of controlling these different variables in order for various kinds of growth to happen?

52:10.000 --> 52:14.560
It's not. It's never been done before and these capsules have never been designed before. So,

52:14.560 --> 52:18.960
you know, when we first decided these are going to be environmental capsules, people thought we're

52:18.960 --> 52:23.120
crazy. What are you building? What are you making? So the answer is that we don't know,

52:23.120 --> 52:28.640
but we know that there has never been a space like this where you have basically a wet lab

52:28.640 --> 52:38.400
and a grow room at that resolution, at that granularity of control over organisms.

52:40.000 --> 52:46.560
There is a reason why there is this incredible evolution of products in the software space.

52:47.040 --> 52:53.440
And the hardware space, that's a more limiting space that because of the physical infrastructure

52:53.440 --> 52:58.000
that we have to test and experiment with things. So we really wanted to push on

52:58.800 --> 53:04.000
creating a wet lab that is novel in every possible way. What could you create in it?

53:04.000 --> 53:12.640
You could create the future. You could create an environment of plants talking to each other

53:12.720 --> 53:20.800
with a robotic referee. And the robotic referee, you know, and you could set an objective function.

53:20.800 --> 53:30.480
And let's say for the transaction driven individuals in the world, let's say their

53:30.480 --> 53:40.640
objective function is carbon sequestration. And all of those plants are implemented with a gaming

53:40.640 --> 53:46.560
engine and they have this reward system, right? And they're constantly needing to optimize the

53:46.560 --> 53:52.800
way in which they carbon sequest. We weed out the bad guys, we leave the good guys, and we end up

53:52.800 --> 53:58.720
with this like ideal ecology of carbon sequestering heroes that connect and communicate with each

53:58.720 --> 54:05.360
other. And once we have that model, this biodiversity chamber, we send it out into the field and we see

54:05.360 --> 54:12.000
what happens in nature. And that's sort of what I'm talking about, augmenting plants with that extra

54:13.200 --> 54:22.720
dimension of bandwidth that they do not have. Just last week, I came across a paper

54:24.080 --> 54:34.000
that discusses the in vivo neurons that are augmented with a pong game. And in a dish,

54:34.000 --> 54:39.680
they basically present sentience and the beginning of awareness, which is wonderful.

54:40.560 --> 54:46.400
That you could actually take these neurons from a mouse brain and you have the electrical circuits

54:46.400 --> 54:53.600
and the physiological circuits that enable these cells to connect and communicate and together

54:53.600 --> 55:00.720
arrive at sort of swarm situation that allows them to act as a system that is not only perceived to

55:00.720 --> 55:06.880
be sentient, but is actually sentient. Michael Levine calls this agential material, material

55:06.880 --> 55:14.240
that has agency, right? So this is of interest to us because this is sort of, again, this is

55:14.240 --> 55:18.560
emergence post-templating. You template until you don't need to template anymore because

55:19.680 --> 55:24.720
the system has its own rules, right? What we don't want to happen with AGI, we want to happen with

55:24.720 --> 55:30.080
synthetic biology. What we don't want to happen online and software with language, we want for it

55:30.080 --> 55:35.520
to happen with bio-based materials because that will get us closer to growing things as opposed

55:35.520 --> 55:42.320
to assembly and mechanically, yeah, putting them together with toxic materials and compounds.

55:42.880 --> 55:47.040
If I can ask a pothead question for a second. So you mentioned just like the silkworms,

55:47.760 --> 55:54.240
the individualist silkworms got to actually learn how to collaborate or actually to collaborate

55:54.240 --> 55:59.600
in a swarm-like way. You're talking about getting plants to communicate in some interesting way

55:59.600 --> 56:06.720
based on an objective function. Is it possible to have some kind of interface between another kind

56:06.720 --> 56:14.080
of organisms, humans, and nature? So like a human to have a conversation with a plant?

56:14.640 --> 56:19.680
There already is. You know that when we cut, freshly cut grass, I love the smell,

56:20.800 --> 56:26.320
but it's a smell of, actually it's a smell of distress that the leaves of grass are communicating

56:26.320 --> 56:34.080
to each other. So the grass when it's cut emits green leaf, volatiles, GLVs, and those GLVs are

56:34.080 --> 56:39.280
basically one leaf of grass communicating to another leaf of grass. Be careful, mind you,

56:39.280 --> 56:44.640
you're about to be cut. These incredible life forms are communicating using a different language

56:44.640 --> 56:50.720
than ours. We use language models, they use molecular models. At the moment where we can

56:50.720 --> 56:57.120
parse, we can decode these molecular moments is when we can start having a conversation with

56:57.120 --> 57:02.400
plants. Now of course there is a lot of work around plant neurobiology. It's a real thing.

57:02.400 --> 57:10.240
Plants do not have a nervous system, but they have something akin to a nervous system. It has a kind

57:10.240 --> 57:15.920
of an ecological intelligence that is focused on a particular time scale, and the time scale is very,

57:15.920 --> 57:25.680
very slow, slow, slow, slow time scale. So it is when we can melt these time scales and connect

57:25.680 --> 57:31.760
with these plants in terms of the content of the language, in this case molecules, the duration of

57:31.760 --> 57:37.040
the language, and we can start having a conversation, if not simply to understand what is happening in

57:37.040 --> 57:42.160
the plant kingdom. Precision agriculture, I promise to you, will look very, very different,

57:42.560 --> 57:48.000
because right now we're using drones to take photos of crops of corn that look bad,

57:48.000 --> 57:54.000
and when we take that photo it's already too late. But if we understand these molecular footprints

57:54.000 --> 57:57.760
and things that they are trying to say, the stress that they are trying to communicate,

57:57.760 --> 58:04.080
then we could of course predict the physiological, biological behavior of these crops, both for

58:04.960 --> 58:11.920
their own self-perpetuation, but also for the foods and the pharma and the type of molecules

58:11.920 --> 58:17.760
that we're seeking to grow for the benefit of humanity. And so these languages that we

58:17.760 --> 58:24.160
are attempting now to quantify and qualify will really help us not only better nature and help

58:24.160 --> 58:34.800
nature in its striving to surviving, but also help us design better wines and better foods and

58:35.680 --> 58:41.440
better medicine and better products, again, across all scales, across all application domains.

58:41.440 --> 58:45.920
Is there intricacies to understanding the time scales, like you mentioned, at which

58:45.920 --> 58:53.280
these communications, these languages operate? Is there something different between the way humans

58:53.280 --> 58:57.280
communicate and the way plants communicate in terms of time? Remember when we started the

58:57.280 --> 59:03.760
conversation talking about definitions in the context of design and then in the context of being?

59:04.720 --> 59:12.880
That question requires, I think, a kind of a shift, a humility. That requires a kind of a

59:12.880 --> 59:18.720
humility towards nature, understanding that it operates on different scales. We recently

59:18.720 --> 59:26.080
discovered that the molecular footprint of a rose or of a plant in general during nighttime

59:26.080 --> 59:30.720
is different than its molecular footprint during daytime. So these are circadian rhythms that are

59:30.720 --> 59:39.040
associated with what kind of molecules these plants emit, given stresses and given,

59:40.720 --> 59:49.600
there's a reason why the jasmine, a jasmine field smells so, so delicious at 4 a.m. in the morning

59:49.600 --> 59:57.280
and there's peace and rest amongst the plants. And you have to sort of tune into that

59:57.760 --> 01:00:02.800
time dimension of the plant kingdom. And that, of course, requires all this humility, where

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:10.160
in a single capsule to design a biodiversity chamber will take years, not months, and definitely

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:18.640
not days, and to see these products. And also that humility in design comes from simply looking at

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:24.400
how we are today as a civilization, how we use and abuse nature. Like just think of all these

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:30.800
Christmas trees, right? These Christmas trees, they take years to grow. We use them for one night,

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:37.520
the holiest night of the year, and then we let them go. And think about in nature, to design a

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:44.880
quote unquote product, an organism spends energy and time and thoughtfulness and many, many,

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:53.360
many years, and I'm thinking about the redwoods, to grow these channels, these cellulose layers

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:59.120
and channels and reach these incredible heights, takes sometimes hundreds of years, sometimes

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:05.120
thousands of years. Am I afraid of building a company that designs products in the scale

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:12.320
of thousands of years? No, I'm not. And the way of being in the physical world today

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:22.800
is really not in tune with the time dimension of the natural world at all. And that needs to change

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:30.640
and that's obviously very, very hard to do in a community of human beings that is,

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:36.720
at least in the Western world, that is based on capitalism. And so here, the wonderful challenge

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:43.120
that we have ahead of us is how do we impart upon the capitalist movement? We know that we need to

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:51.200
produce now products that will enter the real world and be shared and used by others and still

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.680
benefit the natural world while benefiting humans. And that's a wonderful challenge to have.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:01.520
So integrate technology with nature and that's a really difficult problem. I see Parallels here

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:07.120
with another company of Neuralink, which is basically like you, I think you mentioned

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:15.680
Neuralink for nature, that there are short-term products you can come up with, but it's ultimately

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:22.720
a long-term challenge of how do you integrate the machine with this creation of nature, this

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:27.360
intricate complex creation of nature, which is the human brain, and then you're speaking more

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:37.760
generally nature. You know how every company has an image, like this one single image that embodies

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:45.600
the spirit of the company. And I think for Neuralink, it was to me that chimpanzee playing

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:53.040
a video game. It was just unbelievable. But with plants, there potentially is a set of molecules

01:02:53.040 --> 01:03:01.520
that impacts or inspires, I like that word, the plant to behave or act in a certain way

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.920
and allows still the plant the possibility of deciding where it or she or he wants to go,

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:15.120
which is why our first product for this molecular space is going to be a functionalized fragrance.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:20.480
So here we're thinking about the future of fragrances and the future of fragrances and

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:29.680
flavors. You know, these products are in the industry as we know it today, are designed for

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:39.360
totally human-centric use and enjoyment and indulgence and luxury. They're used on the body

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:48.480
for the sake of attraction and feeling good and smelling good. And we were asking ourselves,

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:54.960
is there a world in which a fragrance can be not a functional fragrance, because you could claim

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:59.360
that all fragrances are functional, but is there a world in which the fragrance becomes

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:06.640
functionalized is again, imparted upon or given agency to connect with another organism? Is there

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:13.120
a world in which you and I can go down to your garden and use a perfume that will interact with

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:22.000
the rose garden downstairs? I've just been enamored with the statements that are being made in the

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:28.560
media around, oh, this is completely biologically derived fragrance and it's bio-based. But when

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:34.000
you look into the fragrance and you understand that in order to get to this bio-derived fragrance,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:42.640
you went through, you blew through 10,000 bushes of rose to create five milliliters of a rose

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:48.720
fragrance. And all these 10,000 bushes of rose, they take space, they take water management and

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:56.480
so much waste. Is this really what we want the future of our agriculture and molecular goods

01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:03.120
to look like? And so when we did the Aguajaja Pavilion on the roof of Asif Moma, we calculated

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:07.600
that for that pavilion, we had 40,000 calories embedded into this pavilion that was made of

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:15.840
shrimp shells and chitosan and apple skins and cellulose from tree pulp. And we calculated that

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:20.480
overall the structure had 40,000 calories. Interesting way to think about a structure

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:27.680
from the point of view of calories. But as you left the gallery, you saw these three clocks that

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:32.960
were so beautifully designed by Felix on our team and these clocks measured temperature and humidity

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:38.960
and we connected them to a weather channel so that we could directly look at how the pavilion was

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:46.400
biodegrading in real time. And in our calculations, I say this long-winded description

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:54.400
of the pavilion to say that in the calculation, we incorporated how much electricity we used for

01:05:54.400 --> 01:06:00.080
our computers, for the 3D printers that printed the pavilion. And these were called energy

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:04.560
calculations, energy and materials. And when you think about a product and you think about

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:12.960
a shoe or a chair or a perfume or a building, you don't stop at the object. You want to go

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:19.200
all the way to the system. Again, instead of designing objects or singular embodiments of

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:26.720
the will of the designer, you're really tabbing into an entire system that is interconnected.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:31.040
And if you look at the energy budget that characterized the Project Aguaja,

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:35.680
it traverses the entire planet, right? Some of these shrimp shells were brought from

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:41.040
places in the world we haven't thought of in terms of the apples and the shrimp shells and

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:51.040
the tree pulp. And so going back to fragrances, it's really, really important to understand

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:56.000
the product in the context of the ecological system from which it's sourced and how it's

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:02.720
designed. And that is the kind of thinking that is not only desired, but is required

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:06.320
if we are to achieve synergy between humanity and nature.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.680
And it's interesting because the system-level thinking is almost always going to take you to

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.880
the entire earth to consider in the entire earth ecosystem.

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.480
Which is why it's important to have a left brain and a right brain competing for attention.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:18.720
And intimacy.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:27.760
Yes, you mentioned a fragrance that kind of sends out a message to the environment, essentially.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.040
A message in a bottle, yeah.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:32.720
A message in a bottle. So like, so you can go to a rose garden

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.720
and trick the rose garden to think it's 4 a.m.?

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.400
You could if you wanted to, but maybe that is-

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.560
Not trick. Trick is such a bad word.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.040
Right.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.000
Inspire.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:48.560
But inspire I like. I like the idea of providing nature with a choice, which is why I love that

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:53.120
elegant mathematical equation of empowerment and agency.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:08:00.080
Empower the rose garden to create a romantic moment for the wearer of the fragrance.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:08.160
But now again, you're again, all of this to go back to that human-centric notion of romance.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:16.400
But maybe there's another way to do romance, right? That we haven't yet explored. And maybe

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:21.680
you know, there is a way to tap into what happens to the rose when it's dreaming.

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:27.280
Assuming that plants are sentient and assuming that we can tap into that sentience,

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.600
what can we discover about what does the rose want?

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:41.600
Like, what does it actually want? And what does it need? And what are the roses, you know, dreams?

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.640
But do you think there's some correlation in terms of romance,

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:46.800
in terms of the word you sometimes use, magic?

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:53.840
Is there some similarities in what humans want and what roses want and what nature wants?

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:58.000
I think so. I think there is. And if I did not think so, oh my goodness,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.440
this would not be a nice world to live in. I think we all want love.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:10.960
I recently read this beautiful letter that was written by Einstein to his daughter

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:18.080
and was discovered. Einstein asked his daughter to wait 20 years until she reveals these letters.

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:23.120
And so she did. It's just one of the most beautiful letters I've ever read from a father

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:31.600
to his daughter. And the letter overall is imbued with a kind of a sense of remorse or

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:39.360
maybe even feelings of sadness. And there is some kind of melancholy note in the letter

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:46.400
where Einstein regrets not having spent enough time with his daughter, having focused on the

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:51.520
theory of general relativity and changing the world. And then he goes on to talk about this

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:58.400
beautiful and elegant equation of E equals MC square. And he tells his daughter that he believes

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:04.560
that love is actually the force that shapes the universe because it is like gravity, right? It

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:09.920
attracts people. It is like light. It brings people together and connects between people.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:17.040
And it's all empowering. And so if you multiply it by the speed of light, you could really

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.640
change the world for the better. And call me a romanticist. I know you are too,

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:30.880
which is why I so love being here. I believe in this. I totally and utterly

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:34.480
believe in love.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:39.680
In love. By the way, let me just excerpt from Einstein's letter. There's an extremely

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:46.160
powerful force that so far science has not found a formal explanation to. It is a force that includes

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:51.440
and governs all others and is even behind any phenomena operating in the universe and has not

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:59.040
yet been identified by us. This universal force is love. He also, the last paragraph in the letter,

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:03.760
as you've mentioned, I deeply regret not having been able to express what is in my heart,

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:11.680
which has quietly beaten for you all my life. Maybe it's too late to apologize, but his time

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:19.040
is relative. That jokes through Einstein. I need to tell you that I love you. And thanks to you,

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:23.440
I've reached the ultimate answer. Your father, Albert Einstein.

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:24.000
Yeah.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:29.120
I deeply regret not having been able to express what is in my heart.

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:39.120
Maybe that's a universal regret. Filling your days with busyness and silly pursuits

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:43.440
and not sitting down and expressing that.

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:50.960
But it is everything. It is everything. It is why I love that expression. And I forget

01:11:50.960 --> 01:12:03.440
who said this, but I love my daughter more than evolution required. And I feel the same way towards

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:12.160
my other half. And I feel that when you find that connection, everything and anything is possible.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:24.640
And it's a very, very, very magical moment. So I believe in love, and I believe in the one.

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:31.680
It might be the same thing, it might be a different thing, but let me ask you a ridiculously big

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:38.240
philosophical question about beauty. Dostoevsky said beauty will save the world in The Idiot,

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:46.160
one of my favorite books of his. What is beauty to you? You've created through this intersection of

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:52.160
engineering and nature, you've created some incredibly beautiful things. What do you think

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:56.240
is beauty? That's a beautiful question.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.360
Maybe it is connected to the love question.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:03.200
It is connected to the love question. Of course, everything is connected to the love question.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:15.120
To me, beauty is agency. To me, something that has agency, it is beautiful. There is this

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:21.360
special quote from Buckminster Fuller, which I cannot remember word for word, but I remember

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:28.640
the concept, which goes something like this. When I work on a problem, I never think about beauty.

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:34.480
But when I'm done solving the problem and I look at what I've created and it's not beautiful,

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:45.040
I know that I was wrong. It's kind of an agency that speaks to the objective function of the

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:48.880
creation, whether for Bucky it's useless or useful.

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:52.320
So this idea of empowerment that you talked about is fundamentally connected to it.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.920
Comes back to that, yeah.

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:59.520
What's the difference that you hinted at between empowerment and emergence?

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:10.320
Is emergence completely lacks control? And empowerment is more controlled?

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:16.640
There's an agent making decisions? Is there an interesting distinction there?

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:22.880
Yes. I think empowerment is a force with direction. It has directionality to it.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.320
Emergence is, I believe, multi-directional. Again, that depends on the application.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:37.120
Emergence is perhaps, in terms of sort of a material definition, is a tropic spirit.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:48.560
The end is a tropic counterpart. I think they overlap because I think that

01:14:48.560 --> 01:15:01.440
empowerment is a way of inspiring emergence. I think emergence does not happen without

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.800
empowerment, but empowerment can happen without emergence.

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:10.000
Do you think of emergence as the loss of control? When you're thinking about these capsules

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:18.960
and the things they create, is emergence a thing that is not a desirable conclusion?

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:25.280
I love that question because to some of us, the loss of control is control.

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:32.480
In design, we're used to extreme levels of control over form and the shape of a thing,

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:37.360
and how it behaves, and how it functions. And that's something we've inherited from

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:46.400
the Industrial Revolution. But with nature, there's this diversity that happens

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:52.240
without necessarily having a reward function. This is good or bad. Things just happen,

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:55.840
and some of them happen to have wings, and some of them happen to have scales.

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:05.680
You end up with this incredible potential for diversity. I think the future of design is in

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:14.080
that soft control, is in the ability to design highly controlled systems that enable the loss

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:21.600
of control. Creativity is very much part of this because creativity is all about letting go

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:28.560
and beginning again, and beginning again, beginning again. When you cannot let go,

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:35.120
you cannot be creative, and you can't find novelty. But I think that letting go

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:43.360
is a moment that enables empowerment, agency, creativity, emergence, and they're all connected.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:50.480
They associate themselves with the definition of destiny or the inevitable. A good friend of mine

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:59.360
shared with me the elegant definition of fate, which is the ratio of who you are and who you

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:07.200
want to be. Ratio of who you are, who you want to be. Exactly, and that ends up defining you.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:16.640
Those tools, I think, when you let go, you give peace to your will, to a sense of will.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:22.720
I think that's very, very important in design, but also in life.

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:28.560
She said this fate is the ratio of who you are and who you want to be.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.640
Do you think there's something to this whole manifestation thing, like focusing on a vision

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:42.480
of what you want the world to become, and in that focusing, you manifest it? Like Paola Coelho said

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:46.640
in The Alchemist, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.560
Is there something to that?

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:56.960
I think so, yes. I always think of what I do as the culmination of energy, information, and matter,

01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:03.920
and how to direct energy, information, and matter in the design of a thing or in the design of a

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:12.320
life. I think living is very much a process of channeling these energies to where they need to

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:20.000
go. I think that the manifestation or part of that manifestation is the pointing to the moon in

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.760
order to get to the moon, and that's why manifestation is also directional. It has that

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:33.680
vector quality to it that I think of agency as. Have you, in your own life, has there been things

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:40.560
you've done where you kind of direct that energy, information, and matter in a way that opens up

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.000
new possibilities?

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.960
Yeah. I mean, you've also said somewhere, I'm probably misquoting, that

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:55.760
many things, you and Ari are many things, and you become new things every 10 years or so.

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.440
Oh, I did say that somewhere.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:58.080
Somewhere.

01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:59.920
That every decade you sort of switch.

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.960
That was a previous scenario that said that.

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:07.520
Yeah, I did say some time ago that you have to sort of reboot every 10 years

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:12.080
to keep creative and keep inventive and keep fresh.

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:16.400
Is there things you've done in your life where just kind of doors opened?

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:29.120
I think everything, everything, everything good I've found in my life has been found in that way of

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:36.480
letting go and suspending my sense of disbelief. And often you will find me say to the team,

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:42.720
suspend your disbelief. I don't care that this is impossible. Let's assume it is. Where does it take

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:50.720
us? And that suspension of disbelief is absolutely part and parcel of the creative act. You know,

01:19:50.960 --> 01:20:03.840
act. You know, I did so when I was in medical school. I was in Hadassah and in the Hebrew

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:12.880
University. And I remember I left medical school for architecture the day my grandmother passed

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:19.040
away. And that was a moment of relief. And that was a door that was closing that opened other

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:25.680
opportunities. But that, of course, required letting go of the great vision of becoming a

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:33.280
doctor and letting go of the dream of being surrounded by wonderful patients and the science

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:38.240
of medicine and the research associated with that science and letting go of that dream

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:48.640
to accomplish another. And it has happened throughout my life in different ways. MIT was

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:56.640
another experience like that where people pointed at me as the designer for whom the

01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:03.280
academic currency is not necessarily the citation index. And of course, in order to get tenure at

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:11.040
MIT, you have to look at the citation index. But for me, it was not that. It was manifesting our

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:17.600
work in shows and writing papers and writing patents and creating a celebration around the

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:26.480
work. And I never saw a distinction between those ways of being. I also think that another

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:35.600
kind of way of being or a modality of being that I found helpful is Victor Frenkel wrote this

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:41.200
incredible book, Man's Search for Meaning after the Holocaust. And he writes different people

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:50.160
pursue life for different reasons. According to Freud, the goal of life is to find pleasure,

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:58.400
and according to Adler, it's to find power. And for Victor Frenkel, it was about finding meaning.

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:04.880
And when you let go of the titles and the disciplines and the boundaries and the

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:14.480
expectations and the perception, you are elevated to this really special spiritual,

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:23.280
but definitely very, very creative plane where you can sort of start anew and look at the world

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:30.720
through the lens of a bacterium or a robot or look at ecology through the lens of chemistry

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:34.000
and look at chemistry through the lens of robotics and look at robotics through the lens of

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:40.800
microbial ecologies and so on and so forth. And I feel that kind of rebooting,

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:48.560
not every 10 years, but every minute, every breath is very, very important for a creative life and

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:56.240
for just maintaining this fresh mind to reboot, to begin again with every breath,

01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:04.160
begin again. And that can be confusing for some. For my team members, I like to change my mind,

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:13.280
it's who I am, it's how I think, it's how I operate. And they'll come and we found another

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:18.320
technique or another technology that's interesting. And we thought that we were working on this

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:22.480
functionalized fragrance, but now there's another opportunity and let's go there. And to me,

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:31.200
I would much rather live life like if I had to pick sort of my favorite Broadway show

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:38.560
to enter and live through, it would be Into the Woods. It's not a specific fairy tale, it's not

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:47.920
the Sleeping Beauty or Little Red Riding Hood or Rapunzel, it's all of them. It's sort of moving

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:52.560
into the forest and seeing this wonder and getting close and learning about that and then moving to

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:59.920
another wonder. And life is really about tying all of these little fairy tales together,

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:06.160
together in work and also in life. Unafraid to leap into the unknown?

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:12.160
Unafraid to leap into the unknown. Speaking of MIT, you got a tenure at MIT and then you leaped

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:19.120
to New York and started a new company with a vision that doesn't span a couple of years,

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:26.880
but centuries. I did. It was my destiny to start a company. And do I have mornings when I wake up

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:31.200
and I ask myself, what the hell am I doing? Yes, I have those mornings.

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:37.440
What do you do with those mornings by the way? I embrace them and I find gratitude and I say

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:46.480
to myself, thank goodness, I'm so lucky to have the ability to be frustrated in this way.

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:58.480
So I really, really embrace these frustrations and I take them, I wrap them in a bubble and I look

01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:08.720
at it on the outside of my aware mind and I laugh at them, I smile at them.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:15.440
If I could return actually to the question of beauty for a second, I forgot to ask you

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:23.360
something. You mentioned imperfection in the death masks. What role does imperfection play in

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:32.640
our conception of beauty? What role does imperfection play in nature? There's this

01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:41.280
Japanese aesthetics concept of wabi-sabi which basically embraces imperfection. Nothing lasts,

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:45.280
nothing is finished and nothing is perfect. What do you think of that?

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:52.880
I totally agree that change is the only permanence, that imperfection is there

01:25:52.880 --> 01:26:00.320
if only to signal that we are part of a bigger thing than ourselves, that we are on a

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:12.160
journey, that things are in movement and if they were perfect, of course when things are perfect,

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:18.000
it is just so boring. We end up with stereotypes and as humans, but I think just in general as

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:24.160
living beings, we're here to find meaning and that meaning cannot be found without struggle and

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:32.800
without seeking to, not to perfect, but to build towards something better. When I was a child,

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:41.120
my mother who I love so much always explained to me how important it is to fall and to fail and

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:52.080
to fight and to argue and that there is a way, that there is a culture to failing and to

01:26:52.080 --> 01:27:02.000
imperfection. So I think it is necessary for something beautiful to be imperfect

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:08.240
and it is a sign of nature because nothing in nature is perfect.

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:14.720
What about human relations? You mentioned finding love. Are the flaws in humans,

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:20.720
the imperfection in humans a component of love? What role do you think the flaws play?

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:33.840
That's a really profound question. I think the flaws are there to

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:51.120
present a vulnerability and those flaws are a sign of those vulnerabilities.

01:27:52.080 --> 01:28:04.080
I think love is very, very gentle. With Bill, we often talk between the two of us about what drives

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:10.720
all human behavior and for him, it's incentive, as you might expect. He will repeat this sentence

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:18.080
to me, incentive drives all human behavior, but I would say to me it's love, very much so.

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:25.360
I think flaws are part of that because flaws are a sign of that vulnerability, whether physical,

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:30.960
whether emotional vulnerability, and these vulnerabilities, they either tear us apart or

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:38.960
they bring us together. The vulnerability is what is the glue, I think. I think that

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:45.120
the vulnerability enables connection. The connection is the glue and that connection is

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:52.800
the glue. That connection enables accessing a higher ground as a community as opposed to

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:58.640
as an individual. If there is a society over the mind or if there are higher levels of awareness

01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:06.240
that can be accessed in community as opposed to, again, going to the silkworm, as opposed to on

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:12.720
the individual level, I think those occur through the flaws and the vulnerabilities. Without them,

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:20.800
we cannot find connection, community, and without community, we can't build what we have built as a

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:26.880
civilization for the past hundreds of thousands of years. I think not only are they beautiful,

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:31.760
but they have a functional role in building civilizations.

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:38.320
There's a sense in which love requires vulnerability and maybe love is the leap

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:47.840
into that vulnerability. I think, yes. I think a flaw, think about it physically. I'm thinking

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:56.080
about a brick that's flawed, but in a way, I think of a flaw as an increased surface area.

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:02.880
God, that's a good line. That's a good line.

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:10.560
A surface area that physically or emotionally, it introduces this whole new dimension to a human

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:17.120
or a brick. Because you have more surface area, you can use mortar and build a home.

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:24.080
I think of it as accessing this additional dimension of surface area that could be used

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:30.640
for good or bad, right? To connect, to communicate, to collaborate.

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:37.120
It makes me think of that quote from this incredible movie I've watched years ago,

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:43.440
Particle Fever, I think it was called, a documentary about the Large Hydron Collider,

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:49.360
an incredible film where they talk about the things that are least important for our survival

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:57.440
are the things that make us human, like the pure romantic act or the notion of,

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:07.360
and Viktor Frankl talks about that too. He talks about feeling the sun on his arms as he is

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:22.160
working the soil in two degrees Fahrenheit without clothes. And the officer berates him and says,

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:28.080
what have you done? Have you been a businessman before you came here to the camp? And he says,

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:31.920
I was a doctor. And he said, you must have made a lot of money as a doctor. And he said,

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:46.400
all my work I've done for free. I've been helping the poor. But he keeps his humility and he keeps

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:58.000
his modesty and he keeps his preservation of the spirit. And he says the things that actually make

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:10.240
him able to outlive the terrible experience in the Holocaust was really cherishing this moment

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:18.560
when the sun hits his skin or when he can eat a grain of rice, a single grain of rice. So I think

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:28.240
I think cherishing is a very important part of living a meaningful life, being able to cherish

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:31.840
those simple things. Like to notice them and to-

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:39.840
To notice them, to pay attention to them in the moment. And I do this now more than ever.

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:44.480
I mean, there is some- Bukowski has this poem I like called Nirvana,

01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:51.600
where it tells the story of a young man on a bus going through North Carolina or something like

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:59.040
this and they stop off in a cafe and he has this, there's a waitress and he talks about that he

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:05.360
notices the magic, something indescribable, he just notices the magic of it. And he gets back on the

01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:12.400
bus with the rest of the passengers and none of them seem to have noticed the magic. And I think

01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:19.680
if you just allow yourself to pause and just to feel whatever that is, maybe ultimately it's a

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:30.240
kind of gratitude for, I don't know what it is. I'm sure it's just chemicals in the brain, but it's

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:37.520
just so incredible to be alive and noticing that and appreciating that and being one in that with

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:48.080
others. Yes, yes. And that goes back to the fireplace, to the first technology. What was

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:55.440
the first technology? It was fire. First technology to have built community and it emerged out of a

01:33:55.440 --> 01:34:04.160
vulnerability of wanting to stay away from the cold and be warm together. And of course that fire is

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:14.080
associated not only with comfort and the ability to form biorelevant nutrients in our food and

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:27.840
provide heat and comfort, but also spirits and a kind of a way to enter a spiritual moment,

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:38.400
to enter a moment that can only be experienced in a community as a form of a meditative moment.

01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:49.200
There is a lot to be said about light. Light is, I think, an important part of these moments of,

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:59.200
I think it's a real thing. I really truly believe that we're born with an aura, surface area that

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:12.720
is measurable. I think we're born into the world with an aura. And how do we channel that is really,

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:21.280
channel that ends up defining the light in our lives?

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:26.720
Do you think we're all lonely? Do you think there's loneliness in us humans?

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:33.360
Oh yes, yes. Loneliness is part, yes. I think we all have that loneliness, whether we're willing to

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.880
access that loneliness and look at it in the eye or completely,

01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:47.280
you know, completely avoid it or deny it. It's like, it feels like it's some kind of foundation

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:54.960
for longing and longing leads to this combination of vulnerability and connection with others.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.440
It feels like that's a really important part of being human is being lonely.

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:06.640
Very, it's very, we are born into this world alone. Again, being alone and being lonely are

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:13.040
two different things, right? You can be together but be lonely and you can be alone but not be

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:20.800
lonely at all. We often joke, Bill and I, that he cannot be lonely. He cannot deal with being

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:28.480
by himself. He always needs people around him. And I strive long, must have creative solitude, must

01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:36.400
find pockets of solitude and loneliness in order to find creativity and reconnect with myself.

01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:45.200
So loneliness is a recipe for community in my opinion. And I think those things complement

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:55.520
each other and they're synergetic. Absolutely. The yin and yang of togetherness. And they allow you,

01:36:55.520 --> 01:37:05.360
I think, to reset and to tune in to that ratio we talked about of who you are and who you want

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:11.680
to be. If you go to this place of creative solitude, what's your creative process?

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:17.760
Is there something you've noticed about what you do that leads to good work?

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:25.920
I love to be able not only to lose focus but kind of to focus on the peripheral view

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:33.520
and to allow different things to occur at once. So I will often in my loneliness journeys,

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:41.040
I will often listen to like Leonard Bernstein, anything I can find online by Lenny Bernstein.

01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:47.440
It's reading a nature paper. It's war and peace. It's really revisiting all the texts that are so

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:53.360
timeless for me with opportunities that are very, very timely. And I think for me, the creative

01:37:53.360 --> 01:38:03.520
process is really about bringing timeless problems or concepts together with timely technologies

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:09.920
to observe them. I remember when we did the Mandela Pavilion, we read Moby Dick,

01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:16.400
the whiteness of the whale, the albino, the different, the other. And that got us to work

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:20.880
on Melanin. And Melanin also was sort of an output from the death mass. So it's lots of

01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:29.280
things happening at the same time and really allowing them to come together to form this

01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:37.040
view about the world through the lens of a spirit being or a living being or a material

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:41.200
and then focus on the world through the lens of that material.

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:46.160
The glass work was another project like that where we were fascinated by glass because

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:53.600
obviously it's superb material for architecture. But we created this new glass printing technology

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:59.520
for the first time that was shedding light on the biomechanics of fluid glass, the math and

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:05.360
the physics of which was never done before, which was so exciting to us. But revealing new knowledge

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:11.920
about the world through technology, that's one theme. The reincarnation between things,

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:17.840
material and immaterial, that's another theme. Lenny Bernstein, War and Peace, Tolstoy.

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:24.240
You've tweeted a Tolstoy quote from War and Peace, as of course you would.

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:28.560
Everything I know, I know because of love. Yeah, I love this quote.

01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:38.560
So you use these kind of inspirations to focus you and then find the actual idea in the periphery?

01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:46.000
Yes, and then connect them with whatever it is that we're working on, whether it's high throughput

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:53.440
directed evolution of bacteria, whether it's recreating that Garden of Eden in the capsule

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:58.880
and what it looks like, the food of the future. It is a little bit like directing a film. Creating

01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:08.400
a new project is a bit like creating a film. And you have these heroes, you have these characters

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:14.960
and you put them together and there is a narrative and there is a story. Whenever we start a new

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:22.000
project, it has to have these ingredients of simultaneous complexity. It has to be novel in

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:27.120
terms of the synthetic biology, material science, robotics, engineering, all of these elements that

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:35.120
are discipline based or rooted must be novel. If you can combine novelty in synthetic biology

01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:39.760
with a novelty in robotics, with a novelty in material science, with a novelty in computational

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:46.320
design, you are bound to create something novel, period. And that's how I run the company and that's

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:52.480
how I pick the people. And so that's another very, very important ingredient of the cutting edge

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:58.080
across multiple disciplines that come together. And then in the background and the periphery,

01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:04.560
there's all these messages, the whispers of the ancient oldies, right? The Beethovens and the

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:10.480
Picasso's. So Beethoven's always whispering to you. Yeah. How could one not include Beethoven

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:14.960
and the whispers? I'm going to ask you about Beethoven and the Evgeny Kissinger you've mentioned,

01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:18.560
because I've played piano my whole life. I obviously know a lot of Beethoven.

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:24.320
And it's one of the private things for me, I suppose, because I don't think I've ever publicly

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:34.240
played piano. By the way, me too. I play in private only. Yeah, people sometimes, even with guitar,

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:39.280
people ask me, can you play something? And it just feels like certain things are meant to be done

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:46.160
privately. It's weird. I mean, it's difficult. And some of the times I have performed publicly,

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:52.640
it is an ultimate leap in vulnerability. It's very, very, very difficult for me. And I'm sure,

01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:56.720
I know it's not for a lot of people, but it is for me. Anyway, we'll return to that. But

01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:02.800
since you've mentioned a combination of novelty across multiple disciplines, that's what you seek

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:09.840
when you build teams or pick people you work with. I just wanted to kind of linger on this

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:18.240
idea of what kind of humans are you looking for in this endeavor that you're taking on,

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:22.800
this fascinating thing that you've been talking about. I want to think somewhere else,

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:29.600
a previous version, version 5.7 of Neri said somewhere that there's four fields

01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:36.080
that are combined to create this intersection of biology and engineering work and is computational

01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:40.000
design, additive manufacturing, material engineering, synthetic biology. I'm sure

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
there's others, but how do you find these humans? Machine learning is in the mix.

01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:49.520
I manifest and they come. Yeah. There are a few approaches.

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:59.280
They show up. Send your message upon the water. I mean, those job descriptions that you saw,

01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:05.600
the first ones I wrote by myself. You find interesting people and brilliant people when

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:11.200
you look, and we talked about second derivative, when you look under and under and under. If you

01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:17.920
look deep enough and specialized enough, and if you allow yourself to look at the cracks,

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:25.040
at the flaws, at the cracks between disciplines and between skills, you find really, really

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:35.360
interesting diamonds in the rough. I like for those job descriptions to be those messages in

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:42.160
a bottle that bring those really interesting people our way. I mean, they have to have humility.

01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:48.880
They have to have a shine in their eye. They have to be hungry and foolish. As Job so famously said,

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:54.400
a friend of mine who's a dean of a well-known architectural school said,

01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:59.280
today architects don't want to be architects. Architects don't look up to the

01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:05.200
star architects as role models. Star architects are no longer role models. Architects want to

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:11.600
build by virtue of not building. Architects want, she said, we're back in the 60s when we think

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:19.520
about architecture, back in the hippie movement. I think that in a way they have to be somewhat

01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:25.280
of a hippie, somewhat of a kind of a jack of all trades, master of all.

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:27.600
And yet with humility.

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:35.280
And yet with humility. Now, that is hard to find. And that is why when I start an interview,

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:41.760
I talk about childhood memories, and I asked about music, and I ask about connection. And

01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:50.080
through these interviews, you can learn a lot about a person's future by spending time hearing

01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:57.040
them talk about their past. Do you find that educational, like PhDs versus like what's the

01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:02.880
life trajectory? Yours is an interesting life trajectory too. Like what's the life trajectory

01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:05.040
that leads to the kind of person that would work with you?

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:13.360
It's, you know, people who have ideally had industry experience and know what it's like

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:18.480
to be in the quote unquote real world. They're dreamers that are addicted to reality as opposed

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:24.080
to realists that are addicted to dreams. Meaning they have that innocence in them. They have the

01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:33.920
hunger. They have the idealism without being entitled and with understanding the systems

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:40.160
that govern our world and understanding how to utilize these systems as forging horses to

01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:47.360
bring those values into the world. There are individuals who feel comfortable in this friction

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:59.200
between highly wondrous and dreamy and incredible fantasy renditions of what the world could be with

01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:07.440
extremely brilliant skills in terms of their disciplinary background. So PhD with industrial

01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:15.760
experience in a certain field or a double major in two fields that make no sense whatsoever in

01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:22.800
their combination are things that really, really attract me. Especially that spans the technology,

01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:28.800
biology gap. Yes. Technology, biology, nature, culture. I mean, the secret to one thing is

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:33.440
through the lens of another and I always believe in that kind of translational design ability

01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:38.160
to be able to see something through the lens of another and always allows you to think again,

01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:45.280
begin again, reestablish, redefine, suspend your disbelief, revisit. And when you revisit enough

01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:52.160
times, like 100 times or like 200 times and you revisit the same question through the lens of

01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:58.880
any possible discipline and any possible scenario, eventually you get to the truth.

01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:08.000
I have to ask you, because you work at the interplay of the machine and the natural world,

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:14.080
is there a good definition for you of what is life? What is a living organism?

01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:21.200
Mm hmm. I think like 440 million years ago, there were all these plants that

01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:30.400
the cyanobacteria, I believe actually, that was like the first extinction, right? There were

01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:35.920
five extinctions. We are apparently the sixth. We are in the eye of the storm. We are in the

01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:41.040
sixth extinction. We are going to be extinct as we speak. I mean, death is upon us whether we want

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:49.680
to admit it or not. And actually, they found in Argentina and in various places around the world,

01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:55.680
they found these spores of the first plants that existed on the planet and they

01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:02.800
emerged out of these cyanobacteria were the first, of course, and then they found these spore-based

01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:09.680
plants. And because they didn't have seeds or only spores, the spores became sort of the fossils by

01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:16.000
which we've come to know of their existence. And because of these spores, we know that this first

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:24.400
extinction existed. But this extinction is actually what enabled plants to resurrect, right? So the

01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:33.840
death of these first plants, because they clinked to the rocks and they generated a ton of phosphorus

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:41.440
that went into the ocean by clinging to the rocks like 60 times more phosphorus than without them.

01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:48.720
And then all this phosphorus basically choked the oceans and made them super cold and without

01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:57.120
oxygen, aoxic. And then we lost the plant kingdom. And then because of the death of these first plants,

01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:04.000
they actually enriched the soil and created nutrients for these new plants to come to the

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:13.120
planet. And those planets had more sophisticated vein systems and they were moving beyond spores

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:19.840
to seeded plants, et cetera, and flowering plants. And so in a way, one mass extinction

01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:29.280
sort of led in the Ordovician period sort of led to life as we know it. And where would we be without

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:36.000
plants in a way? So I think that death is very much part of life. And through that definition,

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:43.680
that kind of planetary wide definition in the context of hundreds of millions of years,

01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:52.880
life gains a completely new sort of a new light. And that's when the particles become a wave,

01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:59.440
where humans are, we are not alone and we are here because of those plants. So I think death is very

01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:08.160
much part of life. So in the context of the redwood tree, perhaps life is defined as

01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:14.480
as 10 generations. And through the lens of a bacteria, perhaps life is defined as a

01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:22.160
millisecond. And perhaps through the lens of an AGI, life is defined as all of human civilization.

01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:31.440
So I think it really is a question of this time scale again, the time scale and the organism,

01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:35.680
the life form that's asking the question through which we can answer what is life.

01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:41.840
What do you think about this? If we think of ourselves as in the eye of the storm of

01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:50.160
another extinction, the natural question to ask here is you have all of nature and then you have

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:55.840
this new human creation that is currently being termed artificial intelligence.

01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:05.120
How does your work play with the possibility of a future super intelligent ecosystem

01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:14.800
and AGI that either joins or supersedes humans? Yeah. So I'm glad you asked this question.

01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:22.240
And are you hopeful or terrified? Both. I'm hopeful and terrified. I did watch your interview

01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:27.680
with Elias Ryudkovsky and I loved it. Because you were scared or because you were excited

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:37.840
First of all, I was both. I was totally scared, shamed, excited and totally also

01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:45.360
inspired because he's just such an incredible thinker. And I can agree or disagree with what

01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:53.120
he says, but I just found his way of thinking about AGI and the perils of humanity as a result.

01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:58.880
There's an inevitability to what he's saying. His advice to young people is that prepare for

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:10.960
a short life. He thinks it's very, almost simple. It's almost common sense that AGI would get rid

01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:19.440
of humans, that he can't imagine a trajectory eventually that leads to a place that doesn't

01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:26.080
have AGI kill all humans. There's just too many trajectories where a super intelligent systems

01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:35.120
gets rid of humans and in the near term. And so that clarity of thinking is very sobering. To me,

01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:40.800
maybe it is to you as well. It's super inspiring because I think he's wrong,

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:46.560
but it's like you almost want to prove him wrong. It's like, no, we humans are clever

01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:51.440
bunch. We're going to find a way. It is a bit like jumping into super cold water. It's sort of a

01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:59.360
fist in your face. It wakes you up. And I like these moments so much. And he was able to bring

01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:09.600
that moment to life, even though I think a mother can never think that way ever. And it's a little

01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:16.480
bit like that notion of, I love her more than evolution requires. On your question about AGI

01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:24.000
and nature, look, I think we've been through a lot in terms of, to get here, we sort of moved from

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:28.880
data, the ability to collect information, to knowledge, the ability to use this information

01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:33.920
for utility, from knowledge to intelligence. And what is intelligence? It's the ability to problem

01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:39.360
solve and adapt and translate. So that sort of from data to information to knowledge,

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:45.440
I think the next frontier is wisdom. And what is wisdom? Wisdom is the ability to have or

01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:54.240
find insight about the world and from wisdom to spiritual awareness, which transcends wisdom and

01:53:54.240 --> 01:54:01.360
is able to chart the world into new territory. But I think what is interesting about AGI is that

01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:07.120
it is sort of almost like a self-recursive thing, right? Because it's like a washing machine of like

01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:13.600
a third derivative Wikipedia. It uses kind of like language to create language, to create language,

01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:18.800
to create language. It feels like novelty is being constantly created. It doesn't feel like

01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:24.080
it's regurgitating. And that's so fascinating because these are not the stochastic parrots.

01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:32.320
This is sort of a new form of emergence, perhaps, of novelty, as you say, that exists by virtue of

01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:42.720
using old things to create new things. But it's not as if the AGI has self-awareness, right? It's

01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:51.440
not as if it has maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe it has. But as far as I can tell, it's not as if AGI has

01:54:51.440 --> 01:55:00.160
approached consciousness or sentience just yet. It's probably getting there. But the language appears

01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:06.320
to present itself as if there is sentience there, but it doesn't. But I think that's the problem.

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:13.040
At the point where this AGI sounds like me and speaks like me and behaves like me and feels like

01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:20.720
me and breathes like me and my daughter knows the AGI to be me is sort of the end of everything,

01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:28.640
is the end of human agency. But what is the end of human agency to humans, I think, is the beginning

01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:34.160
of agency to nature. Because if you take all of this agency, if you take all of these language

01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:42.560
models that can summarize all of human civilization and consciousness and then upload that to nature

01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:48.240
and have nature now deal with that world of consciousness that it never had access to.

01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:57.200
So maybe through Eliezel's lens, the short-lived human becomes sort of a very long-lived human-like

01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:06.960
sentient weeping willow. Maybe, maybe that's the end and the beginning. And maybe on the more

01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:15.840
optimistic side for us humans, it's a different form of existence where everything we create and

01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:26.880
everything we consume and everything we process is all made up of six elements and that's it.

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:36.640
And there's only those six elements and not 118 elements. And it's all the stuff of biology plus

01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:43.840
some fair amount of bits, genes, and atoms. A lot of Beethoven.

01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:50.080
A lot of Beethoven. I think the idea of connecting AGI to nature through your work is really

01:56:50.080 --> 01:57:01.920
fascinating. Sort of unlocking this incredible machinery of intelligence that is AGI and

01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:09.040
connecting it to the incredible machinery of wisdom that is nature as evolved through billions of

01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:20.000
years. A pretty crazy, intense evolution. Exactly. And unlike sort of, again, I'm going back to

01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:27.760
directed evolution, unlike this sort of high-throughput brute force approach,

01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:35.040
if there is a way to utilize this synergy for diversity and diversification,

01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:45.920
like, yeah, what happens if you ask a chat GPT question that it takes 10,000 years to answer that

01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:55.280
question? What does that look like when you completely switch the time scale and you can

01:57:55.280 --> 01:58:04.000
afford the time to answer the question? And again, I don't know, but that world to me is possibly

01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:12.240
amazing. Do you think there's, because when you start to think about time scales like this,

01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:18.560
just looking at Earth, all the possible trajectories in my take of this living organism that is Earth,

01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:24.240
do you think there's others like it? Do you think there's other planets with life forms on them that

01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:32.720
are just doing their thing in this kind of way? Because in what you're doing, you're directly

01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:39.760
playing with what's possible with life, lifelike things that kind of maps the question of, well,

01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:48.160
what kind of other things are possible elsewhere? Do you think there's other worlds full of life,

01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:55.120
full of alien life out there? I've studied the calculations that point towards the

01:58:55.520 --> 01:59:05.840
verdict that the possibility of life around us is very, very low. We are a chosen planet in a way,

01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:14.880
right? There's water and there's love. What else do you need? And that sort of very peculiar

01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:23.920
juxtaposition of conditions, the oxygen, the water, the carbon, again, is in a way a miracle,

01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:34.400
given the massive extinctions that we've been through as life forms. And that said,

01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:42.800
I cannot believe that there is no other life form. I want to believe more than I know

01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:51.760
that yes, that there are life forms in the white fountain that is the black hole,

01:59:51.840 --> 02:00:01.760
right? That there are these life forms that are light years away from us, that are forming other

02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:08.880
forms of life forces. I'm much more worried about probably the thing that you're working on,

02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:16.640
which is that there's all kinds of life out around us that we're not communicating with.

02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:17.760
Yes.

02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:24.080
So there's aliens, in a sense, all around us that we're not seeing, that we're not talking to,

02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:30.480
that we're not communicating. Because that to me just seems the more likely situation.

02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:31.680
That they're here.

02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:38.160
That they're here. They're all around us in different forms. There's a thing that connects

02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:46.240
all of us, all of living beings across the universe. And we're just beginning to understand

02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:51.440
any of it. And I feel like that's the important problem is, I feel like you can get there with

02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:57.280
the tools of science today by just studying life on earth. Unlock some really fundamental things

02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:02.720
that maybe you can start to answer questions about, what is consciousness? Maybe this thing

02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:09.760
that we've been saying about love, but honestly, in a serious way. And then you'll start to

02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:18.480
understand that there is alien life all out there. And it's much more complicated and

02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:24.480
interesting than we kind of realize, as opposed to looking to human-like, exactly human-like things.

02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:27.760
It's the variety of life that's possible is just almost endless.

02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:35.040
I totally agree with you. I think, again, define alien, right?

02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:38.880
Define intelligence. Define life.

02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:43.200
Right. And Marvin Minsky used to say, intelligence is a suitcase word.

02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:49.840
It's a word so big, it's a word like sustainability, and it's a word like rock and roll.

02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:55.040
And suitcase words are always very, very dangerous.

02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:58.960
Speaking of rock and roll, you've mentioned music and you mentioned Beethoven a bunch of times.

02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:07.600
You've also tweeted about you getting a kiss in performance and so on. What can you say about the

02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:14.800
role of music in your life? I love music. I always wondered why is it that plastic arts,

02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:18.960
meaning architecture and sculpture and painting, can't get us to cry and music

02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:25.600
gets us to cry so quickly and connect so quickly. There is something about music that it is,

02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:32.560
and no wonder that plants also respond to music, but that is the top of the creative pyramid,

02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:36.800
in my opinion. It's a weird mystery that we're so connected to music. By the way,

02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:43.200
to push back, a good bridge will make me cry. A good arch, it's true. And I will say,

02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:49.760
when I visited the Sagrada Familia, I had that kind of spiritual reverence towards

02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:56.000
that spatial experience and being in that space and feeling the intention in the space and

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:04.080
appreciating every little gesture. So it's true. It is the universal language. It's the language

02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:10.240
of waves. It's the language of the waves, not the language of the particles. It is the universal

02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:18.560
language, I believe. And that is definitely one of my loves. And you said that if you weren't

02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:23.760
doing what you were doing now, perhaps you would be a film director. So I have to ask,

02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:32.240
what do you think is the best film of all time? Maybe top three. Yeah, maybe The Godfather.

02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:38.400
Godfather, okay. The Godfather is definitely up there. Francis Coppola is one of my heroes.

02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:43.600
Have you met him? I have met him. Yes, yes, yes. I was very,

02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:49.280
very lucky. We were very lucky to work with him on his new film, Megalopolis, which is coming out,

02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:55.360
I hope, in 2024. And think about the cities of the future in the context of new materials and

02:03:56.320 --> 02:04:00.640
the unity between nature and culture. Godfather is definitely up there.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:09.120
2001 is up there. I would watch that film again and again and again. It's incredible.

02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:19.760
The last scene in Odyssey 2001, that's just watch the last scene of 2001, then listen to

02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:28.480
Yudkovsky, and then go to the garden, and that's pretty much the end and the beginning. But that

02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:37.760
scene, that last scene from 2001 is everything. It says so much with so little, and it's sort of

02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:46.960
the embodiment, I believe, of ambivalence. And there's opportunity to believe in the beginning

02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:53.840
of humankind, the end of humankind, the planet, child, star, or star child of the future.

02:04:55.280 --> 02:05:03.360
Was there a death? Was there a reincarnation? That final scene, to me, is something that

02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:10.960
I go back to and study. And every time there is a different reading of that scene that inspires me.

02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:16.720
So that scene, and then the first scene in The Godfather, still one of the best scenes of all

02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:22.640
times. Sort of a portrait of America, the ideals and values that are brought from Italy.

02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:29.680
A family of loyalty, of values, of how different values are constructed.

02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:36.240
Yes, loyalty, and the human spirit, and how Coppola celebrates the human spirit through

02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:44.720
the most simple gestures in language and acting. And I think in Kubrick, you see this highly curated

02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:54.400
and controlled and manicured vision of creating a film. And with Francis, it's like an Italian

02:05:54.400 --> 02:06:01.040
feast. It's like anything can happen at any moment in time. And just being on the set with him

02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:09.200
is an experience I'll take with me to my grave. It's very, very, very special.

02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:13.520
And you said music is also a part of that, of creating a feeling in the movies.

02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:20.880
Yeah. Actually, The Godfather, that tune.

02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:24.960
That makes me emotional every time on some weird level.

02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:36.960
Yeah, it's one of these tunes I'm sure that has, if you play it to a jasmine, you'll get the best

02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:43.920
scent of all times. But I think with that particular tune, I learned staccato,

02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:53.200
as something very, very happy and joyous. And then made into this stretched in time and became

02:06:53.840 --> 02:07:03.040
kind of the refrain of nostalgia and melancholy and loyalty and all of these values that ride

02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:08.000
on top of this one single tune. And you can play it in all kinds of different ways. I've played it

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:13.680
on guitar in all kinds of different ways. And I think in Godfather III, the son plays it on guitar

02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:20.960
to the father. I think this happens in movies, but sometimes a melody, and that's a simple melody

02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:31.360
can just like... And the Strauss melody in 2001. And when you juxtapose these melodies with

02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:37.920
the scene, you get this again, whole that's bigger than some of its parts where you get this moment

02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:46.240
that is, I think, like these are the moments I would send with the next Voyager to outer space.

02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:54.160
I definitely send the Godfather in 2001 would definitely be on that golden record.

02:07:54.880 --> 02:08:00.560
You are an incredibly successful scientist, engineer, architect, artist, designer. You've

02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:06.080
mentored a lot of successful people. Can you give advice to young people listening to this?

02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:13.760
How to have a successful career and how to have a successful life?

02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:20.880
Look, I think there's this beautiful line in Sheltering Sky. How many times have you seen

02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:29.840
a full moon in your life and actually took the time to ingest and explore and reflect upon

02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:36.320
the full moon? Probably 20, I believe he says. I spend time with a full moon.

02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:46.720
I take my time with a full moon, and I pay attention to a full moon. And I think paying

02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:58.400
attention to the seasons and taking time to appreciate the little things, the simple things

02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:08.240
is what makes a meaningful life. I was very lucky to have grown up in a home that

02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:18.400
taught me this way of being. My parents, my grandmother, who played a very important role

02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:32.560
in my growing up. And that ability to pay attention and to be present is so, so,

02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:36.960
so I could not emphasize it enough. It's so crucial.

02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:40.000
And be grateful.

02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:48.800
And be grateful. I think gratitude and presence, appreciation are really

02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:53.120
the most important things in life.

02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:56.640
If you could take a short tangent about your grandmother,

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:04.080
who's played a big role in your life, what do you remember? What lessons have you learned from her?

02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:09.120
She had this blanket that she would give me every time I came back from school and say,

02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:14.000
do your homework here and meet with your friends here. And it was always in her garden.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:21.040
And her garden in my mind was ginormous. But last I went there and saw the site,

02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:28.320
which has now become the site for another tall building, it was a tiny, tiny little garden

02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:36.000
that to me seemed so large when I was growing up because it had everything. It had

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:44.320
fig trees. It had olive trees. It had mushrooms. It had the blanket. I would do my homework there.

02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:52.800
It was everything. And I needed nothing else. And that was my Garden of Eden. That was my

02:10:52.800 --> 02:11:00.880
childhood. And she taught me we would lie on the blanket and look at the clouds and reflect upon

02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:05.120
the shapes of the clouds and study the shapes of the plants. And there was a lot of wonder

02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:13.280
in that childhood with her. And she taught me the importance of wonder

02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:23.840
in sort of in an eternal childhood and living adulthood as a child. And so I'm very,

02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:33.440
very grateful for that. I think it is the sense of wonder. The speaking up was always something

02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:42.480
that she adhered to, to speak up your truth, to be straightforward, to be positive. These are

02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:49.840
things that I also got from my mom. And from my mom, the sense of humor. She had the best sense

02:11:49.840 --> 02:12:00.240
of humor that I could think of and was just a joy to be around. And my father taught me everything.

02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:03.360
My father taught me everything I know. My mom taught me everything I feel.

02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:08.000
My grandma taught me everything I incite.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.760
Well, I see the sense of wonder that just carries through everything you do.

02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:20.560
So I think you would make your grandmother proud. Well, what about advice for how to have a career?

02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:27.440
So you've had a very interesting career and a successful career, but not an easy one.

02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:29.360
You took a few leaps.

02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:36.080
I did take a few leaps and they were uncomfortable. My father, and I'll never forget,

02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:44.080
I think we were listening to a Rolling Stones song in the kitchen and my dad,

02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:49.600
who's actually born in Boston, he's American, he said,

02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:55.760
I started to have sort of these second thoughts about continuing my education in Israel and I

02:12:55.760 --> 02:13:02.000
wanted to go, I was on my way to London to the Architectural Association to do my diploma studies

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:08.080
there. And he looked at me and he said, get out of here, kiddo, you've got to get out of here.

02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:15.120
And you've outgrown where you're at, you need to move forward. Another thing he had taught me,

02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:20.000
you need to move forward. Another thing he had taught me, the feeling of discomfort,

02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:28.640
as you say, the feeling of loneliness and discomfort is imperative to growth.

02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:36.640
Growth is painful, period. Any form of growth is difficult and painful. Birth is difficult

02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:43.360
and painful. And it is really, really important to place yourself in situations of discomfort.

02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:48.320
I like to be in a room where everyone in the room is more intelligent than me. I like to be

02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:56.400
in that kind of state where the people that I surround myself with are orders of magnitude,

02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:02.320
more intelligent than I am. And I can say that that is true of all of my team members.

02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:09.040
And that's the intellectual discomfort that I feed off of. The same is true for physical exertion.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:16.640
You've got to put yourself in these uncomfortable situations in order to grow,

02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:27.920
in order to find comfort. And then, on the other hand, is love, is finding love and finding that

02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:38.320
human, this other human that complements you and that makes you a better version

02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:48.640
of the one you are and even of the one you want to be. But with gratitude and attention and love,

02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:56.800
you can go so, so far. To the younger generation, I don't speak of a career. I never thought of

02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:06.560
my work as my career ever. And there was this constant entanglement between life and work

02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:13.920
and love and longing and being and mothering. It's all the same. And I appreciate that to some

02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:27.040
people that doesn't work in their arrangement of will versus comfort versus the reality.

02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:33.120
But for me, it has always worked. So I think to the younger generation, I say don't think of

02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:38.880
your career. A career is something that is imposed upon you. Think of your calling. That's something

02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:46.640
that's innately and directionally moves you. And it's something that transcends a career.

02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:53.600
Similarly, you can think about the difference between learning versus being educated. Being

02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:56.960
educated is something that's given to you, that's external, that's being imposed,

02:15:56.960 --> 02:16:01.200
that's top-down imposed. Learning is something that comes from within. It's also the difference

02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:08.400
between joy and happiness. Many times I'm sad and I'm still joyous. And it's very, very important

02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:17.680
to understand the difference between these externally perceived success paths and internally

02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:26.160
driven, value-based ways of being in the world. And we together, when we combine all of these,

02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:38.720
the broken puzzle, let's say, of substance and vulnerability, we get this bigger,

02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:46.880
gestalt, this wondrous world of a future that is peaceful, that is

02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:57.920
wholesome, and that advocates for that kind of synergy that we've been talking about throughout.

02:16:58.720 --> 02:16:59.760
But it's all fun.

02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:06.320
Well, thank you for this incredible conversation. Thank you for all the work you're doing. And I

02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:14.240
have to say that thank you for noticing me and listening to me. You're somebody from just today

02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:20.400
and from our exchanges before this. There's a sense where you care about me as a human being,

02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:25.760
which I could tell you care about other humans. Thank you for doing that. Thank you for having

02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:33.680
empathy and just really listening and noticing me, that I exist. So thank you for that.

02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:38.240
I've been a huge fan of your work. I've been a huge fan of who you are as a human being.

02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:43.760
It's just an honor to sit with me. Thank you. Thank you so much, Lex. I feel the same way.

02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:49.200
I'll just say the same. And I look forward to hearing the response to my job application.

02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:56.240
You're accepted. We all speak of you all the time. Thank you so much. Thank you, Neri.

time.
