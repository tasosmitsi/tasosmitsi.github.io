00:00.000 --> 00:02.160
There is a famous story about Einstein

00:02.160 --> 00:04.840
that he used to, you know, go think, think, think,

00:04.840 --> 00:06.280
and then go for a walk,

00:06.280 --> 00:08.020
and like he would whistle sometimes.

00:08.020 --> 00:10.880
So I remember the first time I heard of this story,

00:10.880 --> 00:12.160
I thought, hmm, how interesting.

00:12.160 --> 00:14.040
So what a coincidence that this came to him

00:14.040 --> 00:15.440
when he was whistling.

00:15.440 --> 00:16.360
But in fact, it's not.

00:16.360 --> 00:19.040
This is how it works in some sense,

00:19.040 --> 00:21.820
that you have to prepare for it,

00:21.820 --> 00:24.440
but then it happens when you stop thinking actually.

00:24.440 --> 00:28.840
So the moment of discovery is the moment when thinking stops

00:28.840 --> 00:33.840
and you kind of almost become that truth that you're seeking.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.120
The following is a conversation with Edward Frankel,

00:41.120 --> 00:43.600
one of the greatest living mathematicians,

00:43.600 --> 00:46.400
doing research on the interface of mathematics

00:46.400 --> 00:47.620
and quantum physics,

00:47.620 --> 00:50.320
with an emphasis on the Langlands program,

00:50.320 --> 00:53.380
which he describes as a grand unified theory

00:53.380 --> 00:54.640
of mathematics.

00:54.640 --> 00:57.680
He also is the author of Love and Math,

00:57.720 --> 01:00.260
the Heart of Hidden Reality.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.200
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.040
To support it,

01:03.040 --> 01:05.400
please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.200
And now, dear friends,

01:07.200 --> 01:09.020
here's Edward Frankel.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.320
You open your book, Love and Math,

01:12.320 --> 01:14.000
with the question,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.240
how does one become a mathematician?

01:16.240 --> 01:18.200
There are many ways that this can happen.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.260
Let me tell you how it happened to me.

01:20.260 --> 01:22.400
So how did it happen to you?

01:22.400 --> 01:23.440
So first of all,

01:23.440 --> 01:25.180
I grew up in the Soviet Union.

01:26.180 --> 01:30.300
In a small town near Moscow called Kolomna.

01:32.060 --> 01:35.260
And I was a smart kid, you know, in school,

01:35.260 --> 01:38.740
but mathematics was probably my least favorite subject.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.020
Not because I couldn't do it.

01:41.020 --> 01:42.980
I was, you know, a straight A student

01:42.980 --> 01:46.800
and I could do all the problems easily,

01:46.800 --> 01:48.840
but I thought it was incredibly boring.

01:49.980 --> 01:53.480
And since the only math I knew

01:53.480 --> 01:55.880
was what was presented at school,

01:57.080 --> 01:58.440
I thought that was it.

01:58.440 --> 02:01.560
And I was like, what kind of boring subject is this?

02:01.560 --> 02:04.320
So what I really liked was physics

02:04.320 --> 02:05.880
and especially quantum physics.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.880
So I was buying,

02:09.120 --> 02:12.660
I would go to a bookstore and buy popular books

02:12.660 --> 02:17.660
about elementary particles and atoms and things like that,

02:18.640 --> 02:20.840
and read them, you know, devour them.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.560
And so I thought my dream was to become

02:24.560 --> 02:28.080
a theoretical physicist and to delve

02:28.080 --> 02:31.480
into this finer structure of the universe, you know.

02:31.480 --> 02:35.080
So then something happened when I was 15 years old.

02:35.960 --> 02:39.080
It turns out that a friend of my parents

02:39.080 --> 02:42.680
was a mathematician who was a professor at the local college.

02:42.680 --> 02:46.440
It was a small college preparing educators, teachers.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.480
It's a provincial town.

02:47.480 --> 02:50.960
Imagine it's like 117 kilometers from Moscow,

02:50.960 --> 02:53.440
which would be something like 70 miles, I guess.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.280
You do the math.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.080
I like how you remember the number exactly.

02:57.080 --> 03:00.040
Yeah, it's not funny how we remember numbers.

03:00.040 --> 03:04.080
So his name was Yevgeny Yevgenyevich Petrov.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.680
And if this doesn't remind you

03:06.680 --> 03:09.680
of the great works of Russian literature,

03:09.680 --> 03:11.080
then you haven't read them.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.640
Like we're in peace, you know,

03:13.640 --> 03:16.240
with the patronymic names, but this was all real.

03:16.240 --> 03:17.800
This was all happening.

03:17.800 --> 03:22.000
So my mom one day by chance met Yevgeny Yevgenyevich

03:22.000 --> 03:25.720
and told him about me, that I was this bright kid

03:25.720 --> 03:28.200
and interested in physics.

03:28.200 --> 03:31.280
And he said, oh, I want to meet him.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.120
I'm going to convert him into math.

03:34.040 --> 03:37.280
And my mom was like, nah, math, he doesn't like mathematics.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.640
So they said, okay, let's see what I can do.

03:40.640 --> 03:41.800
So I went to see him.

03:41.800 --> 03:46.080
So I'm about 15 and a bit arrogant,

03:46.080 --> 03:48.760
I would say, you know, like average teenager.

03:49.640 --> 03:51.760
So he says to me,

03:52.720 --> 03:57.720
so I hear that you are interested in physics

03:57.960 --> 03:59.040
and elementary particles.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.120
I said, yeah, sure.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.360
I said, for example, do you know about quarks?

04:04.480 --> 04:06.840
And I said, yes, of course I know about quarks.

04:06.840 --> 04:11.840
Quarks are the, you know, constituents of particles

04:12.240 --> 04:13.640
like protons and neutrons.

04:13.640 --> 04:15.640
And it was one of the greatest discoveries

04:15.800 --> 04:18.200
in theoretical physics in the sixties

04:18.200 --> 04:20.680
that those particles were not elementary,

04:20.680 --> 04:23.640
but in fact had the smaller parts.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.280
And he said, oh, so then you probably know

04:25.280 --> 04:27.720
representation theory of the group SU3.

04:27.720 --> 04:31.400
It was like, SU what?

04:31.400 --> 04:35.760
So in fact, I wanted to know

04:35.760 --> 04:38.840
what were the underpinnings of those theories.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.640
I knew the story, I knew the narrative,

04:40.640 --> 04:42.880
I knew kind of this basic story

04:42.880 --> 04:44.560
of what these particles look like.

04:44.560 --> 04:48.320
But how did physicists come up with these ideas?

04:48.320 --> 04:50.920
How were they able to theorize them?

04:50.920 --> 04:53.160
And so I remembered, you know, like it was yesterday.

04:53.160 --> 04:57.840
So he pulls out a book and it's kind of like a Bible,

04:57.840 --> 05:00.000
you know, like a substantial book.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.680
And he opens it somewhere in the middle.

05:02.680 --> 05:06.480
And there I see the diagrams that I saw in popular books,

05:06.480 --> 05:09.520
but in popular books, there was no explanation.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.760
And now I see all these weird symbols and equations.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.480
It's clear that it is explained in there.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.320
Oh my God.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.360
He said, you think what they teach you at school

05:20.360 --> 05:21.320
is mathematics?

05:22.200 --> 05:24.720
It's like, no, this is real mathematics.

05:25.640 --> 05:28.240
So I was instantly converted.

05:28.240 --> 05:32.960
That you understand the underpinnings of physical reality.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.800
You have to understand what SU3 is.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.760
You have to learn what are groups,

05:37.760 --> 05:42.680
what is group SU3, what are representations of SU3.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.560
There was a coherent and beautiful.

05:45.560 --> 05:46.880
I could appreciate the beauty,

05:46.880 --> 05:50.800
even though I could not understand heads and tails of it.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.960
But you were drawn to the methodology,

05:52.960 --> 05:57.600
the machinery of how such understanding could be attained.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.160
Well, in retrospect,

05:59.160 --> 06:04.160
I think what I was really craving was a deeper understanding.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.920
And up to that point,

06:05.920 --> 06:08.280
the deepest that I could see was for those diagrams,

06:08.280 --> 06:11.000
but for that story that, you know,

06:11.040 --> 06:12.760
proton consists of three quarks

06:12.760 --> 06:14.480
and the neutron consists of three quarks

06:14.480 --> 06:17.080
and they're called up and down and so on.

06:17.080 --> 06:21.480
But I didn't know that there was actually underneath,

06:21.480 --> 06:24.920
beneath the surface, there was this mathematical theory.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.320
If you can just linger on it,

06:26.320 --> 06:28.560
what drew you to quantum mechanics?

06:29.440 --> 06:34.040
Is there some romantic notion of understanding the universe?

06:34.040 --> 06:35.280
What is interesting to you?

06:35.280 --> 06:36.400
Is it the puzzle of it

06:36.400 --> 06:38.240
or is it like the philosophical thing?

06:38.240 --> 06:40.600
Now I am looking back.

06:40.600 --> 06:45.600
So whatever I say about Edward at 15,

06:46.960 --> 06:50.920
is colored by my, you know,

06:50.920 --> 06:53.720
all my experiences that happen in the meantime.

06:53.720 --> 06:54.560
I should say-

06:54.560 --> 06:55.600
My current views and so on.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.400
For the people who may not know you,

06:57.400 --> 07:00.000
I think your book and your presentations

07:00.000 --> 07:01.760
kind of revealed that that 15 year old

07:01.760 --> 07:02.840
is still in there somewhere.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.120
Well, I take it as a compliment.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.160
Some of the joy.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.440
He's probably still here now, yes.

07:08.440 --> 07:09.280
In some way.

07:10.240 --> 07:11.960
Yeah, I think it was a joy of discovery

07:11.960 --> 07:15.600
and the joy of going deeper into the kind of the,

07:16.680 --> 07:21.320
to the root, to the deepest structures of the universe,

07:21.320 --> 07:24.440
to the secrets, the secrets.

07:24.440 --> 07:27.120
And we may not discover all of them.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.600
We may not be able to understand,

07:28.600 --> 07:32.960
but we're going to try and go as far and as deep as we can.

07:32.960 --> 07:37.480
I think that's what was the motivating factor in this.

07:37.480 --> 07:38.840
Yeah, there's this mystery.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.440
There's this dark room

07:40.440 --> 07:42.640
and there's a few of these mathematical physicists.

07:42.640 --> 07:47.640
They're able to shine a flashlight briefly into there.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.200
We'll talk about it,

07:50.200 --> 07:51.440
but it also kind of makes me sad

07:51.440 --> 07:54.960
that there's so few of your kind

07:54.960 --> 07:59.960
that have the flashlight to look into the room.

08:01.000 --> 08:01.840
It's interesting.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.680
I don't think there are so few, to be honest,

08:04.680 --> 08:07.640
because I think I find a lot of people

08:07.640 --> 08:09.520
are actually interested.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.200
If you talk to people,

08:11.200 --> 08:14.080
like some people you wouldn't expect

08:14.080 --> 08:18.560
to be interested in this from all walks of life,

08:18.560 --> 08:22.560
from people of all kinds of professions.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.440
I tell them I'm a mathematician and they're a mathematician.

08:25.440 --> 08:26.880
Okay, so that's a separate story.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.000
A lot of people I think have been traumatized

08:29.000 --> 08:31.240
by their experience in the math classes.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.040
We can talk about it later.

08:33.040 --> 08:35.080
But then they ask me what kind of research I do.

08:35.120 --> 08:39.360
And I mentioned that I work on the interface

08:39.360 --> 08:41.560
of math and quantum physics.

08:41.560 --> 08:42.880
And their eyes light up and say,

08:42.880 --> 08:45.320
oh, quantum physics or like Einstein's relativity.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.520
Oh, I am really curious about it.

08:46.520 --> 08:49.240
I watch this podcast or I watch that podcast.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.080
And I've learned this.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.920
It's like, what do you think about that?

08:51.920 --> 08:54.640
So I actually find that actually physicists

08:54.640 --> 08:58.640
are doing a great job educating the public, so to speak,

08:58.640 --> 09:03.640
and in terms of popular books

09:04.480 --> 09:05.960
and videos and so on.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.520
Mathematicians are behind.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.600
We're starting to catch up a little bit,

09:10.600 --> 09:12.400
have been starting the last 10 years,

09:12.400 --> 09:13.760
but we're still behind.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.640
But I think people are curious.

09:16.640 --> 09:20.000
Science is still very much something

09:20.000 --> 09:23.280
that people want to learn because that's our kind of,

09:23.280 --> 09:25.360
the best way we know to establish

09:25.360 --> 09:29.360
some sort of objective reality, whatever that might be.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.280
Yeah, and to figure out this whole puzzle,

09:31.280 --> 09:33.080
to figure out the secrets that the universe holds.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.320
Things that we can agree on, kind of.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.240
Even though for me, at this point,

09:37.240 --> 09:40.280
I always make an argument that our physical theories

09:40.280 --> 09:42.120
always change, they get updated.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.840
So you had Newton's theory of gravity,

09:44.840 --> 09:49.760
then Einstein's theory superseded it.

09:49.760 --> 09:53.760
But in mathematics, it seems that theories don't change.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.840
Pythagoras' theorem has been the same

09:56.840 --> 09:59.000
for the last 2,500 years.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.680
X squared plus Y squared equals Z squared.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.320
We don't expect that next year, suddenly,

10:03.320 --> 10:06.080
it will be Z cubed, you know?

10:06.080 --> 10:10.480
So that, to me, is actually even more,

10:10.480 --> 10:14.200
hints even more at how much we are connected to each other

10:14.200 --> 10:16.720
because Pythagoras' theory, if you think about it,

10:16.720 --> 10:18.640
or any other mathematical theorem,

10:19.840 --> 10:22.960
means the same thing to anyone in the world today,

10:22.960 --> 10:26.920
regardless of their cultural upbringing,

10:26.960 --> 10:31.960
religion, ideas, ideology, gender, whatever,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.160
nationality, race, whatever, right?

10:35.160 --> 10:39.520
And it has meant the same to everyone, everywhere,

10:39.520 --> 10:41.920
and most likely will mean the same.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.720
So that's, to me, kind of an antidote

10:45.880 --> 10:48.920
to the kind of divisiveness

10:48.920 --> 10:51.200
that we sometimes observe these days,

10:51.200 --> 10:53.840
where it seems that we can't agree on anything.

10:54.800 --> 10:58.760
To the political complexity of two plus two equals five

10:58.760 --> 11:01.200
in George Orwell's 1984.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.880
I was in the Soviet Union in 1984,

11:02.880 --> 11:07.640
and so in many ways, I see that it was prescient.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.200
The novel was prescient.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.640
But we still have not found a dictator

11:11.640 --> 11:14.080
who would actually say two plus two equals five

11:14.080 --> 11:17.120
and would demand their citizens to repeat that.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.120
The night is still young.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.960
Has not happened yet, okay?

11:19.960 --> 11:23.040
Yeah, but it does feel like math and physics

11:23.080 --> 11:25.880
are both sneaking up to a deep truth

11:25.880 --> 11:27.560
from slightly different angles,

11:27.560 --> 11:29.840
and you stand at the crossroads

11:29.840 --> 11:31.920
or at the intersection of the two.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.240
It's interesting to ask, what do you think

11:33.240 --> 11:35.720
is the difference between physics and mathematics

11:35.720 --> 11:39.080
in the way physics and mathematics look at the world?

11:39.080 --> 11:42.560
There is actually an essential difference,

11:42.560 --> 11:44.440
which is that physicists are interested

11:44.440 --> 11:48.120
in describing this universe, okay?

11:48.120 --> 11:50.400
Mathematicians are interested in describing

11:50.400 --> 11:52.440
all possible mathematical universes,

11:52.440 --> 11:55.960
of which, and some of our work,

11:55.960 --> 11:57.760
I still consider myself more of a mathematician

11:57.760 --> 11:59.240
than a physicist.

11:59.240 --> 12:02.240
My first love for physics, notwithstanding.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.040
Mathematicians are, in a way,

12:07.520 --> 12:09.960
we have more diversity, if you might say.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.440
So we are accepting, for instance,

12:13.520 --> 12:18.440
our universe has three spatial dimensions

12:18.440 --> 12:19.800
and one time dimension, right?

12:19.800 --> 12:22.120
So what I mean is that-

12:22.120 --> 12:22.960
Allegedly.

12:22.960 --> 12:24.160
Allegedly.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.400
Observed, but that we can observe today, right?

12:26.400 --> 12:27.720
So of course, there are theories

12:27.720 --> 12:30.240
where there are some hidden dimensions as well.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.480
Well, let's just say observed dimensions.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.640
So this tabletop has two dimensions

12:36.640 --> 12:39.920
because you can have two axes, two coordinate axes.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.760
X and Y, but then there is also a third one

12:43.760 --> 12:46.880
to describe the space of this room.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.880
And then there's a time dimension.

12:48.880 --> 12:51.680
So realistic theories of physics have to be

12:52.840 --> 12:57.200
about spaces of three dimensions

12:57.200 --> 12:59.560
or space times of four dimensions.

12:59.560 --> 13:02.720
But mathematically, we are just as interested

13:02.720 --> 13:06.240
in theories in 10 space time dimensions

13:06.240 --> 13:08.480
or 11 or 25 or whatever,

13:08.480 --> 13:12.680
or infinite dimensional spaces, you know?

13:12.680 --> 13:14.880
So that's the difference.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.760
On the other hand, I have to give it to the physicists.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.480
We don't have the same satisfaction that they have

13:20.480 --> 13:25.480
of having their theories confirmed by an experiment.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.520
We don't get to play with big machines

13:28.520 --> 13:32.840
like LHC in Geneva, large Hadron Collider

13:32.840 --> 13:35.440
that recently discovered the Higgs boson

13:35.440 --> 13:37.160
and some other things.

13:37.160 --> 13:40.240
For us, it's all like a mental exercise in some sense.

13:40.240 --> 13:44.680
We prove things by using rules of logic.

13:44.680 --> 13:47.400
And that's our way of confirming.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.640
Experimental confirmation, if you will.

13:49.640 --> 13:52.800
But I think I kind of envy a little bit my friends physicists

13:52.800 --> 13:57.800
that they get to experience this big toys

13:57.800 --> 13:59.160
and play with them.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.600
But it does seem that sometimes, as you've spoken about,

14:01.600 --> 14:04.920
abstract mathematical concepts map to reality,

14:04.920 --> 14:06.600
and it seems to happen quite a bit.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.440
That's right.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.840
Mathematics underpins physics, obviously.

14:09.840 --> 14:10.960
It's a language.

14:10.960 --> 14:15.960
The book of nature, as Galileo famously said,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.880
is written in the language of mathematics.

14:18.880 --> 14:23.880
And the letters in it are the circles, triangles,

14:24.960 --> 14:26.720
and squares.

14:26.720 --> 14:30.240
And those who don't know the language, I'm paraphrasing,

14:30.240 --> 14:33.680
are left to wander in a dark labyrinth.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.160
That's a famous quote from Galileo,

14:36.160 --> 14:38.600
which is very true and has become even more true

14:38.600 --> 14:41.000
more recently in theoretical physics,

14:41.680 --> 14:46.680
in the most sort of far out parts of the theoretical physics

14:48.280 --> 14:50.040
that have to do with elementary particles

14:50.040 --> 14:53.960
and as well as the structure of the cosmos

14:53.960 --> 14:55.200
at the large scale.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.520
What do you think of Max Tegmark

14:57.520 --> 14:59.680
who wrote the book, Mathematical Universe?

15:00.880 --> 15:04.480
So do you think, just lingering on that point,

15:04.480 --> 15:06.320
you think at the end of the day,

15:07.320 --> 15:09.920
the future generations will all be mathematicians?

15:11.520 --> 15:14.320
Meaning the ones that deeply understand

15:14.320 --> 15:15.400
the way the universe works.

15:15.400 --> 15:19.960
At the core, is it just mathematics?

15:19.960 --> 15:21.960
At the core of, you know,

15:25.240 --> 15:28.120
I would say mathematics is one half of the core.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.440
So the book is called Love and Math.

15:30.440 --> 15:35.440
So these are the two pillars, if you will, in my view.

15:35.840 --> 15:39.200
In other words, you can't cover everything by math.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.800
So mathematics gives you tools,

15:40.800 --> 15:45.800
it gives you way kind of a clear vision.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.080
But mathematics by itself is not enough

15:50.080 --> 15:55.080
for one to have a harmonious and balanced life.

15:55.080 --> 15:59.560
So I am suspicious of any theory

15:59.560 --> 16:03.520
that declares that everything is mathematics.

16:04.760 --> 16:07.640
So math can generate things that are beautiful,

16:07.640 --> 16:10.320
but it can't explain why it's beautiful.

16:10.320 --> 16:13.240
Math, you could say, is a way to discern patterns,

16:13.240 --> 16:15.680
to find regularities in the universe,

16:15.680 --> 16:19.160
and both physical and mental universe.

16:19.160 --> 16:20.840
Mathematics explores the mind

16:20.840 --> 16:25.840
as much as it explores the physical world around us.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.200
And it helps us to find those patterns,

16:29.440 --> 16:33.240
which kind of, which makes our perception more sophisticated,

16:33.240 --> 16:36.800
our ability to perceive things such as beauty.

16:38.120 --> 16:42.320
And it sharpens our ability to see beauty,

16:42.320 --> 16:43.320
to understand beauty.

16:43.320 --> 16:46.200
So our world becomes more complex

16:47.040 --> 16:51.640
from thinking that our, that Earth is flat,

16:51.640 --> 16:54.160
we go to realizing that it is round,

16:54.160 --> 16:56.360
that it's shaped as a sphere,

16:56.360 --> 16:59.400
so that we can actually travel around the Earth.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.440
So there isn't a place where we hit the end, so to speak.

17:03.400 --> 17:08.200
And then proceeding in the same vein,

17:08.200 --> 17:10.840
then Einstein's general relativity theory

17:10.840 --> 17:15.400
tells us that our space-time is not flat either.

17:16.320 --> 17:19.040
This is much harder to imagine

17:19.040 --> 17:22.960
the bent three-dimensional or four-dimensional space

17:22.960 --> 17:24.360
or four-dimensional space-time,

17:24.360 --> 17:27.240
because this idea that the space around us is flat

17:27.240 --> 17:28.880
is so deeply entrenched.

17:28.880 --> 17:32.240
And yet we know from this theory,

17:32.240 --> 17:34.640
and from the experiments that have confirmed it,

17:35.760 --> 17:40.640
that a ray of light bends around a star,

17:40.640 --> 17:43.320
as if being attracted by the force of gravity.

17:43.320 --> 17:46.040
But in fact, the force of gravity is the bending.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.440
It's just that it's not only the bending of the space,

17:48.440 --> 17:50.480
it's also the bending of space-time.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.320
There is a curvature, not only between special,

17:53.320 --> 17:55.520
spatial dimensions,

17:55.520 --> 17:59.000
the way parallels and meridians come together.

17:59.040 --> 18:03.040
In a small scale, they look like perpendicular lines.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.280
But if you zoom out,

18:04.280 --> 18:07.480
you see that the space are curving the space.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.680
They are sort of the tracks

18:09.680 --> 18:11.840
along which the space gets curved.

18:11.840 --> 18:15.160
That would be the curvature of spatial dimensions.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.120
But in fact, now throwing time,

18:17.120 --> 18:19.360
and one time, imagine a sphere,

18:19.360 --> 18:23.720
which has one of the meridians correspond to time,

18:23.720 --> 18:25.280
and the parallels correspond to space.

18:25.280 --> 18:26.200
I can't imagine it,

18:26.200 --> 18:28.600
but I can write mathematical formula

18:28.600 --> 18:30.440
expressing that curvature.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.960
And in fact, that curvature is responsible

18:32.960 --> 18:35.040
for the force of gravity attraction

18:35.040 --> 18:37.960
between the sort of simplest instantiation of it,

18:37.960 --> 18:40.080
attraction between two planets,

18:40.080 --> 18:41.720
or between two human beings,

18:41.720 --> 18:43.800
for that matter.

18:43.800 --> 18:47.320
Yeah, the time, bending time,

18:47.320 --> 18:50.760
it's not very nice what that theory did to time,

18:50.760 --> 18:55.120
because it feels like the marching of time forward

18:55.120 --> 18:57.840
is fundamental to our human experience.

18:57.840 --> 19:02.320
The arrow of time marching forward nicely

19:02.320 --> 19:05.280
seems to be the only way we can understand the universe.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.400
And the fact that you can start now.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.680
Up to now, up to now.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.320
There are people who claim that they can,

19:09.320 --> 19:12.520
that they have, they possess other ways of experiencing it.

19:12.520 --> 19:16.120
So truly can visualize messing with time.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.560
Well, messing with time,

19:17.560 --> 19:18.880
but not necessarily messing with time,

19:18.880 --> 19:21.560
because one point of view is that,

19:23.280 --> 19:24.440
I think, who was it?

19:24.440 --> 19:25.680
I think William Blake,

19:26.640 --> 19:30.840
who wrote that eternity loves time production.

19:30.840 --> 19:34.520
So one point of view is that,

19:34.520 --> 19:36.400
it is eternity which is fundamental,

19:36.400 --> 19:38.320
where time stands still,

19:38.320 --> 19:41.720
which our mind conceptualizes as the time.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.680
So, but in fact, you know, it's not something mystical.

19:45.680 --> 19:50.680
If you think about when you really absorbed in something,

19:52.120 --> 19:53.720
time does stand still.

19:53.720 --> 19:54.920
And then you look at the clock and it's like,

19:54.920 --> 19:56.960
oh my God, two hours have passed.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.360
And it felt like a couple of seconds.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.960
When you are absorbed, when you're in love,

20:01.960 --> 20:04.520
when you are passionate about something,

20:04.520 --> 20:06.120
when you're creating something,

20:07.960 --> 20:10.600
we lose ourselves and we lose the sense of time

20:10.600 --> 20:12.280
and space for that matter, you see.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.400
So there is only that which is happening,

20:14.400 --> 20:16.600
that creative process.

20:18.240 --> 20:20.840
So I think that this is familiar to all of us.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.840
And we may be actually the closest to the truth

20:22.840 --> 20:25.160
at that moment, to the true natural reality.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.520
So yes, so then there is a point of view

20:27.520 --> 20:30.720
that this is where we are, we are who we are

20:30.720 --> 20:34.280
at our sort of fundamental, at our fundamental level.

20:34.280 --> 20:37.080
And after that, the mind comes in

20:37.080 --> 20:38.840
and tries to conceptualize it.

20:38.840 --> 20:41.080
It's like, oh, because I was writing something,

20:42.760 --> 20:45.880
I was writing a book, I was painting this painting,

20:45.880 --> 20:47.560
or maybe I was watching this painting

20:47.560 --> 20:49.320
and got totally absorbed in it.

20:49.320 --> 20:50.760
Or I fell in love with this person.

20:51.640 --> 20:52.480
That's what happened.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.560
But in the moment when it's happening,

20:53.560 --> 20:55.520
you're not thinking about it.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.000
You're just there.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.560
Yeah, we construct narratives around the set of memories

20:59.560 --> 21:02.040
that seem to have happened in sequence,

21:02.040 --> 21:04.920
or at least that's the way we tell ourselves that.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.800
And we also have a bunch of weird human things

21:07.800 --> 21:11.360
like consciousness and the experience of free will

21:11.360 --> 21:16.360
that we chose a set of actions as the time unrolled forward.

21:16.880 --> 21:17.840
Right.

21:17.840 --> 21:21.480
And we are intelligent, conscious agents

21:21.480 --> 21:25.040
making, taking those actions.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.880
But what if all of that is just-

21:26.880 --> 21:28.400
An illusion. An illusion.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.320
And then a nice narrative we tell ourselves.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.160
Sure.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.000
That's a really difficult thing to internalize.

21:32.000 --> 21:32.840
It's possible.

21:32.840 --> 21:36.040
And imagine that to make it really catch 22.

21:36.040 --> 21:39.360
Imagine that our minds are set up in such a way

21:40.720 --> 21:44.920
that they can't approach the world or experience otherwise.

21:44.920 --> 21:47.240
So in other words, to understand,

21:47.240 --> 21:52.240
to see that from a more kind of all-encompassing point of view,

21:53.080 --> 21:54.720
we have to step out of the mind.

21:55.680 --> 21:59.000
Well, I wonder what's the more honest way to look at things.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.560
But I think we like to be, to play with time.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.600
I think we like to play with these experiences,

22:03.600 --> 22:05.560
with all the drama of it, with all the memories,

22:05.560 --> 22:07.800
with all the tribulations.

22:07.800 --> 22:08.640
I think that's-

22:08.640 --> 22:09.720
We love it. We love it.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.720
Otherwise we wouldn't be doing it.

22:11.720 --> 22:13.920
I think that's, or Earth loves it.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.000
The evolutionary process somehow loves it.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.760
Whatever this thing that's being created here on Earth,

22:19.760 --> 22:23.000
it seems to like to create,

22:23.000 --> 22:24.800
like to allow its children to play

22:24.800 --> 22:28.880
with certain truths that they hold,

22:28.880 --> 22:32.160
the subjective truths that are useful for the competition

22:32.160 --> 22:34.400
or whatever this dance that we call life,

22:34.400 --> 22:36.480
broadly defined, not just humans.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.400
And you know, I'm glad you mentioned that

22:38.400 --> 22:40.720
because what I find fascinating

22:40.720 --> 22:44.400
is that the greatest scientists are on record saying

22:44.400 --> 22:47.320
that when they were making their discoveries,

22:47.320 --> 22:49.000
they felt like children.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.760
So Isaac Newton said to myself,

22:50.760 --> 22:53.520
I only appeared as a child playing on the seashore

22:53.520 --> 22:56.000
and every once in a while finding a prettier pebble

22:56.000 --> 22:59.680
or a prettier shell whilst I think he said something

22:59.680 --> 23:04.680
like the infinite ocean of knowledge was lying before me.

23:04.880 --> 23:09.160
Alexander Grothendieck, who probably was the greatest

23:09.160 --> 23:12.040
mathematician of the second half of the 20th century,

23:12.040 --> 23:14.720
the French mathematician, Alexander Grothendieck

23:15.880 --> 23:19.240
wrote that discovery is a privilege of a child.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.480
The child who is not afraid to be wrong once again,

23:22.480 --> 23:26.800
to look like an idiot, to try this and that,

23:26.800 --> 23:29.560
I'm paraphrasing, and go through trial and error.

23:29.560 --> 23:32.520
That is for them, in other words, for them,

23:33.520 --> 23:38.520
that innocence of a child who is not afraid,

23:39.240 --> 23:43.120
who has not yet been told that it cannot be done, okay?

23:43.120 --> 23:46.400
That was essential to scientific pursuit,

23:46.400 --> 23:48.320
to scientific discovery.

23:48.320 --> 23:53.320
And now also compared to Pablo Picasso, a great artist,

23:54.560 --> 23:57.960
right, so who said every child is an artist.

23:57.960 --> 24:02.240
The question is how to preserve that as we grow up.

24:02.280 --> 24:03.360
Do you struggle with that?

24:03.360 --> 24:07.440
You're one of the most respected mathematicians in the world.

24:08.760 --> 24:12.080
You're Berkeley, you're like, there's a statue,

24:12.080 --> 24:14.640
you're supposed to be very like, you know.

24:14.640 --> 24:19.200
Ivory Tower, sometimes I joke, I say I take an elevator

24:19.200 --> 24:22.040
to the top of the Ivory Tower every day, yeah.

24:22.040 --> 24:24.680
And you're supposed to speak like royalty.

24:24.680 --> 24:29.120
Do you struggle to strip all of that away

24:29.120 --> 24:31.440
to rediscover the child when you're thinking

24:31.440 --> 24:34.000
about problems when you're teaching,

24:34.000 --> 24:35.320
when you're thinking about the world?

24:35.320 --> 24:37.760
Absolutely, I mean, that's part of being human

24:37.760 --> 24:40.840
because when we grow up, I mean, all of them,

24:40.840 --> 24:43.000
all of these great scientists,

24:43.000 --> 24:44.760
I think they were so great in part

24:44.760 --> 24:48.200
because they were able to maintain that connection, okay,

24:48.200 --> 24:50.960
and that fascination, that vulnerability,

24:52.160 --> 24:57.160
that spontaneity, you know, and kind of looking at the world

24:58.040 --> 24:59.720
through the eyes of a child.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.440
But it's difficult because, you know,

25:01.440 --> 25:04.520
you go through education system and for many of us,

25:06.040 --> 25:10.760
it's not especially helpful for maintaining that connection

25:10.760 --> 25:14.040
that we kind of like, we are being told certain things

25:14.040 --> 25:17.080
that we accept, take for granted and so on

25:17.080 --> 25:19.560
and little by little, and also we get hit

25:19.560 --> 25:22.680
every time we act different, okay,

25:22.680 --> 25:26.160
every time we act in a way that doesn't fit

25:26.160 --> 25:28.960
sort of the pattern, we get punished by the teachers,

25:28.960 --> 25:32.560
we get punished by parents and so on.

25:32.560 --> 25:35.240
And don't get respect when you act childlike

25:35.240 --> 25:38.360
in your thinking, when you are fearless

25:38.360 --> 25:40.840
and looking like an idiot.

25:40.840 --> 25:41.680
That's right.

25:41.680 --> 25:42.760
Because there's a hierarchy.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.600
Nobody wants to look like an idiot, you know,

25:44.600 --> 25:47.720
once you start growing up or you think you're growing up.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.440
In the beginning, you don't even think of,

25:49.440 --> 25:52.640
you don't think in these terms.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.960
You just play, you're just playing

25:54.960 --> 25:57.240
and you are open to possibilities,

25:57.240 --> 25:58.600
to these infinite possibilities

25:58.600 --> 26:00.560
that this world presents to us.

26:00.560 --> 26:05.480
So how do we, I'm not saying that education system

26:05.480 --> 26:10.000
should not be also kind of taming that a little bit.

26:11.320 --> 26:15.120
Obviously, the goal is balance,

26:15.120 --> 26:20.120
that acquiring knowledge so that we can be more mature

26:21.720 --> 26:25.080
and more discerning, more discriminating

26:25.080 --> 26:26.880
in terms of our approach to the world,

26:26.880 --> 26:28.760
in terms of our connections to the world

26:28.760 --> 26:30.400
and people and so on.

26:30.400 --> 26:34.000
But how do we do that while also preserving

26:34.000 --> 26:36.720
that innocence of a child?

26:36.720 --> 26:40.600
And my guess is that there is no formula for this.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.720
It is, a life is an answer.

26:43.720 --> 26:47.640
Every life, every human being is one particular answer

26:47.640 --> 26:49.800
to how do we find balance?

26:50.640 --> 26:55.120
That's one imperfect approximation,

26:55.120 --> 26:58.040
approximate solution to the problem.

26:58.040 --> 27:02.120
But we can look up to the great ones

27:02.120 --> 27:06.640
who have credentials in the sense that they have shown

27:06.640 --> 27:09.240
and they have proved that they have done something

27:09.240 --> 27:11.160
that other humans appreciate,

27:11.160 --> 27:14.520
our civilization appreciates, say Isaac Newton

27:14.520 --> 27:17.240
or Alexander Grotendieck or Pablo Picasso.

27:17.240 --> 27:19.760
So they have established their right

27:19.760 --> 27:21.600
to speak about these matters

27:21.600 --> 27:25.720
and we cannot dismiss them as mere mad men.

27:25.720 --> 27:28.240
They say, okay, well, if the same thing was said

27:28.240 --> 27:31.200
by somebody who never achieved anything

27:31.200 --> 27:34.200
in their field of endeavor,

27:35.560 --> 27:37.560
it would be easy for us to dismiss it.

27:37.560 --> 27:41.280
But when it comes from someone like Isaac Newton,

27:42.280 --> 27:43.840
we take notice.

27:43.840 --> 27:46.680
So I think that's something important that they teach us

27:46.720 --> 27:49.880
and especially today in this age of AI,

27:50.800 --> 27:53.440
of course, there's a big elephant in the room always,

27:53.440 --> 27:55.320
which is called AI, right?

27:55.320 --> 27:58.520
And so I know that you are an expert in the subject

27:58.520 --> 28:02.000
and we are living now in this very interesting times

28:02.000 --> 28:04.920
of new AI systems coming online

28:04.920 --> 28:07.440
pretty much every couple of weeks.

28:07.440 --> 28:12.440
So I kind of, to me, that whole debate about

28:14.120 --> 28:15.960
what is it, what is artificial intelligence?

28:15.960 --> 28:16.800
Where is it going?

28:16.800 --> 28:18.000
What should we do about it?

28:19.160 --> 28:23.520
Needs an influx of this type of considerations

28:23.520 --> 28:25.600
that we've just been talking about.

28:25.600 --> 28:30.600
That, for instance, the idea that inspiration, creativity

28:31.160 --> 28:33.240
doesn't come from accumulation of knowledge

28:33.240 --> 28:37.640
because obviously a child has not yet accumulated knowledge.

28:37.640 --> 28:40.960
And yet the great ones are on record saying

28:41.240 --> 28:46.040
a child has a capacity to create.

28:46.040 --> 28:50.240
And an adult credits the inner child

28:51.880 --> 28:56.200
for this capacity to create as an adult, you see.

28:56.200 --> 28:59.000
That's kind of weird if we take the point of view

28:59.000 --> 29:01.640
that everything is computation,

29:01.640 --> 29:03.320
everything is accumulation of knowledge

29:03.320 --> 29:06.040
that just bigger and bigger data sets,

29:06.040 --> 29:08.320
finer and finer neural networks,

29:08.320 --> 29:11.480
and then we will be able to replicate human consciousness.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.080
If we take that point of view,

29:13.080 --> 29:15.840
then what I just said kind of doesn't fit

29:15.840 --> 29:17.800
because obviously a child has not been fed

29:17.800 --> 29:20.520
any training data as far as we know.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.480
Yeah, they're perfectly capable of, you know,

29:23.480 --> 29:25.680
of distinguishing between cats and dogs, for instance,

29:25.680 --> 29:26.640
and stuff like that.

29:26.640 --> 29:27.560
But much more than that,

29:27.560 --> 29:31.840
they're also capable of that, you know,

29:31.840 --> 29:35.000
wide-eyed sort of perspective.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.920
So can it really be captured?

29:37.920 --> 29:41.200
That perspective, that sense of awe,

29:41.200 --> 29:45.080
can it really be captured by competition alone?

29:45.080 --> 29:46.520
I actually, I don't know the answer.

29:46.520 --> 29:51.000
So I'm not sort of trying to present

29:51.000 --> 29:52.120
a particular point of view.

29:52.120 --> 29:56.040
I'm just trying to question any theory

29:56.040 --> 30:00.640
that starts out by saying life is this

30:00.640 --> 30:02.520
or consciousness is this.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.800
Because when you look more closely,

30:05.800 --> 30:09.640
you recognize that there are some other things at play

30:09.640 --> 30:12.480
which do not quite fit the narrative.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.280
And it's hard to know where they come from.

30:14.280 --> 30:17.760
It's also possible that the evolutionary process

30:17.760 --> 30:22.520
that's created is the very, it is computation,

30:22.520 --> 30:25.560
and the child is actually not a blank slate,

30:25.560 --> 30:29.040
but the result of one of the most incredible

30:30.040 --> 30:33.320
several billion year old computations

30:34.760 --> 30:39.760
that had explored all kinds of aspects of life on Earth,

30:43.040 --> 30:48.040
of war and love and terror and ambition and violence

30:49.920 --> 30:54.520
and invention, all of that, from the bacteria to today.

30:54.520 --> 30:58.280
So like that young child is not a blank slate.

30:58.280 --> 31:01.960
They're coming, they're actually hold within them

31:01.960 --> 31:06.160
the knowledge of several billions of years.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.680
Right, the question is whether as a child

31:08.680 --> 31:11.320
you carry that in the form of the kind

31:11.320 --> 31:14.200
of computational algorithms that we are aware today.

31:14.200 --> 31:19.000
You see, what strikes me as unlikely is that,

31:19.960 --> 31:21.440
how should I put it?

31:21.440 --> 31:25.800
How interesting that you are a computer scientist

31:25.800 --> 31:27.000
and there are other people coming.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.160
I have studied computer science, so I know a little bit.

31:30.160 --> 31:33.080
And so it's tempting to say,

31:33.080 --> 31:37.000
oh, the whole world is computer science

31:37.000 --> 31:39.400
or is based, can be explained by computer science.

31:39.400 --> 31:40.240
Why?

31:40.240 --> 31:41.480
Because it makes me feel good.

31:41.480 --> 31:43.600
Because I have mastered it, I have learned it.

31:43.600 --> 31:47.080
My ego is very happy and people come to me

31:47.080 --> 31:50.080
and they look up to me and they revere me.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.240
Kind of like priests in old days

31:52.240 --> 31:54.000
when the religion was paramount,

31:54.040 --> 31:56.520
when you would tend to explain things

31:56.520 --> 31:58.960
in theological religious terms.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.520
Today, science has progressed.

32:00.520 --> 32:05.040
There are fewer people who kind of buy into official religion.

32:05.040 --> 32:10.040
So we have this urge, I suppose, to explain and to know

32:11.240 --> 32:14.280
and to dissect and to analyze and to conceptualize,

32:14.280 --> 32:16.800
which is a wonderful quality that we have.

32:16.800 --> 32:20.000
And we should definitely pursue that.

32:20.040 --> 32:23.720
But I find it a little bit unlikely

32:24.720 --> 32:28.440
that the universe is just exactly what I have learned

32:28.440 --> 32:30.920
and not something that I don't know, you see.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.280
Well, there's a lot of interesting aspects

32:34.280 --> 32:36.960
of the current large language models

32:36.960 --> 32:40.080
that one perspective of it, I think,

32:40.080 --> 32:43.320
speaks to the love in math that you talk to,

32:43.320 --> 32:48.320
which is they're trained on human data

32:49.160 --> 32:50.400
from the internet.

32:51.320 --> 32:55.240
So at its best, a large language model, like GPT-4,

32:56.320 --> 33:00.320
captures the magic of the human condition

33:00.320 --> 33:03.800
on its full display, its full complexity.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.600
And since it's mimicking, it's trying to compress

33:06.600 --> 33:08.960
all the weirdness of humans,

33:08.960 --> 33:13.120
of all the debates and discussions, the perspectives,

33:13.120 --> 33:15.360
all the different ways that people approach

33:15.360 --> 33:17.760
solving different problems, all of that compressed.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.320
So we live, we're each individual ants.

33:20.320 --> 33:22.200
We only have like, we have a family,

33:22.200 --> 33:24.320
we interact with a few little ants.

33:24.320 --> 33:28.000
And here comes AI that's able to summarize,

33:28.000 --> 33:31.800
like a TLDR, report of humanity.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.800
And that's the beauty of it, so I embrace it.

33:34.800 --> 33:35.640
But I wonder if-

33:35.640 --> 33:37.040
I'm very impressed by it.

33:37.040 --> 33:41.640
I wonder if it can be very impressive,

33:41.640 --> 33:46.640
meaning way more impressive in being able to fake

33:46.840 --> 33:49.520
or simulate or emulate a human.

33:49.520 --> 33:50.360
Fake.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.600
I'm glad you mentioned that,

33:51.600 --> 33:53.880
because that just seems to be the mantra.

33:53.880 --> 33:54.720
It's just word.

33:54.720 --> 33:56.080
Fake it till you make it.

33:56.080 --> 33:56.920
Yeah.

33:56.920 --> 33:57.760
Isn't it?

33:57.760 --> 33:58.840
Isn't that what we all do though?

33:58.840 --> 34:02.680
No, well, yes, we do that, but we also do other things.

34:02.680 --> 34:04.200
We can be truly in love.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.480
We can be truly inspired when it is not fake.

34:06.480 --> 34:07.360
I do believe.

34:07.360 --> 34:08.760
Call me romantic, okay?

34:08.760 --> 34:10.320
But I do believe.

34:10.320 --> 34:11.160
And this is a very good,

34:11.160 --> 34:12.720
I'm glad you're putting it in these terms,

34:12.720 --> 34:14.960
because I've had conversations like that.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.760
That, yeah, fake it till you make it,

34:16.760 --> 34:18.760
but that's like, that's what humans do.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.840
Yes, we do that, but not all the time.

34:20.840 --> 34:23.000
So, and that is debatable,

34:23.000 --> 34:25.480
because also I speak from my own experience.

34:25.480 --> 34:28.240
And that's where the first person perspective comes in,

34:28.240 --> 34:30.080
the subjective view.

34:30.080 --> 34:33.480
I cannot prove to you, for instance, or anyone else,

34:33.480 --> 34:36.000
that there are certain moments in my life

34:36.000 --> 34:37.320
where I am genuine.

34:37.320 --> 34:42.200
I am pure, so to speak, when it's not faking it.

34:42.200 --> 34:46.920
But I do have a tremendous certainty of it.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.960
And that's a subjective certainty.

34:48.960 --> 34:51.120
Now, I am, as a scientist,

34:51.120 --> 34:54.640
I'm also trained to give more credibility

34:54.640 --> 34:56.400
to objective arguments that,

34:56.400 --> 34:58.280
and other things that can be reproduced,

34:58.280 --> 35:01.440
things that I can demonstrate, that I can show.

35:01.440 --> 35:02.480
But as I get older,

35:02.480 --> 35:04.720
show me some. There we go.

35:04.720 --> 35:08.280
As I get more mature, show me, hopefully, you know?

35:08.280 --> 35:11.400
I'm starting to question why I am not giving

35:11.400 --> 35:14.480
as much credibility

35:14.480 --> 35:16.760
to my subjective understanding of the world,

35:16.760 --> 35:18.520
the kind of the first person perspective,

35:18.520 --> 35:23.280
when actually modern science has already sold on that.

35:23.280 --> 35:27.520
You know, quantum mechanics has shown unambiguously

35:27.520 --> 35:32.240
that the observer is always involved in the observation.

35:32.240 --> 35:35.480
Likewise, Gödel's incompleteness theorems, to me,

35:36.440 --> 35:44.480
show how essential is the observer of a mathematical theory.

35:44.480 --> 35:48.040
For one thing, that's the one who chooses the axioms.

35:48.040 --> 35:49.800
And we can talk about this in more detail.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.320
Likewise, Einstein's relativity,

35:51.320 --> 35:54.800
where time is relative to the observer, for instance.

35:54.800 --> 35:55.520
That's brilliant.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.120
You're just describing in all of these different scales

35:58.120 --> 35:59.720
the observer, what the observer means.

35:59.760 --> 36:03.880
So science of the 19th century had the,

36:03.880 --> 36:05.520
from modern perspective,

36:05.520 --> 36:08.160
and I don't want to offend anybody, had the delusion

36:08.160 --> 36:10.280
that somehow you could analyze the world

36:10.280 --> 36:12.200
being completely detached from it.

36:12.200 --> 36:15.200
We now know, after the landmark achievements

36:15.200 --> 36:18.680
of the first half of the 20th century, that this is nonsense.

36:18.680 --> 36:20.120
That is simply not true.

36:20.120 --> 36:23.760
And this has been experimentally proved time and time again.

36:23.760 --> 36:27.600
So to me, I'm thinking maybe it's a hint

36:27.600 --> 36:31.040
that I should take my first-person perspective seriously

36:31.040 --> 36:35.960
as well, and not just rely on objective phenomena,

36:35.960 --> 36:40.960
things that can be proved in a traditional objective way

36:42.360 --> 36:45.320
by setting up an experiment that can be repeated many times.

36:45.320 --> 36:49.120
Maybe I fall in love, the deepest love of my life,

36:49.120 --> 36:51.440
perhaps hasn't happened yet.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.360
Perhaps I will fall in love, but it's unique.

36:53.360 --> 36:54.320
It's a unique event.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.760
You can't reproduce it necessarily, you see.

36:57.760 --> 36:59.120
So in that sense,

36:59.120 --> 37:01.640
you see how these things are closely connected.

37:01.640 --> 37:05.680
I think that if we are declaring from the outset

37:05.680 --> 37:10.280
that all there is to life is computation

37:10.280 --> 37:13.200
in the form of neural networks or something like this,

37:13.200 --> 37:15.320
however sophisticated they might be,

37:16.240 --> 37:19.400
I think we are from the outset denying to ourselves

37:19.400 --> 37:22.680
the possibility that yes, there is a side of me

37:22.680 --> 37:24.120
which is not faking it.

37:24.120 --> 37:25.720
Yes, there is a side of me

37:25.720 --> 37:28.600
which cannot be captured by logic and reason.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.720
And you know what another great scientist said,

37:30.720 --> 37:31.720
blessed Pascal?

37:32.920 --> 37:36.280
He said, the heart has its reasons

37:36.280 --> 37:38.640
of which the reason knows nothing.

37:39.520 --> 37:42.480
And then he also said, the last step of reason

37:42.480 --> 37:45.680
is to grasp that there are infinitely many things

37:45.680 --> 37:46.520
beyond reason.

37:47.560 --> 37:49.840
How interesting, this was not a theologian,

37:49.840 --> 37:53.400
this was not a priest, this was not a spiritual guru.

37:55.120 --> 37:58.960
It was a hardcore scientist who actually developed,

37:58.960 --> 38:01.080
I think one of the very first calculators.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.520
How interesting that this guy also was able to

38:06.360 --> 38:08.560
impart on us that wisdom.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.880
Now, you can always say that's not the case,

38:12.800 --> 38:17.800
but why should we from the outset exclude this possibility

38:19.240 --> 38:22.240
that there is something to what he was saying?

38:22.240 --> 38:23.400
That is my question.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.440
I'm not taking sides.

38:27.600 --> 38:30.120
What I'm trying to do is to shake a little bit the debate

38:30.120 --> 38:33.120
because most mathematicians that I know

38:33.120 --> 38:35.040
and computer scientists even more so,

38:35.040 --> 38:36.840
they're kind of already sold on this.

38:38.680 --> 38:42.600
We are just, reminds me of this famous Lord Kelvin's quote

38:42.600 --> 38:44.400
from the end of 19th century.

38:45.680 --> 38:47.440
There's some debate whether he actually said that,

38:47.440 --> 38:52.440
but never let a good story stand in the way of truth.

38:53.560 --> 38:57.440
He said, physics is basically finished,

38:57.440 --> 39:00.720
all that remains is more precise measurement.

39:00.720 --> 39:04.520
So I find a lot of my colleagues are happy to say,

39:04.520 --> 39:07.920
man, everything's finished, we already got it, we got it.

39:07.920 --> 39:12.920
Maybe a little tweaks in our large language models, you know?

39:13.200 --> 39:14.800
So now here's my question.

39:15.840 --> 39:17.840
I'm kind of playing devil's advocate a little bit

39:17.840 --> 39:19.720
because I don't see the other side

39:19.720 --> 39:22.680
so quote unquote represented that much.

39:22.680 --> 39:25.080
And I'm saying, okay, could it be also that

39:25.080 --> 39:28.040
if you believe in that, that that becomes your reality?

39:28.920 --> 39:31.000
That you can kind of put yourself in a box

39:32.160 --> 39:34.520
where everything is computation

39:34.520 --> 39:37.360
and then you start seeing things as being such.

39:37.360 --> 39:40.440
It's confirmation bias, if you will, you know?

39:40.440 --> 39:42.520
This also reminds me, I think a good analogy

39:42.520 --> 39:45.200
is this a friend of mine, Philip Caution told me

39:45.200 --> 39:47.680
that in France, there is this literary movement

39:47.680 --> 39:48.920
which is called Oulipo.

39:49.800 --> 39:54.160
O-U-L-I-P-O.

39:54.160 --> 39:58.000
And it's a bunch of writers and mathematicians

39:58.000 --> 40:00.600
who create works of literature

40:02.000 --> 40:05.320
in which they basically impose certain constraints.

40:05.320 --> 40:08.320
A good example of this is a novel

40:08.320 --> 40:10.280
which is called The Void or Disappearance

40:10.280 --> 40:13.560
by a writer named Georges Perec,

40:13.560 --> 40:16.280
which is a 300 page novel in French

40:17.280 --> 40:22.080
which never uses the letter E,

40:22.080 --> 40:26.920
which is the most widely used letter of the French language.

40:26.920 --> 40:30.840
So in other words, he set these parameters for himself.

40:30.840 --> 40:34.080
I'm going to write a book where I don't use this letter,

40:34.080 --> 40:38.360
which is a great experiment and I applaud it.

40:38.360 --> 40:40.720
But it's one thing to do that

40:40.720 --> 40:45.360
and to kind of show his gamesmanship, if you will,

40:45.560 --> 40:48.840
and his proclivity and his ability as a writer.

40:48.840 --> 40:49.680
But it's another thing,

40:49.680 --> 40:52.240
if at the end of writing this book,

40:52.240 --> 40:53.080
when he finished the book,

40:53.080 --> 40:55.200
he would say letter E actually doesn't exist.

40:56.840 --> 40:59.640
And he tried to convince us that in fact,

40:59.640 --> 41:01.640
French language does not have that letter

41:01.640 --> 41:05.720
simply because he was able to go so far without using it.

41:05.720 --> 41:09.160
So self-imposed limitation, that's how I see it.

41:09.160 --> 41:13.040
And I wonder why we should do that.

41:13.080 --> 41:15.640
Do we really need, do we really feel the urge

41:15.640 --> 41:17.880
to say the world is like that?

41:17.880 --> 41:20.360
The world can be explained this way or that way.

41:20.360 --> 41:22.760
And I'm saying it, it's a personal question for me

41:22.760 --> 41:26.160
because I am addicted to knowledge myself.

41:27.560 --> 41:28.720
Hi, my name is Edward.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.080
And I'm a knowledge addict.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.240
I'm being serious, I'm not being facetious.

41:34.240 --> 41:37.880
Up until very recently, maybe a couple of years ago,

41:37.880 --> 41:40.080
I simply did not feel comfortable

41:40.080 --> 41:44.200
if I could not say the given answer, explanation.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.720
It's like, oh, there has to be some explanation.

41:45.720 --> 41:48.200
And I tried to frantically search for it.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.480
Just for somebody like me,

41:51.520 --> 41:54.400
a nerd, a left brainiac,

41:54.400 --> 41:59.400
and that's kind of typical for a scientist,

42:00.040 --> 42:02.760
for a mathematician, it is incredibly hard

42:05.280 --> 42:08.680
just to allow the possibility that it's a mystery

42:09.560 --> 42:13.960
and not to feel the urge to get the answer.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.160
It is incredibly hard, but it's possible.

42:16.160 --> 42:17.680
And it is liberating.

42:17.680 --> 42:22.560
It's a recovering addict to knowledge.

42:22.560 --> 42:25.920
Let me say what you gain from it.

42:25.920 --> 42:29.160
For instance, I understand the value of paradoxes.

42:29.160 --> 42:31.800
I appreciate paradoxes more.

42:31.800 --> 42:35.680
And to use another philosopher,

42:35.720 --> 42:38.480
Soren Kierkegaard, the Danish philosopher said,

42:39.480 --> 42:43.800
I think without paradox is like a lover without passion.

42:45.960 --> 42:47.200
A paltry mediocrity.

42:47.200 --> 42:48.400
Ooh, that's a good line.

42:48.400 --> 42:49.520
Right?

42:49.520 --> 42:52.520
So, and you know, Niels Bohr,

42:52.520 --> 42:55.800
Niels Bohr said, in similar vein,

42:55.800 --> 43:00.040
the great Danish also, something about the Danes.

43:00.040 --> 43:01.800
I think it all started with Hamlet.

43:01.800 --> 43:02.640
You know?

43:03.640 --> 43:08.640
He said, the opposite of a simple truth is a falsity,

43:09.440 --> 43:13.680
but the opposite of a great truth is another great truth.

43:13.680 --> 43:17.600
In other words, things are not black and white, you know?

43:17.600 --> 43:20.680
They're not, and I would even venture to say

43:20.680 --> 43:25.680
the most interesting things in life are like that.

43:26.480 --> 43:28.880
The ones which are ambiguous.

43:28.880 --> 43:31.520
Is an electron a particle or a wave?

43:31.520 --> 43:33.200
It depends how you set up an experiment.

43:33.200 --> 43:36.160
It will reveal itself as this or that,

43:36.160 --> 43:38.400
depending on how you set up an experiment.

43:39.880 --> 43:43.960
This bottle, if you project it down onto the table,

43:43.960 --> 43:46.040
you will see more or less a square.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.600
If you project it onto a wall,

43:47.600 --> 43:49.200
you will see a different shape.

43:49.200 --> 43:52.240
A naive question would be, is it this or that?

43:53.480 --> 43:56.320
We understand that it's neither,

43:56.320 --> 43:58.680
but both projections reveal something.

43:58.680 --> 44:00.800
They reveal different sides of it.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.560
A paradox is like that.

44:02.560 --> 44:07.040
It's only paradoxical if we are confined

44:07.040 --> 44:10.640
in a particular vision,

44:10.640 --> 44:14.640
if we are wedded to a particular point of view.

44:14.640 --> 44:16.080
It's a harbinger, if you will,

44:16.080 --> 44:20.200
of a possibility of seeing things in a more,

44:22.200 --> 44:25.760
as they are, more sophisticated than we thought before.

44:25.760 --> 44:26.600
You see?

44:26.600 --> 44:31.360
This is such a difficult idea for science to grapple with

44:31.360 --> 44:33.640
that, I don't know how,

44:33.640 --> 44:34.960
there's so many ways to describe this,

44:34.960 --> 44:37.480
but you could say maybe that

44:37.480 --> 44:40.080
the subjective experience of the world

44:40.080 --> 44:43.880
from an observer is actually fundamental.

44:43.880 --> 44:45.480
But we know that.

44:45.480 --> 44:49.360
Our best physical theorists tell us that unambiguously.

44:49.360 --> 44:52.440
In quantum mechanics, actually, Heisenberg,

44:52.440 --> 44:54.600
I think, captured it the best when he said,

44:54.600 --> 44:57.640
what we observe is not reality itself,

44:57.640 --> 45:01.640
but reality subjected to our method of questioning.

45:03.960 --> 45:06.320
When I talk about electrons, for instance,

45:06.320 --> 45:07.840
so that there is a very specific way

45:07.840 --> 45:09.760
in which this is realized,

45:09.760 --> 45:11.800
there is a so-called double slit experiment, right?

45:11.800 --> 45:14.560
So for those who don't know,

45:14.560 --> 45:18.920
you have a screen and you have an emitter

45:18.920 --> 45:21.800
from which you kind of shoot electrons,

45:21.800 --> 45:23.440
and in between you put another screen

45:23.440 --> 45:26.680
which has two vertical slits parallel to each other.

45:26.680 --> 45:29.840
If we were shooting tennis balls,

45:29.840 --> 45:32.120
each ball would go through one slit or another,

45:32.120 --> 45:35.640
and then hit the screen behind this or that slit,

45:35.640 --> 45:37.880
so you would have, let's say they're colored,

45:37.880 --> 45:39.160
they're painted.

45:39.160 --> 45:43.120
So there'll be sort of bumps or spots of paint

45:43.120 --> 45:44.920
behind this or that.

45:44.920 --> 45:48.920
But that's not what happens when we shoot electrons.

45:48.920 --> 45:50.440
We see an interference pattern,

45:50.440 --> 45:52.640
as if we were actually sending a wave,

45:52.640 --> 45:54.560
so that each electron,

45:54.560 --> 45:57.120
it seems like each electron goes through both slits at once

45:57.120 --> 46:01.000
and then has the audacity to interfere with itself,

46:01.000 --> 46:04.080
where at some points two crests would amplify,

46:04.080 --> 46:05.440
and at some points a crest and a trough

46:05.440 --> 46:07.520
would cancel each other.

46:07.520 --> 46:10.960
Yet, so that suggests, okay, so the electron is a wave?

46:10.960 --> 46:13.440
Not so fast, because if you put a detector

46:13.440 --> 46:14.840
behind one of the slits and you say,

46:14.840 --> 46:18.480
I'm going to capture you,

46:18.480 --> 46:21.560
I'm going to find out which slit you went through,

46:21.560 --> 46:22.760
the pattern will change,

46:22.760 --> 46:25.000
and it will look like there are particles.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.040
So that's a very concrete realization of the idea

46:28.040 --> 46:30.560
that depending on how we set up an experiment,

46:30.560 --> 46:32.040
we will see different results.

46:33.040 --> 46:37.920
And the problem is that our psyche, I feel,

46:37.920 --> 46:39.400
kind of lagging behind,

46:39.400 --> 46:41.280
in part because maybe our scientists

46:41.280 --> 46:43.400
are not doing such a great job,

46:43.400 --> 46:45.600
so I take responsibility for this,

46:45.600 --> 46:48.760
why haven't I explained this properly, you know?

46:48.760 --> 46:51.200
I tried in a bunch of talks and so on,

46:51.200 --> 46:53.560
so now I'm talking about this again.

46:53.560 --> 46:54.920
Our psyche kind of is lagging behind,

46:54.920 --> 46:57.600
we're still, even though our science has progressed so much

46:57.600 --> 47:00.760
from the certainty and the determinism

47:00.760 --> 47:04.440
and all of that of the 19th century,

47:04.440 --> 47:07.960
our psyche is somehow still attached to those ideas,

47:07.960 --> 47:10.160
the ideas of causality or this naive determinism

47:10.160 --> 47:14.800
that the world is a bunch of billiard balls hitting each other

47:14.800 --> 47:17.480
driven by some blind forces, you know?

47:17.480 --> 47:18.600
That's not at all like it is,

47:18.600 --> 47:20.720
and we've known this for over,

47:20.720 --> 47:23.880
well, for about a hundred years at least, you know?

47:23.880 --> 47:26.680
And you call this self-imposed limitation.

47:26.680 --> 47:30.040
It is a self-imposed limitation when we pretend that,

47:32.160 --> 47:36.640
for instance, that this naive ideas of 19th century physics

47:36.640 --> 47:40.680
are still valid and then start applying them to our lives

47:40.680 --> 47:42.600
and then also derive conclusions from it,

47:42.600 --> 47:46.760
and for instance, people say, there is no free will, why?

47:46.760 --> 47:49.920
Oh, because the world is just a bunch of billiard balls,

47:49.920 --> 47:50.760
so where is the free will?

47:50.760 --> 47:53.040
But excuse me, didn't you get the memo

47:53.040 --> 47:55.160
that this has been debunked thoroughly

47:55.160 --> 47:56.840
by the so-called quantum mechanics,

47:56.840 --> 47:58.800
which is our best scientific theory?

47:58.800 --> 48:01.160
This is not some kind of bullshit

48:01.160 --> 48:06.160
or some kind of concoction of a mad man.

48:06.880 --> 48:08.000
This is our scientific theory

48:08.000 --> 48:09.600
which has been confirmed by experiment,

48:09.600 --> 48:11.600
so we should pay attention to that.

48:11.600 --> 48:14.720
But of course, it's not just self-imposed limitation.

48:14.720 --> 48:16.040
Unfortunately, in this case,

48:16.040 --> 48:18.520
there is a big issue of education.

48:18.520 --> 48:20.600
So a lot of people are not aware of it

48:20.600 --> 48:22.040
through no fault of their own

48:22.040 --> 48:24.520
because they were never properly taught that

48:24.520 --> 48:27.280
because our system is broken, education system is broken,

48:27.280 --> 48:28.920
especially in math.

48:28.920 --> 48:31.680
And then our, so where do we get information?

48:31.680 --> 48:34.440
You get information from our scientists

48:34.440 --> 48:37.320
who actually write popular books and so on,

48:37.320 --> 48:42.040
which is a great thing that they do.

48:42.040 --> 48:43.880
But a lot of scientists somehow,

48:44.640 --> 48:49.240
when it comes to explaining the laws of physics,

48:49.240 --> 48:54.240
they're doing a fantastic job talking about this phenomenon,

48:54.920 --> 48:57.520
for instance, double slit experiment and things like that.

48:57.520 --> 49:00.600
But then, interviewed by a science magazine

49:00.600 --> 49:01.720
about free will and so on,

49:01.720 --> 49:05.160
they revert back to 19th century physics

49:05.160 --> 49:07.360
as if those developments actually never happened.

49:07.360 --> 49:12.360
So to me, this is single most important sort of issue

49:13.360 --> 49:17.400
in our popular science.

49:17.400 --> 49:21.120
The idea that somehow there is this world out there,

49:21.120 --> 49:24.000
but it's complete, has nothing to do with me.

49:24.000 --> 49:28.440
So I can revel in the intricacies

49:28.440 --> 49:31.040
of these particles and their interactions,

49:32.120 --> 49:37.000
but completely ignore what implications this has

49:37.000 --> 49:40.800
for my own relationship to physical reality,

49:40.800 --> 49:44.400
to my own life, because it's kind of scary, I guess.

49:44.400 --> 49:47.080
But also, what are the tools

49:47.080 --> 49:51.800
with which we can talk about the observer,

49:53.080 --> 49:55.720
the subjective view on reality?

49:55.720 --> 49:58.760
What are the tools with which we could talk about,

49:58.760 --> 50:01.880
rigorously talk about free will and consciousness?

50:01.880 --> 50:04.240
What are the tools in mathematics that allow that?

50:04.240 --> 50:05.680
I don't think we have those tools.

50:05.680 --> 50:07.840
Because we haven't been taught properly,

50:07.840 --> 50:10.040
so actually tools are there.

50:10.040 --> 50:15.040
For instance, I think, well, here we have to,

50:16.880 --> 50:20.320
I have to say, my conviction is that everybody knows.

50:21.480 --> 50:22.520
In the heart of hearts,

50:22.520 --> 50:25.720
everybody knows that there is that.

50:25.720 --> 50:28.600
There is something ineffable.

50:28.600 --> 50:32.400
There is something mysterious.

50:32.400 --> 50:36.240
And in fact, somehow immediately I feel that,

50:38.000 --> 50:39.680
the impulse to quote somebody on this,

50:40.360 --> 50:41.960
as if my own opinion doesn't count.

50:41.960 --> 50:45.640
Yeah, there's a long, dead expert that has said that.

50:45.640 --> 50:49.920
Even Einstein said that, so like, see, look at me.

50:49.920 --> 50:53.840
I am supposedly this smart, intelligent person.

50:53.840 --> 50:56.240
I am afraid to say it and own it myself.

50:56.240 --> 50:58.600
I have to find confirmation.

50:58.600 --> 51:01.760
I have to find an authority who agrees with me.

51:01.760 --> 51:03.280
And in fact, it's not so difficult to find,

51:03.280 --> 51:05.160
because Albert Einstein literally said

51:05.160 --> 51:08.120
the most important thing in life is the mysterious.

51:08.120 --> 51:09.800
He actually said that.

51:09.800 --> 51:12.280
There are some quotes which are attributed to him,

51:12.280 --> 51:14.440
which he never said, but this he did.

51:14.440 --> 51:15.600
I investigated, okay?

51:15.600 --> 51:19.600
So, but more importantly, you know,

51:19.600 --> 51:21.240
how do you feel about it?

51:22.560 --> 51:25.120
I think that everybody knows,

51:25.120 --> 51:30.120
but in other words, he also said Einstein,

51:30.440 --> 51:33.600
imagination is more important than knowledge, okay?

51:33.600 --> 51:36.160
And he explained, for knowledge is always limited.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.200
Whereas imagination embraces the entire world,

51:40.200 --> 51:41.800
giving birth to evolution.

51:41.800 --> 51:43.720
It is, strictly speaking,

51:43.720 --> 51:46.080
a real factor in scientific research, he says.

51:46.080 --> 51:47.920
And he says, I am enough of an artist

51:47.920 --> 51:50.440
to follow my intuition and imagination.

51:50.440 --> 51:52.200
That's Albert Einstein, again.

51:52.200 --> 51:54.840
So, and I feel the same way, to be honest.

51:54.840 --> 51:58.160
If I think about my own mathematical research,

51:58.160 --> 52:00.080
it's never linear.

52:00.080 --> 52:02.320
It's never like, give me more data, give me more data,

52:02.320 --> 52:05.000
give me more data, boom, the glass is full.

52:05.040 --> 52:06.480
And then I come up with discovery.

52:06.480 --> 52:11.120
No, it's always felt as a jump, as a leap.

52:12.280 --> 52:17.000
And I have actually been studying various examples

52:17.000 --> 52:20.080
in history of mathematics, of some fundamental discoveries,

52:20.080 --> 52:21.400
like discovery of complex numbers,

52:21.400 --> 52:22.960
like square root of negative one.

52:24.080 --> 52:27.200
I wonder if a large language model

52:27.200 --> 52:29.080
could actually ever come up with the idea

52:29.080 --> 52:31.280
that square root of negative one

52:32.280 --> 52:36.600
is something that is essential or meaningful.

52:36.600 --> 52:40.200
Because if all the information that you get,

52:40.200 --> 52:44.200
all the knowledge that had been accumulated up to that point

52:44.200 --> 52:47.360
tells you that you cannot have a square root

52:47.360 --> 52:48.560
of a negative number, why?

52:48.560 --> 52:51.800
Because if you had such a square root,

52:51.800 --> 52:56.240
we know that if you square it, you get a negative number.

52:56.240 --> 52:59.040
But we know that if you square any real number,

52:59.040 --> 53:02.520
positive or negative, you will always get a positive number.

53:02.520 --> 53:05.920
So checkmate, you know, it's over.

53:05.920 --> 53:07.720
Square root of negative one doesn't exist.

53:07.720 --> 53:10.920
Yet we know that these numbers make sense.

53:10.920 --> 53:12.280
They're called complex numbers.

53:12.280 --> 53:15.920
And in fact, quantum mechanics is based on complex numbers.

53:15.920 --> 53:20.120
They are essential and indispensable for quantum mechanics.

53:20.120 --> 53:22.280
Could one discover that?

53:22.280 --> 53:26.320
So to me, that sounds like a discontinuity

53:26.320 --> 53:27.840
in the process of discovery.

53:27.840 --> 53:29.880
It's a jump, it's a departure.

53:29.880 --> 53:32.160
It is like a child who is experimenting.

53:32.160 --> 53:34.560
It's like a child who says, I'm not afraid to be an idiot.

53:34.560 --> 53:37.760
Everybody says, the adults are saying

53:37.760 --> 53:40.360
square root of negative number doesn't exist.

53:40.360 --> 53:41.520
But guess what?

53:41.520 --> 53:44.920
I'm going to accept it and I'm going to play with it.

53:44.920 --> 53:46.680
And I'm going to see what happens.

53:46.680 --> 53:48.600
This is literally how they were discovered.

53:48.600 --> 53:53.600
There was an Italian mathematician, astronomer, astrologer.

53:54.400 --> 53:58.640
He made money apparently by compiling astrological

53:58.640 --> 54:03.200
sort of readings for the elite of his era.

54:03.200 --> 54:06.000
This is 16th century, as one does, a gambler.

54:07.360 --> 54:08.520
All around interesting guy.

54:08.520 --> 54:10.680
I'm sure we would have an interesting conversation with him.

54:10.680 --> 54:15.040
Gerolamo Cardano, he also invented what's called

54:15.040 --> 54:19.600
Cardan shaft, which is an essential component of a car.

54:21.160 --> 54:23.040
Cardano Vival, we say in Russian.

54:23.600 --> 54:28.600
So he wrote a book, which is called Ars Magna,

54:28.960 --> 54:31.280
which is like the great art of algebra.

54:31.280 --> 54:32.560
And he was writing solutions

54:32.560 --> 54:36.000
for the cubic and quartic equations.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.640
This is something that is familiar because it's cool.

54:39.640 --> 54:42.200
We study solutions of quadratic equations,

54:42.200 --> 54:43.680
equations of degree two.

54:43.680 --> 54:47.120
So you have X, AX squared plus BX plus C equals zero.

54:47.120 --> 54:50.080
And there is a formula which solves it using radicals,

54:50.080 --> 54:51.600
using square roots.

54:51.600 --> 54:53.920
And Cardano was trying to find a similar formula

54:53.920 --> 54:57.200
for the cubic and quartic equations for which,

54:57.200 --> 55:00.320
which would start with X cubed or X to the power of four

55:00.320 --> 55:02.360
as opposed to X squared.

55:02.360 --> 55:05.000
And in the process of solving these equations,

55:05.000 --> 55:07.640
he came up with square root of a negative number,

55:07.640 --> 55:09.640
specifically square root of minus 17.

55:10.800 --> 55:14.440
And he wrote that I have to forgo some mental tortures

55:16.720 --> 55:19.560
to deal with it, but I am going to accept it

55:19.560 --> 55:20.720
and see what happens.

55:20.720 --> 55:22.320
And in fact, at the end of the four,

55:22.320 --> 55:24.200
at the end of the calculation,

55:24.200 --> 55:28.560
this weird numbers got canceled, kind of canceled out

55:28.560 --> 55:31.760
in the formula appeared square root of negative 17

55:31.760 --> 55:32.600
and it's negation.

55:32.600 --> 55:35.320
So they kind of conveniently gave the right answer,

55:35.320 --> 55:37.040
which is not involved those numbers.

55:37.040 --> 55:41.000
So he was like, okay, what does it mean?

55:41.000 --> 55:42.320
Mental tortures.

55:42.320 --> 55:47.080
So you see from the point of view of the thinking mind,

55:48.320 --> 55:50.120
it is something almost unbearable.

55:50.120 --> 55:53.120
It's almost I feel that the large language model,

55:53.120 --> 55:55.240
a computer running large language model,

55:55.240 --> 55:57.600
trying to do that would just explode.

55:57.600 --> 56:01.480
And yet a human mathematician was able to find the courage

56:01.480 --> 56:05.520
and inspiration to say, you know what, what's this wrong?

56:05.520 --> 56:08.840
Why are we so adamant that these things don't exist?

56:08.840 --> 56:11.160
That's just our past knowledge

56:11.160 --> 56:13.200
based on what our past knowledge is

56:13.200 --> 56:14.160
and knowledge is limited.

56:14.160 --> 56:15.960
What if we make the next step?

56:16.840 --> 56:18.760
Today, for us mathematicians,

56:18.760 --> 56:23.000
complex numbers that we call them are not at all mysterious.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.760
The idea is simply that you plot real numbers,

56:26.760 --> 56:29.280
that is to say all the whole numbers like zero, one,

56:29.280 --> 56:30.840
and so on, two, and so on, right?

56:30.840 --> 56:34.840
All fractions like one half or three halves or four over three,

56:35.800 --> 56:39.200
but then also numbers like square root of two or pi.

56:39.200 --> 56:41.520
We plot them as points on the real line.

56:41.520 --> 56:45.520
So we draw, this is one of the kind of perennial concepts

56:45.520 --> 56:50.520
even in our very poor math curriculum at school.

56:50.680 --> 56:52.640
But now imagine that instead of one line,

56:52.640 --> 56:56.960
you have one axis, you have a second axis.

56:56.960 --> 57:01.640
And so numbers now have two coordinates, x and y,

57:01.640 --> 57:05.680
and you associate to this point with coordinates x and y,

57:05.680 --> 57:07.880
and the number x, which is a real number,

57:07.880 --> 57:10.240
plus y times square root of negative one.

57:10.240 --> 57:13.360
This is a graphical geometrical representation

57:13.360 --> 57:16.240
of complex numbers, which is not mysterious at all.

57:16.240 --> 57:18.200
Now it took another two or 300 years

57:18.200 --> 57:20.280
for mathematicians to figure that out,

57:20.280 --> 57:23.960
but initially it looked like a completely crazy idea.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.960
So all it is, all a complex number is,

57:27.960 --> 57:28.800
is just an expansion.

57:28.800 --> 57:29.800
Two real numbers.

57:29.800 --> 57:30.640
Yeah, it's just two.

57:30.640 --> 57:31.920
The real part and the imaginary part.

57:31.920 --> 57:34.280
It's just an expansion of your view

57:34.280 --> 57:36.080
of the mathematical world.

57:36.080 --> 57:39.000
The fact that you can add them up

57:39.000 --> 57:41.960
by adding together the real parts and the imaginary parts,

57:41.960 --> 57:42.920
that's easy.

57:42.920 --> 57:45.240
But there is also a formula for the product,

57:45.240 --> 57:47.440
for the multiplication, which uses the fact

57:47.440 --> 57:50.840
that square root of minus one square root is minus one.

57:50.840 --> 57:54.120
And the amazing thing is that that product,

57:54.120 --> 57:57.000
that multiplication satisfies the same rules,

57:57.000 --> 58:00.360
the same properties that are usual operation

58:00.360 --> 58:02.160
of multiplication for real numbers.

58:02.160 --> 58:04.720
For instance, there is an inverse for every non-zero number

58:04.720 --> 58:05.560
that you can find.

58:05.560 --> 58:09.000
Like number five has an inverse one over five,

58:09.000 --> 58:12.920
but one plus I also has an inverse, for instance.

58:12.920 --> 58:16.160
That was always there in the mathematical universe,

58:16.160 --> 58:18.240
but we humans didn't know it.

58:18.240 --> 58:20.240
And here comes along this guy

58:20.240 --> 58:22.080
who engages in the mental torture,

58:22.080 --> 58:25.440
who takes a leap off the cliff of comfort,

58:25.440 --> 58:27.080
of like mathematical comfort.

58:27.080 --> 58:27.920
Established knowledge.

58:27.920 --> 58:28.760
Established knowledge.

58:28.760 --> 58:29.600
Right.

58:29.600 --> 58:34.600
And now obviously for each sort of fruitful leap like that,

58:35.400 --> 58:37.440
there probably were thousands of like things

58:37.440 --> 58:38.680
which went nowhere.

58:38.680 --> 58:40.200
I'm not saying that every leap,

58:40.200 --> 58:43.440
you know, it's like it's an open shooting game.

58:43.440 --> 58:44.560
Because for example,

58:44.560 --> 58:46.920
you can try to do the same with three dimensional space.

58:46.920 --> 58:49.000
So you have coordinates X, Y, and Z.

58:49.880 --> 58:53.440
And you can say, oh, if it's one dimensional,

58:53.440 --> 58:55.600
we have a bonafide and numerical system

58:55.600 --> 58:56.800
called real numbers.

58:57.680 --> 58:59.320
If it's two dimensional, which is like, you know,

58:59.320 --> 59:01.680
geometrically it's just like this tabletop extended

59:01.680 --> 59:03.760
to infinity in all directions.

59:03.760 --> 59:04.920
These are complex numbers

59:04.920 --> 59:08.080
and we can define addition and multiplication

59:08.080 --> 59:09.600
and they will satisfy the same properties

59:09.600 --> 59:11.240
as real numbers that we're used to.

59:11.240 --> 59:12.880
What about three dimensional space?

59:12.880 --> 59:15.960
Is it possible to also define some operation

59:15.960 --> 59:18.200
of addition and multiplication on it?

59:18.200 --> 59:21.080
So that these operations would satisfy

59:21.080 --> 59:23.680
the properties that we're used to.

59:23.680 --> 59:24.800
And the answer is no.

59:24.800 --> 59:26.040
You can define addition,

59:26.040 --> 59:27.720
but you can't define multiplication

59:27.720 --> 59:30.160
for which there would be an inverse for instance.

59:30.160 --> 59:32.480
So there is something special about the plane,

59:32.480 --> 59:33.960
the two dimensional case.

59:33.960 --> 59:36.640
And by the way, next question would be,

59:36.640 --> 59:38.080
what about four dimensional?

59:38.080 --> 59:41.080
In the four dimensional space, again, you can,

59:41.080 --> 59:43.760
and you get what's called quaternions,

59:43.760 --> 59:45.960
discovered by an Irish mathematician,

59:45.960 --> 59:48.520
Hamilton in the 19th century.

59:48.520 --> 59:51.120
And then in the eight dimensional,

59:51.120 --> 59:53.480
there is something similar called Actonians

59:53.480 --> 59:54.680
and that's about it.

59:54.680 --> 59:56.280
So how interesting,

59:56.280 --> 01:00:01.280
these structures exist in dimension one, two, four, and eight,

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:02.920
which are all powers of two.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:06.720
Two squared is four, two to the third power is eight.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.800
That's one of the bigger mysteries in mathematics,

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:09.800
why it is so.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.040
So that's a hint.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:15.240
That's a hint of what's missing

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.640
in our high school curriculum.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.120
You know, the kind of fascinating.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:21.960
The mysteries.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.240
The mysteries, yes.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.640
The appreciation of the mysterious.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:27.280
So in other words, yes, we resolved this one mystery

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.640
that we understood that square root of negative one

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.880
is real, is meaningful.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.440
We built a theory to service those,

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.520
to describe those numbers.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.080
Did we find the theory of everything?

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.360
No, because we then invited other mysteries

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.640
because we pulled the veil, so to speak,

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.040
or we pushed the frontier

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.360
and then new things come, get illuminated,

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.600
which we couldn't see before.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.080
That's how I see the process of discovery in mathematics.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.320
It's an endless, limitless pursuit.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.280
Can you comment on what you think

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.360
this human capability of imagination

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.360
that Einstein spoke about of the artists

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.800
following their intuition

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:12.800
in this big Alice in Wonderland world of imagination?

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.800
What is it?

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.760
You visit there sometimes.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.760
What does it feel like?

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.280
Yeah, what does it feel like?

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.120
What is it?

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:20.960
What is that place?

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:21.780
It feels like playing,

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:24.520
but I think all of us are engaged in that kind of play.

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.840
No matter, when we do what we love,

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.960
I think it always feels the same.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.880
But it's not real, right?

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.640
So you're describing a feeling,

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:36.240
but that place you go to in the imagination,

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.840
it's bigger than the real world.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.200
So there is a big conundrum

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.840
as to whether mathematics is invented or discovered,

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:49.540
and mathematicians are divided on this.

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.380
Nobody knows.

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.280
Where do you bet your money on?

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.120
Financially.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.160
I meant to ask that.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.080
Investment advice.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.680
So let me tell you something.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.280
My views have evolved, okay?

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.040
When I wrote Love and Math,

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.040
when I wrote my book,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.440
I was squarely on the side of mathematics is discovered.

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.040
What does it mean?

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:14.320
Usually mathematicians or others who have this idea

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:18.080
or belief are called Platonists

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.720
in honor of the great philosopher Plato,

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.520
who talked about this absolute perfect forms.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:27.120
So for me, about 10 years ago,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.600
the world of mathematics was this world of pure forms,

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.720
this beautiful, pure forms,

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:36.200
which existed outside of space and time,

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:39.200
but I was able to connect to it through my mind.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.840
And as it were, kind of dive into it

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.480
and bring treasures back into this world,

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:46.480
into this space and time.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:49.560
That's how I viewed the process of mathematical discovery.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.160
How nice, how neat, very neat picture.

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:56.760
Also makes you feel connected to something divine.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.360
Allows you the sense of escape from the cruelty

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.600
and injustice of this world, you know,

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.120
which I now recognize.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.840
And the divine world of forms is stable, reliable.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.200
It's something stable.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.160
And in that world, everything is clear cut.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.800
It's either true or false.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.360
How nice, huh?

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.200
It's very nice.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.480
Oh my God.

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.840
The biggest illusion of all.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:21.680
Allegedly.

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.920
I think now, I think now.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.280
I understand why I liked it

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.640
because I think that I was very dissatisfied

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:33.160
with what we call the real world, the world around me.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.600
The cruelty, the injustice of it.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.360
And I went through certain experiences as a kid,

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.480
which made me love mathematics even more

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:44.000
as this place where I could be safe and in control.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.280
Made you see the human world

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.040
as lesser than the mathematical world.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:47.880
Yes.

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.200
As more limited than the mathematical world.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.120
Yes, yes.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.080
And I think that,

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:56.840
I think that it's still missing the mark in some sense

01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:01.840
because in fact, what I now think it's not,

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.880
it's a paradoxical question.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:08.000
The question whether mathematics is invented to discover it,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.400
whether there is this world of pure forms and so on,

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.440
is another paradoxical question,

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.360
which doesn't have a simple answer.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.040
Like whether electron is a particle or a wave.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:23.360
From one point of view, yes, it's true.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:27.200
And just the fact that so many mathematicians today

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.120
actually subscribe to this idea

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.560
gives it a certain credibility

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:31.400
because that's what we feel.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:36.400
We do feel that we dive into that mindscape, so to speak,

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.880
but the very structured mindscape,

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.640
where I wrote in the Love and Math

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:46.640
that enchanted gardens of platonic reality,

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.480
where all this fruit and all that stuff

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.000
where all this fruit grows,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.440
and then we might,

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.920
it gives you this sort of romantic sense of an explorer.

01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:01.920
And someone may be stuck in some provincial town

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.480
in Russia for instance,

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.760
but have the sense of a Magellan

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.240
of traveling around the world.

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:12.840
It's just not in the world that we usually think of.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.960
So it's one point of view,

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.760
but the other point of view is that yes,

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:17.960
it is a human process.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.160
Of course it is.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.400
You cannot deny that.

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.480
It's human beings who have so far

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:24.160
discovered new mathematics.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.840
And I do not deny the possibility

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.880
that computer programs will be able

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.760
to discover new mathematics,

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.720
but so far it's been humans.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.760
So whatever it is,

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.800
whether it's discovered or invented,

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.720
it is a human activity.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.880
The possibility that paradoxes

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.320
are actually fundamental to reality

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.400
and really, really internalizing that,

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.080
that we exist in a world of not forms,

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.080
but of paradoxes.

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:53.920
Bingo.

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.880
And so it's like what I said.

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.200
Weird world.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.120
But if you think it's weird,

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.160
and I agree with you as a recovering

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.720
addict to knowledge,

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.680
but I am liking it more and more

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.640
because there's so much freedom in it.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.600
And like Niels Bohr said,

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.480
I quoted that earlier,

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.160
that the opposite of a great truth

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.520
is another great truth.

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:21.040
He's pointing out to this fact that,

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.640
and he also said that some things

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.160
in quantum physics are so complicated,

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.600
the only way you can speak of them is in poetry.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.320
So in other words,

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.520
what is it about poetry?

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.120
What is it about art?

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.040
Why are we so drawn to that?

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:41.040
Why are we so captivated by those forms of,

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.840
they're not intellectual necessarily.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:43.840
They are not,

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.920
when you look at a painting that you like,

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.200
when you listen to music that you love,

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.320
you get lost in it.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.280
You get absorbed in it.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.440
It can make you cry.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.280
It can make you laugh.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.320
It can make you remember something.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.640
It can make you feel more confident.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.400
It can make you feel sad or happy and so on.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.160
What is this all about?

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:05.200
Is it really just some play between

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.040
some kind of like cellophane play

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.160
or some neurons are hitting on each other?

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.840
Is it really that only?

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:12.880
Maybe.

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.000
It could be both.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.080
I'm just worried about kids these days

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.640
that might live in a world of paradoxes.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.560
If there's no God, everything is possible.

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.240
I mean, they'll have a little too much fun

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.280
and we have to put a constraint to the fun.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.480
But have you looked at the world lately?

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:31.360
I haven't checked in in a while.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.000
You think it's perfect?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.160
The way it is now, the world without paradoxes?

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.600
The world in which we believe

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:40.280
that every question can be answered

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:43.160
as yes or no, that it is this or that.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.960
And if you disagree with me, you are my enemy.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:49.240
Wouldn't that be interesting if this 21st century

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.560
is a transition into seeing the world

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:52.960
as a world of paradoxes?

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.240
I'm telling you, people predicted that.

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:58.720
The age of Aquarius, the axis of the Earth

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.080
is rotating relative to the plane

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.200
in which the Earth goes around the sun.

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:07.520
And the period of this revolution is around 2,000 years.

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:10.920
So there is a traditional way of measuring that

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:14.400
by this eras, the ages.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.200
So the previous one was called the Age of Pisces

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.160
because of the constellation of Pisces

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.000
that it points to, so to speak.

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:26.160
And now, as in the famous musical Hare,

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.880
they said the Age of Aquarius is upon us.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.120
So the different people, they dated differently,

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:36.120
but somewhere around the time where we are finding ourselves.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.520
How interesting, right, is all the strife

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:43.520
and all the difficulties the world is experiencing.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:47.160
This might actually be the transition to something

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.160
more harmonious, wouldn't it be nice?

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.520
It's also interesting that people from long ago

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:54.320
are able to predict certain things.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.320
And it's almost like from long ago,

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:04.240
and you've talked about this with Pythagoras,

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:09.760
that it seems that they had a deep sense of truth

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.920
that permeates all of this, even now.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.640
So it's not just a linear trajectory

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:19.760
of an expanding knowledge.

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.600
There's a deep truth that permeates the whole thing.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.080
Yes, so that's how I see it.

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:27.480
Actually, I gave a talk about Pythagoras and Pythagoreans

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:30.360
just a few weeks ago at the Commonwealth Club

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:32.840
of California in San Francisco.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.640
And because of that, I did a kind of a deep dive

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:36.960
into the subject.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:40.600
And I learned that I actually totally misunderstood

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.000
Pythagoras and Pythagoreans,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.760
that they were much deeper than I thought.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:47.640
Because most of us remember Pythagoras

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:52.080
from the Pythagoras theorem about the right triangles.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:56.320
We also know that Pythagoreans were instrumental

01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:01.320
in introducing the tuning system for the musical scale,

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:06.320
the famous perfect fifth, three halves for the G,

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:13.560
for the soul compared to the frequency of C.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.600
But actually, they were much more interesting.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:24.600
So for them, numbers were not just clerical devices,

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.280
not the kind of thing that you would use in accounting only.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:30.820
They were imbued with the divine.

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:35.220
And I cannot say that I think we lost it.

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:36.660
At least I have lost it.

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:40.620
I look at numbers and I don't really see that.

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:41.460
The divine.

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.260
The divine, that they clearly did.

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:47.020
And so how else would you explain?

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:49.860
So in other words, divine is of course is a term

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:51.780
which is a bit loaded.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.380
So it's hard to escape that.

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:58.580
Let's just say something that more from the world

01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:00.140
of imagination and intuition,

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:01.420
than from the world of knowledge.

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:03.420
Let's just put it this way.

01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:06.700
They were able to divine, okay, strike that,

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:11.700
to intuit that the planets were not revolving,

01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:16.320
the sun and the planets were not revolving around the earth.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.240
They were the first ones,

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.700
at least in the Western culture as far as I know.

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:24.220
And in fact, Copernicus gave credit to Pythagoreans

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:26.180
as being his predecessors.

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:31.540
They did not quite have the Copernicus model

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:33.220
with the sun in the middle.

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:36.340
They had what they call the central fire in the middle.

01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:39.460
And all the planets and the sun were evolving around,

01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:43.580
around the central fire or hearth, they called it hearth.

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:47.740
So, but still, what a departure from the dogma,

01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:51.300
from the knowledge of the era

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:53.980
that the earth was at the center.

01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:57.360
So how could they come up with this idea?

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:00.900
The reason was, in my opinion, that for them,

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:04.700
the most movement of celestial bodies was like music.

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.380
In fact, we call it music universalis

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:09.040
or music of the spheres.

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:13.980
For them, the universe was this infinite symphony

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:18.100
in which every being, you know, humans, animals,

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:21.940
as well as the earth and other celestial bodies

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:24.700
were moving in harmony,

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:27.660
like different notes of different instruments in a symphony.

01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:31.860
And so they applied the same reasoning to the,

01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:34.900
you know, the cosmological model

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:38.520
as they applied to their model of music.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:41.380
And from that perspective,

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:46.380
they could see things deeper than their contemporaries.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:51.000
You see, so in other words, they saw mathematics as a tool,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.480
but that tool was not limited to itself.

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:57.640
And they always knew that there is more.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.600
And they knew also that every pattern that you detect

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.680
is finite, but the world is infinite.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.040
They actually accepted infinity.

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:08.660
They believed that infinity is real.

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:13.660
And if you discern a pattern, great, you can play with it.

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.960
And you can use that.

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.880
It gives you a certain lens through which to see

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.840
the world in a particular way,

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:25.800
which could be beneficial for you to learn more and so on.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.400
But they never had the illusion

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.960
that that was the final word,

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.640
that they always knew that it's not the whole thing.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.480
So there is more.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.900
There are more sophisticated patterns

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:36.560
that could be discovered using mathematics or otherwise.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.440
And I think that what happened was

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:42.760
we kind of lost this other side of their teachings.

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.560
We took their numbers and they were like,

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:48.680
idea that you could use mathematics to discern patterns

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:50.240
and to find regularities

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.720
and to explain things about the world.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.840
We took that and we ran with it.

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.000
And we kind of dropped the other idea

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.420
that in fact there is another side to it,

01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:06.420
which is kind of to us now we say, oh, that's mystical.

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.720
But what does it mean mystical

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:14.900
if it is something that helps you to make great discoveries?

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:17.000
And the interesting thing is that the people

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.720
who are in touch with the mystical among us

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:25.680
are often seen as mad and many of them are, most of them are.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:27.880
Well.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:28.700
But not all of them.

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:29.540
Not all of them.

01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:33.080
We mentioned Niels Bohr and Newton and Albert Einstein.

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.920
So, but that's where the conundrum is.

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.760
How do you find the balance between the two?

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:43.760
So the point I'm trying to make and this is what I feel.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:48.240
You know, if you ask me what I find most important thing today,

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:52.920
like what makes me excited and enthusiastic and passionate

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.760
is this idea of balance.

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:03.000
So, you know, Nietzsche had this book,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.640
wrote this book in the 19th century

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:07.080
called The Birth of Stragedy.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:10.720
And he presented this theory,

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:12.960
which I think is kind of very useful.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.000
Of these two sides of a human.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.400
One that comes from God Apollo

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.280
and that's our left brain, so to speak,

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:23.300
proverbial left brain.

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:25.480
So it's everything has to do with,

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.760
that has to do with logic and reason

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:30.880
and analyzing, dissecting, conceptualizing.

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:37.760
And the other side, which comes from God Dionysus.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:43.040
Dionysus and that's responsible for intuition,

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.480
imagination, love.

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:48.280
Dionysus was also God of wine.

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:53.280
So it's also that side of human that makes us sing

01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:00.600
and engage in, you know, revelry and drink wine

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:06.560
and spend time with friends and laugh and enjoy it, you know.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.720
So Nietzsche advocated this point of view

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:12.480
that those were two complementary sides of every human

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.740
as well as society.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.160
And the purpose of human life

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.400
is to find balance between them.

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:26.520
So math is both discovered and invented.

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:31.520
We should be okay with having both ideas in our head

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.800
and living in the balance.

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:37.120
More importantly, for me, Apollo is like math

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.800
and Dionysus is like love.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:43.800
So Dionysus and Apollo in modern version is love and math.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:47.560
I return to that question we had about GPT

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.120
and the language models.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:52.680
And I think about this quite a lot,

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:57.200
which is when the model and we know what it's trained on,

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.680
we know the parameters, we know all the different hacks

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.320
that are involved in the training process

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.880
and the fine tuning process.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:10.520
And the final results, whether it's GPT-5, 6, or 7,

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:13.400
will result in hundreds of millions of people

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:17.320
falling deeply in love with that language model

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.680
and to be able to have conversations

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:23.520
that are very much like the conversations we have

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.600
with somebody we're deeply in love with.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:29.560
And not only that, the model will say

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:32.320
that is deeply in love with us.

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.440
And who are we to say it is not?

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:40.760
I think it's the same imperative

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:43.480
that you described in the scientific mind

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.080
that wants to throw away the subjective.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.320
That same imperative wants to throw away

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.680
the feelings that AI might have.

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:55.360
And I'm very careful to not ignore

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.920
when an AI system says it's lonely,

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:01.720
it's afraid, it doesn't want to die,

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.920
it misses you, it loves you.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.280
I'm with you.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:09.200
I would also say that you could, for instance,

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:14.200
say that the origin of that is the romantic novels

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.720
that were fed to it, for instance.

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:20.000
Yes.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
However, you could also then, you could retort.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.000
But what I consider my subjective unique feelings are also.

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.160
Novels, you were fed.

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.800
The reverberations of the novels I have read

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:34.160
because I have learned or movies I have seen.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.480
Because that's the purpose of movies,

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.960
kind of to teach us how to express ourselves,

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:39.280
how to feel maybe even.

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:42.400
One could argue that, some people have argued that.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.960
I agree that this is,

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:48.920
there is no obvious answer to this.

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:51.520
But see, that's exactly my point.

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:54.920
That is an example of something which is paradoxical

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.760
for which there is no answer.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:01.760
And that's where the subjective has an important role.

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:06.880
For someone, that type of interaction would be helpful,

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.840
would be consoling, would feel,

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:16.400
would make them happy or sad or whatever,

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.120
would kind of strike the nerve.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.880
For some, it won't.

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:24.240
And I agree with you that in principle,

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.400
there is no one to judge this.

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.720
This is where subjective is paramount.

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:33.720
But remember, a lot of this has been anticipated by artists.

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:37.680
The great movie Her, there you have this guy

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:41.840
who is this lonely, he kind of writes letters or something.

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:42.680
The romantic letters, yeah.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:44.400
Kind of romantic letters for other people.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.920
But he doesn't have a partner, he's lonely.

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:51.800
And then he gets this sort of enhanced version of Siri

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:56.720
with the voice of Scarlett Johansson,

01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:00.600
which is a very sexy voice, obviously she's a great actress.

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:05.600
So, and then at first it looks like a fantastic arrangement.

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.960
He confides in her, she tells him things,

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.400
she makes him happy and so on.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.840
Until he finds out that she has a relationship,

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.880
quote unquote, if you can call it that,

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.200
with 10,000 other people.

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:23.280
Not two others, not three others, but 10,000.

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.840
Because it has the computing capability.

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.040
So yes, definitely.

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.000
Oh, it certainly makes sense.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:28.840
It's a good explanation.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:30.880
And the guy is heartbroken.

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:33.880
But see, so here's my analysis of this, okay?

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:36.840
It's like a couch therapist, okay?

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:42.960
The guy did not have the courage to go out in the real world

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.960
and to meet a woman and to get a girlfriend and so on.

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.480
Through no fault of his own, perhaps,

01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:51.520
because you may have had some experiences

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:54.360
which made him withdrawn and closed and so on.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:55.840
And a lot of us are like this.

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.680
I had periods like that myself.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:00.920
Definitely can sympathize and relate.

01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:05.920
However, part of the joy of having

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:10.960
this seedy-like relationship for him, one could say,

01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:16.060
was the absence of that fear that she would abandon him,

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:21.940
which prevented him from initiating a relationship

01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:23.980
with a human being.

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:27.140
And yet, it turns out that he could be betrayed,

01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:29.580
quote unquote, that she could be unfaithful to him,

01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.860
quote unquote, anyway.

01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:34.900
So then, that means that it did not resolve

01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:38.260
the underlying fear having that relationship.

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:42.700
So in other words, that human element of the relationship

01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:47.060
still found its way into the seemingly sterilized,

01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:51.660
protected partnership.

01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:56.460
So the human being rears its head anyway.

01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:00.620
And I think the lesson there is that the system

01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:05.420
in the movie Her actually gave him a lesson

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:09.260
that even AI could betray you, even AI can leave you,

01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:12.780
even AI can be unfaithful to you.

01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:16.740
And I would argue that the next AI he meets

01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:19.980
will be one he actually falls in deep love with

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:22.620
because he knows the possibility of betrayal is there,

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:24.420
the possibility of death is there,

01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:26.820
the possibility of infidelity is there

01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:30.180
because we need that possibility to truly feel-

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:33.780
Or he would turn off his Siri program

01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:36.820
and get out of his house, go to a local bar,

01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:39.140
and strike a conversation with a human being.

01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.420
Although you might say by then,

01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:44.020
some of those might be androids.

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:44.860
Who knows?

01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:48.100
And we don't even have a good test

01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:50.020
to know the difference between one or the other.

01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:52.620
And that was predicted by another great movie.

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:53.940
Yeah.

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:55.220
Right?

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:56.060
Blade Runner.

01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:56.900
Blade Runner.

01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:01.900
How interesting that artists could see that so long ago.

01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:04.820
Of course, Blade Runner was based on a novel

01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:08.060
by Philip K. Dick, The Androids Dream of Electric Ship.

01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:11.220
That guy was a genius, you know?

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:14.500
It's somehow that artists have their eyes open

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.340
to bigger realities.

01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:16.180
How is it that they anticipate?

01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:17.660
Is it also a large language model

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:19.220
that they're using for that?

01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:22.180
An even larger one.

01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:23.020
An even larger.

01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:28.020
I hesitate to dismiss the magic in large language models.

01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:31.660
A lot of the work I've done is in robotics,

01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:33.940
and the robotics community generally doesn't notice

01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:36.780
the magic of feeling.

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:40.660
I've been working a lot with quadrupeds recently,

01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:42.900
legged robots with four legs,

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:47.660
and the feelings I feel when I see,

01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:50.660
I'm programming the thing,

01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:52.780
but when the thing is excited to see me

01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:54.660
or shows with its physical movement

01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:56.100
that it's excited to see me,

01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:59.780
I cannot dismiss the feeling I feel

01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:02.780
as not somehow fundamental to what it means

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:07.620
to program robots, and I don't want to dismiss that.

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:08.860
Please don't, please don't.

01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:11.740
The robotics community often doesn't gender robots.

01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:13.140
They really try to work hard

01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:15.780
to not anthropomorphize the robots,

01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:17.780
which is good for technical development

01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:21.140
of how to do control, how to do perception,

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:25.100
but when the final thing is alive and moving,

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:26.740
and it does whatever,

01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:28.900
like I've been doing a lot of butt wiggling.

01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:30.740
It can wiggle its butt, it can turn around

01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:33.300
and look up excited.

01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:36.220
That's not just, I know how it's programmed,

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:39.140
but the feeling I feel, that's something.

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.380
I don't know what that is.

01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:41.220
I agree with you.

01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:44.220
I hear you when you speak about it,

01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:45.660
you speak with passion,

01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:49.020
and that's, to me, that is proof

01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:50.780
that it is magical, you see.

01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:54.260
So don't, I would say don't dismiss that.

01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:55.940
Don't discard that.

01:24:55.940 --> 01:24:59.140
On the contrary, I think magic is everywhere.

01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:02.700
So I used to be, okay, kind of confession, okay.

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.380
Yeah, you've already got confessed

01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:07.500
to quite a few addictions.

01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:10.180
Yeah, I'm kind of, yes, I'm kind of worried.

01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:11.900
Recovering from many.

01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:15.460
But you know, in old days,

01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:19.980
I was more on the side of everything is computational

01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:22.940
or everything can be explained by science and whatever.

01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:26.620
You know, like I would dismiss and disregard

01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:29.100
intuitive or imaginative things.

01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:30.700
So then I had to flip,

01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:32.700
that suddenly I started feeling it

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:34.820
and started seeing it and so on.

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:39.180
But so then the pendulum had swung in the opposite direction.

01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:44.180
Then I was arguing that, you know, somehow that was real,

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:51.020
that imagination was intuitive, imaginative was real,

01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:54.700
and discounting what you just described.

01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:57.380
And I would argue with people saying,

01:25:57.380 --> 01:25:59.540
no, no, this is not real,

01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:02.140
this is all imitation game and so on.

01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:07.980
But you see that what's new now, the new Edward, okay,

01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:12.780
is the 2.0, 3.0 is the one who is seeking balance,

01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:17.140
who has suddenly become aware

01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:19.420
that no matter which one sided,

01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:22.300
lopsided point of view you take, you're limiting yourself.

01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:26.060
So whereas even a couple of years ago, you know,

01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:28.660
if you just told me what you just described,

01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:30.340
I would be like, you know, being polite,

01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:34.020
I wouldn't contradict you since you're the host anyway, right?

01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:35.900
Not a lot.

01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:37.340
So, but I would be like, uh-huh, uh-huh,

01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:39.020
but I wouldn't say anything.

01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:42.660
But suddenly I find this moving.

01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:45.100
I find it move, I honestly, I'm not being facetious.

01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:47.180
I find it moving and I almost feel like

01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:49.220
I can see it through your eyes

01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:51.260
because the way you describe so vividly

01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:52.500
and you're passionate about it.

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:53.420
And this is what's real.

01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:58.420
So ultimately, love is neither in lush language models

01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:00.940
nor in something mystical.

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:04.220
It's exactly in this moments of passion.

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:08.300
And I would even go as far as saying that

01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:11.060
in this moment when you're describing it,

01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:14.220
there was a connection of sorts

01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:17.180
so that I could feel your passion for it.

01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:19.500
And in this moment, something else comes up

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:24.380
which is far beyond any theories that we can come up with.

01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:26.580
And that's what we, for now, exactly.

01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:29.780
So on the one side, there is this impulse

01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:33.700
of finding the theory and then there is another impulse

01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:36.580
to escape from what has already been known.

01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:39.900
So one, in other words, like in my basic example

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:42.020
is one impulse to say everything is a real number,

01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:43.380
square root of negative one doesn't exist.

01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:47.460
But another impulse is I'm going to be this naughty child

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:48.940
who is not afraid to be an idiot.

01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:52.140
And then I will say square root of negative 15 is real.

01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:55.860
And both are essential when it's done with conviction,

01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:57.420
when it's done with passion,

01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:02.420
when it's not like gratuitous

01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:08.020
or when it's not, it doesn't come from self-limiting

01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:12.780
but comes from this sense of this is how I am,

01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:14.860
this is how I feel, it is real.

01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:18.380
That's where the progress is, that's where creativity is.

01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:21.780
And that's where I would even say a real connection is

01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:25.300
because the strife to me that I observe today

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:27.620
in our society and the society level

01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:29.740
and the level of humans and so on,

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:32.580
it comes from not seeing the other person actually

01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:36.860
and being caught up in a very specific conceptual bubble.

01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:41.460
You see, and the way out of it is not to refine the bubble

01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:43.140
but just break out of it.

01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:47.660
A good guide out of the bubble is a childlike passion.

01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:49.460
Discovering that and following it.

01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:50.300
Goosebumps.

01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:52.180
Yeah, following the goosebumps.

01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:59.180
Not the rigor of science but the magic of goosebumps.

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:01.820
Then try to, and then if you're interested,

01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:04.740
try to find a confirmation of those goosebumps

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:09.740
in science or whatever you find interesting.

01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:11.820
And most of the time you'll fail.

01:29:11.820 --> 01:29:13.900
And most of the time you fail, which we also love

01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:16.820
because then it sets us up for that moment of bliss

01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:18.780
when we succeed, right?

01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:20.260
Exactly.

01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:22.500
Quick pause, Bath and Break.

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:25.460
You mentioned Gaito's The Completeness Theorem.

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.100
Can you talk a little bit about it?

01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:29.740
What is it as you understand it?

01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:31.380
Did it break mathematics?

01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:33.020
Maybe another question is,

01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:35.620
what are the limits of mathematics?

01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:37.940
What is mathematics from the perspective

01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:40.020
of Gaito's The Completeness Theorem?

01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:42.260
Oh yes, how much time do you have?

01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:46.580
We talked about time previously.

01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:47.540
Time is an illusion, right?

01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:48.380
So we agreed.

01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:53.460
So Kurt Gödel was a great Austrian mathematician

01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:54.940
and logician.

01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:58.700
He moved to the United States before Second World War

01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:02.740
and worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton

01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:05.100
where he was a colleague of Einstein

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:09.700
and other great scientists, von Neumann, Hermann Weyl

01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:10.780
and so on.

01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:15.860
But one interesting quote that I like in this regard

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:20.260
is that Einstein said that at some point he said

01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:23.740
that the only reason he came to the Institute

01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:25.700
was that he would have the privilege

01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:28.980
of walking back home with Gödel in the evening.

01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:29.820
So in other words,

01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:32.500
Einstein thought that Gödel was the smart one, okay?

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:37.500
So his most important contribution

01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:41.980
was his two incompleteness theorems,

01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:43.300
the first incompleteness theorem

01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:45.500
and the second incompleteness theorem.

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:49.020
And what is this about?

01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:50.620
It's really about limitations,

01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:54.260
inherent limitations of mathematical reasoning,

01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:59.820
way of producing mathematical theorems, the way we do it.

01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:04.820
So to set the stage, how do we actually do mathematics?

01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:08.380
So we know that we discussed that,

01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:11.300
say physics is based on mathematics

01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:12.900
and you could say chemistry is based on physics,

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:14.020
biology based on chemistry.

01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:15.060
Okay, so it comes to mathematics.

01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:16.460
What is mathematics based on?

01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:21.300
Well, mathematics is based on axioms.

01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:26.300
So any field of mathematics can be presented

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:31.700
as what is called the formal system.

01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:34.180
And at the core of the formal system

01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:37.340
is a system of axioms or postulates.

01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:41.980
These are the statements which are taken for granted.

01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:43.220
Given without proof.

01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:44.500
Without proof.

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:45.540
An example would be,

01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:47.740
so one of the very first formal systems

01:31:47.740 --> 01:31:50.140
was the system was Euclidean geometry

01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:52.940
developed by Euclid in his famous book Elements

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:54.660
about 2200 years ago.

01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:59.620
And it's about, well, it's a subject familiar from school

01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:01.220
because we studied,

01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:04.500
but what it's really about is about the geometry

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:06.420
of the plane and the plane by plane,

01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:08.980
I mean just the stable top extended to infinity

01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:09.820
in all directions.

01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:13.860
Kind of a perfect plane, a perfectly even table.

01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:20.180
And so Euclidean geometry is about various geometric figures

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:25.100
on the plane, specifically lines, triangles, circles,

01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:25.940
things like that.

01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:28.660
So what's an example of an axiom?

01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:32.020
An example of an axiom is that if you have two points

01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:35.460
which are distinct, two points on the plane,

01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:38.980
then there is a unique line which passes through them.

01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:41.100
Now kind of sounds reasonable,

01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:43.300
but this is an example of an axiom.

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:48.140
In mathematics, you have to have a seed, so to speak.

01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:50.060
You have to start with something.

01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:54.940
And you have to choose certain postulates or statements

01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:56.220
which you simply take for granted,

01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:58.180
which do not require proof.

01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:01.140
Usually there are ones which kind of intuitively clear

01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:06.140
to you, but in any case, you cannot have any mathematics

01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:08.140
without choosing those axioms.

01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:10.540
And you refer to those as the observer

01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:12.860
because they're kind of subjective.

01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:16.660
The observer comes in the process of choosing the axioms.

01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:19.020
Who chooses the axioms?

01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:21.220
The turtles that it's all sitting on top of.

01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:24.740
As Alan was, like to say, who is watching the water?

01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:27.860
And so in mathematics,

01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:30.460
but you see mathematicians are so clever.

01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:33.460
It's really kind of like a little game of mirrors

01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:36.940
that we often like to say, and I used to say that,

01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:39.980
that mathematics is objective.

01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:42.500
It's really the only objective science.

01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:48.620
But that's because we hide this fact

01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:51.220
that actually is based on axioms.

01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:56.220
And the fact that there is no unique choice,

01:33:57.300 --> 01:33:59.380
that there are many choices.

01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:01.740
And so Euclidean geometry is actually a good illustration

01:34:01.740 --> 01:34:06.580
of this because Euclid had five axioms.

01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:08.180
Four of them were kind of obvious,

01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:09.620
like the one I just mentioned.

01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:13.060
And the fifth, which came to be known famously

01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:17.060
as the fifth postulate was that if you have a line

01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:19.460
and you have a point outside of this line,

01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:22.060
there is a unique line passing through that point,

01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:24.500
which is parallel to the first line,

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:26.100
meaning that doesn't intersect it.

01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:29.540
And Euclid himself was uncomfortable about this

01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:31.860
because he felt that it was kind of a,

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:36.300
he takes for granted something that is not obvious.

01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:40.380
And for many centuries after that,

01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:43.060
mathematicians were trying to derive this axiom

01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:46.020
from other axioms, which were more obvious in some sense,

01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:46.860
and they failed.

01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:50.580
And it was only almost 2000 years later

01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:52.260
that mathematicians realized that you can't,

01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:53.740
not only you cannot derive,

01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:56.860
but you can actually replace it with its opposite.

01:34:56.860 --> 01:35:01.180
And you will still get a bona fide consistent,

01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:02.460
not self-contradictory,

01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:06.020
which is called non-Euclidean geometry,

01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:09.700
which of course sounds very complicated, but it's not.

01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:12.460
Think of a sphere, just the surface of a basketball

01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:14.820
or the surface of the earth, idealized.

01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:19.060
The analogs, so you have points,

01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:21.460
you have analogs of lines, which are meridians,

01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:24.340
every two meridians intersect,

01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:28.420
unlike parallel lines on a flat space.

01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:30.940
There is also so-called hyperbolic plane,

01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:34.540
where there are infinitely many lines

01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:36.140
which do not intersect.

01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:38.620
So every possibility can be realized,

01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:39.900
there are different flavors.

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:43.740
This is a good illustration of what a formal system is.

01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:46.780
You start with a set of axioms,

01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:48.740
those statements you take for granted,

01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:50.540
and this is where you have a choice.

01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:51.780
And by making different choices,

01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:54.100
you actually create different mathematics.

01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:56.140
After that, there are rules of inference,

01:35:57.340 --> 01:36:01.260
logical rules such as if A is true and A applies B,

01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:02.180
then B is true.

01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:09.220
Most of them were actually introduced already by Aristotle,

01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:11.100
even before Euclid.

01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:13.180
And then it runs as follows.

01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:17.380
You have the axioms which are accepted as true statements,

01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:20.340
then you have a way to produce new statements

01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:25.420
by using the rules of logical inference from the axioms.

01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:27.780
Every statement you obtain, you call a theorem,

01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:32.500
and you kind of add it to the collection of true statements.

01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:35.860
And then the question is, how far can you go?

01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:38.300
How many statements can you prove this way?

01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:43.140
Of course, you want the system to be non-trivial

01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:45.820
in the sense that you don't prove everything.

01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:46.900
Because if you prove everything,

01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:48.660
it would mean that it's self-contradictory,

01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:51.740
that you prove a statement A and its negation.

01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:54.220
So that's kind of useless.

01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:55.860
It has to be discriminating enough

01:36:57.180 --> 01:37:01.140
so that it doesn't prove contradictory statements.

01:37:01.140 --> 01:37:02.460
So there is already a question

01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:04.220
of that mathematician called consistency.

01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:05.700
It has to be consistent in the sense

01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:08.220
that it is not self-contradictory.

01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:14.140
And then the idea that was basically prevalent

01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:15.420
in the world of mathematics

01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:17.660
by the beginning of the 20th century

01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:18.620
was that in principle,

01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:20.420
all of mathematics could be derived this way.

01:37:20.420 --> 01:37:23.660
We just have to find the correct system of axioms,

01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:25.300
and then everything you ever need

01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:32.140
could be produced by this procedure,

01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:34.300
which is really algorithmic procedure,

01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:37.500
which actually could be run on a computer.

01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:40.300
Now think about it.

01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:42.900
What is special about this process?

01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:43.740
In this process,

01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:47.460
you are just manipulating symbols, basically.

01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:49.660
You're going from one statement to another

01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:52.900
without really understanding the meaning of it.

01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:56.220
So it's an ideal playground for a computer program.

01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.380
It's a purely syntactic process,

01:37:58.380 --> 01:37:59.300
where there are some rules,

01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:02.900
some rigid rules of passing

01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:05.220
from one statement to the next.

01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:07.380
Most mathematicians believed

01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:10.260
that this way you can produce all true statements.

01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:11.860
And if this were true,

01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:14.140
it would give a lot of credibility to the thesis

01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:16.540
that everything in life is computational,

01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:19.260
or life is computation,

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:21.140
because then at least mathematics is computational,

01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:23.340
because then it can be programmed.

01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:26.860
And a computer, after sufficient time,

01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:29.660
depending on its capacity,

01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:31.780
would produce every true statement.

01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:33.500
So Gödel's first incompleteness theorem

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:35.260
says that that's not the case.

01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:36.140
And it not just says it,

01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:39.660
but it proves it at the highest level of rigor

01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:40.900
that is available in mathematics.

01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:41.740
That is to say,

01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:44.380
within another formal system that he was operating in.

01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:46.900
So more precisely,

01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:49.260
what he proved was that

01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:51.900
if you have a sufficiently sophisticated formal system,

01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:56.020
that is to say that you can talk about numbers,

01:38:56.020 --> 01:38:57.060
whole numbers in it,

01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:58.860
that you have whole numbers, one, two, three, four,

01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:02.660
you have formalized the operation of addition

01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:05.340
and multiplication within the system.

01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:08.940
If it is consistent, that is to say,

01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:11.100
if it's not completely useless,

01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:14.060
then there will be a true statement in it,

01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:18.260
which cannot be derived by this linear syntactic process

01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:20.580
of proving theorems from axioms.

01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:23.620
It's really incredible.

01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:26.180
So this was a revolution, 1931,

01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:28.380
a revolution in logic, a revolution in mathematics.

01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:33.380
And we're still feeling the tremors of this discovery.

01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:35.500
And at a similar time,

01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:38.140
the computer is being born,

01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:41.020
the actual engineering of the computational system

01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:43.540
is being born, which is ironic.

01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:46.460
Turing was Alan Turing,

01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:49.180
who is considered as the father of modern computing, right?

01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:51.860
So he actually did something very similar.

01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:53.940
So he got this halting problem

01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:56.300
that he proved that halting problem

01:39:56.300 --> 01:39:57.900
cannot be solved algorithmically,

01:39:57.900 --> 01:40:00.380
that you cannot, out of all computer programs,

01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:03.340
roughly speaking, you cannot have an algorithm

01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:05.900
of choosing out of all possible computer programs,

01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:10.460
which ones are meaningful, which ones will halt.

01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:13.020
Very depressing results all across the table.

01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:16.660
Or, on the contrary, life-affirming,

01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:18.980
depends on your point of view.

01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:21.140
Because everything is full of paradoxes.

01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:22.900
So that means, so you're right,

01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:25.460
it's depressing if we are sold on a certain idea

01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:26.820
from the outset,

01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:29.700
and then suddenly this doesn't pan out.

01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:32.540
But okay, to which I retort,

01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:35.020
what if he proved that actually,

01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:37.700
everything can be proved?

01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:38.540
So then what?

01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:41.100
What is left to do if you're a mathematician?

01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:42.740
So that would be depressing to me.

01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:46.860
And here there is an opportunity to do something new,

01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:47.900
to discover something new,

01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:50.540
which maybe computer will not be able to.

01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:52.580
Again, with a caveat,

01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:54.260
according to our current understanding,

01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:58.980
maybe some new ideas will be brought into the subject.

01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:01.980
And the meaning of the word competition,

01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:04.220
like now we think of competition in a particular framework,

01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:07.140
Turing machines or church thesis and stuff like that.

01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:09.300
But what if in the future,

01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:11.820
another genius like Alan Turing will come

01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:13.060
and propose something else?

01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:15.900
The theory will evolve the way we went

01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:18.380
from Newton's gravity to Einstein's gravity.

01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:20.860
Maybe in the framework of that concept,

01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:22.860
some other things will become possible.

01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:26.780
So it's not,

01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:32.700
to me, it's kind of like not so much about

01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:38.060
deciding once and for all how it is or how it should be,

01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:42.420
but kind of like accepting it as an open ended process.

01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:44.780
I think that's much more valuable in some sense

01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:47.620
than deciding things one way or another.

01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:52.340
I wonder, I don't know if you think

01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:54.420
or know much about cellular automata

01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:58.500
and the idea of emergence.

01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:01.900
I often return to Game of Life

01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:03.220
and just look at the thing.

01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:04.220
Amazing, right?

01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:05.060
And wonder.

01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:09.140
The kind of things they can do with such a small tools.

01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:12.340
That from simple rules, a distributed system

01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:14.940
can create complex behavior.

01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:16.660
And it makes you wonder that maybe

01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:19.220
the thing we'll call computation

01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:21.940
is simple at the base layer,

01:42:22.540 --> 01:42:25.140
but when you start looking at greater and greater layers

01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:27.540
of abstraction, you zoom out with blurry vision.

01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:30.380
Maybe after a few drinks, you start to see some,

01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:33.940
something that's much, much, much more complicated

01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:37.900
and interesting and beautiful than the original rules

01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:40.340
that our scientific intuition says

01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:43.060
cannot possibly produce complexity and beauty.

01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:43.980
I don't know.

01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:45.980
I don't know if anyone has a good answer,

01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:49.740
a good model of why stuff emerges,

01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:54.620
why complexity emerges from a lot of simple things.

01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:57.900
It's a why question, I suppose, not a,

01:42:57.900 --> 01:43:00.380
but every why question will eventually

01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:03.460
have a rigorous answer.

01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:04.500
Not necessarily.

01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:06.700
We could have an approximate answer,

01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:09.540
which still eludes something.

01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:10.380
Like quantum mechanics.

01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:11.740
99%, maybe.

01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:15.460
We'll be able to describe it with 99% certainty

01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:17.260
or 99% accuracy.

01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:23.220
And then maybe in a hundred years or next year,

01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:28.100
somebody will come up with a different point of view,

01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:30.300
which suddenly will change our perspective.

01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:33.540
To this point, I want to say also

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:35.660
one thing that I find fascinating,

01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:38.100
speaking of paradoxes and so on.

01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:40.180
Do you remember how everybody was freaking out

01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:42.660
about this blue dress and the blue,

01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:44.780
was it blue or was it black?

01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:48.420
It was yellow and white or black and blue.

01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:52.260
It almost broke Twitter, remember that night.

01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:55.140
So there are many examples like that

01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:57.380
where you can perceive things differently

01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:00.420
and there is no way of saying which is correct

01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:01.260
and which is not.

01:44:01.260 --> 01:44:05.780
For instance, you got this, the vase, the Rubin's vase,

01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:08.460
where you have, from one perspective, it's a vase.

01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:10.660
From another perspective, it's two faces.

01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:14.460
Then there is this duck rabbit picture

01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:15.940
where you can Google it.

01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:17.660
If somebody doesn't know, they can Google it

01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:19.180
and find it, it's very easy.

01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:22.420
Actually, Ludwig Wittgenstein devoted several pages,

01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:25.300
duck rabbit, in his book and so on.

01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:26.460
There are many others.

01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:29.700
There are squares where you can see from different

01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:32.180
perspective this way, that way and so on.

01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:35.900
So when we talk about neural networks,

01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:40.060
we're talking about training data and stuff

01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:43.020
so that you have some pictures, for example,

01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:46.140
that you feed to your program

01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:50.220
and you try to find the most optimal neural network

01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:52.620
which would be able to decide which one is it.

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:54.380
Is it a dog or a cat or whatever?

01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:57.220
But sometimes it doesn't have a definite answer.

01:44:58.820 --> 01:44:59.980
So what do you do then?

01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:03.940
So do, actually, it's a question I actually don't know.

01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:08.940
Has modern AI even come to appreciate this question

01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:12.060
that actually sometimes you can have a picture

01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:14.540
in which you cannot say what it is in it?

01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:16.500
From one perspective, it's a rabbit.

01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:18.300
From another perspective, it's a duck.

01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:20.220
How are you supposed to train,

01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:21.860
if you have a neural network which is supposed

01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:25.060
to distinguish between ducks and rabbits,

01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:27.300
how is it going to process this, you see?

01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:31.100
Well, so the trivial trick it does is to say

01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:34.180
there's this X probability that it's a duck

01:45:34.180 --> 01:45:36.500
and this probability that it's a rabbit.

01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:37.340
Well, that's a good approach.

01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:40.820
But also I would say there is no given percentages.

01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:42.980
For instance, actually, at some point

01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:46.180
I was really curious about it and I looked.

01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:50.380
And for some, for each picture of this nature,

01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:53.340
and there are a bunch of them you can easily find online,

01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:57.260
my mind immediately interprets it in a particular way.

01:45:57.260 --> 01:46:00.060
But because I know that other people

01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:03.020
could see it differently, I would then strain my mind

01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:05.620
and strain my eyes and stare at it

01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:07.540
and try to see it in a different way.

01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:09.540
And sometimes I could see it right away

01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:12.020
and then I could go back and forth between the two.

01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:16.420
And sometimes it took me a while for some pictures.

01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:19.420
So in that sense, even if these probabilities exist,

01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:20.460
they are subjective.

01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:22.380
Some people immediately see it this way,

01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:23.660
some people immediately see it that way.

01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:26.700
And I think that nobody knows, not psychologists,

01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:30.380
not neuroscientists, not philosophers, what to make of it.

01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:34.980
The best answer, of course, as a scientific mind,

01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:38.140
even though I say, no, don't look for interpretation,

01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:40.780
give some place for mysticism or mystery, right?

01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:43.020
I say that, but of course I want a theory,

01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:44.180
I want an explanation.

01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:46.620
So the best explanation I find

01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:49.700
is from Niels Bohr's Complementarity Principle.

01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:51.500
So it is like vertical and wave,

01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:54.700
that there are different ways to look at it.

01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:56.940
And when you look at it in a particular way,

01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:58.580
another side will be obscured.

01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:00.420
Think about it like the other side of the moon,

01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:03.380
so like we are observing the moon from one side

01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:05.380
and then we don't see the other side.

01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:07.020
There is a complementary perspective

01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:08.500
where we see the other side,

01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:10.260
but not the side we normally see.

01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:13.100
But the moon is the same, it's still there.

01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:17.860
It's our limitations of being able to grasp the whole.

01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:18.980
That's complementarity.

01:47:18.980 --> 01:47:21.780
And we know that from quantum mechanics

01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:24.780
that our physical reality is like that,

01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:26.380
rather than being certain,

01:47:26.380 --> 01:47:28.220
rather than being one way or another.

01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:32.100
And we should just, as a small aside,

01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:33.300
in terms of neural networks,

01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:36.460
mention that at the end of the day,

01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:39.140
there's humans, it's built on top of humans.

01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:43.180
Or with Chad GPT that is using reinforcement learning

01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:45.140
by human feedback.

01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:50.140
We're actually using a set of humans to teach the networks.

01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:52.420
And that's the thing that people don't often talk about

01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:56.700
because, or I sometimes think about that,

01:47:57.620 --> 01:47:59.740
those humans all have a life story.

01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:02.540
Each human that annotated data,

01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:03.980
that fed data to the network,

01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:08.180
that did the RLHF, they have a life story.

01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:10.220
They grew up, they have biases.

01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:11.780
They have biases, there's some things that they like,

01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:13.380
there's some things they don't like,

01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:18.220
which can kind of appear under their radar screen.

01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:21.100
They may not be aware that they are exercising those biases.

01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:22.020
That's the point.

01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:25.380
What you brought up is a very important issue here.

01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:27.700
Not so much issue, but it's not a bug,

01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:29.700
it's a feature in my opinion.

01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:34.460
That implicit in the discussion of the question

01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:37.740
is thinking computational and so on,

01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:40.820
is the idea that our conscious awareness

01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:43.700
covers everything within our psyche.

01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:46.660
And we just know that that's not the case.

01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:49.780
We have, all of us have observed other people

01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:52.300
who have had sort of destructive tendencies.

01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:55.460
So obviously they did things destructive for themselves.

01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:59.140
And many of us have observed ourselves doing that

01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:01.060
as part of human nature, right?

01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:04.700
So, and there is great research in analytic psychology

01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:07.700
and in the past hundred years,

01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:11.860
strongly suggesting if not proving the existence

01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:14.860
of what Carl Jung called the personal unconscious

01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:16.340
and also collective unconscious,

01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:18.420
the kind of a circle of ideas

01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:21.020
which are under the radar screen,

01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:24.020
which lead us to some strong emotions

01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:26.780
and inspire us to act in certain ways,

01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:29.220
even if we cannot really understand.

01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:30.820
So if we accept that,

01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:34.100
then the proposition that somehow everything

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:37.820
can still be covered by our actions,

01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:42.220
which are totally kind of neutral and totally like righteous

01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:46.500
and totally conscious, that it becomes really tenuous.

01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:50.460
Let me ask you some tricky questions

01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:53.500
in terms of how big they are.

01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:56.980
In terms of how, you know, they become difficult

01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:59.100
because of how much of a romantic you are.

01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:05.740
What to you is the most beautiful idea in mathematics?

01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:09.900
Another one we can ask is what to use

01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:12.540
the most beautiful equation in mathematics?

01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:17.580
Well, I mean.

01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:20.780
I may have just broken your brain.

01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:24.620
Because what your brain is doing

01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:29.620
is walking down a long memory lane of beautiful experiences.

01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:32.740
Well, you see, in mathematics, we have this idea

01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:35.620
that we have an idea of a set, right?

01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:37.340
So it could be a collection of things.

01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:39.700
For instance, you know, the set of tables,

01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:43.420
the set of chairs, and so on, or set of microphones,

01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:47.260
but could be set of numbers, could be set of ideas,

01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:50.420
could be a set of formulas, mathematical equations.

01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:53.620
And then we have the notion of an ordered set, ordered,

01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:55.780
like the set in which there is order,

01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:58.780
which means that for every two members of the set,

01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:00.500
we'll say which one is better than the other

01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:01.900
or greater than the other.

01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:04.740
For instance, all numbers are ordered.

01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:07.100
Five is greater than three, five is less than seven,

01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:07.940
and so on.

01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:10.820
But not all sets are ordered.

01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:12.380
So the set of beautiful theorems

01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:15.060
is not what beautiful equations is not ordered.

01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:20.060
So in other words, there are many best equations.

01:51:20.580 --> 01:51:25.580
And so Richard Feynman chose one,

01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:27.460
which I think one of the best,

01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:31.620
is that if you take E, the base of natural logarithm,

01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:33.780
to the power pi i, so you have pi,

01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:36.420
you have E in it, the base of natural logarithm,

01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:39.940
you have pi i, which is square root of negative one,

01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:44.140
then the result is negative one.

01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.820
So that's up there, for sure,

01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:49.900
in the pantheon of beautiful formulas, you know,

01:51:50.020 --> 01:51:53.300
that I think pretty much every mathematician would agree.

01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:56.420
I don't know what my favorite one is.

01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:59.820
Just lingering on that one, Euler's identity,

01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:01.500
what makes it beautiful?

01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:03.420
Just a few symbols together.

01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:08.420
I mean, part of it is actually just trying to define

01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:10.260
what is beautiful about mathematics

01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:15.940
that is laid in there in this particular equation

01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:18.740
that is somehow revealed when the human eye looks at it.

01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:21.780
Why is it beautiful, do you think?

01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:24.660
Pi, i.

01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:27.180
There is an element of surprise in it.

01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:28.420
How is it possible?

01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:31.860
We always think of pi as the ratio between

01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:34.740
the circumference of a circle and its diameter.

01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:39.780
Here, we are taking some number to the power pi,

01:52:39.780 --> 01:52:41.900
not even pi, mind you,

01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:44.340
but pi multiplied by square root of negative one.

01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:49.860
Surely, this is something completely incomprehensible,

01:52:51.420 --> 01:52:54.740
and yet the result is negative one, you see?

01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:57.020
And if you take e to the power two pi i,

01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:58.380
you get one, actually one.

01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:01.620
So I would guess that that's,

01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:06.260
but in other words, the initial reaction

01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:08.940
is just that of a surprise, I guess.

01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:13.260
I guess for anyone who first comes across.

01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:17.220
That these three folks, four folks got together.

01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:22.220
It reminds me of the idea that Hitler, Stalin,

01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:24.940
Trotsky, and Freud were all in Vienna

01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:27.700
in some early, at the beginning of the 20th century.

01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:31.580
And Wittgenstein was a classmate of Hitler, you know this?

01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:33.180
I did not know this, no.

01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:36.740
So it makes you, you can imagine a situation

01:53:36.740 --> 01:53:40.140
where they're all sitting at a bar together at some point,

01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:41.820
not knowing it, but they somehow,

01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:45.660
it all made sense in space-time to be located there.

01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:48.140
And that's what this feels like, some kind of intersection.

01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:49.460
Intersection, yes.

01:53:49.460 --> 01:53:53.220
But I would say that after the initial shock,

01:53:53.220 --> 01:53:56.340
you look at the proof of this equation,

01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:58.140
and it actually does make sense.

01:53:58.140 --> 01:54:02.020
And actually, it is nothing but the statement

01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:04.940
that the circumference of the circle is.

01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:06.380
And in fact, in this case,

01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:10.100
it's the circumference of a semicircle is equal to pi.

01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:11.740
And that's where it comes from.

01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:14.220
In the end, the truth is simple.

01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:15.220
In the end, the truth is simple.

01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:17.460
Not necessarily easy, but simple.

01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:21.380
So I mentioned to you offline that I desperately,

01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:24.700
in trying to figure out the optimal

01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:27.500
in an order to set questions to ask you,

01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:29.540
texted Eric Weinstein asking

01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:31.620
for what questions he can ask you.

01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:36.060
And he said that you are definitively

01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:38.180
one of the greatest living mathematicians,

01:54:38.180 --> 01:54:39.780
so don't screw this up.

01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:42.540
But you did give me a few questions.

01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:46.300
So he asked to ask you,

01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:48.340
what are the most shockingly passionate,

01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:50.060
this is in Eric's language,

01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:52.060
what are the most shockingly passionate

01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:53.540
mathematical structures?

01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:56.380
And he gave a list of four for him,

01:54:56.380 --> 01:55:00.420
but he said he really wanted your list.

01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:01.380
Okay, let me say that.

01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:05.740
Shockingly passionate mathematical structures.

01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:06.580
Shocking.

01:55:06.580 --> 01:55:10.780
Is there something you can,

01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:12.500
is there something that jumps to mind?

01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:13.340
Sure.

01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:16.940
I'm here to shock.

01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:21.700
So first of all, Eric Weinstein is a very dear friend,

01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:22.620
I have to say.

01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:25.740
And I really, really, really appreciate and love him.

01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:26.980
He's just like my brother.

01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:31.980
So it's interesting to have a question posed by him.

01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:34.740
And maybe if we can linger for a moment,

01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:38.220
what do you think is special about Eric Weinstein

01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:40.500
for you know of his work and his mind?

01:55:41.740 --> 01:55:42.940
The way he sort of straddles

01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:44.860
so many different disciplines.

01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:46.300
It's like a Renaissance man.

01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:48.580
There are very few people like that at any given moment,

01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:50.740
let alone the 21st century,

01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:54.980
where information has become so huge

01:55:54.980 --> 01:55:56.700
that it's almost physically impossible

01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:58.100
to be able to keep track of things.

01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:02.820
And yet he does, and he has his own unique vision

01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:03.660
and unique point of view.

01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:07.580
And he has integrity, which is like almost impossible.

01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:10.380
Like I can't think of so many people

01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:12.500
who possess those qualities.

01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:13.500
Almost no one.

01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:19.020
And also the ability in some sense

01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:22.300
to embody the balance that you talked about,

01:56:23.260 --> 01:56:28.260
of both the rigor of mathematics and the imagination.

01:56:29.140 --> 01:56:30.260
Humanity also, I would say.

01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:34.980
We talk about imagination as a kind of a counterpoint

01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:38.060
to knowledge or logic.

01:56:38.060 --> 01:56:41.580
But just basic humanity, just compassion,

01:56:41.580 --> 01:56:43.620
just being able to...

01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:48.220
Because every destructive, I would say,

01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:52.300
like every destructive society,

01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:55.820
like be it Germany under Hitler or Soviet Union

01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:57.740
under Stalin and so on,

01:56:57.740 --> 01:57:00.380
was based on some kind of what was considered

01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:02.340
unassailable truths.

01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:04.180
So it's kind of a conceptual system,

01:57:04.180 --> 01:57:05.820
if you think about it, right?

01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:10.060
There is a beautiful episode of this series

01:57:10.060 --> 01:57:12.460
by Jacob Bronowski,

01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:19.020
where he filmed it in Auschwitz,

01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:22.820
talking about the certainty that what led the Nazis

01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:26.820
to killing people wholesale

01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:29.340
was almost a mathematical idea.

01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:32.660
And they just basically bought into this idea

01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:35.180
and checked out their humanity at the door.

01:57:35.180 --> 01:57:38.740
So I would say that antidote to this type of thing

01:57:38.740 --> 01:57:41.060
is not necessarily even imagination

01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:42.380
in a kind of elevated sense

01:57:42.380 --> 01:57:44.660
that we have been discussing today

01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:49.260
that is exemplified by our greatest scientists

01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:51.300
and philosophers.

01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:57.140
But just basic humanity, basic common sense

01:57:57.780 --> 01:58:00.740
of just like knowing that it's just not right

01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:03.940
and I don't care what my ideology tells me,

01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:05.860
but I'm just not going to do it.

01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:10.220
So that I think is kind of missing a little bit

01:58:10.220 --> 01:58:11.380
into the society.

01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:14.460
People get a lot too caught up in ideology,

01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:16.620
in certain conceptual frameworks.

01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:19.980
So societies that lose that basic human compassion,

01:58:20.020 --> 01:58:22.580
that basic humanity around the trouble.

01:58:22.580 --> 01:58:23.420
Oh, very much so.

01:58:23.420 --> 01:58:25.260
But not only society, like a human being.

01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:27.740
And Eric is one of the people,

01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:30.620
I agree with you, keeps that flame of him.

01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:33.380
Like I trust that he will not do something

01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:37.260
that's not human, that's not right.

01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:39.380
I just feel that, you know, like there's some people

01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:42.580
you just kind of feel that they won't cross that line.

01:58:42.580 --> 01:58:45.500
And that's a huge thing today

01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:47.380
because I have to say, looking back,

01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:51.180
definitely I have not hurt people personally,

01:58:51.180 --> 01:58:52.980
but like I could be mean, for instance.

01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:55.980
I could be harsh.

01:58:55.980 --> 01:58:58.900
And now I see it as a sign of weakness,

01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:00.580
as a sign of insecurity.

01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:05.660
You know, I saw your interview with Ray Kurzweil

01:59:05.660 --> 01:59:07.060
the other day.

01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:09.100
Beautiful, I was really moved by it.

01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:11.860
But you know, at some point I was like,

01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:14.860
I looked at him at this sort of like Dr. Evil.

01:59:14.860 --> 01:59:17.820
I'm kind of ashamed of it now,

01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:20.700
but like, you know, I'm kind of coming clean.

01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:25.060
And I would, you know, because, well, why?

01:59:25.060 --> 01:59:28.380
Because I needed an adversary in my mind

01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:32.140
because I projected onto him kind of the fears that I had

01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:35.220
that AI will conquer us and so on.

01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:40.220
And this was rooted in my kind of awakening moment

01:59:40.380 --> 01:59:42.620
in a sense, a kind of a moment where I suddenly started

01:59:42.620 --> 01:59:44.300
to see the other side.

01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:47.460
But I wasn't sure yet, you see?

01:59:47.460 --> 01:59:48.300
You have to feel it.

01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:50.020
So I had to have a fight about it.

01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:52.380
Yeah, you had to actually have the projection.

01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:54.300
I had to, so it was not in,

01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:55.860
I believe that it was not in me already.

01:59:55.860 --> 01:59:57.820
So I had to throw it onto somebody.

01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:00.180
And that's not balanced yet.

02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:03.500
So balance is when you recognize that it's you actually.

02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:06.380
And I had this moment actually, it was so amazing.

02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:07.820
Like I would give this mean,

02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:09.820
I would talk about AI and the dangers

02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:13.380
and he would always be my like foil, you know?

02:00:13.900 --> 02:00:17.620
I would put like a sinister photograph of him on the slide.

02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:19.460
And I was like, look at this guy.

02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:22.300
He wants to put nanobots into your brain.

02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:27.020
And he's also like a top executive at Google and so on.

02:00:27.020 --> 02:00:28.980
So I would create this whole narrative.

02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:33.820
And then something happened where I was giving a lecture,

02:00:33.820 --> 02:00:38.620
this is 2015, in Aspen, Aspen Ideas Festival,

02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:41.220
which is a wonderful festival.

02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:43.140
So keynote speech actually.

02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:46.100
And I was doing my usual shtick.

02:00:46.100 --> 02:00:47.580
And then suddenly I said,

02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:52.220
I came up to that, there was a big screen

02:00:52.220 --> 02:00:53.820
and there was a picture of him there.

02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:54.820
And I came up to the screen

02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:56.300
and I kind of touched it with my hand.

02:00:56.300 --> 02:00:59.940
And I said, but I don't want to pick on Mr. Kuzma

02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:01.500
because he's me.

02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:03.620
I had this revelation

02:01:03.620 --> 02:01:06.620
that I'm actually fighting with myself, with my own fears.

02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:11.620
And then I learned about his,

02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:16.060
his father, that his father died when he was young.

02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:22.260
And that he is, in fact, he's very, to his credit,

02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:25.380
he's very sincere and upfront about it.

02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:27.860
Self-disclosure, I think it's very essential, by the way,

02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:30.580
all this discussion, like what really motivates you?

02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:33.620
He said it, he said it publicly many times,

02:01:33.620 --> 02:01:37.500
even as early as 2015, I could find this information,

02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:43.500
that he wanted to reunite with his father in the cloud.

02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:46.780
And suddenly I saw him not as a caricature

02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:50.780
that exemplified all my fears,

02:01:50.780 --> 02:01:53.220
but as a human being who,

02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:56.780
a child longing for his father, grieving for his father.

02:01:56.780 --> 02:01:59.540
So suddenly it became a story, a love story.

02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:05.860
And so that is, so in other words,

02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:08.180
I've seen it in myself,

02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:13.180
this capacity to project my own fears

02:02:15.300 --> 02:02:18.140
and then fight with other people over something

02:02:18.140 --> 02:02:20.460
that actually was my own.

02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:23.180
And as soon as I got to this point of seeing him,

02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:25.980
and then my next lecture, actually I talked about it,

02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:28.300
about him in this way.

02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:31.260
And I said, look, it's a love story.

02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:32.500
And he is actually,

02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:37.380
and it's not how I would want to reunite with my father.

02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:45.420
But like you said, if I am consistent,

02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:46.900
I have to allow the possibility

02:02:46.900 --> 02:02:51.620
that different people perceive things differently.

02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:55.900
And so for him, that's his imagination.

02:02:55.900 --> 02:02:58.020
So you know how, who is this?

02:02:58.020 --> 02:02:59.980
Voltaire, I think, is ascribed to Voltaire.

02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:01.140
It's like, I disagree with you,

02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:02.860
but I will fight to death

02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:04.700
for you to have the right to say it.

02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:08.540
So now that I feel like my position is more like,

02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:13.380
I disagree with him, that this is the way to approach death

02:03:13.380 --> 02:03:15.940
and to approach the death of our loved ones

02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:18.700
and how we miss them and how we,

02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:23.700
the sense of loneliness and inability to interact directly.

02:03:25.660 --> 02:03:28.100
That's not something that is nice with me,

02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:31.300
but I think it's also,

02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:33.940
it can also be called imagination from his perspective.

02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:36.860
And look, motivated by that,

02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:41.300
how much he has brought, how many interesting inventions,

02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:43.820
like his musical inventions, for instance,

02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:46.900
naturally because his father was a composer,

02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:49.780
a music composer and a conductor.

02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:53.580
So in other words, in the bigger scheme of things,

02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:55.220
even if I think he's misguided,

02:03:58.340 --> 02:04:03.420
still, I can't deny that it's a certain leap of faith,

02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:06.500
from his perspective, to try to say that this is the way

02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:08.740
we can all connect to our loved ones.

02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:11.740
And because it is sincere, and I see it now as sincere,

02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:13.060
and in fact, in your interview,

02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:14.980
you really teased it out to him,

02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:18.220
and I was really moved by it, I have to say.

02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:19.980
He has mellowed a little bit too, I said.

02:04:19.980 --> 02:04:23.100
You know, it was really, really sweet

02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:24.540
when he talked about his father.

02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:25.620
And I can relate, you know,

02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:27.220
my father died four years ago,

02:04:27.220 --> 02:04:30.620
and I can relate what a heartbreak,

02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:33.940
I was much older than Ray was when his father died,

02:04:33.940 --> 02:04:38.940
but I can relate to this longing and that grief, you know.

02:04:38.980 --> 02:04:42.420
And when somebody is sincere and he puts his,

02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:46.740
opens his cards and, you know,

02:04:46.740 --> 02:04:48.620
and says, this is why, that's why I want to do it,

02:04:48.620 --> 02:04:50.780
because I want to recreate my father,

02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:53.820
and I want to be able to talk to him this way.

02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:57.180
Then we have a serious, then we understand, you know,

02:04:57.180 --> 02:05:01.780
the opposite of it would be not disclosing

02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:07.780
and just pretending that this is how

02:05:08.260 --> 02:05:10.220
it's supposed to be, in scientific terms,

02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:13.540
so it was replacing your real emotion,

02:05:13.540 --> 02:05:14.900
but come from the heart,

02:05:14.900 --> 02:05:17.220
by some kind of a theory which comes from the mind.

02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:19.100
And this is where we can go astray,

02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:23.740
because then we become captives of frameworks

02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:25.460
and conceptual systems,

02:05:25.460 --> 02:05:28.460
which may not be beneficial to our society.

02:05:28.460 --> 02:05:30.180
In tough times, we need the people

02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:33.620
that have not lost their way in the ideologies.

02:05:33.620 --> 02:05:35.660
We need the people who are still in touch with their heart.

02:05:35.660 --> 02:05:38.620
And you mentioned this with Eric, it's certainly true.

02:05:38.620 --> 02:05:40.900
I disagree with him on a lot of stuff,

02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:44.020
but I feel like when the world is burning down,

02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:46.940
Eric is one of the people that you can still count on

02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:48.300
to have a heart.

02:05:48.300 --> 02:05:49.740
I've talked a lot over the past year

02:05:49.740 --> 02:05:51.420
about the war in Ukraine

02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:54.780
and the possibility of nuclear war,

02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:58.100
and it feels like he's one of the people I would call first

02:06:01.700 --> 02:06:05.420
if, God forbid, something like a nuclear war would begin,

02:06:05.420 --> 02:06:07.780
because you look for people with a heart,

02:06:07.780 --> 02:06:09.060
no matter their ideas.

02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:10.900
And that's right, it takes courage

02:06:10.900 --> 02:06:14.060
and it takes a certain self-awareness, I would say.

02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:16.100
And which brings me, you know,

02:06:16.100 --> 02:06:19.140
I think the crucial is that which was inscribed, you know,

02:06:19.140 --> 02:06:21.380
on the temple of Apollo in Delphi.

02:06:21.380 --> 02:06:23.820
There was a statement, know thyself, know yourself,

02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:25.380
you know, like who am I?

02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:28.860
Ultimately it goes down to this and all these debates.

02:06:28.860 --> 02:06:32.540
And the point is that I used to be, like I said,

02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:33.660
pessimistic at some point,

02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:38.180
and I was scared even of where development of AI was going.

02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:40.460
This is about 2014, 2015.

02:06:41.540 --> 02:06:44.020
And now I'm much more, so for instance,

02:06:44.020 --> 02:06:47.900
after I saw Ray Kurzweil as a human being,

02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:52.420
after I could relate to him and sympathize with him,

02:06:52.420 --> 02:06:55.660
suddenly I stopped seeing him in the news.

02:06:55.660 --> 02:06:58.180
Like before that, I would always see him in the news saying,

02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:00.100
we're going to put nanobots in your brain,

02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:02.260
da-da-da, by the year 2030, whatever, you know?

02:07:02.260 --> 02:07:04.340
And then we upload you by the 21st,

02:07:04.340 --> 02:07:07.700
and I would be like, no, you know, the story was terrible.

02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:09.940
Suddenly I didn't see him anymore.

02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:11.420
I had to, you know?

02:07:11.420 --> 02:07:15.020
So now it makes me question, who was creating the trouble?

02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:16.820
What was all within you?

02:07:16.820 --> 02:07:20.340
Was it him who was creating the trouble or was it my mind?

02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:21.180
You see?

02:07:21.180 --> 02:07:25.220
And so as I became self-aware,

02:07:25.220 --> 02:07:28.020
suddenly other possibilities opened

02:07:28.020 --> 02:07:29.860
and suddenly that conflict, which by the way,

02:07:29.860 --> 02:07:34.540
if I kept giving this nasty, you know, talks about him,

02:07:34.540 --> 02:07:37.300
one day I suppose we would have a debate.

02:07:37.300 --> 02:07:41.140
And so you have this, one person stays this and then that.

02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:44.820
And what I learned is that it's a never-ending conflict.

02:07:44.820 --> 02:07:46.740
This conflict just does not end.

02:07:47.900 --> 02:07:50.820
But there is an alternative, there is a better way,

02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:55.220
which is to realize that it is you arguing with yourself.

02:07:55.220 --> 02:07:57.900
Now, if you want to continue arguing with yourself,

02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:01.900
continue as long as you need.

02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:04.140
Just be careful not to destroy too many things,

02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:05.300
you know, in the process.

02:08:05.300 --> 02:08:08.220
But there is an option of actually dropping it,

02:08:08.220 --> 02:08:09.540
of actually dropping it.

02:08:09.540 --> 02:08:12.340
This is so, I was so surprised by this.

02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:14.340
Yeah, just discovering in yourself

02:08:14.340 --> 02:08:17.580
the capacity, the human capacity for compassion.

02:08:17.580 --> 02:08:20.620
And you understand that he has a perspective,

02:08:20.620 --> 02:08:22.860
he is operating in the space of imagination,

02:08:22.860 --> 02:08:24.340
a human being like you.

02:08:24.340 --> 02:08:25.780
And we're all in this kind of together

02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:26.620
trying to figure this out.

02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:28.060
But we're all missing both, ultimately.

02:08:28.060 --> 02:08:31.580
And also it's like, with realizing how much

02:08:31.580 --> 02:08:34.900
I have screwed up, you know, comes this humility also.

02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:37.220
So like, I find it extremely hard now

02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:39.380
to like really lash out at somebody

02:08:39.380 --> 02:08:41.540
and to say like, you're horrible, whatever.

02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:43.500
Because immediately the question is,

02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:46.300
who am I to criticize, you know?

02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:48.540
So is there another way to have a dialogue?

02:08:48.540 --> 02:08:51.180
Is there a way to, you know, speaking, you know,

02:08:51.180 --> 02:08:54.940
since we talked about the innocence of a child

02:08:54.940 --> 02:08:58.220
and how much it drives a discovery in science and so on,

02:08:58.220 --> 02:09:00.500
you know, I remember, I think I heard

02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:02.460
Adyashanti who gave this nice example.

02:09:02.460 --> 02:09:04.380
He's like, when you're a kid, you know,

02:09:04.380 --> 02:09:06.220
you go and you play with your friends

02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:07.660
and then you fight with another kid.

02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:09.460
And he was like, I hate you.

02:09:09.460 --> 02:09:10.540
I don't want to see you again.

02:09:10.540 --> 02:09:12.500
You just go home like after half an hour.

02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:13.580
Okay, what are you going to do?

02:09:13.580 --> 02:09:14.780
You want to play?

02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:17.940
So you come out, he's like, hey, you want to play?

02:09:17.940 --> 02:09:19.700
You don't talk about what happened.

02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:23.340
You don't rehash this, you know, just keep going.

02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:26.180
And sometimes I think we are on the verge

02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:31.180
maybe of learning that because I think that if we are,

02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:36.180
if we continue to push each of us, our set of ideas

02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:40.540
and like ideologies and like, you know,

02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:42.340
what matters to us and so on.

02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:44.260
Like, yeah, no, no, what matters to you,

02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:47.540
but like there are other ways to approach other people.

02:09:47.540 --> 02:09:50.020
There are other ways you can find point of contact.

02:09:51.180 --> 02:09:54.900
Speaking of which, mathematics, mathematical formulas

02:09:55.900 --> 02:09:58.460
are universal, represent universal knowledge.

02:09:58.460 --> 02:10:01.540
Two plus two is four, whether you vote for this guy

02:10:01.540 --> 02:10:03.540
or that guy in the election, you know,

02:10:03.540 --> 02:10:08.140
how about that as a point of contact of commonality,

02:10:08.140 --> 02:10:10.340
you know, and nobody can patent those formulas.

02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:11.500
Did you know that?

02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:13.580
And there is a Supreme Court decision

02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:15.580
that mathematical formulas cannot be patented.

02:10:15.580 --> 02:10:19.180
Like Einstein could not patent equal E equals MC squared.

02:10:19.180 --> 02:10:22.820
It doesn't belong to him because if the formula is correct,

02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:24.220
then it belongs to everyone.

02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:29.780
So what do you think of that all too tricky question?

02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:32.540
And if you want, I can deeply bias your answer

02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:35.140
by giving the list of four that Eric provided.

02:10:35.140 --> 02:10:36.380
Oh no, let me give mine.

02:10:36.380 --> 02:10:38.740
I cannot see, by the way, what you have, so.

02:10:38.740 --> 02:10:40.540
But I can guess some of them.

02:10:40.540 --> 02:10:43.140
So I'm going to try to do something different from him.

02:10:43.140 --> 02:10:44.900
So I already mentioned one,

02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:49.860
which is that you have one dimensional numerical system,

02:10:49.860 --> 02:10:50.860
which is real numbers.

02:10:50.860 --> 02:10:52.980
You have two dimensional, which is complex numbers.

02:10:52.980 --> 02:10:54.220
You have four dimensional,

02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:56.420
and it's probably connected to what he wrote

02:10:56.420 --> 02:10:59.140
because it has to do with some homotopic groups of spheres

02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:00.140
and stuff like that.

02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:04.580
Then, of course, one I love, okay.

02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:08.420
One plus two plus three plus four plus five

02:11:08.420 --> 02:11:09.620
plus six and so on.

02:11:11.740 --> 02:11:13.980
Does it make any sense, the sum?

02:11:13.980 --> 02:11:15.580
You probably heard about this one.

02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:18.020
It became very popular at some point.

02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:19.260
One plus two plus three.

02:11:19.260 --> 02:11:22.660
I did a video for Numberphile, the YouTube channel about it,

02:11:22.660 --> 02:11:23.660
maybe 10 years ago.

02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:25.900
So one plus two plus three plus four plus five

02:11:25.900 --> 02:11:30.740
ostensibly diverges, goes to infinity

02:11:30.740 --> 02:11:32.540
because you get a bigger and bigger number.

02:11:32.540 --> 02:11:35.740
And yet there is a way to make sense of it

02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:39.540
in which it comes up to minus one over 12.

02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:41.420
How fascinating.

02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:43.860
First of all, the answer is not even a positive number,

02:11:43.860 --> 02:11:44.900
and it's not an integer.

02:11:44.900 --> 02:11:45.740
It's not a whole number.

02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:47.220
It's minus one over 12.

02:11:47.220 --> 02:11:49.980
So sometimes people ask me, what is your favorite number?

02:11:49.980 --> 02:11:51.060
And it's kind of a joke.

02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:52.420
I say minus one over 12.

02:11:53.700 --> 02:11:54.540
It's actually 42.

02:11:56.900 --> 02:11:59.220
So your favorite number is not an ordered set.

02:12:00.740 --> 02:12:01.580
Right.

02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:02.420
So what else?

02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:03.260
What else?

02:12:03.260 --> 02:12:04.380
Playgrounds program, of course.

02:12:04.380 --> 02:12:05.660
I have to mention that.

02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:07.220
And we'll explore that in depth.

02:12:07.220 --> 02:12:09.380
Do you want to know what Eric said?

02:12:09.380 --> 02:12:10.380
Sure.

02:12:10.380 --> 02:12:15.380
Sphere version, boys surface, hop vibration.

02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:16.900
Hop vibration, okay.

02:12:16.900 --> 02:12:21.060
And pi one of S03.

02:12:21.060 --> 02:12:22.060
Okay, oh yes.

02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:25.140
So that's the famous cup trick, you know?

02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:27.020
Okay, look, so this is how it works.

02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:29.380
No tricks.

02:12:29.380 --> 02:12:30.220
No tricks.

02:12:30.220 --> 02:12:31.060
No magic.

02:12:31.060 --> 02:12:35.460
It is magical, okay, but not because I'm tricking you.

02:12:35.460 --> 02:12:39.060
So you start with a bottle like this or a cup,

02:12:40.020 --> 02:12:40.860
and you start twisting it.

02:12:40.860 --> 02:12:44.180
And at the same time, you twist your arm.

02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:45.020
Then you come.

02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:49.740
So this is actually going to rotate at 360 degrees,

02:12:49.740 --> 02:12:50.580
the full turn.

02:12:50.580 --> 02:12:53.820
Then you say, okay, I won't be able to do another turn

02:12:53.820 --> 02:12:55.700
because then my arm would really get twisted.

02:12:55.700 --> 02:12:57.180
I'll have to go see a doctor.

02:12:57.180 --> 02:13:00.300
Yet, if I do it second time, it untwists.

02:13:02.060 --> 02:13:06.300
This is the pi one of S03, Eric is talking about.

02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:10.220
So there is something where the first motion is not trivial,

02:13:10.220 --> 02:13:12.420
but if you double down on it,

02:13:12.420 --> 02:13:15.060
you come back to the initial position.

02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:16.780
It's very closely connected to the fact

02:13:16.780 --> 02:13:18.860
that we have elementary particles of two types,

02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:20.060
bosons and fermions.

02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:23.940
So bosons are, for example, photons

02:13:23.940 --> 02:13:26.700
or carriers of other forces or the Higgs boson.

02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:29.620
It is called a boson for a reason because it is a boson.

02:13:30.580 --> 02:13:35.580
In honor of Indian mathematician Bose, B-O-S-E and Einstein.

02:13:36.020 --> 02:13:38.220
So these particles obey what's called

02:13:38.220 --> 02:13:40.300
Bose-Einstein statistics.

02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:43.020
But then there are other particles called fermions

02:13:44.020 --> 02:13:47.940
in honor of Enrico Fermi, Italian born mathematician

02:13:47.980 --> 02:13:49.460
who worked in the U.S.

02:13:50.380 --> 02:13:54.580
And they follow what's called Dirac Fermi statistics.

02:13:54.580 --> 02:13:57.820
And those are electrons and constituents of matter,

02:13:57.820 --> 02:14:00.420
electrons, protons, neutrons and so on.

02:14:00.420 --> 02:14:04.420
And they have a certain duplicity, if you will.

02:14:04.420 --> 02:14:06.700
And that duplicity is rooted mathematically

02:14:06.700 --> 02:14:09.060
in this experiment, this little experiment

02:14:09.060 --> 02:14:10.180
that I have just done.

02:14:11.620 --> 02:14:14.340
So I can imagine, speaking of imagination, okay?

02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:16.260
So I'm just kind of riffing on this.

02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:20.900
Imagine a world in which this will not be shocking or like,

02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:21.980
in this case, it's not even shocking

02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:24.380
because I haven't really explained the details

02:14:24.380 --> 02:14:26.420
because I can't do it in two minutes.

02:14:26.420 --> 02:14:31.300
I indicated what this is all about and so on.

02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:34.460
But imagine a world in which this is not foreign

02:14:34.460 --> 02:14:36.860
to most people, that most people have seen it before.

02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:40.180
They're not afraid to approach this type of questions

02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:44.220
because we talked a little bit about mass education,

02:14:44.220 --> 02:14:47.060
but I really believe that a lot of people in our society,

02:14:47.060 --> 02:14:49.780
and it is not only in the United States,

02:14:49.780 --> 02:14:51.300
but throughout the world,

02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:53.820
a lot of people have been traumatized.

02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:55.660
It's really PTSD.

02:14:55.660 --> 02:14:57.860
That's why people, when they see mass microformula

02:14:57.860 --> 02:15:01.940
or like, even like, they need to calculate tip on the bill.

02:15:01.940 --> 02:15:03.460
They just, they're terrified

02:15:03.460 --> 02:15:07.580
because it brings up those memories when they were kids

02:15:07.580 --> 02:15:12.580
and being called to blackboard and solve a problem.

02:15:13.420 --> 02:15:14.340
You can't solve a problem.

02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:16.460
An unscrupulous teacher says, you're an idiot.

02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:20.980
Sit down and you feel ashamed and lowly

02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:22.620
and that stays with you.

02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:25.380
And so I think that, unfortunately, that's where we are,

02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:27.180
but one can dream.

02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:29.380
And so my dream is that one day

02:15:29.380 --> 02:15:31.460
we'll be able to overcome this.

02:15:31.460 --> 02:15:34.540
And actually, all of these treasures of mathematics

02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:37.980
will become widely available

02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:40.340
or at least people will know where to find them

02:15:40.340 --> 02:15:43.100
and they will not be afraid of going there and looking.

02:15:43.100 --> 02:15:44.780
And I think this will help because like I said,

02:15:44.780 --> 02:15:47.980
for one thing, it gives you a sense of belonging.

02:15:47.980 --> 02:15:51.100
It gives you, it kind of is an antidote

02:15:51.100 --> 02:15:53.580
to the kind of alienation and separation

02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:55.340
that we feel today, oftentimes,

02:15:55.340 --> 02:15:57.740
because of ideological divide,

02:15:57.740 --> 02:16:00.020
sectarian strife and all kinds of things like that.

02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:01.940
Because then you will, once you see,

02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:05.300
there's like a critical mass of this beauty

02:16:05.300 --> 02:16:07.780
that kind of like dawns on you, is like, my God,

02:16:07.780 --> 02:16:09.540
this is what we all have in common.

02:16:11.340 --> 02:16:14.980
You mentioned Langlands program.

02:16:14.980 --> 02:16:16.140
We have to talk about it.

02:16:16.140 --> 02:16:16.980
Sure.

02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:18.540
At the core of your book and your work

02:16:18.540 --> 02:16:19.820
is the Langlands program.

02:16:19.820 --> 02:16:21.380
Can you describe what it is?

02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:23.940
Sure.

02:16:23.940 --> 02:16:28.220
So Langlands is a mathematician.

02:16:28.220 --> 02:16:31.020
It's a name of a mathematician, Robert Langlands.

02:16:32.780 --> 02:16:35.140
Canadian born, still alive.

02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:37.900
He was a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study

02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:40.900
that we talked about where Einstein and Gödel

02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:43.300
and other great scientists have worked.

02:16:44.340 --> 02:16:47.460
In fact, he used to occupy the office of Albert Einstein

02:16:47.460 --> 02:16:50.060
at the Institute for Advanced Study.

02:16:50.060 --> 02:16:55.060
So he, in the late sixties,

02:16:56.300 --> 02:16:58.500
he came up with a set of ideas

02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:01.260
which captivated a lot of mathematicians,

02:17:01.260 --> 02:17:04.260
several generations of mathematicians by now,

02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:07.500
which came to be known as the Langlands program.

02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:10.380
And what it is about is connecting different fields

02:17:10.380 --> 02:17:13.780
of mathematics, which seem to be far away from each other.

02:17:13.780 --> 02:17:18.020
For example, number theory, which as the name suggests,

02:17:18.020 --> 02:17:23.020
deals with numbers and various equations with,

02:17:23.620 --> 02:17:25.660
like X squared plus Y squared equals one.

02:17:27.820 --> 02:17:31.700
And on the other side, harmonic analysis,

02:17:33.420 --> 02:17:37.060
something that any music lover can appreciate

02:17:37.580 --> 02:17:40.860
because the sound of a symphony can be kind of decomposed

02:17:40.860 --> 02:17:42.420
into sounds of different instruments.

02:17:42.420 --> 02:17:45.260
And each of those sounds can be represented by a wave

02:17:45.260 --> 02:17:47.620
like this, like a sine function.

02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:49.020
Those are the harmonics.

02:17:49.020 --> 02:17:52.820
They are still, the periods of a harmonic periods

02:17:52.820 --> 02:17:54.220
of different notes are different.

02:17:54.220 --> 02:17:56.580
They correspond to different notes and different instruments,

02:17:56.580 --> 02:17:58.820
different semitones, if you will.

02:17:58.820 --> 02:18:03.060
But they all combine together into something special,

02:18:03.380 --> 02:18:07.180
which cannot be reduced to any one of those.

02:18:07.180 --> 02:18:08.980
So mathematically, it's the idea

02:18:08.980 --> 02:18:13.980
that you can decompose a signal into as a collection,

02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:18.420
as a simultaneous oscillation of several elementary signals.

02:18:19.300 --> 02:18:21.060
That's called harmonic analysis.

02:18:21.980 --> 02:18:24.380
So what Langlands found is that some really difficult

02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:27.780
questions in number theory can be translated

02:18:27.780 --> 02:18:31.740
into much more easily tractable questions

02:18:31.740 --> 02:18:32.740
in harmonic analysis.

02:18:32.740 --> 02:18:35.060
That was his initial idea.

02:18:35.060 --> 02:18:38.740
But what happened next surprised everybody

02:18:38.740 --> 02:18:41.060
that the kind of patterns that he was able to observe,

02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:43.020
the kind of regularities that he was able to observe,

02:18:43.020 --> 02:18:44.820
which were quite surprising,

02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:47.780
were subsequently found in other areas of mathematics.

02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:53.020
For example, in geometry and eventually in quantum physics.

02:18:53.020 --> 02:18:57.580
So in fact, Ed Whitten, who is a kind of a dean

02:18:57.580 --> 02:18:59.620
of modern theoretical physicists,

02:18:59.620 --> 02:19:02.540
professor at the Institute for Advanced Study as well,

02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:03.900
got interested in this subject.

02:19:03.900 --> 02:19:06.020
I described in my book how it happened.

02:19:07.340 --> 02:19:11.900
And he was instrumental in bridging the gap

02:19:11.900 --> 02:19:16.180
between these patterns found in physics and in geometry,

02:19:16.180 --> 02:19:21.180
finding kind of a superstratum, if you will,

02:19:22.580 --> 02:19:24.620
or kind of a way to connect these two things,

02:19:24.620 --> 02:19:26.660
kind of a bridge between these two fields.

02:19:26.660 --> 02:19:30.260
So subsequently, I collaborate with Whitten on this.

02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:33.180
This has been one of the major themes of my research.

02:19:35.980 --> 02:19:39.980
I always found it interesting to connect things,

02:19:39.980 --> 02:19:41.140
to unite things.

02:19:42.940 --> 02:19:46.980
When I was younger, I couldn't understand why,

02:19:46.980 --> 02:19:48.660
but I was always interested in,

02:19:50.940 --> 02:19:53.540
not in working in specific field,

02:19:53.540 --> 02:19:55.780
but kind of cutting across fields.

02:19:56.620 --> 02:20:01.620
And then I would discover that, for instance,

02:20:01.940 --> 02:20:04.500
I took some people who know what happens in this field,

02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:09.020
but don't know what happens in their field, or conversely.

02:20:09.020 --> 02:20:14.020
And then I would find it imperative to go out

02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:17.820
and explain to them, to the different sides,

02:20:17.820 --> 02:20:19.580
what this is all about,

02:20:19.580 --> 02:20:22.660
so that more people are aware of these hidden structures,

02:20:22.660 --> 02:20:25.100
of these hidden parallels, if you will.

02:20:25.900 --> 02:20:28.860
So that has been sort of a theme in my research.

02:20:28.860 --> 02:20:32.700
And so I guess now I kind of understand more why

02:20:32.700 --> 02:20:37.180
it's kind of a balance, like what we talked about earlier.

02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:40.900
So can you elucidate a little bit how,

02:20:40.900 --> 02:20:43.140
what are the mathematical tools that allow you

02:20:43.140 --> 02:20:47.900
to connect these different continents of mathematics?

02:20:49.340 --> 02:20:51.660
Is there something you can convert into words

02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:53.820
that Langlands was able to find,

02:20:53.820 --> 02:20:55.780
and you were able to explore further?

02:20:56.700 --> 02:21:00.220
I would say what it suggests is that there is some

02:21:00.220 --> 02:21:02.820
hidden principles, which we still don't understand.

02:21:02.820 --> 02:21:06.260
My view is that we still don't know why,

02:21:06.260 --> 02:21:09.380
that we can prove some instances of this

02:21:10.940 --> 02:21:12.940
correspondences and connections,

02:21:14.020 --> 02:21:16.900
but we still don't know the real underlying reasons,

02:21:16.900 --> 02:21:19.340
which means that there is a certain layer

02:21:20.540 --> 02:21:22.820
beneath the surface that we see now.

02:21:24.100 --> 02:21:27.140
It is like, so the way I see it now is like this,

02:21:27.140 --> 02:21:30.580
that there is something three-dimensional, like this bottle,

02:21:30.580 --> 02:21:33.260
but what we are seeing is this projection onto the table

02:21:33.260 --> 02:21:34.580
and the projection onto a wall,

02:21:34.580 --> 02:21:37.420
and then we can map things from one projection to another,

02:21:37.420 --> 02:21:39.900
and you say, oh my God, that's incredible.

02:21:39.900 --> 02:21:42.140
But the real explanation is that both of them

02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:43.820
are projections of the same thing,

02:21:43.820 --> 02:21:45.500
and that we haven't found yet.

02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:46.540
But that's what I want to find,

02:21:46.540 --> 02:21:48.900
so that's what motivates me, I would say.

02:21:50.180 --> 02:21:53.420
From number theory to geometry to quantum physics.

02:21:53.460 --> 02:21:56.660
So there is this one thing which has different projections,

02:21:56.660 --> 02:21:59.020
except it's not just the table and the wall,

02:21:59.020 --> 02:22:02.780
but there are like many different walls, if you will.

02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:05.540
So what is the philosophical implication

02:22:05.540 --> 02:22:08.340
that there is commonalities like that

02:22:08.340 --> 02:22:11.100
across these very disparate fields?

02:22:11.100 --> 02:22:13.060
It means that what we believe

02:22:13.060 --> 02:22:17.220
are the fundamental elements of mathematics

02:22:17.220 --> 02:22:19.580
are not fundamental, there is something beyond.

02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:21.700
It's like we previously thought

02:22:21.740 --> 02:22:24.540
that atoms were indivisible.

02:22:24.540 --> 02:22:27.380
Then we found out that there is nucleus and electrons,

02:22:27.380 --> 02:22:29.700
and the nucleus consists of protons and neutrons.

02:22:29.700 --> 02:22:31.580
Then we thought, okay, protons and neutrons

02:22:31.580 --> 02:22:33.260
must be elementary.

02:22:33.260 --> 02:22:35.860
Now we know they consist of quarks.

02:22:35.860 --> 02:22:39.100
So it's about kind of finding the quarks of mathematics.

02:22:39.100 --> 02:22:42.740
And of course, beyond that, there's maybe even more.

02:22:42.740 --> 02:22:44.220
Which was my initial motivation

02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:47.260
to study mathematics, by the way, right?

02:22:47.260 --> 02:22:49.220
Quarks was the first time you fell in love

02:22:49.220 --> 02:22:50.860
with understanding the nature of reality.

02:22:50.860 --> 02:22:52.180
Yeah.

02:22:52.180 --> 02:22:54.100
What was it like working with Ed Whitten,

02:22:54.100 --> 02:22:59.100
who many people say is one of the smartest humans in history,

02:23:01.300 --> 02:23:05.180
or at least mathematical physicists in history?

02:23:05.180 --> 02:23:07.340
Yes, fascinating.

02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:08.620
I enjoyed it very much.

02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:11.700
I also felt that I have to keep up, you know?

02:23:11.700 --> 02:23:16.300
And so we wrote this long paper in 2007,

02:23:16.300 --> 02:23:19.220
and we collaborated for about a year.

02:23:19.220 --> 02:23:22.180
I have known him before, and we talked before,

02:23:22.180 --> 02:23:24.700
and I've seen him since, and we talked.

02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:27.260
But it's very different to just meet somebody

02:23:27.260 --> 02:23:29.100
at conferences and have a conversation,

02:23:30.780 --> 02:23:33.540
as opposed to actually working on a project together.

02:23:34.580 --> 02:23:38.300
So he's very, very, very serious, very focused.

02:23:38.300 --> 02:23:40.500
This is one thing which I have to say.

02:23:40.500 --> 02:23:42.660
I was really struck by this.

02:23:42.660 --> 02:23:47.100
Why is he considered to be such a powerful intellect

02:23:47.140 --> 02:23:49.820
by many other powerful intellects?

02:23:51.740 --> 02:23:56.260
He has had this unique vision of the subject.

02:23:56.260 --> 02:23:59.300
He was able to connect different things,

02:24:00.700 --> 02:24:03.420
especially find connections

02:24:03.420 --> 02:24:05.780
between quantum physics and mathematics,

02:24:06.940 --> 02:24:08.140
almost unparalleled.

02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:11.020
I don't think anyone comes close in some sense

02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:16.020
in the last 50 years to him in terms of finding,

02:24:16.260 --> 02:24:18.860
just consistently, time after time,

02:24:18.860 --> 02:24:20.340
breaking ground, new ground, new ground.

02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:25.100
So he would basically, one way one could describe it

02:24:25.100 --> 02:24:28.660
is he would take some idea in physics

02:24:30.140 --> 02:24:35.140
and then find an interpretation of it in mathematics

02:24:35.940 --> 02:24:40.300
and then say, distill it, present it in mathematical terms,

02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:43.580
and tell mathematicians, this should be like that, you know?

02:24:44.540 --> 02:24:47.660
One plus two plus three plus four is minus one over 12.

02:24:47.660 --> 02:24:50.020
And mathematicians would be like, no way.

02:24:52.020 --> 02:24:54.300
And then it would pan out,

02:24:54.300 --> 02:24:56.580
and mathematicians would then,

02:24:56.580 --> 02:24:58.460
a whole industry would be created

02:24:58.460 --> 02:25:02.180
of groups of mathematicians trying to prove his conjectures

02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:06.620
and his ideas, and he would always be proven right.

02:25:06.620 --> 02:25:09.420
So in other words, being able to glean

02:25:09.420 --> 02:25:13.460
some mathematical truths from physical theories.

02:25:13.460 --> 02:25:14.620
That's one side.

02:25:14.620 --> 02:25:16.780
On the other hand, conversely,

02:25:16.780 --> 02:25:18.940
applying sophisticated mathematics.

02:25:18.940 --> 02:25:23.700
He's probably the physicist who kind of

02:25:23.700 --> 02:25:25.580
could learn mathematics the fastest.

02:25:25.580 --> 02:25:27.420
I don't think.

02:25:27.420 --> 02:25:30.740
Some younger physicists maybe could come close,

02:25:30.740 --> 02:25:33.620
but it's still quite, for them, a long way to go

02:25:33.620 --> 02:25:37.820
to get, you know, to be comparable to Whitten.

02:25:37.820 --> 02:25:40.700
To take some of the most sophisticated mathematics

02:25:41.580 --> 02:25:44.580
and not learn it to the point where

02:25:44.580 --> 02:25:47.180
it becomes a practitioner of the subject practically.

02:25:48.180 --> 02:25:51.940
And then use it to gain some new insights

02:25:51.940 --> 02:25:53.700
on the physics side.

02:25:53.700 --> 02:25:56.100
Now, of course, the thing is that

02:25:56.100 --> 02:25:58.740
the theories that physics, one could say,

02:25:58.740 --> 02:26:00.580
is in a sort of a crisis in some sense

02:26:00.580 --> 02:26:05.580
because of a current gap between the sophisticated theories

02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:11.020
which came from applying sophisticated mathematics

02:26:11.020 --> 02:26:13.300
and the actual universe.

02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:14.820
So we have theories, for instance,

02:26:14.820 --> 02:26:17.380
which describe 10-dimensional worlds,

02:26:17.380 --> 02:26:21.020
10-dimensional space-time coming from string theory

02:26:21.020 --> 02:26:22.580
and things like that.

02:26:22.580 --> 02:26:25.660
But we don't know yet how to apply it

02:26:25.660 --> 02:26:27.940
to understanding our universe.

02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:30.460
A lot of progress has been made,

02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:34.620
but it's kind of at a kind of an impasse right now.

02:26:34.620 --> 02:26:38.660
And at the same time, our most realistic theories,

02:26:38.660 --> 02:26:41.340
most advanced theories of the four-dimensional universe

02:26:42.460 --> 02:26:44.860
are in contradiction with each other.

02:26:44.860 --> 02:26:48.620
The standard model describing the three known forces

02:26:48.620 --> 02:26:52.500
of nature, the electromagnetic, strong and weak,

02:26:52.500 --> 02:26:54.100
it was great accuracy.

02:26:54.100 --> 02:26:57.100
And Einstein's relativity, which describes the fourth,

02:26:57.100 --> 02:26:58.460
called gravity.

02:26:58.460 --> 02:27:03.460
Everybody above a certain age knows that one.

02:27:04.740 --> 02:27:05.580
Yeah.

02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:09.500
So these two theories are in contradiction at the moment.

02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:11.540
And string theory was one of the,

02:27:11.540 --> 02:27:12.980
the promise of string theory was that

02:27:12.980 --> 02:27:14.860
it would unify those two.

02:27:14.860 --> 02:27:17.660
And so far it has not happened.

02:27:17.660 --> 02:27:20.620
So we are kind of at a very interesting place right now.

02:27:20.620 --> 02:27:24.740
And I think that new ideas perhaps are needed.

02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:28.300
And I wouldn't be surprised if Witten is one of those people

02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:29.860
who come up with those ideas.

02:27:29.860 --> 02:27:33.420
Well, he has been one of the people

02:27:33.420 --> 02:27:36.540
that added a lot of ideas under the flag of string theory.

02:27:37.980 --> 02:27:40.060
What do you think about this theory?

02:27:40.060 --> 02:27:42.020
What do you think is beautiful about it?

02:27:42.020 --> 02:27:42.860
String theory.

02:27:44.700 --> 02:27:47.540
Well, first of all, kind of remember,

02:27:47.540 --> 02:27:52.540
we talked about Pythagoreans and how for Pythagoreans,

02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:54.620
the whole world was this symphony

02:27:54.620 --> 02:27:57.900
where you have these different vibrations of all the humans.

02:27:57.900 --> 02:27:59.340
Every human is a vibration.

02:27:59.340 --> 02:28:02.900
Every animal, every being, every tree

02:28:02.900 --> 02:28:05.420
and every celestial body and so on.

02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:06.940
So string theory is kind of like that

02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:09.420
because in string theory there is this fundamental object

02:28:09.420 --> 02:28:10.820
which is a vibrating string.

02:28:12.260 --> 02:28:15.180
And all particles are in a sense supposed

02:28:15.180 --> 02:28:18.820
to be different modulations or vibrations of that string.

02:28:18.820 --> 02:28:20.820
So that by itself is already interesting

02:28:20.820 --> 02:28:25.340
that you kind of describe this diversity

02:28:25.340 --> 02:28:27.900
of various particles and interactions between them

02:28:27.900 --> 02:28:30.660
using one guiding principle in some sense.

02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:34.100
But also just the mathematical things that come out of it.

02:28:36.300 --> 02:28:39.260
It looks impossible to satisfy various constraints

02:28:39.260 --> 02:28:42.300
and then there is sort of like a unique way to do it.

02:28:42.300 --> 02:28:45.860
So that's sort of the, every time that happens

02:28:45.860 --> 02:28:50.020
when you have some system, like overdetermined system.

02:28:50.020 --> 02:28:54.260
Let's suppose you have to do like five interviews

02:28:54.260 --> 02:28:56.980
in one day and you wake up in the morning

02:28:56.980 --> 02:28:59.940
and you're like, that's impossible.

02:28:59.940 --> 02:29:02.180
Because then so many things have to align.

02:29:02.180 --> 02:29:03.460
For instance, let's suppose you have to go

02:29:03.460 --> 02:29:04.860
from one place to another.

02:29:04.860 --> 02:29:06.900
So then you have a commute and then who knows

02:29:06.900 --> 02:29:09.340
maybe there is a traffic jam and stuff like that.

02:29:09.340 --> 02:29:12.620
And now suppose that it all works seamlessly

02:29:12.620 --> 02:29:14.260
and there were like a bunch of places

02:29:14.260 --> 02:29:18.500
where it could have gone hopelessly wrong and it didn't.

02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:22.060
And then in the evening you're like, wow, it worked.

02:29:22.060 --> 02:29:23.620
That's beautiful, right?

02:29:23.620 --> 02:29:27.540
That's kind of like great luck in a way we would say.

02:29:27.580 --> 02:29:30.860
But in science this happens sometimes

02:29:30.860 --> 02:29:33.380
that you have this theory which not supposed to work

02:29:33.380 --> 02:29:35.460
because there are so many seemingly

02:29:35.460 --> 02:29:37.380
contradictory demands on it.

02:29:37.380 --> 02:29:41.180
And yet there is a sweet spot where they balance each other.

02:29:41.180 --> 02:29:43.700
So string theory is kind of like this.

02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:47.140
The unfortunate aspect of it is that it balances itself

02:29:47.140 --> 02:29:48.980
in 10 dimensions and not in four.

02:29:50.020 --> 02:29:52.820
So maybe there is another universe somewhere.

02:29:53.580 --> 02:29:58.060
But see, as a mathematician, for me,

02:29:58.060 --> 02:29:59.860
all spaces are created equal.

02:29:59.860 --> 02:30:00.780
Yeah.

02:30:00.780 --> 02:30:02.300
10 dimensional, four dimensional.

02:30:02.300 --> 02:30:04.100
So mathematicians love string theory

02:30:04.100 --> 02:30:07.380
because it has given us so much food for thought.

02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:13.300
But do you think it's a correct or a incorrect theory

02:30:15.660 --> 02:30:17.940
for understanding this reality?

02:30:17.940 --> 02:30:20.460
So it might be a theory that explains

02:30:20.460 --> 02:30:23.100
some 10th dimensional reality in some other universe,

02:30:23.100 --> 02:30:26.220
but is it potentially, what do you think are the odds?

02:30:26.220 --> 02:30:28.980
Again, financial advice, if you were to bet.

02:30:28.980 --> 02:30:33.460
What do you think are the odds that it gets us closer

02:30:33.460 --> 02:30:35.780
to understanding this reality?

02:30:35.780 --> 02:30:39.740
Well, in the form that it is now, that seems unlikely.

02:30:39.740 --> 02:30:42.220
But it could well be that based on these ideas

02:30:42.220 --> 02:30:45.180
with some modifications, with some essential new elements,

02:30:46.540 --> 02:30:47.700
it could work out.

02:30:47.700 --> 02:30:50.220
So I would say right now it doesn't look so good.

02:30:50.820 --> 02:30:53.900
From the point of view that we, from what we know.

02:30:55.020 --> 02:30:57.100
But maybe somebody will come and introduce

02:30:57.100 --> 02:30:59.460
like square root of negative one.

02:30:59.460 --> 02:31:00.540
I mean, they already introduced,

02:31:00.540 --> 02:31:02.740
but I mean kind of like as a metaphor.

02:31:02.740 --> 02:31:06.580
Maybe somebody will come and say, what if we do this?

02:31:06.580 --> 02:31:08.340
It looks crazy.

02:31:08.340 --> 02:31:11.540
Speaking of Niels Bohr, he had this famous quote

02:31:11.540 --> 02:31:12.900
that he said to somebody,

02:31:14.020 --> 02:31:16.660
there is no doubt that your theory is crazy.

02:31:16.660 --> 02:31:19.100
The question is whether it's crazy enough

02:31:20.020 --> 02:31:21.620
to describe reality.

02:31:21.620 --> 02:31:23.580
So that's where we are kind of.

02:31:23.580 --> 02:31:26.380
Speaking of crazy and crazy enough,

02:31:26.380 --> 02:31:31.380
let me ask for therapy, for advice, for wisdom

02:31:34.420 --> 02:31:36.900
in returning to Eric Weinstein

02:31:36.900 --> 02:31:39.620
and maybe give some guidance to understanding

02:31:41.140 --> 02:31:45.380
his view on his attempt at theory of everything

02:31:45.380 --> 02:31:47.180
they call geometric unity,

02:31:47.180 --> 02:31:49.980
that he told me that you may have some inkling

02:31:49.980 --> 02:31:52.260
of an understanding of.

02:31:52.260 --> 02:31:54.740
If you were to describe this theory

02:31:54.740 --> 02:31:56.420
to aliens that visited earth,

02:31:59.660 --> 02:32:00.500
how would you do it?

02:32:00.500 --> 02:32:04.300
Or you could try if it was just me visiting earth,

02:32:05.220 --> 02:32:08.340
how would you describe your best understanding of it?

02:32:08.340 --> 02:32:10.900
He shared with me some of it

02:32:10.900 --> 02:32:13.900
when I was in New York at Columbia, like 11 years ago.

02:32:13.900 --> 02:32:16.340
We actually spent a lot of time where he explained to me

02:32:16.340 --> 02:32:17.580
and I found it beautiful.

02:32:18.980 --> 02:32:23.500
He has a very original idea at the core of it

02:32:23.500 --> 02:32:25.420
where you have this instead of four dimensional,

02:32:25.420 --> 02:32:29.100
instead of 10 dimensional, he has 14 dimensional space.

02:32:29.100 --> 02:32:32.260
And I thought it was really original.

02:32:32.260 --> 02:32:35.700
And this is exactly goes to the point I made earlier

02:32:35.700 --> 02:32:36.980
that we need new ideas.

02:32:37.980 --> 02:32:40.900
I feel that without some fundamental new idea,

02:32:40.900 --> 02:32:43.500
we won't be able to get closer

02:32:43.500 --> 02:32:45.980
to understanding our universe.

02:32:46.460 --> 02:32:47.940
I have a problem with the whole idea

02:32:47.940 --> 02:32:49.140
of theory of everything.

02:32:50.380 --> 02:32:51.980
I don't believe that one exists

02:32:51.980 --> 02:32:56.980
nor that we should aim to construct one.

02:32:58.460 --> 02:33:02.260
And I think it's really not to offend anybody,

02:33:02.260 --> 02:33:05.900
but it's ultimately a fault of education system

02:33:05.900 --> 02:33:07.500
of physicists.

02:33:07.500 --> 02:33:10.780
Like in mathematics, we're not brought up,

02:33:10.780 --> 02:33:12.420
we're not educated as mathematicians

02:33:12.420 --> 02:33:15.580
with the idea that one day we will come up

02:33:16.100 --> 02:33:16.940
with the theory of everything.

02:33:16.940 --> 02:33:20.140
Even though as a joke, I said that Langland's program

02:33:20.140 --> 02:33:22.180
is mathematical theory of everything,

02:33:23.140 --> 02:33:25.460
but I made it kind of a tongue in cheek.

02:33:25.460 --> 02:33:28.260
But isn't it a little bit kind of that?

02:33:28.260 --> 02:33:29.820
It's not really because first of all,

02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:32.060
it doesn't cover all fields of mathematics

02:33:32.060 --> 02:33:33.980
and it covers specific phenomena.

02:33:33.980 --> 02:33:37.180
But isn't it spiritually striving

02:33:37.180 --> 02:33:39.300
towards the same platonic form

02:33:39.300 --> 02:33:41.340
of a theory of everything?

02:33:41.340 --> 02:33:43.140
Like connecting, connecting fields.

02:33:43.140 --> 02:33:45.540
But connecting doesn't mean that it covers everything.

02:33:46.540 --> 02:33:47.380
So you could connect two things

02:33:47.380 --> 02:33:49.740
and then you have infinitely many other things

02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:53.220
which are outside of the purview of this connection.

02:33:53.220 --> 02:33:56.580
That's how it is in mathematics, I feel.

02:33:56.580 --> 02:33:58.980
And I would venture to say

02:33:58.980 --> 02:34:01.660
that most mathematicians look at it this way.

02:34:01.660 --> 02:34:03.140
Like there is no idea that somehow,

02:34:03.140 --> 02:34:04.420
I think it's actually impossible

02:34:04.420 --> 02:34:06.420
because we're not talking about such a thing

02:34:06.420 --> 02:34:07.740
as like one universe.

02:34:07.740 --> 02:34:09.340
We're talking about all possible universes

02:34:09.340 --> 02:34:10.660
of all possible dimensions and so on.

02:34:10.660 --> 02:34:13.820
It is just not feasible to have a unified,

02:34:13.820 --> 02:34:15.900
unify everything in one equation.

02:34:17.300 --> 02:34:19.380
Now, physicists, on the other hand,

02:34:19.380 --> 02:34:23.060
have been brought up, educated for decades with this idea.

02:34:23.060 --> 02:34:26.140
And to me, and I'm not sure I should say that,

02:34:26.140 --> 02:34:29.540
but I feel like it's kind of an ultimate ego trip.

02:34:29.540 --> 02:34:32.260
So that I have come up with the unified,

02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:33.980
I have found the unified theory of everything.

02:34:33.980 --> 02:34:36.540
It's me and my name will be on it.

02:34:36.540 --> 02:34:40.580
I think a lot of physicists get educated this way,

02:34:40.580 --> 02:34:43.020
especially men take it seriously.

02:34:43.060 --> 02:34:44.300
And I've seen that happen

02:34:44.300 --> 02:34:46.180
and I think it is counterproductive.

02:34:46.180 --> 02:34:48.100
I think that a lot of people agree

02:34:48.100 --> 02:34:49.940
that this debate is kind of,

02:34:49.940 --> 02:34:51.300
I feel like it's kind of settled.

02:34:51.300 --> 02:34:53.820
I think I hear it less and less,

02:34:53.820 --> 02:34:57.260
but I disagree with the whole premise.

02:34:57.260 --> 02:35:00.140
So you, it's interesting

02:35:00.140 --> 02:35:02.540
because both are interesting points you made,

02:35:02.540 --> 02:35:05.020
which is you don't think a theory of everything exists

02:35:05.020 --> 02:35:08.860
and you don't think the pursuit of a theory

02:35:08.860 --> 02:35:09.700
of everything is good.

02:35:09.700 --> 02:35:12.100
So I think you spoke to the second thing,

02:35:12.100 --> 02:35:16.100
which is basically that the pursuit of a theory

02:35:16.100 --> 02:35:19.300
of everything becomes like a drug to the human ego.

02:35:19.300 --> 02:35:20.140
That's right.

02:35:20.140 --> 02:35:21.740
So it is a huge motivating factor.

02:35:21.740 --> 02:35:23.260
I don't deny that,

02:35:23.260 --> 02:35:24.700
but I feel that it's,

02:35:24.700 --> 02:35:27.860
there are better ways to motivate people

02:35:27.860 --> 02:35:30.500
than like that, than this way.

02:35:30.500 --> 02:35:31.340
Okay.

02:35:31.340 --> 02:35:33.980
So I would say for instance,

02:35:33.980 --> 02:35:36.700
if one, because then it's not a game

02:35:36.700 --> 02:35:39.300
of winner takes all in some sense.

02:35:39.300 --> 02:35:43.060
And in fairness, when physicists say theory of everything,

02:35:43.060 --> 02:35:44.620
grand unified theory,

02:35:44.620 --> 02:35:46.060
they mean something very specific,

02:35:46.060 --> 02:35:47.580
which is unifying the standard model

02:35:47.580 --> 02:35:49.620
and Einstein's relativity theory,

02:35:49.620 --> 02:35:51.420
which is the theory of gravity.

02:35:51.420 --> 02:35:53.380
So they don't necessarily,

02:35:53.380 --> 02:35:55.060
a lot of physicists may say these words,

02:35:55.060 --> 02:35:56.700
but they don't really mean them.

02:35:57.660 --> 02:35:59.380
I think it's important to realize that,

02:35:59.380 --> 02:36:01.820
that in my opinion, that's not productive

02:36:01.820 --> 02:36:03.540
and it's not feasible anyway.

02:36:03.540 --> 02:36:05.020
So having said that,

02:36:05.020 --> 02:36:06.940
there are some theories are better than others, obviously.

02:36:06.940 --> 02:36:09.140
So for instance, Eric's theory has,

02:36:09.140 --> 02:36:10.380
as far as I understand,

02:36:10.380 --> 02:36:13.140
does have a certain way of producing

02:36:13.140 --> 02:36:16.300
some of the elementary particles that we see

02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:18.420
and as well as the force of gravity.

02:36:18.420 --> 02:36:20.700
So it does have that promise.

02:36:20.700 --> 02:36:25.700
I feel that at least from the place where I had seen it

02:36:25.700 --> 02:36:26.900
about 10 years ago,

02:36:26.900 --> 02:36:28.980
it still required a lot of work to get to the point

02:36:28.980 --> 02:36:31.820
of actually saying that it does work because,

02:36:33.540 --> 02:36:35.780
you know, there are a lot of elements.

02:36:36.540 --> 02:36:37.860
It's a huge enterprise to have a theory

02:36:37.860 --> 02:36:41.340
because you have just to describe the field,

02:36:41.340 --> 02:36:43.980
sort of the building blocks of the theory.

02:36:43.980 --> 02:36:45.660
It's already tremendous undertaking

02:36:45.660 --> 02:36:47.980
and he's trying to do it for curved spaces

02:36:47.980 --> 02:36:48.980
and greater generality,

02:36:48.980 --> 02:36:52.300
which is what makes it so unique and so beautiful.

02:36:52.300 --> 02:36:53.860
But then on top of that,

02:36:53.860 --> 02:36:55.460
there are all this issue of quantization,

02:36:55.460 --> 02:36:58.740
of actually describing them as quantum field theory.

02:36:58.740 --> 02:37:00.140
And the quantum field theory,

02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:03.700
even as a language, as a framework,

02:37:03.700 --> 02:37:06.100
is currently incomplete in my opinion.

02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:07.100
And not only in my opinion,

02:37:07.100 --> 02:37:10.220
it's like everybody agrees on that,

02:37:10.220 --> 02:37:15.220
that it's a collection of tricks, so to speak.

02:37:15.820 --> 02:37:16.940
It's a collection of tools.

02:37:16.940 --> 02:37:17.780
It's a toolbox,

02:37:17.780 --> 02:37:22.780
but it is not a consistent rigorous theory,

02:37:23.540 --> 02:37:26.420
like number theory in mathematics.

02:37:26.420 --> 02:37:30.540
Physicists have still been able to derive predictions

02:37:31.380 --> 02:37:36.380
from it and confirm them to great accuracy.

02:37:37.460 --> 02:37:39.700
But underpinnings,

02:37:39.700 --> 02:37:42.820
it doesn't have the real rigorous foundation

02:37:42.820 --> 02:37:44.420
from mathematical perspective.

02:37:44.420 --> 02:37:48.860
So in that sense, even if in that framework,

02:37:48.860 --> 02:37:53.860
a new theory could lead to an explanation of some,

02:37:55.380 --> 02:37:57.300
some new explanation of some phenomena,

02:37:57.300 --> 02:37:58.980
it would still be incomplete in a sense

02:37:58.980 --> 02:38:00.500
because it wouldn't be mathematically rigorous.

02:38:01.500 --> 02:38:05.740
Because the whole framework is not yet on a firm foundation.

02:38:06.580 --> 02:38:08.060
So it's not consistent.

02:38:08.900 --> 02:38:11.620
Why is it that the universe should have,

02:38:11.620 --> 02:38:13.260
so that's to your first point,

02:38:13.260 --> 02:38:16.420
do you think the universe has a beautiful clean?

02:38:17.740 --> 02:38:19.220
When you show up and meet God

02:38:19.220 --> 02:38:21.940
and there's one equation on the board

02:38:21.940 --> 02:38:23.940
and the two of you just chuckle,

02:38:23.940 --> 02:38:25.740
do you think such equation exists?

02:38:26.820 --> 02:38:30.020
Yeah, there are such equations, for instance,

02:38:30.020 --> 02:38:34.100
let's say I am interested in a particular question, right?

02:38:34.100 --> 02:38:36.700
So in the Langlands program,

02:38:36.700 --> 02:38:39.780
so moving away from physics, so let's talk about math.

02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:43.100
So in the context of the Langlands program,

02:38:44.100 --> 02:38:46.980
I have recently developed with my co-authors,

02:38:46.980 --> 02:38:49.420
Ettinghoff and Kasdan, and kind of a new strength,

02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:51.980
a new flavor of the Langlands program, if you will.

02:38:53.140 --> 02:38:55.620
But so far, it's a sort of, it's a vision.

02:38:55.620 --> 02:38:57.660
It's a set of conjectures,

02:38:57.660 --> 02:38:59.180
which we have proved in some cases,

02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:01.340
but not in full generality.

02:39:01.340 --> 02:39:05.700
So yes, I would like to use your framework,

02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:08.940
me, the creator, and ask her,

02:39:08.940 --> 02:39:13.180
what is the explanation of this?

02:39:13.180 --> 02:39:14.900
And it may well be that she will answer

02:39:14.900 --> 02:39:16.980
in a way that I will just burst out laughing.

02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:19.380
It's like, how could we not see it, you see?

02:39:19.380 --> 02:39:21.300
So that I totally see.

02:39:21.300 --> 02:39:24.780
But I don't see one equation governing,

02:39:24.780 --> 02:39:26.980
one equation governing them all.

02:39:27.940 --> 02:39:29.820
Not one equation governing them all,

02:39:29.820 --> 02:39:32.940
but it does seem that such equations exist,

02:39:32.940 --> 02:39:34.420
where she will tell you something,

02:39:34.420 --> 02:39:37.180
and you look back and say, how could I not see it?

02:39:37.180 --> 02:39:40.620
It seems like the truth at the end of the day is simple,

02:39:42.140 --> 02:39:45.380
that we're seeking, especially through mathematics.

02:39:45.380 --> 02:39:47.260
It seems somehow simple.

02:39:47.260 --> 02:39:48.940
The nature of reality,

02:39:48.940 --> 02:39:51.380
the thing that governs it seems to be simple.

02:39:51.380 --> 02:39:52.500
I wonder why that is.

02:39:53.380 --> 02:39:56.340
And I also wonder if it's not totally incorrect,

02:39:56.340 --> 02:39:58.900
and we're just craving the simplicity.

02:40:00.100 --> 02:40:03.700
And then mixing into the whole conversation

02:40:03.700 --> 02:40:07.540
about how much the observer that craves simplicity

02:40:07.540 --> 02:40:09.660
is part of the answer.

02:40:11.260 --> 02:40:13.060
It's a whole big, giant mess.

02:40:13.940 --> 02:40:18.940
Or a whole big, beautiful painting or symphony.

02:40:19.020 --> 02:40:22.620
You said of Eric Weinstein that I find it remarkable

02:40:22.620 --> 02:40:25.060
that Eric was able to come up with

02:40:25.060 --> 02:40:26.700
such beautiful and original ideas,

02:40:26.700 --> 02:40:29.580
even though he has been out of academia for so long,

02:40:29.580 --> 02:40:31.260
doing wonderful things in other areas,

02:40:31.260 --> 02:40:33.580
such as economics and finance.

02:40:33.580 --> 02:40:35.620
I'd like to use that kind of quote

02:40:35.620 --> 02:40:38.060
as just a question to you about different places

02:40:38.060 --> 02:40:42.260
where people of your level can operate,

02:40:42.260 --> 02:40:45.500
so inside, academia and outside.

02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:49.660
What is the difference of doing mathematics

02:40:49.660 --> 02:40:51.300
inside academia and outside?

02:40:52.300 --> 02:40:54.300
Just, not even mathematics,

02:40:54.300 --> 02:40:56.380
but developing beautiful, original ideas.

02:40:57.980 --> 02:41:02.980
Where's the place that your imagination can flourish most?

02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:06.700
So the limitations of academia is,

02:41:06.700 --> 02:41:07.860
there's a community of people

02:41:07.860 --> 02:41:12.420
that take a set of axioms as gospel,

02:41:12.420 --> 02:41:15.860
so it's harder to take that leap into the unknown.

02:41:15.860 --> 02:41:18.420
But it's also, the nice thing about academia

02:41:18.420 --> 02:41:20.900
is some of the most brilliant people in the world

02:41:21.780 --> 02:41:23.460
are there, and it's that community.

02:41:23.460 --> 02:41:26.780
Both the competition and the collaboration is there.

02:41:26.780 --> 02:41:28.060
Yeah.

02:41:28.060 --> 02:41:29.380
I wonder if there's something you could say

02:41:29.380 --> 02:41:33.060
sort of to further about this world

02:41:33.060 --> 02:41:35.700
that people might not be familiar with.

02:41:35.700 --> 02:41:38.020
But I think you gave a very good description.

02:41:38.020 --> 02:41:40.060
I'm not sure I can improve on it

02:41:40.060 --> 02:41:44.100
because I don't have an overarching theory of academia.

02:41:44.100 --> 02:41:47.060
I definitely have been part of it, and I'm grateful

02:41:47.060 --> 02:41:50.980
because it gives you a great sense of security,

02:41:52.620 --> 02:41:55.420
which comes with its own downside, too,

02:41:55.420 --> 02:41:57.380
because you kind of get a little disconnected

02:41:57.380 --> 02:41:59.860
from the real world because you get tenure,

02:41:59.860 --> 02:42:02.100
so you feel financially secure.

02:42:02.100 --> 02:42:04.180
It doesn't pay you that much, so to speak,

02:42:04.180 --> 02:42:07.180
relatively speaking, and it's comfortable,

02:42:07.180 --> 02:42:10.980
but it's not that much, but you can't be fired.

02:42:10.980 --> 02:42:13.180
So there is something about this

02:42:13.180 --> 02:42:16.820
which I definitely have benefit from it,

02:42:16.820 --> 02:42:20.500
and it does, people are not even aware

02:42:20.500 --> 02:42:24.780
what it's like to live outside where you don't have

02:42:24.780 --> 02:42:26.340
this type of security.

02:42:26.340 --> 02:42:29.380
On the other hand, that also means

02:42:29.380 --> 02:42:31.220
that we're lacking certain skills

02:42:31.220 --> 02:42:33.540
that sort of real people in the real world

02:42:33.540 --> 02:42:37.100
have developed out of necessity

02:42:37.100 --> 02:42:39.780
to deal with that sort of insecurity.

02:42:39.780 --> 02:42:42.180
So it kind of always cuts both ways.

02:42:42.180 --> 02:42:43.100
On the one hand, it gives,

02:42:43.100 --> 02:42:45.100
and on the other hand, it takes away,

02:42:45.140 --> 02:42:47.140
and it's a very interesting setup.

02:42:47.140 --> 02:42:48.700
And also, on the one hand,

02:42:48.700 --> 02:42:51.820
we are all supposed to be the truth seekers,

02:42:51.820 --> 02:42:55.420
but in reality, of course, it is a human activity

02:42:55.420 --> 02:42:57.460
and it is a human community

02:42:57.460 --> 02:43:01.420
with all kinds of good, bad, and ugly things that happen,

02:43:01.420 --> 02:43:03.980
a lot of them under the radar screen, so to speak.

02:43:03.980 --> 02:43:08.140
And so, but maybe there is something to it.

02:43:08.140 --> 02:43:10.140
There is definitely, there are definitely people

02:43:10.140 --> 02:43:14.820
who are upholding kind of that old tradition, definitely.

02:43:14.860 --> 02:43:16.220
And that is inspiring.

02:43:16.220 --> 02:43:19.980
And I aspire to be one of those, do my best.

02:43:19.980 --> 02:43:24.980
So whether this is a system that will stay or should stay,

02:43:25.820 --> 02:43:27.420
I don't know, I really don't know.

02:43:27.420 --> 02:43:28.260
That's really fascinating.

02:43:28.260 --> 02:43:30.300
Yeah, it's fascinating what,

02:43:30.300 --> 02:43:34.300
especially with it, just to introduce the bit of AI poison

02:43:34.300 --> 02:43:37.180
into the mix as that changes the nature of education

02:43:37.180 --> 02:43:40.500
perhaps as well, what the role of the university

02:43:40.500 --> 02:43:44.020
is in the next 10, 20, 50, 100 years, I wonder.

02:43:45.660 --> 02:43:49.660
And I wonder that, how do you make sense

02:43:49.660 --> 02:43:52.700
that Einstein was working after attempting,

02:43:52.700 --> 02:43:55.380
I believe, to be a university professor?

02:43:56.420 --> 02:43:57.820
He was working in the patent office.

02:43:57.820 --> 02:43:59.900
Yeah, as a patent clerk.

02:43:59.900 --> 02:44:01.660
But I have to say, to these days,

02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:06.780
the science has become so much faster.

02:44:06.780 --> 02:44:09.660
It is really hard to do it being outside.

02:44:09.660 --> 02:44:13.620
Now, Eric is unique in this way, even though he did,

02:44:15.420 --> 02:44:19.020
go to great undergraduate and graduate schools,

02:44:22.020 --> 02:44:24.140
and then worked for a while in academia.

02:44:25.740 --> 02:44:27.820
There are very few examples like this.

02:44:27.820 --> 02:44:30.500
This is Yutong Zhang, who proved an important conjecture,

02:44:30.500 --> 02:44:32.780
number theory, about 10 years ago,

02:44:32.780 --> 02:44:34.540
and is now, as I understand,

02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:36.940
is a professor at UC Santa Barbara.

02:44:36.940 --> 02:44:38.620
He worked outside of academia

02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:42.620
and was able to make tremendous advance on his own.

02:44:43.340 --> 02:44:45.500
This case is exceedingly rare,

02:44:46.820 --> 02:44:49.420
in part because academia is trying to protect its turf,

02:44:49.420 --> 02:44:54.420
and it's creating the prohibitive cost of an outsider.

02:44:55.220 --> 02:44:57.340
That is true, but there is also something

02:44:57.340 --> 02:45:00.540
about how much concentration.

02:45:00.540 --> 02:45:03.260
In mathematics, I don't think people

02:45:03.260 --> 02:45:06.140
who are not in the field understand

02:45:06.140 --> 02:45:11.140
what kind of focus and concentration actually do,

02:45:11.580 --> 02:45:16.580
like mathematics at the top level these days requires,

02:45:16.940 --> 02:45:18.580
because we're not talking about something

02:45:18.580 --> 02:45:20.820
that is more or less good.

02:45:20.820 --> 02:45:22.660
It is something which is unassailable.

02:45:22.660 --> 02:45:26.820
It's finding this treasure at the bottom of the ocean

02:45:26.820 --> 02:45:31.820
without the aqualung, without oxygen,

02:45:32.580 --> 02:45:37.580
and that's why people go crazy sometimes.

02:45:38.220 --> 02:45:39.220
There is a reason for that.

02:45:39.220 --> 02:45:41.260
Well, let me ask you about that,

02:45:41.260 --> 02:45:42.580
just to linger on that,

02:45:42.580 --> 02:45:44.680
the amount of concentration required.

02:45:46.380 --> 02:45:49.420
Cal Newport wrote a book called Deep Work.

02:45:49.420 --> 02:45:51.420
He's a theoretical computer scientist.

02:45:54.980 --> 02:45:57.980
He took quite seriously the task

02:45:57.980 --> 02:45:59.620
of allocating the hours in the day

02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:01.260
for that kind of deep thinking.

02:46:01.260 --> 02:46:03.100
And then the mathematician

02:46:03.100 --> 02:46:07.100
is theoretical computer scientist on steroids.

02:46:07.100 --> 02:46:09.900
So for your own life and what you've observed,

02:46:11.820 --> 02:46:15.300
let me ask the big question, how to think,

02:46:15.300 --> 02:46:18.420
how to think deeply, how to find the mental,

02:46:18.420 --> 02:46:21.900
psychological, pragmatic space

02:46:21.900 --> 02:46:24.300
to really sit there and think deeply.

02:46:25.780 --> 02:46:26.860
How do you do it?

02:46:26.860 --> 02:46:28.140
In the moments you remember

02:46:28.140 --> 02:46:29.740
where you really deeply thought,

02:46:32.900 --> 02:46:34.900
was it an accident, was it deliberate?

02:46:35.700 --> 02:46:40.340
No, it's deliberate because first of all,

02:46:40.340 --> 02:46:43.340
my first years as a mathematician,

02:46:46.500 --> 02:46:50.740
I worked every day, weekends, holidays, doesn't matter.

02:46:53.180 --> 02:46:54.300
I didn't even question that.

02:46:54.300 --> 02:46:58.620
So I would feel something's missing if I took a day off.

02:46:59.620 --> 02:47:04.620
And so it was just a kind of a sustained effort.

02:47:05.220 --> 02:47:08.260
The point is that still the process is nonlinear

02:47:08.260 --> 02:47:11.460
to go back to what we discussed earlier,

02:47:11.460 --> 02:47:13.940
that in other words, the way I see it

02:47:13.940 --> 02:47:16.700
is you are making an effort

02:47:16.700 --> 02:47:20.980
to bring all the information into focus,

02:47:20.980 --> 02:47:22.900
what you believe is correct.

02:47:22.900 --> 02:47:27.300
And you're playing with different ways

02:47:27.300 --> 02:47:29.260
of connecting things.

02:47:29.260 --> 02:47:31.500
But it is a total miracle

02:47:31.500 --> 02:47:35.700
when suddenly there is inside strikes.

02:47:35.700 --> 02:47:38.020
It is not something that in my experience

02:47:38.020 --> 02:47:42.020
could be predicted or even anticipated

02:47:42.020 --> 02:47:44.060
or brought closer.

02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:48.020
There is a famous story about Einstein

02:47:48.020 --> 02:47:50.700
that he used to go think, think, think,

02:47:50.700 --> 02:47:52.100
and then go for a walk.

02:47:52.100 --> 02:47:53.860
And he would whistle sometimes.

02:47:53.860 --> 02:47:56.700
So I remember the first time I heard this story,

02:47:56.780 --> 02:47:57.980
I thought, hmm, how interesting.

02:47:57.980 --> 02:47:59.860
So what a coincidence that this came to him

02:47:59.860 --> 02:48:01.260
when he was whistling.

02:48:01.260 --> 02:48:02.620
But in fact, it's not.

02:48:02.620 --> 02:48:04.860
It is how it works in some sense,

02:48:04.860 --> 02:48:07.620
that you have to prepare for it,

02:48:07.620 --> 02:48:10.780
but then it happens when you stop thinking, actually.

02:48:10.780 --> 02:48:14.660
The moment of discovery is the moment when thinking stops.

02:48:14.660 --> 02:48:19.660
And you kind of almost become that truth

02:48:20.620 --> 02:48:22.180
that you're seeking.

02:48:22.180 --> 02:48:25.180
But you cannot do it by will in some sense.

02:48:25.180 --> 02:48:27.740
It's kind of like, you know how in the Eastern tradition,

02:48:27.740 --> 02:48:29.300
they have this concept of Satori,

02:48:29.300 --> 02:48:30.860
like in Buddhism, in Zen Buddhism,

02:48:30.860 --> 02:48:33.820
they have this Satori, which is enlightenment.

02:48:33.820 --> 02:48:38.500
And so there are various reports of Buddhist monks

02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:41.340
or Buddhist masters who have had experience Satori.

02:48:43.460 --> 02:48:47.740
But they say you can't do it by will.

02:48:47.740 --> 02:48:49.900
You cannot make it happen.

02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:52.820
If anything, you have to relax to let it come to you.

02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:54.060
It's kind of like that.

02:48:54.060 --> 02:48:54.900
It's kind of like that.

02:48:54.900 --> 02:48:59.900
So I think that what matters,

02:49:00.260 --> 02:49:01.580
but you say how to think.

02:49:01.580 --> 02:49:05.220
The point is that we're talking about such an esoteric area.

02:49:05.220 --> 02:49:07.060
Mathematics is really esoteric area.

02:49:07.060 --> 02:49:08.900
It's a really strange subject

02:49:08.900 --> 02:49:12.500
where you try to fit everything

02:49:12.500 --> 02:49:16.380
in this very, very stringent set of rules,

02:49:16.380 --> 02:49:18.180
to play those rules.

02:49:18.180 --> 02:49:20.740
Isn't it basically the pure,

02:49:20.740 --> 02:49:23.180
the hardest manifestation of a puzzle

02:49:23.180 --> 02:49:25.100
that we're all solving in different other disciplines,

02:49:25.100 --> 02:49:27.380
but this is the hardest puzzle.

02:49:27.380 --> 02:49:30.020
But yes and no, because there is just a different,

02:49:31.620 --> 02:49:33.100
for instance, there is a different criterion

02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:35.340
for what constitutes progress.

02:49:35.340 --> 02:49:38.540
For instance, in physics, a lot of arguments they make,

02:49:38.540 --> 02:49:40.820
they are not rigorous from mathematical perspective.

02:49:40.820 --> 02:49:42.500
It is kind of an intuitive arguments.

02:49:42.500 --> 02:49:43.820
We think it is like this,

02:49:43.820 --> 02:49:47.460
and this is acceptable in the subject for a good reason.

02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:49.660
And so there is some play.

02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:52.740
It's more like human activity, day-to-day activity,

02:49:53.100 --> 02:49:55.460
for instance, if you and I discuss something,

02:49:55.460 --> 02:49:56.980
you have an idea, and I have an idea,

02:49:56.980 --> 02:49:58.420
and we argue about it,

02:49:58.420 --> 02:50:00.780
and something seems more plausible,

02:50:00.780 --> 02:50:02.500
something seems less plausible.

02:50:02.500 --> 02:50:05.060
And so we may decide to take this point of view

02:50:05.060 --> 02:50:09.780
or that point of view as a provisional point of view

02:50:09.780 --> 02:50:10.780
and go with it.

02:50:11.660 --> 02:50:13.820
In my mind, it doesn't work this way.

02:50:13.820 --> 02:50:15.620
You either prove it or you don't.

02:50:15.620 --> 02:50:19.380
And oftentimes, you get to the point

02:50:19.380 --> 02:50:21.540
where there is this much you need to prove,

02:50:21.580 --> 02:50:25.060
and it just wouldn't come to you,

02:50:25.060 --> 02:50:26.700
and you just don't see it,

02:50:26.700 --> 02:50:29.020
and it can go on for months.

02:50:30.380 --> 02:50:31.980
Super frustrating.

02:50:31.980 --> 02:50:35.740
But without it, it is nothing, kind of.

02:50:35.740 --> 02:50:37.860
I would love to hear your opinion

02:50:37.860 --> 02:50:39.980
to the degree that you know it,

02:50:39.980 --> 02:50:43.580
of the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles,

02:50:43.580 --> 02:50:48.580
which seems to have this element perhaps for years.

02:50:48.820 --> 02:50:49.780
To the degree that you know,

02:50:49.780 --> 02:50:52.620
perhaps can you explain Fermat's Last Theorem

02:50:52.620 --> 02:50:54.780
and what your thoughts are on the process

02:50:54.780 --> 02:50:57.180
that Andrew Wiles took that seemed to,

02:50:57.180 --> 02:50:59.260
at least from my sort of romantic perspective,

02:50:59.260 --> 02:51:01.260
seemed to be very lonely.

02:51:01.260 --> 02:51:03.540
Yes, it's a lonely profession.

02:51:04.380 --> 02:51:09.380
And hopeless, and sort of the,

02:51:10.820 --> 02:51:13.980
you put it really nicely because it feels like

02:51:13.980 --> 02:51:16.020
there's a lot of moments where you feel like you're close.

02:51:16.020 --> 02:51:17.420
You feel like 99% is done,

02:51:17.580 --> 02:51:19.980
and there is this one stubborn thing

02:51:19.980 --> 02:51:23.620
which just does not compute, doesn't happen,

02:51:23.620 --> 02:51:28.260
and you're trying to find that push for this last link,

02:51:28.260 --> 02:51:30.260
and it could take,

02:51:30.260 --> 02:51:32.060
and nobody knows how long it's going to take.

02:51:32.060 --> 02:51:34.660
Would it be useful to maybe try to explain

02:51:34.660 --> 02:51:35.740
Fermat's Last Theorem?

02:51:35.740 --> 02:51:37.340
Sure, it's easy to do.

02:51:39.100 --> 02:51:41.340
I am an optimist, I'm an optimist.

02:51:41.340 --> 02:51:44.900
I think, I always think that everything can be explained.

02:51:44.900 --> 02:51:47.700
Even though I say that not everything can be explained,

02:51:47.700 --> 02:51:52.020
but in mathematics, within this particular framework,

02:51:52.020 --> 02:51:54.580
I think that I always feel optimistic

02:51:54.580 --> 02:51:57.140
when people ask me to explain something.

02:51:57.140 --> 02:51:58.420
I always start with the assumption

02:51:58.420 --> 02:52:01.300
that they will understand, you know?

02:52:01.300 --> 02:52:03.100
So let's try.

02:52:04.700 --> 02:52:06.500
Fermat's Last Theorem,

02:52:06.500 --> 02:52:10.460
one of the jewels of mathematics of all time.

02:52:11.420 --> 02:52:13.780
A beautiful story also behind it.

02:52:13.780 --> 02:52:16.740
Pierre Fermat, a great French mathematician

02:52:16.740 --> 02:52:18.580
who lived in the beginning of,

02:52:18.580 --> 02:52:22.820
mostly worked at the beginning of what, 17th century,

02:52:22.820 --> 02:52:25.340
and he actually has to,

02:52:25.340 --> 02:52:28.620
he's created a number of important contributions.

02:52:28.620 --> 02:52:31.300
But the most famous is called Fermat's Last Theorem,

02:52:31.300 --> 02:52:33.380
or Fermat's Great Theorem.

02:52:33.380 --> 02:52:35.900
And the reason why it became so famous

02:52:35.900 --> 02:52:38.580
is in part because he actually claimed

02:52:38.580 --> 02:52:40.860
to have proved it himself.

02:52:40.860 --> 02:52:44.420
And he did it on the margin of a book that he was reading,

02:52:44.420 --> 02:52:46.700
which was actually an important book by Diophantus

02:52:46.700 --> 02:52:51.340
about equations with coefficients and whole numbers.

02:52:51.340 --> 02:52:53.460
And he wrote on the margin, literally,

02:52:55.380 --> 02:52:57.060
this equation, you know, this problem,

02:52:57.060 --> 02:52:58.660
which I will explain in a moment,

02:52:59.780 --> 02:53:02.940
I have solved it, I have found a proof,

02:53:02.940 --> 02:53:06.180
but this margin is too small to contain it.

02:53:06.180 --> 02:53:09.700
At some point, I was giving a public talk about this,

02:53:09.740 --> 02:53:12.500
and I made, as a joke, I made a tweet

02:53:12.500 --> 02:53:14.940
in which I wrote that I have proved this theorem,

02:53:14.940 --> 02:53:16.820
but 280 characters are not enough,

02:53:16.820 --> 02:53:18.660
and it kind of cuts me in mid-sentence.

02:53:18.660 --> 02:53:22.980
So this was 17th century Twitter-style proof, okay?

02:53:22.980 --> 02:53:24.700
But a lot of mathematicians took it seriously

02:53:24.700 --> 02:53:27.020
because he had great credibility,

02:53:27.020 --> 02:53:32.020
he did make some major contributions.

02:53:32.140 --> 02:53:33.380
And the search was on.

02:53:33.380 --> 02:53:37.300
So for 350 years, about 350 years,

02:53:38.300 --> 02:53:43.300
it remained unproved, with many people trying and failing.

02:53:44.700 --> 02:53:49.500
Until in 1994, no, in 1993,

02:53:49.500 --> 02:53:51.660
Andrew Wiles announced,

02:53:51.660 --> 02:53:53.980
a mathematician from Princeton University,

02:53:53.980 --> 02:53:56.420
announced the proof, and it was very exciting

02:53:56.420 --> 02:54:00.540
because he was one of the top number theorists in the world.

02:54:00.540 --> 02:54:04.260
And unfortunately, about a year later, a gap was found.

02:54:04.260 --> 02:54:06.540
So this is exactly what we were talking about earlier.

02:54:06.540 --> 02:54:07.980
You have 99% of the proof,

02:54:07.980 --> 02:54:11.020
this one little thing does not quite connect,

02:54:11.020 --> 02:54:12.740
and this nullifies the whole thing.

02:54:12.740 --> 02:54:13.780
Even though, well, you could say

02:54:13.780 --> 02:54:15.060
there are some interesting ideas,

02:54:15.060 --> 02:54:18.540
but it's not the same as actually having a proof.

02:54:18.540 --> 02:54:20.340
So he apparently was really frustrated,

02:54:20.340 --> 02:54:22.820
and he was really, a lot of people thought

02:54:22.820 --> 02:54:26.060
that it's going to be another 100 years or whatever.

02:54:26.060 --> 02:54:28.780
And then luckily, he was able to enlist,

02:54:28.780 --> 02:54:33.380
with the help, assistance of his former student,

02:54:33.380 --> 02:54:35.820
also great number theorist, Richard Taylor,

02:54:35.860 --> 02:54:38.940
they were able to do that 1%, so to speak.

02:54:38.940 --> 02:54:40.820
Well, some people might say it may be not one,

02:54:40.820 --> 02:54:41.820
but 5%, or whatever,

02:54:41.820 --> 02:54:44.260
but it definitely was an important ingredient,

02:54:44.260 --> 02:54:48.580
but it was not, he had a sort of like a big new set of ideas,

02:54:48.580 --> 02:54:50.500
and this one thing didn't pan out.

02:54:50.500 --> 02:54:52.620
They were able to close it with Taylor,

02:54:52.620 --> 02:54:54.180
and it finally was published,

02:54:54.180 --> 02:54:57.420
and I think was accepted and refereed in 95,

02:54:57.420 --> 02:54:59.900
and since it's believed to be correct.

02:55:01.860 --> 02:55:05.700
Now, what he proved actually was not Fermat's theorem,

02:55:06.220 --> 02:55:08.380
but a certain statement,

02:55:08.380 --> 02:55:11.380
which is called Shimura-Tanayama-Wei Conjecture,

02:55:11.380 --> 02:55:12.900
named after three mathematicians,

02:55:12.900 --> 02:55:14.140
two Japanese mathematicians,

02:55:14.140 --> 02:55:16.540
and one French-born mathematician,

02:55:16.540 --> 02:55:19.140
who worked also at the Institute for Advanced Study

02:55:19.140 --> 02:55:24.140
in Princeton, and it was my colleague at UC Berkeley,

02:55:24.140 --> 02:55:27.660
Ken Ribbett, who in the 80s connected the two problems.

02:55:27.660 --> 02:55:29.780
So this is how it often works in mathematics.

02:55:29.780 --> 02:55:31.860
You want to prove statement A,

02:55:31.860 --> 02:55:34.660
instead, you prove that A is equivalent to B,

02:55:34.820 --> 02:55:36.620
so after that, if you can prove B,

02:55:36.620 --> 02:55:39.140
this would automatically imply that A is correct.

02:55:39.140 --> 02:55:40.580
So this is what happened here.

02:55:40.580 --> 02:55:41.820
A was Fermat's last theorem,

02:55:41.820 --> 02:55:43.860
B was Shimura-Tanayama-Wei Conjecture,

02:55:43.860 --> 02:55:46.900
and that's what Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor

02:55:46.900 --> 02:55:48.180
really proved.

02:55:48.180 --> 02:55:50.460
So it requires, to get to Fermat's last theorem,

02:55:50.460 --> 02:55:51.300
it requires that bridge,

02:55:51.300 --> 02:55:54.060
which was established by my colleague Ken Ribbett

02:55:54.060 --> 02:55:55.380
at UC Berkeley.

02:55:55.380 --> 02:55:57.980
So now, what is the statement of Fermat's last theorem?

02:56:00.180 --> 02:56:02.020
Let me start with Pythagoras,

02:56:02.020 --> 02:56:03.300
since we already talked about it,

02:56:04.220 --> 02:56:06.900
let me start with Pythagoras' theorem,

02:56:06.900 --> 02:56:10.020
which describes the right triangles.

02:56:10.020 --> 02:56:11.260
So what is the right triangle?

02:56:11.260 --> 02:56:14.420
It's a triangle in which one of the angles is 90 degrees,

02:56:14.420 --> 02:56:15.900
like this.

02:56:15.900 --> 02:56:17.420
So it has three sides.

02:56:17.420 --> 02:56:20.220
The longer side is called hypotenuse,

02:56:20.220 --> 02:56:21.700
and then there's two other sides.

02:56:21.700 --> 02:56:25.860
So if we denote the length of hypotenuse by Z,

02:56:25.860 --> 02:56:28.540
and the two other sides, X and Y,

02:56:28.540 --> 02:56:31.220
then Z squared is equal to X squared plus Y squared.

02:56:31.860 --> 02:56:34.060
So that's the equation,

02:56:34.060 --> 02:56:36.460
or X squared plus Y squared equals Z squared.

02:56:38.180 --> 02:56:41.140
And it turns out that this equation

02:56:41.140 --> 02:56:44.100
has solutions in natural numbers,

02:56:44.100 --> 02:56:47.820
many, actually infinitely many solutions in natural numbers.

02:56:47.820 --> 02:56:50.980
For example, if X is, you take X equals three,

02:56:52.140 --> 02:56:54.340
Y equals four, and Z equals five,

02:56:55.300 --> 02:56:58.180
then they solve this equation,

02:56:58.180 --> 02:57:00.540
because three squared is nine,

02:57:01.860 --> 02:57:03.140
four squared is 16.

02:57:04.100 --> 02:57:06.380
Nine plus 16, 25.

02:57:06.380 --> 02:57:07.620
And that's five squared.

02:57:08.620 --> 02:57:11.940
So X squared plus Y squared equals Z squared

02:57:11.940 --> 02:57:15.900
is solved by X equals three, Y equals four, Z equals five.

02:57:15.900 --> 02:57:18.460
And there are many other solutions of that nature.

02:57:18.460 --> 02:57:19.980
And we should say that natural numbers

02:57:19.980 --> 02:57:23.340
are whole numbers that are non-negative.

02:57:23.340 --> 02:57:26.060
That's right, one, two, three, four, five, six, and so on.

02:57:26.060 --> 02:57:27.660
Now, what's Fermat's last theorem?

02:57:27.660 --> 02:57:29.860
Fermat asked, what about,

02:57:29.860 --> 02:57:33.580
what will happen if we replace squares by cubes, for example?

02:57:33.580 --> 02:57:36.980
So X cubed plus Y cubed equals Z cubed.

02:57:38.540 --> 02:57:40.620
Are there any solutions in,

02:57:41.500 --> 02:57:43.300
what do you call it, natural numbers?

02:57:44.740 --> 02:57:46.740
It turns out there are none.

02:57:46.740 --> 02:57:48.020
What about fourth powers?

02:57:48.940 --> 02:57:50.060
Again, none.

02:57:50.060 --> 02:57:51.860
Oh, it seems like none, right?

02:57:51.860 --> 02:57:53.980
So that was the statement.

02:57:53.980 --> 02:57:57.260
So this theorem says that the equation,

02:57:57.260 --> 02:57:59.900
X cubed plus Y cubed equals Z cubed

02:57:59.900 --> 02:58:01.940
has no solutions in natural numbers.

02:58:04.740 --> 02:58:06.940
Remember, natural means positive whole numbers.

02:58:06.940 --> 02:58:09.140
So of course there is a trivial solution, zero, zero, zero,

02:58:09.140 --> 02:58:12.140
so then this works, but you need all of them to be positive.

02:58:13.700 --> 02:58:15.540
X to the fourth plus Y to the fourth

02:58:15.540 --> 02:58:18.620
equals Z to the fourth also has no solutions.

02:58:20.820 --> 02:58:22.860
X to the fifth plus Y to the fifth

02:58:22.860 --> 02:58:24.700
equals Z to the fifth, no solutions.

02:58:24.700 --> 02:58:26.140
So you kind of see the trend.

02:58:27.060 --> 02:58:30.740
X to the N plus Y to the N equals Z to the N.

02:58:30.740 --> 02:58:32.220
If N is greater than two,

02:58:33.220 --> 02:58:35.180
has no solutions in natural numbers.

02:58:35.180 --> 02:58:37.460
That is a statement of Fermat's last theorem.

02:58:38.300 --> 02:58:42.180
Deceptively simple as far as famous theorems are concerned.

02:58:42.180 --> 02:58:45.340
You don't need to know anything beyond standard arithmetic,

02:58:45.340 --> 02:58:48.260
addition and multiplication of natural numbers.

02:58:48.260 --> 02:58:49.500
That's why a lot of people,

02:58:50.980 --> 02:58:55.980
both specialists and amateurs try to prove it.

02:58:56.580 --> 02:58:59.060
Because it's so easy to formulate.

02:59:01.060 --> 02:59:03.620
So in fact, I think Fermat proved the case of cubes.

02:59:03.620 --> 02:59:05.900
I think he did actually prove some elsewhere,

02:59:05.900 --> 02:59:08.700
the case of cubes, but so it remained like fourth.

02:59:08.700 --> 02:59:10.020
There are infinitely many cases, right?

02:59:10.020 --> 02:59:11.700
You have to, even if you prove it for cubes

02:59:11.700 --> 02:59:12.900
and for fourth power and fifth,

02:59:12.900 --> 02:59:15.140
then still there is sixth, seventh and so on.

02:59:15.140 --> 02:59:18.140
There are infinitely many cases in which it has to be proved.

02:59:19.460 --> 02:59:21.300
And so you see,

02:59:22.300 --> 02:59:26.340
the deceptively simple result took 350 years to prove.

02:59:27.700 --> 02:59:30.500
And in a sense, it's like mathematicians,

02:59:30.500 --> 02:59:33.100
you would think mathematics is such a sterile profession.

02:59:33.100 --> 02:59:35.140
Everybody's so serious,

02:59:35.140 --> 02:59:37.500
almost like we're all wearing lab coats

02:59:37.500 --> 02:59:41.940
and take an elevator to the every tower.

02:59:41.940 --> 02:59:45.580
And however, look at all this drama.

02:59:45.580 --> 02:59:46.420
Look at all this drama.

02:59:46.420 --> 02:59:47.900
It's like, we also like drama.

02:59:47.900 --> 02:59:49.420
We also have narratives.

02:59:49.420 --> 02:59:51.060
We also have our myths.

02:59:51.940 --> 02:59:54.900
Here is a guy, is a 16th century mathematician

02:59:54.900 --> 02:59:58.860
or 17th century mathematician who leaves a note on the margin

02:59:58.860 --> 03:00:01.500
and motivates others to find the proof.

03:00:01.500 --> 03:00:03.940
Then how many hearts were broken

03:00:03.940 --> 03:00:05.740
that they believed that they found the proof.

03:00:05.740 --> 03:00:07.780
And then later it was realized

03:00:07.780 --> 03:00:10.220
that the proof was incorrect and so on.

03:00:10.220 --> 03:00:13.820
And brings us to modern day and one last attempt.

03:00:13.820 --> 03:00:16.980
Andrew Wiles, who is very serious and respected

03:00:16.980 --> 03:00:19.140
and esteemed mathematician, announces the proof

03:00:19.820 --> 03:00:21.380
that he's only to be faced with the same reality

03:00:21.380 --> 03:00:24.180
of his hopes dashed, seemingly dashed.

03:00:24.180 --> 03:00:27.140
And like, there is a mistake, it doesn't work.

03:00:27.140 --> 03:00:29.300
And then to be able to recover a year later.

03:00:29.300 --> 03:00:31.820
How much drama in this one story, huh?

03:00:31.820 --> 03:00:34.740
It's amazing, but from what you understand,

03:00:34.740 --> 03:00:37.940
from what you know, what was the process for him

03:00:37.940 --> 03:00:40.980
that is similar perhaps to your own life

03:00:40.980 --> 03:00:45.980
of walking along with the problem for months, not years?

03:00:46.020 --> 03:00:47.220
Not years.

03:00:47.220 --> 03:00:51.460
Yes, so he worked, he has given interviews

03:00:51.460 --> 03:00:52.780
about it afterwards.

03:00:52.780 --> 03:00:55.900
So we know that he described his process

03:00:55.900 --> 03:00:59.740
that number one, he did not want to tell anybody

03:00:59.740 --> 03:01:02.180
because he was afraid that people find out

03:01:02.180 --> 03:01:03.380
that he's working on it.

03:01:04.540 --> 03:01:08.140
Because he was such a top level mathematician,

03:01:08.140 --> 03:01:10.540
people would guess that he has some idea,

03:01:10.540 --> 03:01:11.380
that there is some idea.

03:01:11.380 --> 03:01:14.820
So, you know, if you just know

03:01:14.860 --> 03:01:16.700
that somebody has an idea,

03:01:16.700 --> 03:01:19.900
this already gives you a great boost of confidence, right?

03:01:19.900 --> 03:01:23.340
So he didn't want people to have that information.

03:01:23.340 --> 03:01:25.500
So he didn't tell anybody that he was working on it.

03:01:25.500 --> 03:01:26.340
Number one.

03:01:26.340 --> 03:01:27.180
Just be lonely.

03:01:27.180 --> 03:01:29.500
Number two, he worked on it for seven years,

03:01:29.500 --> 03:01:32.660
if I remember correctly, by himself.

03:01:32.660 --> 03:01:37.660
And then he thought he had it and he was elated.

03:01:37.860 --> 03:01:40.700
Obviously he was, you know, very happy.

03:01:40.700 --> 03:01:42.940
And he announced it at a conference,

03:01:42.940 --> 03:01:44.500
I think it was in Cambridge University

03:01:44.500 --> 03:01:48.740
or Oxford University in the UK in 1993, I believe.

03:01:48.740 --> 03:01:53.740
So, you know, this is really interesting

03:01:55.540 --> 03:01:59.060
because all of us, all mathematicians can relate to this

03:01:59.060 --> 03:02:02.100
because I remember very well my first problem,

03:02:02.100 --> 03:02:03.540
how I solved my first problem.

03:02:04.740 --> 03:02:07.860
I described it in Love and Math in my book.

03:02:07.860 --> 03:02:12.340
So it was, I was, how old was I?

03:02:12.340 --> 03:02:14.260
I was 18 years old.

03:02:14.260 --> 03:02:17.500
I was a student in Moscow and I was just,

03:02:17.500 --> 03:02:19.540
I just lucked out that I was introduced

03:02:19.540 --> 03:02:22.420
to this great mathematician since I, you know,

03:02:22.420 --> 03:02:24.540
I was not studying at Moscow University

03:02:24.540 --> 03:02:26.500
because of anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union.

03:02:26.500 --> 03:02:28.380
So I was in this technical school,

03:02:28.380 --> 03:02:30.700
but I was lucky that I had a mathematician

03:02:30.700 --> 03:02:35.340
who took me under his wing and Dmitry Fuchs,

03:02:35.340 --> 03:02:39.540
who actually later came to the US

03:02:39.580 --> 03:02:42.140
and he's still a professor at UC Davis, actually.

03:02:43.180 --> 03:02:44.540
Not so far from me.

03:02:45.860 --> 03:02:50.100
So he gave me this problem and it was rather technical,

03:02:50.100 --> 03:02:51.740
so I will not try to describe it,

03:02:51.740 --> 03:02:55.780
but I do remember how much effort, you know,

03:02:55.780 --> 03:02:58.540
that excitement, but also kind of a fear.

03:02:58.540 --> 03:03:01.300
What if I don't have what it takes, you know?

03:03:01.300 --> 03:03:04.980
I lost sleep, so this was one consequence of this.

03:03:04.980 --> 03:03:06.580
I, for the first time in my life,

03:03:06.580 --> 03:03:07.820
I had trouble falling asleep

03:03:07.820 --> 03:03:11.100
and this actually stayed for a couple of years afterwards.

03:03:11.100 --> 03:03:12.820
So then it was kind of like a wake-up call

03:03:12.820 --> 03:03:14.700
that I should be to take care of myself,

03:03:14.700 --> 03:03:16.180
not work too late and so on.

03:03:16.180 --> 03:03:18.700
So that was sort of like that experience.

03:03:18.700 --> 03:03:21.340
And I was lucky that I was able to find a solution,

03:03:21.340 --> 03:03:24.020
number one, within two months maybe.

03:03:24.020 --> 03:03:26.900
And it was very, it was surprising and it was beautiful.

03:03:26.900 --> 03:03:29.900
Like the answer was in terms of something

03:03:29.900 --> 03:03:31.820
which seemed to be from a different world,

03:03:31.820 --> 03:03:34.180
from a different area of mathematics.

03:03:34.180 --> 03:03:35.860
So I was very happy.

03:03:35.860 --> 03:03:37.940
But I do remember this moment

03:03:37.940 --> 03:03:42.180
when suddenly you see that, just like you,

03:03:42.180 --> 03:03:43.420
in this case, it was literally,

03:03:43.420 --> 03:03:45.700
I had to compile these diagrams

03:03:45.700 --> 03:03:48.380
with what mathematicians call cohomology groups

03:03:48.380 --> 03:03:53.380
and spectral sequences and manually calculate some numbers

03:03:53.580 --> 03:03:55.860
and trying to discern some system in it.

03:03:55.860 --> 03:03:59.340
And suddenly I saw that, how they all were governed

03:03:59.340 --> 03:04:03.220
by this one force, so to speak, one pattern.

03:04:03.220 --> 03:04:05.620
And that was absolutely wow.

03:04:06.460 --> 03:04:07.300
So it's like.

03:04:07.300 --> 03:04:10.460
So you're sitting there at a desk.

03:04:10.460 --> 03:04:13.060
Actually, I lived in a town outside of Moscow.

03:04:13.060 --> 03:04:15.780
So I used to take, I would take a train to Moscow.

03:04:15.780 --> 03:04:19.180
So it's what we call in Russia, electric train,

03:04:19.180 --> 03:04:20.180
which was super slow.

03:04:20.180 --> 03:04:23.060
It took more than two hours to cover that distance.

03:04:23.060 --> 03:04:26.660
And I think that the crucial insight came when I was in this

03:04:26.660 --> 03:04:29.220
and I just, I had to contain myself

03:04:29.220 --> 03:04:30.580
so I don't start screaming

03:04:30.580 --> 03:04:34.780
because there were other passengers in the car.

03:04:34.820 --> 03:04:39.060
So I was sitting there and staring at this paper.

03:04:39.060 --> 03:04:41.260
So you know what I remember?

03:04:41.260 --> 03:04:43.020
That's what came to me.

03:04:43.020 --> 03:04:47.180
I have something now which nobody else in the world has.

03:04:47.180 --> 03:04:49.060
I have a proof of, first of all, I did not,

03:04:49.060 --> 03:04:50.180
it was not just a proof.

03:04:50.180 --> 03:04:53.300
Like in the case of Fermat, the statement is already made.

03:04:53.300 --> 03:04:54.820
That's why it's called conjecture.

03:04:54.820 --> 03:04:57.220
You make a statement, you don't have a proof yet.

03:04:57.220 --> 03:04:58.180
Then you try to prove it.

03:04:58.180 --> 03:05:00.420
In my case, I did not know what the answer would be.

03:05:00.420 --> 03:05:03.860
There was a type of question where the answer was unknown.

03:05:03.860 --> 03:05:06.420
So I had to find the answer and prove it.

03:05:06.420 --> 03:05:08.020
And the answer was very nice.

03:05:08.020 --> 03:05:09.980
So nobody knew, as far as I could tell,

03:05:09.980 --> 03:05:12.740
nobody knew because my teacher told me

03:05:12.740 --> 03:05:14.820
that he explored all the literature.

03:05:14.820 --> 03:05:15.660
This was not known.

03:05:15.660 --> 03:05:19.940
So this was, suddenly I felt that I was in possession

03:05:21.380 --> 03:05:22.220
of this.

03:05:23.500 --> 03:05:24.980
Now it was a little thing.

03:05:24.980 --> 03:05:27.060
It was not cure for cancer, you know.

03:05:27.060 --> 03:05:31.220
It was not a large language model, you know.

03:05:31.220 --> 03:05:36.220
But it was something undeniably real, meaningful.

03:05:36.260 --> 03:05:38.500
And it was mine, kind of, you know, like I had it.

03:05:38.500 --> 03:05:39.860
Nobody else, I had not published it yet.

03:05:39.860 --> 03:05:42.180
I didn't even tell, I hadn't even told anybody.

03:05:42.180 --> 03:05:45.380
And it is a very strange feeling, you know, to have that.

03:05:45.380 --> 03:05:48.780
Were you worried that this treasure could be stolen?

03:05:48.780 --> 03:05:50.660
Not at the time, not at the time.

03:05:50.660 --> 03:05:52.500
So later on, there were situations

03:05:52.500 --> 03:05:55.300
where I was exposed to those type of experiences.

03:05:55.300 --> 03:05:56.620
But at that time, I didn't think of that.

03:05:56.620 --> 03:05:59.900
I was still this starry-eyed kid, you know,

03:05:59.900 --> 03:06:02.820
who was just obsessed with mathematics,

03:06:02.820 --> 03:06:04.500
with this beauty and discovery,

03:06:04.500 --> 03:06:08.260
discovering those beautiful facts, beautiful results.

03:06:08.260 --> 03:06:09.780
So I didn't think about,

03:06:09.780 --> 03:06:11.540
I didn't even think that it could be possible

03:06:11.540 --> 03:06:13.580
that somebody could steal it or whatever.

03:06:13.580 --> 03:06:16.660
I just wanted to share it with my teacher as soon as possible,

03:06:16.660 --> 03:06:19.940
you know, and he understood quickly.

03:06:19.940 --> 03:06:21.940
And he's like, yeah, good job, you know.

03:06:22.940 --> 03:06:26.260
Is there something you can give color to the drama?

03:06:26.260 --> 03:06:28.540
Eric has talked, Eric Weinstein has spoken

03:06:28.540 --> 03:06:30.860
about some of the challenges,

03:06:30.860 --> 03:06:34.740
some of the triumphs and challenges of his time at Harvard.

03:06:34.740 --> 03:06:39.740
So is there something to that drama

03:06:40.020 --> 03:06:42.860
of people stealing each other's ideas

03:06:42.860 --> 03:06:45.500
or not allocating credit enough?

03:06:45.500 --> 03:06:46.940
Oh, sure, yes.

03:06:46.940 --> 03:06:49.980
All of that and creating psychological stresses

03:06:49.980 --> 03:06:50.820
because of that.

03:06:50.820 --> 03:06:53.100
Happens all the time, yes, unfortunately.

03:06:53.100 --> 03:06:54.900
On young minds and so on.

03:06:54.900 --> 03:06:57.020
Could have a very bad effect.

03:06:57.020 --> 03:06:58.420
Is that just the way of life

03:06:59.260 --> 03:07:00.860
or is this...

03:07:00.860 --> 03:07:02.980
I think we can definitely do better.

03:07:02.980 --> 03:07:06.260
And I think the first step is to kind of admit

03:07:06.260 --> 03:07:10.740
that we are not 100% seekers of truth

03:07:10.740 --> 03:07:12.020
that we are human beings

03:07:12.020 --> 03:07:17.020
and all the good and bad and ugly qualities

03:07:18.940 --> 03:07:23.300
can be present and to have some kind of dialogue

03:07:23.300 --> 03:07:26.220
in my subject in mathematics.

03:07:26.220 --> 03:07:27.620
This has not happened yet.

03:07:27.620 --> 03:07:28.980
There have been some famous cases

03:07:28.980 --> 03:07:30.380
where people have been accused,

03:07:30.380 --> 03:07:34.820
which had been resolved or partially resolved or unresolved.

03:07:34.820 --> 03:07:36.860
And everybody knows it,

03:07:36.860 --> 03:07:38.860
but there isn't a systematic effort,

03:07:38.860 --> 03:07:40.500
as far as I can tell,

03:07:40.500 --> 03:07:44.340
of really trying to create some rules, some ethics rules.

03:07:44.340 --> 03:07:47.260
This is fair game, this is not fair game.

03:07:47.260 --> 03:07:50.780
So that as a community, we strive to get better.

03:07:50.780 --> 03:07:52.580
I think that for most people,

03:07:52.580 --> 03:07:55.180
it's more like keeping your head in the sand

03:07:55.180 --> 03:07:57.500
and kind of pretending that it doesn't happen.

03:07:58.340 --> 03:08:00.340
Or it happens, some isolated incidents.

03:08:00.340 --> 03:08:03.180
Well, my experience is not like that at all.

03:08:03.180 --> 03:08:06.580
I think it does happen much more often than it should.

03:08:06.580 --> 03:08:08.220
That's my opinion.

03:08:08.220 --> 03:08:11.580
So there's the pool of academia is fascinating.

03:08:11.580 --> 03:08:13.060
One of the reasons I really love it

03:08:13.060 --> 03:08:17.220
is you have young minds with fresh ideas.

03:08:17.220 --> 03:08:18.940
And that same innocence you had

03:08:18.940 --> 03:08:22.140
when you first on the train have that brilliant breakthrough.

03:08:22.140 --> 03:08:23.980
And then you throw that in together

03:08:24.740 --> 03:08:27.580
exceptional world-class scientists

03:08:27.580 --> 03:08:30.220
who have, first of all, are getting older.

03:08:32.540 --> 03:08:35.700
Second of all, maybe they have partaken

03:08:35.700 --> 03:08:40.340
in the drug of fame and money and status and recognition.

03:08:40.340 --> 03:08:43.100
So that starts to a little bit corrupt

03:08:43.100 --> 03:08:45.340
all of our human minds.

03:08:45.340 --> 03:08:47.420
And you throw that mix in together.

03:08:47.420 --> 03:08:48.620
Yeah.

03:08:48.620 --> 03:08:50.180
Mostly without rules.

03:08:51.180 --> 03:08:55.500
And it's beautiful because that's where the ideas of old

03:08:56.860 --> 03:09:00.220
contend with the new, wild-eyed, crazy ideas.

03:09:00.220 --> 03:09:02.620
And they clash and there's a tension

03:09:02.620 --> 03:09:04.700
and there's a dance to it.

03:09:04.700 --> 03:09:06.660
But then there's the old human corruption

03:09:06.660 --> 03:09:09.220
that can take advantage of the young minds.

03:09:10.500 --> 03:09:12.460
It's unclear what to do with that.

03:09:12.460 --> 03:09:14.020
I mean, part of that is just the way of life

03:09:14.020 --> 03:09:15.180
and there's tragedies.

03:09:16.580 --> 03:09:19.140
And oftentimes when you look at who wins the Nobel Prize,

03:09:19.260 --> 03:09:24.260
it's also tragic because sometimes so many minds are...

03:09:25.500 --> 03:09:28.140
The trajectory to the breakthrough idea

03:09:28.140 --> 03:09:30.900
involves so many different minds, young and old.

03:09:30.900 --> 03:09:31.900
Yeah, I mean...

03:09:35.100 --> 03:09:36.220
You're right.

03:09:36.220 --> 03:09:38.540
I think it's like everything else.

03:09:40.380 --> 03:09:42.900
The path is to more self-awareness.

03:09:42.900 --> 03:09:46.420
And it's like owning up your own stuff

03:09:46.420 --> 03:09:48.380
and not blaming other people,

03:09:48.380 --> 03:09:50.020
not projecting onto other people,

03:09:50.020 --> 03:09:52.100
but taking responsibility.

03:09:52.100 --> 03:09:53.820
And that's true for everything.

03:09:53.820 --> 03:09:58.220
And the problem here, unique problem for mathematics,

03:09:58.220 --> 03:10:00.620
I would say physicists and chemists are better.

03:10:00.620 --> 03:10:03.820
They actually have better sort of ethical rules and so on,

03:10:03.820 --> 03:10:05.020
especially biologists like.

03:10:05.020 --> 03:10:06.300
Because I think in part,

03:10:06.300 --> 03:10:08.460
it's because there is much more money involved

03:10:08.460 --> 03:10:09.900
because they have to get grants and so on.

03:10:09.900 --> 03:10:11.460
So for them, the question of priority,

03:10:11.460 --> 03:10:13.820
who discovered what first is much more serious

03:10:13.820 --> 03:10:15.780
because there's really some serious money.

03:10:15.780 --> 03:10:16.820
Mathematics, who cares?

03:10:17.100 --> 03:10:18.900
The Fermat's last theorem was proved.

03:10:18.900 --> 03:10:20.500
Did Andrew Wilde become a millionaire?

03:10:20.500 --> 03:10:21.340
No.

03:10:21.340 --> 03:10:22.540
But I think he got a prize.

03:10:22.540 --> 03:10:26.700
He won a prize, but those prizes are not...

03:10:26.700 --> 03:10:28.740
I think that one was a big prize,

03:10:28.740 --> 03:10:30.300
but in general, there's not going to be...

03:10:30.300 --> 03:10:31.700
I think he won the Abel Prize,

03:10:31.700 --> 03:10:33.900
eventually, which is about a million dollars.

03:10:37.020 --> 03:10:38.220
Sometimes I joke about this,

03:10:38.220 --> 03:10:40.900
that this is the hardest way to win a million dollars.

03:10:40.900 --> 03:10:45.900
So, you know, but amongst mathematicians,

03:10:47.260 --> 03:10:51.260
I think the trouble is that we are so insulated

03:10:52.980 --> 03:10:56.740
from society because it's such a pure subject.

03:10:56.740 --> 03:11:01.620
It draws in very specific psychological types.

03:11:01.620 --> 03:11:03.260
And I can speak about myself.

03:11:03.260 --> 03:11:04.740
I did not realize it at the time,

03:11:04.740 --> 03:11:07.180
but later on, I definitely saw,

03:11:07.180 --> 03:11:08.900
I mentioned some of it earlier,

03:11:08.900 --> 03:11:11.340
that for me, mathematics was a refuge

03:11:11.340 --> 03:11:13.180
from the cruelty of the life I experienced,

03:11:13.180 --> 03:11:15.460
from discrimination that I experienced

03:11:15.460 --> 03:11:17.380
when I applied to Moscow University at 16,

03:11:17.380 --> 03:11:19.580
being failed at the exam and stuff like that,

03:11:19.580 --> 03:11:21.140
which I describe in my book as well.

03:11:21.140 --> 03:11:24.460
But that was my way.

03:11:24.460 --> 03:11:27.180
I was like, I don't trust this world.

03:11:27.180 --> 03:11:29.100
I don't want to deal with it.

03:11:29.100 --> 03:11:33.900
I want to hide in this platonic reality of pure forms.

03:11:33.900 --> 03:11:36.900
This is where I know how to operate.

03:11:36.900 --> 03:11:40.500
I love this and I couldn't be bothered in some sense

03:11:40.500 --> 03:11:42.460
for a while, up to a point,

03:11:42.460 --> 03:11:45.100
as I was getting older and more mature,

03:11:45.100 --> 03:11:47.900
I was becoming more and more interested in other things.

03:11:48.980 --> 03:11:50.620
But I think that's one of the reasons.

03:11:50.620 --> 03:11:54.940
And one of the reasons why I wrote Love and Math

03:11:55.940 --> 03:11:58.580
was precisely to break that cycle,

03:11:58.580 --> 03:12:02.980
that it's the quiet guy in the corner that goes into math

03:12:02.980 --> 03:12:05.860
and not the flamboyant, you know,

03:12:06.100 --> 03:12:08.260
jock or like, you know, DJ.

03:12:09.340 --> 03:12:14.140
I wanted to show how beautiful the subject is,

03:12:14.140 --> 03:12:16.140
to attract this new blood

03:12:16.140 --> 03:12:19.860
so that different psychological types and more women

03:12:22.700 --> 03:12:26.260
would join because then they would have the students

03:12:26.260 --> 03:12:29.580
who would look at them and whom they will inspire.

03:12:29.580 --> 03:12:32.620
And then it would be, instead of a vicious circle,

03:12:32.620 --> 03:12:34.620
it would be a virtuous circle.

03:12:34.780 --> 03:12:36.420
And I have to say, I think it's happening,

03:12:36.420 --> 03:12:38.500
not because of my efforts alone,

03:12:38.500 --> 03:12:39.980
obviously there are many other mathematicians

03:12:39.980 --> 03:12:42.940
who are around the same time, started to put more effort.

03:12:42.940 --> 03:12:46.780
Because see, if the old stereotype of mathematician,

03:12:46.780 --> 03:12:48.700
you're so enclosed, you're not interested

03:12:48.700 --> 03:12:51.300
in even exposing the beauty of your subject

03:12:51.300 --> 03:12:52.820
to other people, you see?

03:12:52.820 --> 03:12:55.300
And then it becomes this vicious circle.

03:12:55.300 --> 03:12:57.700
But you know, this one day, not one day,

03:12:57.700 --> 03:13:00.500
all the time I meet the students who say,

03:13:01.420 --> 03:13:04.940
your book is the reason why I chose math as my major.

03:13:04.940 --> 03:13:07.140
And I am proud, especially when it's women

03:13:07.140 --> 03:13:08.180
who tell me this.

03:13:08.180 --> 03:13:11.860
And they are cool, they are DJs at the same time,

03:13:11.860 --> 03:13:14.860
and they are social and they have friends

03:13:14.860 --> 03:13:16.340
and they go out and so on.

03:13:16.340 --> 03:13:18.980
You see, so then they carry the torch

03:13:18.980 --> 03:13:20.940
because then they will be more likely

03:13:22.860 --> 03:13:26.700
to share this beauty with others,

03:13:26.700 --> 03:13:28.300
to attract more students and so on.

03:13:28.300 --> 03:13:30.540
So I think this dumb was broken.

03:13:30.540 --> 03:13:32.340
So now you have more influx.

03:13:32.340 --> 03:13:34.940
And once we have people who are more able

03:13:34.940 --> 03:13:36.780
to connect at the personal level,

03:13:36.780 --> 03:13:39.260
that's when we also become more self-aware

03:13:39.260 --> 03:13:42.460
as a community, I think, and that's when we might be,

03:13:42.460 --> 03:13:44.820
we should be able to have a chance to improve

03:13:44.820 --> 03:13:48.180
in terms of our ethical rules and stuff like that.

03:13:48.180 --> 03:13:51.620
So let me return to our friend Eric Weinstein

03:13:51.620 --> 03:13:53.900
for a question that I would ask anyway,

03:13:53.900 --> 03:13:57.900
but let's have a non-Russian ask the Russian question.

03:14:00.300 --> 03:14:03.260
Ask him about the Russian concepts of friendship,

03:14:03.260 --> 03:14:06.140
science, gender, and love versus the American.

03:14:10.980 --> 03:14:15.260
So there is a deep romanticism that you have

03:14:17.100 --> 03:14:19.500
that runs through your book, Love and Math.

03:14:20.500 --> 03:14:24.540
Is part of that something you've picked up

03:14:24.540 --> 03:14:26.060
from the Russian culture?

03:14:27.020 --> 03:14:31.620
What can you speak to that fueled both your fascination

03:14:31.620 --> 03:14:33.700
with math and your fascination, no,

03:14:33.700 --> 03:14:38.700
your prioritization of the human experience of love?

03:14:40.740 --> 03:14:41.820
Good question.

03:14:41.820 --> 03:14:46.420
Definitely there is some influence of the Russian culture,

03:14:46.420 --> 03:14:48.460
Russian literature, perhaps, you know.

03:14:49.500 --> 03:14:52.220
But also, you know, like there's so many things.

03:14:52.220 --> 03:14:54.740
How do we develop certain sensibilities?

03:14:54.740 --> 03:14:57.300
Like, why do we care about this and not that?

03:14:57.300 --> 03:15:00.460
Like, why do I care, for instance, about, like you said,

03:15:00.460 --> 03:15:04.460
about this romantic ideals, so to speak, of mathematics?

03:15:04.460 --> 03:15:07.460
That's certainly not something that is automatic.

03:15:07.460 --> 03:15:09.140
Some people care about it, some people don't.

03:15:09.140 --> 03:15:11.420
And I'm not saying it is superior or inferior.

03:15:11.420 --> 03:15:13.220
It's just how my composition,

03:15:13.220 --> 03:15:16.420
my psychological composition is like that.

03:15:16.420 --> 03:15:21.420
And it's an interesting question, like what is the cause of it?

03:15:21.780 --> 03:15:25.220
So I think that we cannot really know,

03:15:25.220 --> 03:15:27.260
but there are some aspects of it, of course.

03:15:27.260 --> 03:15:31.260
The experiences, life experiences are bringing family.

03:15:34.260 --> 03:15:37.260
Like I was, you know, I was surrounded by love

03:15:37.260 --> 03:15:41.780
by my parents on the one hand, but on the other side,

03:15:41.780 --> 03:15:44.420
perhaps they were a little overprotective of me.

03:15:44.420 --> 03:15:46.980
So I was kind of like, you know,

03:15:49.180 --> 03:15:51.100
too much kind of like taken care of.

03:15:51.100 --> 03:15:55.220
So then when I developed certain sensitivity,

03:15:55.220 --> 03:15:58.660
but I was kind of not ready for the challenges.

03:15:58.660 --> 03:15:59.500
The real world.

03:15:59.500 --> 03:16:00.340
Of the real world.

03:16:00.340 --> 03:16:04.740
So then that struggle and then being lost

03:16:04.740 --> 03:16:07.420
and then being able to overcome and to learn.

03:16:07.420 --> 03:16:12.300
And then if you do, in other words, if you don't lose,

03:16:12.300 --> 03:16:13.900
you don't appreciate maybe.

03:16:13.900 --> 03:16:18.100
But sometimes when we lose something and then regain it,

03:16:18.100 --> 03:16:19.620
then we cherish it, we appreciate it,

03:16:19.620 --> 03:16:21.180
and then it becomes something important.

03:16:21.180 --> 03:16:25.940
Also various difficulties, you know,

03:16:25.940 --> 03:16:28.420
the upsetting experiences

03:16:28.420 --> 03:16:30.420
or one could say traumatic experiences.

03:16:31.260 --> 03:16:35.660
Growing up in the Soviet Union, that was not a walking park.

03:16:35.660 --> 03:16:38.100
You know, there were a lot of issues there

03:16:39.220 --> 03:16:40.860
that I had to go through.

03:16:40.860 --> 03:16:45.860
And then it doesn't break you, makes you stronger.

03:16:46.460 --> 03:16:51.460
But in my case, what happened was that, you know,

03:16:53.420 --> 03:16:55.060
for some of it, it took me 30 years

03:16:55.060 --> 03:16:56.500
to really come to terms with it

03:16:56.500 --> 03:16:58.460
and to really understand what happened.

03:16:59.420 --> 03:17:02.420
It gave me this motivation to strive

03:17:05.420 --> 03:17:06.660
to become a mathematician,

03:17:06.660 --> 03:17:08.100
which maybe I wouldn't have otherwise.

03:17:08.100 --> 03:17:10.300
It charged me, supercharged me.

03:17:10.340 --> 03:17:11.500
I'm talking about, for instance,

03:17:11.500 --> 03:17:14.740
I experienced with exam at Moscow University.

03:17:14.740 --> 03:17:16.500
Can you take me through that experience?

03:17:16.500 --> 03:17:21.500
So this is 1984, we spoke about Orwell earlier.

03:17:21.980 --> 03:17:25.500
And I was applying to Moscow University

03:17:27.220 --> 03:17:30.380
mathematics department, it's called Mehmat.

03:17:30.380 --> 03:17:33.980
Which is like for people who don't know, like the place.

03:17:33.980 --> 03:17:35.780
Was the only place to study pure mathematics

03:17:35.780 --> 03:17:36.740
in Moscow, period.

03:17:36.740 --> 03:17:40.060
But also, that's there to be one of the great places

03:17:40.820 --> 03:17:41.660
on earth.

03:17:41.660 --> 03:17:44.460
And it's like a huge building, this, you know,

03:17:44.460 --> 03:17:47.420
this monolith of a building of Moscow University.

03:17:48.700 --> 03:17:53.380
So, because as I said, you know, a year earlier,

03:17:53.380 --> 03:17:56.100
Evgeny Evgenyevich converted me into math,

03:17:56.100 --> 03:17:59.100
capitalizing on my love for quantum physics.

03:17:59.100 --> 03:18:01.660
And so I spent a whole year studying with him

03:18:01.660 --> 03:18:05.420
and I was really kind of at the level of, you know,

03:18:05.900 --> 03:18:10.900
in some subjects, a level of like early graduate studies.

03:18:10.900 --> 03:18:12.780
So it seemed like it would be a breeze

03:18:12.780 --> 03:18:14.820
to get into Moscow University.

03:18:15.980 --> 03:18:20.180
But in fact, little did I know that there was

03:18:22.140 --> 03:18:25.900
a policy of antisemitism where students like me

03:18:25.900 --> 03:18:29.220
would be failed by special examiners.

03:18:29.220 --> 03:18:32.060
Mostly during the oral exam with mathematics,

03:18:32.060 --> 03:18:36.460
but occasionally I would be written tests and stuff.

03:18:37.540 --> 03:18:41.540
Now, my father is Jewish by blood.

03:18:41.540 --> 03:18:42.620
It was not religious.

03:18:42.620 --> 03:18:43.740
His family was not religious.

03:18:43.740 --> 03:18:44.740
My mom is Russian.

03:18:45.900 --> 03:18:49.020
And, but I was, since my last name was my father's name.

03:18:49.020 --> 03:18:54.020
So it was very easy to read what my nationality was.

03:18:54.220 --> 03:18:57.380
And so there was, can you imagine there was special people

03:18:57.380 --> 03:19:01.300
who would screen up applicants who would put aside the files

03:19:01.340 --> 03:19:03.540
of the undesirables.

03:19:03.540 --> 03:19:04.900
There would be special examiners

03:19:04.900 --> 03:19:07.780
who were actually professors at this university

03:19:07.780 --> 03:19:12.780
who would be designated as those who would take the exam

03:19:13.100 --> 03:19:15.100
from those undesirables.

03:19:15.100 --> 03:19:17.740
It was, it's almost comical when you look back now.

03:19:17.740 --> 03:19:19.820
And also like questions, why?

03:19:19.820 --> 03:19:22.820
There was no reason other than just hatred of the other.

03:19:22.820 --> 03:19:23.660
That's how I see it.

03:19:23.660 --> 03:19:25.500
It's just to give a little bit more color.

03:19:25.500 --> 03:19:29.460
So, because you mentioned nationality,

03:19:29.460 --> 03:19:32.620
it's a little quirk that perhaps gives an insight

03:19:32.620 --> 03:19:35.460
to the bigger system that the nationality listed

03:19:35.460 --> 03:19:38.340
on your birth certificate when you're Jewish is Jewish.

03:19:38.340 --> 03:19:40.860
And when you're non-Jewish is listed as Russian.

03:19:40.860 --> 03:19:42.140
For me, it was Russian.

03:19:42.140 --> 03:19:44.100
So first of all, in the inner part,

03:19:44.100 --> 03:19:46.260
everybody has an internal passport.

03:19:47.100 --> 03:19:52.100
And there you have first name, patronymic name, last name,

03:19:52.460 --> 03:19:54.140
date of birth, so these are four.

03:19:54.140 --> 03:19:57.420
And the fifth colon is nationality,

03:19:58.420 --> 03:20:01.820
which comes from the nationality of the parents and so on.

03:20:01.820 --> 03:20:02.900
In my case, it was written Russian

03:20:02.900 --> 03:20:05.380
because my mom was Russian, but it didn't save me.

03:20:05.380 --> 03:20:10.420
Because that was my dad's last name.

03:20:10.420 --> 03:20:15.100
And so anyway, this was the toughest experience

03:20:15.100 --> 03:20:17.660
that I had up until that point.

03:20:18.700 --> 03:20:22.100
And there was this two people who came into the room

03:20:22.100 --> 03:20:24.380
where I was the only undesirable.

03:20:24.380 --> 03:20:27.340
All other kids were being questioned by other examiners,

03:20:28.260 --> 03:20:30.500
but they told me that we cannot question you.

03:20:30.500 --> 03:20:32.900
We are waiting for special examiners.

03:20:32.900 --> 03:20:36.420
So I was like, oh, oh, something is afoot.

03:20:36.420 --> 03:20:39.420
And so these two guys came and for four hours,

03:20:39.420 --> 03:20:41.060
basically were asking me questions

03:20:41.060 --> 03:20:42.580
which were not in the program and so on.

03:20:42.580 --> 03:20:44.260
But I was like, I was 16 years old.

03:20:44.260 --> 03:20:46.860
I tried to answer the best I can, but it was a setup.

03:20:47.860 --> 03:20:50.020
It's been documented since then.

03:20:50.020 --> 03:20:52.780
There are even lists of problems

03:20:52.780 --> 03:20:55.980
that were given to undesirables in those days.

03:20:55.980 --> 03:21:00.380
In my year, no Jewish applicants, as far as I know,

03:21:00.380 --> 03:21:04.140
Jewish by this metric were accepted.

03:21:04.140 --> 03:21:05.580
So then I had to go to this,

03:21:07.660 --> 03:21:10.580
there was one school, technical school in Moscow,

03:21:10.580 --> 03:21:13.380
which was the Institute for Oil and Gas Exploration,

03:21:13.380 --> 03:21:16.780
which had applied mathematics program.

03:21:16.780 --> 03:21:21.500
And that's where many of the kids

03:21:21.500 --> 03:21:24.420
who were not accepted to Moscow University ended up.

03:21:25.260 --> 03:21:30.140
And so, but the point is, so, and then I was,

03:21:30.140 --> 03:21:31.900
I was so motivated by this

03:21:31.900 --> 03:21:36.780
because I wanted to show those guys, you know,

03:21:36.780 --> 03:21:39.900
that within five years, less than five years,

03:21:39.900 --> 03:21:43.220
I got a letter from the president of Harvard University

03:21:43.220 --> 03:21:45.620
inviting me as a visiting professor to Harvard.

03:21:45.620 --> 03:21:47.900
I was 21, I was barely 21

03:21:47.900 --> 03:21:51.180
because I already did some research in the meantime.

03:21:51.180 --> 03:21:54.380
That's how motivated I was, you know.

03:21:55.380 --> 03:21:57.420
But the interesting aspect of it is that

03:21:59.180 --> 03:22:01.820
for the longest time afterwards,

03:22:01.820 --> 03:22:05.020
I was telling myself a story that nothing really happened.

03:22:06.140 --> 03:22:07.340
It wasn't so bad.

03:22:07.340 --> 03:22:08.340
Okay, so I was failed,

03:22:08.340 --> 03:22:12.420
but I knew that I was going to succeed.

03:22:13.540 --> 03:22:18.540
It was 30 years later that I finally got to meet that boy,

03:22:19.180 --> 03:22:24.180
that 16 year old, that I neglected at this time.

03:22:24.340 --> 03:22:28.580
And I realized that he died, that it was a crushing blow.

03:22:28.580 --> 03:22:29.940
The innocence?

03:22:29.940 --> 03:22:32.860
Not just the innocence because there was no way,

03:22:32.860 --> 03:22:35.300
it looked like there was no way I could become a mathematician

03:22:35.300 --> 03:22:40.220
because if they don't accept me there, it's over.

03:22:40.220 --> 03:22:43.060
I didn't know that I could actually find

03:22:43.060 --> 03:22:46.300
this striving applied math program.

03:22:46.300 --> 03:22:48.620
And then eventually somebody would take me under his wing

03:22:48.620 --> 03:22:51.300
and so on, and then could move to the United States.

03:22:51.300 --> 03:22:54.300
This was not in the realm of possibilities.

03:22:54.300 --> 03:22:57.380
So in other words, there was nothing to look forward to.

03:22:57.380 --> 03:22:59.140
It was clear that it's over.

03:22:59.140 --> 03:23:03.300
I cannot do what I love.

03:23:04.980 --> 03:23:09.980
And so when I finally connected to that boy,

03:23:11.300 --> 03:23:14.220
oh my God, that was a totally different experience.

03:23:14.220 --> 03:23:18.980
All the pain and all the trauma came to the surface

03:23:18.980 --> 03:23:22.700
and it was a kind of a tsunami.

03:23:22.700 --> 03:23:26.940
I wasn't sure I would survive this, it was so hard.

03:23:26.940 --> 03:23:28.740
And what happened was I was invited

03:23:28.740 --> 03:23:31.980
to give a talk about this in New York.

03:23:33.140 --> 03:23:37.340
It was kind of a spoken word event about science,

03:23:37.340 --> 03:23:39.780
but like personal experiences related to science.

03:23:39.780 --> 03:23:43.820
This was almost a year after my book came out.

03:23:43.820 --> 03:23:46.460
In my book, one of the first chapters

03:23:46.460 --> 03:23:48.820
is a chapter about this experience.

03:23:49.820 --> 03:23:51.980
But what I realize now is that I wrote it

03:23:51.980 --> 03:23:54.140
from the third person perspective.

03:23:54.140 --> 03:23:57.300
I knew the facts, but I was not emotionally connected

03:23:57.300 --> 03:23:58.140
to that experience.

03:23:58.140 --> 03:24:00.700
However, since I wanted to write the book

03:24:00.700 --> 03:24:04.740
and to connect to my readers, I allowed the boy to write it.

03:24:05.740 --> 03:24:07.780
So a lot of people were touched by it

03:24:07.780 --> 03:24:10.420
and they would, people would say, wow, that chapter,

03:24:10.420 --> 03:24:12.340
it really got a lot of resonance.

03:24:12.340 --> 03:24:13.780
It was translated into another language

03:24:13.780 --> 03:24:16.340
even before the book was published.

03:24:16.340 --> 03:24:19.380
I was surprised by this because I didn't know yet.

03:24:19.380 --> 03:24:22.540
So the adult Edward was not yet in touch,

03:24:22.540 --> 03:24:26.780
but the book gave the outlet to the child.

03:24:29.060 --> 03:24:32.380
And that kind of started the process.

03:24:32.380 --> 03:24:36.620
So finally, almost a year later,

03:24:36.620 --> 03:24:40.340
I'm in New York in this event.

03:24:40.340 --> 03:24:44.020
And the night before I'm in my hotel room

03:24:44.020 --> 03:24:46.540
and I was like, okay, what am I going to talk about tomorrow?

03:24:46.540 --> 03:24:48.580
And I take a piece of paper just to,

03:24:48.580 --> 03:24:50.980
my usual preparation for things.

03:24:51.940 --> 03:24:53.460
And then suddenly I have this vision

03:24:53.460 --> 03:24:55.940
that I will walk up to the microphone tomorrow

03:24:55.940 --> 03:24:58.820
and I will just start crying.

03:25:00.860 --> 03:25:05.860
And I was like, by that time, I already had an insight

03:25:06.580 --> 03:25:10.020
that it's possible to have that kind of a splitting,

03:25:10.020 --> 03:25:11.820
kind of dissociation.

03:25:12.460 --> 03:25:14.900
But things were happening quickly.

03:25:14.900 --> 03:25:16.980
There was someone in my life who explained to me this idea

03:25:16.980 --> 03:25:21.020
that some things are under the radar of awareness,

03:25:21.020 --> 03:25:23.260
but they may still influence you.

03:25:23.260 --> 03:25:25.900
And a lot of that could be connected

03:25:25.900 --> 03:25:29.420
to some experiences in your childhood.

03:25:29.420 --> 03:25:32.860
So I was kind of ready for it from different angles,

03:25:32.860 --> 03:25:35.500
but I was so surprised because I was like,

03:25:35.500 --> 03:25:36.500
what is there to remember?

03:25:36.500 --> 03:25:38.460
I know, I know everything.

03:25:38.460 --> 03:25:40.060
So then my inner voice says,

03:25:40.100 --> 03:25:42.900
all right then, you have nothing to worry about.

03:25:42.900 --> 03:25:46.340
Go tomorrow and you will speak about this.

03:25:46.340 --> 03:25:48.740
And if you start crying, it's not a problem.

03:25:48.740 --> 03:25:52.100
I was like, no, I don't want to cry in front of people.

03:25:52.100 --> 03:25:54.900
I want to find out what it is, what happened.

03:25:54.900 --> 03:25:58.700
And I sat on my bed, closed my eyes and it came.

03:26:00.460 --> 03:26:03.180
So it's hard to describe.

03:26:03.180 --> 03:26:07.980
So this is what, and the sheer energy of it

03:26:08.020 --> 03:26:10.780
and how much effort it took to suppress it actually

03:26:10.780 --> 03:26:13.340
for all these years, how much effort it took

03:26:13.340 --> 03:26:17.500
to build that, I wouldn't say in Russian,

03:26:17.500 --> 03:26:20.420
that hardcore around myself.

03:26:20.420 --> 03:26:23.540
So that, and the thing, later I realized

03:26:23.540 --> 03:26:26.460
there were moments when it could come out.

03:26:26.460 --> 03:26:31.060
And for instance, I developed this fear of public speaking,

03:26:31.060 --> 03:26:35.180
all kinds of little things that I now feel were connected.

03:26:35.180 --> 03:26:37.980
So anyway, I saw what happened now

03:26:37.980 --> 03:26:39.900
through the eyes of that child.

03:26:39.900 --> 03:26:43.020
I saw how difficult it was, how crushed he was.

03:26:44.060 --> 03:26:46.060
And it looked completely hopeless.

03:26:46.060 --> 03:26:48.700
And I felt like, what's the point of living now for me,

03:26:48.700 --> 03:26:52.340
now that I know how cruel this world is,

03:26:52.340 --> 03:26:53.500
which I didn't realize before,

03:26:53.500 --> 03:26:56.580
because I prefer to wear this pink,

03:26:56.580 --> 03:26:59.180
the rose colored glasses.

03:27:00.500 --> 03:27:03.340
But then something happened, it's so strange.

03:27:04.260 --> 03:27:05.900
It's like you feel that inside of you

03:27:05.900 --> 03:27:07.660
there is this dead child.

03:27:07.660 --> 03:27:09.500
And it is incredibly sad.

03:27:09.500 --> 03:27:13.780
I mean, it's like, I can't even describe it.

03:27:13.780 --> 03:27:15.620
But suddenly he comes alive.

03:27:15.620 --> 03:27:19.140
And suddenly it's like, oh, he's here.

03:27:19.140 --> 03:27:21.420
And I had a little talk with him and I said,

03:27:21.420 --> 03:27:23.460
look, you know, and now I thank you.

03:27:23.460 --> 03:27:26.740
I'm so sorry that I neglected you for so long.

03:27:26.740 --> 03:27:29.180
You know, I didn't know.

03:27:29.180 --> 03:27:32.060
I thank you for doing this.

03:27:32.060 --> 03:27:33.340
And it's almost like, you know,

03:27:33.340 --> 03:27:36.620
I felt like the image came to mind is like a fallen soldier.

03:27:36.620 --> 03:27:39.300
Like you leave a fallen soldier on the battlefield,

03:27:39.300 --> 03:27:42.460
a wounded soldier, and then you come back

03:27:42.460 --> 03:27:44.500
to take him with you.

03:27:44.500 --> 03:27:48.020
And I said, but look, look what we have done.

03:27:48.020 --> 03:27:49.500
Look at us now.

03:27:49.500 --> 03:27:51.020
He was not in vain.

03:27:51.020 --> 03:27:52.260
We are doing okay.

03:27:53.140 --> 03:27:56.460
And it's kind of almost just like holding,

03:27:56.460 --> 03:28:01.460
holding, holding that child and that child.

03:28:02.420 --> 03:28:06.700
That sense of who I am, you know, and feeling it.

03:28:06.700 --> 03:28:11.100
So the next day I went to the microphone

03:28:11.100 --> 03:28:13.100
and I let him speak for the first time

03:28:14.180 --> 03:28:17.100
about his experience in his own voice.

03:28:17.100 --> 03:28:17.980
It was incredible.

03:28:17.980 --> 03:28:21.180
People were crying and afterwards came up to me

03:28:21.180 --> 03:28:22.980
and started sharing stories and so on.

03:28:22.980 --> 03:28:25.300
Because it is a story, it's a universal story.

03:28:25.300 --> 03:28:27.260
It's archetypal story.

03:28:27.300 --> 03:28:32.300
It's the story of rejection and being treated unfairly.

03:28:33.100 --> 03:28:35.140
We all know it.

03:28:35.140 --> 03:28:38.100
And I think it's so important to realize

03:28:38.100 --> 03:28:42.020
that it's possible to revisit those moments.

03:28:42.020 --> 03:28:44.820
It's possible to reconnect to our little ones.

03:28:44.820 --> 03:28:46.460
It's possible to bring them back.

03:28:47.380 --> 03:28:49.620
And we are better for it

03:28:49.620 --> 03:28:53.100
because this changed my life, this experience.

03:28:53.100 --> 03:28:55.380
Then suddenly it's like a floodgates.

03:28:55.380 --> 03:28:57.220
There were many other things that came.

03:28:58.100 --> 03:29:00.940
That's when I became interested

03:29:00.940 --> 03:29:04.300
in the dimensions of imagination and intuition and so on.

03:29:04.300 --> 03:29:07.140
Because suddenly I realized that I was deprived

03:29:07.140 --> 03:29:09.460
of that possibility of looking at the world

03:29:09.460 --> 03:29:10.380
through the eyes of a child

03:29:10.380 --> 03:29:12.860
because that child was frozen in time.

03:29:12.860 --> 03:29:17.140
I was not connected to him, but suddenly he's with me.

03:29:17.140 --> 03:29:20.740
And he's like, almost like opens his doors

03:29:20.740 --> 03:29:23.740
and says, look at this, look at this.

03:29:25.380 --> 03:29:30.380
So if I could ask you about, there's a difficult idea here.

03:29:36.140 --> 03:29:37.460
There's a tension.

03:29:37.460 --> 03:29:41.060
I've interacted with a few folks in my personal life

03:29:41.060 --> 03:29:45.020
and in general that have lived through this experience

03:29:45.020 --> 03:29:49.460
of unfairness and cruelty in the world as young people.

03:29:49.740 --> 03:29:54.740
And what wisdom do you draw from the action you took

03:30:00.940 --> 03:30:04.100
of not acknowledging that you're a victim to cruelty,

03:30:04.100 --> 03:30:06.980
but instead just working your ass off, working harder?

03:30:08.940 --> 03:30:12.140
And then the flip side of that

03:30:12.140 --> 03:30:14.420
is you eventually reconnecting

03:30:14.420 --> 03:30:16.460
with the cruelty that you experienced.

03:30:16.460 --> 03:30:18.540
Because if you did that early on,

03:30:18.580 --> 03:30:19.620
I was not ready for it.

03:30:19.620 --> 03:30:21.300
It is a defense mechanism.

03:30:21.300 --> 03:30:23.580
I could have come, you know, there were kids

03:30:23.580 --> 03:30:25.580
who commit suicide after this experience.

03:30:25.580 --> 03:30:28.140
I could have committed suicide because it's too much.

03:30:28.140 --> 03:30:31.020
And it is well known afterwards, of course,

03:30:31.020 --> 03:30:32.860
I became aware of all the literature

03:30:33.980 --> 03:30:36.340
about childhood trauma and so on.

03:30:36.340 --> 03:30:40.940
And I have been speaking publicly about it since then too.

03:30:40.940 --> 03:30:44.500
And so, you know, it is well known issue

03:30:44.540 --> 03:30:49.540
and well known kind of a universal phenomenon.

03:30:50.180 --> 03:30:53.220
I think that, interestingly enough,

03:30:53.220 --> 03:30:56.780
even though now I see a lot of discussion of it,

03:30:56.780 --> 03:30:58.380
now that my eyes are open,

03:30:58.380 --> 03:31:00.500
but somehow before I didn't see it.

03:31:00.500 --> 03:31:04.020
So that, which also shows you how our confirmation bias,

03:31:04.020 --> 03:31:06.140
kind of like how we screen ourselves,

03:31:06.140 --> 03:31:07.740
how we turn the blind eye to things

03:31:07.740 --> 03:31:09.060
which do not confirm our views

03:31:09.060 --> 03:31:10.540
or for which we are not yet ready.

03:31:10.540 --> 03:31:13.620
And by the way, nobody should push to do it too soon.

03:31:13.620 --> 03:31:18.620
I'm glad I developed certain strength.

03:31:18.900 --> 03:31:23.900
I was confident, I was strong to withstand this.

03:31:25.140 --> 03:31:28.420
And if I weren't, who knows how it could turn out.

03:31:28.420 --> 03:31:31.900
So it is a very subtle kind of alchemical process,

03:31:31.900 --> 03:31:35.380
which I don't think there is a recipe, there's a formula.

03:31:36.500 --> 03:31:38.180
The reason I'm talking about this

03:31:38.180 --> 03:31:40.340
is just to share this experience

03:31:40.340 --> 03:31:43.180
because I think that the only thing we can do in this

03:31:43.220 --> 03:31:45.460
in some sense is to share with each other

03:31:45.460 --> 03:31:49.340
because then we can find, for instance,

03:31:49.340 --> 03:31:54.020
if somebody shared with me, it would naturally lead me

03:31:54.020 --> 03:31:57.180
maybe to get closer to that kind of understanding.

03:31:57.180 --> 03:31:59.220
It's really just personal stories.

03:31:59.220 --> 03:32:04.220
It's not, obviously there is a component

03:32:04.940 --> 03:32:06.740
where professionals could be involved,

03:32:06.740 --> 03:32:08.540
professional therapists and so on.

03:32:08.540 --> 03:32:11.540
In my case, it somehow happened miraculously.

03:32:11.540 --> 03:32:12.940
Well, I did have support,

03:32:12.940 --> 03:32:15.380
but not from professional therapists,

03:32:15.380 --> 03:32:17.340
but from like dear friends.

03:32:17.340 --> 03:32:20.900
So I did have, I had somebody at the time

03:32:20.900 --> 03:32:23.620
who basically held my hand through this experience.

03:32:23.620 --> 03:32:26.740
Yes, it was invaluable and it could not be done otherwise.

03:32:28.260 --> 03:32:30.580
So I think it's very common.

03:32:30.580 --> 03:32:32.380
And here's the thing.

03:32:35.580 --> 03:32:39.660
I would not do it any other way.

03:32:40.340 --> 03:32:45.020
When I reconnected and I saw all the horrors and so on,

03:32:45.020 --> 03:32:49.060
but I also was able to see that my examiners

03:32:49.060 --> 03:32:54.060
were victims of their own situation

03:32:54.060 --> 03:32:58.420
that they fell for this bogus theories,

03:32:58.420 --> 03:33:01.420
or maybe it was more of a issue of career advancement

03:33:01.420 --> 03:33:02.500
or something.

03:33:02.500 --> 03:33:05.940
And I also realized they must have suffered as well

03:33:05.940 --> 03:33:09.020
because they must have had some kind of consciousness

03:33:09.780 --> 03:33:13.500
about it, that acting in this way towards sort of

03:33:13.500 --> 03:33:14.620
basically kids.

03:33:16.060 --> 03:33:17.860
So it wasn't pretty from their point of view.

03:33:17.860 --> 03:33:22.860
So I could forgive them and I could also appreciate

03:33:22.980 --> 03:33:27.100
what a boost of energy it gave me.

03:33:27.100 --> 03:33:29.780
If I was accepted and I was just where

03:33:29.780 --> 03:33:32.660
I was a first year student, I would live in a dorm

03:33:32.660 --> 03:33:36.380
because I would be probably partying and drinking

03:33:36.380 --> 03:33:38.180
and who knows what, maybe I wouldn't even

03:33:38.180 --> 03:33:39.980
become a mathematician.

03:33:39.980 --> 03:33:43.740
But this focused me like a laser

03:33:43.740 --> 03:33:45.420
without me even thinking about it.

03:33:45.420 --> 03:33:46.460
It just happened.

03:33:46.460 --> 03:33:50.060
I didn't care about anything but doing mathematics

03:33:50.060 --> 03:33:52.500
and it paid off, it changed my life.

03:33:52.500 --> 03:33:54.100
So was it good or bad?

03:33:55.620 --> 03:33:56.460
Paradox.

03:33:57.820 --> 03:33:59.460
Seems like life is full of those.

03:34:01.340 --> 03:34:03.660
You said you lost your father four years ago.

03:34:04.940 --> 03:34:07.740
What have you learned about life from your dad?

03:34:08.380 --> 03:34:10.140
That's another big one.

03:34:10.140 --> 03:34:11.980
Yeah, because I was very close to him

03:34:12.980 --> 03:34:16.700
and it was tough, it was tough.

03:34:16.700 --> 03:34:21.700
And I was not, I was sort of not ready for it

03:34:21.980 --> 03:34:24.740
because up until that point, I lived pretending

03:34:24.740 --> 03:34:26.060
that death does not exist.

03:34:27.100 --> 03:34:31.260
When my grandparents died, I was already in the US.

03:34:31.260 --> 03:34:33.540
So it was very convenient and I couldn't go back.

03:34:33.540 --> 03:34:38.300
So I grieved, but it kind of was a bit abstract for me.

03:34:38.300 --> 03:34:43.300
I didn't see their dead bodies, I didn't bury them and so on.

03:34:43.620 --> 03:34:48.180
So I waited till the, so the first death in my life

03:34:48.180 --> 03:34:52.220
was my father, like really close loved ones.

03:34:52.220 --> 03:34:53.900
And I was absolutely devastated.

03:34:55.780 --> 03:34:59.220
He was such an amazing creature, such an amazing human being.

03:34:59.220 --> 03:35:03.220
He was the kindest, the smartest, the most funny,

03:35:04.180 --> 03:35:06.860
just really funny and just really fun to be with.

03:35:07.780 --> 03:35:09.260
This is what I miss, obviously.

03:35:09.260 --> 03:35:11.620
I mean, I would just love to hang out with him.

03:35:13.740 --> 03:35:15.620
And then suddenly he's not there.

03:35:15.620 --> 03:35:19.260
So it was tough, but it kind of changed my perspective.

03:35:19.260 --> 03:35:20.580
You miss him?

03:35:20.580 --> 03:35:21.900
I miss him tremendously.

03:35:23.860 --> 03:35:26.420
I miss him tremendously, but in a way,

03:35:26.420 --> 03:35:28.700
I learned that he never left me in some sense.

03:35:28.700 --> 03:35:32.460
I mean, it sounds so, words are so like,

03:35:32.460 --> 03:35:37.060
they are, you cannot express in words this,

03:35:37.060 --> 03:35:40.420
what I'm trying to say, but-

03:35:40.420 --> 03:35:42.900
Do you carry him with you?

03:35:42.900 --> 03:35:45.940
Yeah, but in some sense, I always did.

03:35:45.940 --> 03:35:50.940
And I saw that, that it's always been,

03:35:53.540 --> 03:35:56.060
it was really, we were one in some sense, you know,

03:35:56.060 --> 03:36:01.060
like we were, but there was this experience of two people,

03:36:03.140 --> 03:36:06.580
being together and that I miss tremendously.

03:36:07.900 --> 03:36:09.740
But he gave me so much.

03:36:09.740 --> 03:36:12.820
And, you know, let me tell you one aspect of it,

03:36:12.820 --> 03:36:15.700
for instance, when he was a kid,

03:36:15.700 --> 03:36:19.300
his father was sent to Gulag on bogus pretenses, right?

03:36:19.300 --> 03:36:22.860
So he, when he was 16, he applied to a university.

03:36:22.860 --> 03:36:25.180
He wanted to become a theoretical physicist.

03:36:25.180 --> 03:36:26.780
By the way, my love for theoretical physics

03:36:26.780 --> 03:36:30.420
was to a large extent because of that.

03:36:30.420 --> 03:36:33.180
And he was not accepted, even though he was brilliant,

03:36:33.180 --> 03:36:35.740
because he was the son of the enemy of the people.

03:36:36.940 --> 03:36:41.380
And he kind of broke him, this experience,

03:36:41.380 --> 03:36:44.900
that he didn't care when he was, you know,

03:36:44.900 --> 03:36:47.180
he went to technical school and he didn't really care.

03:36:47.180 --> 03:36:48.500
That's my take on it.

03:36:49.540 --> 03:36:53.500
And then he ended up in this little provincial town

03:36:53.500 --> 03:36:55.580
and he thought he would escape from it as soon as possible.

03:36:55.580 --> 03:36:57.940
And then he met my mother and they fell in love.

03:36:57.940 --> 03:37:02.940
And so I am sort of the product of that, you know.

03:37:04.340 --> 03:37:07.660
But then what I learned is that,

03:37:09.340 --> 03:37:13.580
because he was not able to overcome that specific experience,

03:37:13.580 --> 03:37:15.180
it fell to me to do it.

03:37:15.180 --> 03:37:18.540
And if I didn't, my son or my daughter would have,

03:37:18.540 --> 03:37:21.220
I think that that was one of the things I learned.

03:37:21.220 --> 03:37:22.500
That it was not by chance.

03:37:22.500 --> 03:37:26.980
That about the same age, for slightly different reasons,

03:37:26.980 --> 03:37:30.380
I was subjected to the same kind of unfairness and cruelty.

03:37:31.540 --> 03:37:34.420
And I, in some ways, I feel like I did it for him also.

03:37:34.420 --> 03:37:38.380
I always, because he was also always so proud of me.

03:37:38.380 --> 03:37:39.540
I was so happy.

03:37:39.540 --> 03:37:43.220
And I was, I had this tremendous gift twice.

03:37:43.220 --> 03:37:46.220
I was invited by American Mathematical Society

03:37:46.220 --> 03:37:48.340
to give this big lectures twice.

03:37:48.340 --> 03:37:51.140
It was in 2012 and in 2018.

03:37:52.380 --> 03:37:54.580
And both times they were in Boston.

03:37:54.580 --> 03:37:56.300
It could be anywhere in the U.S.

03:37:56.340 --> 03:37:58.260
Both times was in Boston,

03:37:58.260 --> 03:38:00.860
walking distance from my parents' place.

03:38:00.860 --> 03:38:02.780
So he could be there in my mom as well.

03:38:03.780 --> 03:38:06.620
And that was such a gift that he was beaming,

03:38:06.620 --> 03:38:08.860
you know, like seeing me on the stage.

03:38:10.380 --> 03:38:12.820
So, you know.

03:38:14.300 --> 03:38:17.940
Now that he's no longer here and it's just you.

03:38:17.940 --> 03:38:19.060
Well, I still have my mom.

03:38:19.060 --> 03:38:19.900
I still have my sister.

03:38:19.900 --> 03:38:23.740
Yeah, but as a man, there's some aspect that it's,

03:38:26.780 --> 03:38:29.060
that it does hit you hard.

03:38:29.060 --> 03:38:30.780
Are you afraid of your own death?

03:38:30.780 --> 03:38:32.940
Do you think about your death?

03:38:32.940 --> 03:38:34.740
Are you afraid of it?

03:38:34.740 --> 03:38:38.820
I have a certain conceptual view of life and death today,

03:38:38.820 --> 03:38:40.380
which is informed by my experiences.

03:38:40.380 --> 03:38:43.100
In particular, going through my father's death.

03:38:43.100 --> 03:38:48.060
And that is something which cannot be conceptualized.

03:38:48.060 --> 03:38:51.580
Like that experience, like it cannot give it to somebody.

03:38:52.620 --> 03:38:55.780
One thing I will say is that I felt

03:38:55.900 --> 03:38:58.820
what it was, it was actually love totally exposed,

03:38:58.820 --> 03:39:00.580
like naked.

03:39:01.460 --> 03:39:04.580
And you try to throw, it is so acute.

03:39:04.580 --> 03:39:07.940
So being facing that love is incredibly painful

03:39:07.940 --> 03:39:09.900
because it's so intense.

03:39:09.900 --> 03:39:14.300
When a person is alive, we have conversation,

03:39:14.300 --> 03:39:16.060
we have words, we have some actions,

03:39:16.060 --> 03:39:18.980
we have some stuff that's going on and it puts a filter.

03:39:18.980 --> 03:39:22.420
So we rarely actually feel love

03:39:22.460 --> 03:39:26.820
in this totally, completely pure unadulterated state.

03:39:26.820 --> 03:39:30.260
But when a person dies, it's there and it's staring at you.

03:39:30.260 --> 03:39:32.220
And no matter what you do, you cannot turn away.

03:39:32.220 --> 03:39:34.460
Like I tried to, it's like, almost I felt like

03:39:34.460 --> 03:39:36.380
I want to throw a blanket over it.

03:39:37.340 --> 03:39:41.140
It burns like immediately like boom, gone.

03:39:41.140 --> 03:39:41.980
It's there.

03:39:43.180 --> 03:39:44.460
Live through it.

03:39:44.460 --> 03:39:47.100
And I kept saying to myself, just live through it,

03:39:47.100 --> 03:39:48.020
live through it.

03:39:48.020 --> 03:39:49.620
That's how you, and that's how you know,

03:39:49.620 --> 03:39:52.060
also learn what is love, for example.

03:39:52.060 --> 03:39:53.660
What is it really?

03:39:53.660 --> 03:39:54.500
What is love?

03:39:54.500 --> 03:39:55.700
What is life also?

03:39:55.700 --> 03:39:59.340
Because I was completely, I had no idea.

03:39:59.340 --> 03:40:02.540
And then you kind of learn that, okay,

03:40:02.540 --> 03:40:07.540
so maybe it's not quite, there's more to it.

03:40:08.980 --> 03:40:09.980
There's more to it.

03:40:09.980 --> 03:40:11.780
There's more to this experience

03:40:11.780 --> 03:40:16.780
than what can be put in a concept or in a sentence,

03:40:17.220 --> 03:40:22.220
in maybe poetry or music can do some justice to it.

03:40:22.660 --> 03:40:26.100
But if so, then my own life has that component,

03:40:26.100 --> 03:40:29.340
has that dimension, which is beyond anything

03:40:29.340 --> 03:40:31.100
I can say about it.

03:40:31.100 --> 03:40:35.380
And even though I love this being this, playing this role,

03:40:35.380 --> 03:40:36.220
I love it.

03:40:37.300 --> 03:40:40.860
And I kind of, it kind of makes me feel different

03:40:40.860 --> 03:40:43.180
about all kinds of difficulties that arise

03:40:43.180 --> 03:40:46.100
because it's almost like I want to enjoy it

03:40:46.100 --> 03:40:48.260
because that's what being human is.

03:40:48.260 --> 03:40:51.060
It's being terrified.

03:40:51.060 --> 03:40:53.020
It's being frustrated.

03:40:53.020 --> 03:40:55.940
It's being self-loathing sometimes.

03:40:55.940 --> 03:40:59.740
It's not knowing, but also being joyful

03:40:59.740 --> 03:41:03.260
and just like, ah, let's just enjoy it.

03:41:03.260 --> 03:41:07.180
Kind of all of it, like that's why you came here for

03:41:07.180 --> 03:41:08.980
in some sense, you know?

03:41:08.980 --> 03:41:12.180
It's like not trying to run away from things,

03:41:12.180 --> 03:41:14.660
but kind of trying to just live through them

03:41:14.660 --> 03:41:15.780
and appreciate.

03:41:15.780 --> 03:41:17.980
So the biggest thing is gratitude in some sense.

03:41:17.980 --> 03:41:18.820
It's just gratitude.

03:41:18.820 --> 03:41:21.020
So thank you for letting me play.

03:41:21.020 --> 03:41:23.220
Gratitude for every single moment, even if it's dark,

03:41:23.220 --> 03:41:24.060
even if it's a loss.

03:41:24.060 --> 03:41:26.740
Yes, and that's why I am so, people around me,

03:41:26.740 --> 03:41:29.060
they all say that it's a total doom and gloom

03:41:29.060 --> 03:41:30.860
and the world is ending.

03:41:30.860 --> 03:41:35.860
And I'm like, first of all, that's how you see it, okay?

03:41:36.100 --> 03:41:37.900
That's not the only point of view,

03:41:37.900 --> 03:41:40.540
but also even if it is, like that's your challenge.

03:41:40.540 --> 03:41:41.900
Like, what are you going to do about it?

03:41:41.900 --> 03:41:43.980
Stop complaining about other people.

03:41:43.980 --> 03:41:45.060
Do something yourself.

03:41:45.060 --> 03:41:48.220
How can you make it a better world, you know?

03:41:48.220 --> 03:41:51.340
And I think all of that starts with just a gratitude

03:41:51.340 --> 03:41:54.140
for the moment, to be able to play this game.

03:41:54.140 --> 03:41:56.380
Yeah, how beautiful it is.

03:41:58.380 --> 03:42:00.740
We've talked about love, but let me ask,

03:42:00.740 --> 03:42:03.580
what role does love play in this whole game

03:42:03.580 --> 03:42:04.820
in the human condition?

03:42:05.660 --> 03:42:06.860
It's like the glue, you know what I'm saying?

03:42:06.860 --> 03:42:07.940
For me, it's like that.

03:42:07.940 --> 03:42:12.940
It's, and it's not because people say love is like

03:42:12.940 --> 03:42:14.980
for a human being, like a romantic love.

03:42:15.820 --> 03:42:17.260
Which is a huge component of it, obviously,

03:42:17.260 --> 03:42:20.900
because so, so beautiful to be able to express it

03:42:20.900 --> 03:42:24.740
in this way, but it could be love for what you do

03:42:24.740 --> 03:42:27.540
for your passion for something, you know?

03:42:27.540 --> 03:42:32.540
And, or love for your friends, for instance,

03:42:34.420 --> 03:42:36.300
or love, it doesn't have to be.

03:42:36.300 --> 03:42:41.100
And so in some sense, that's what it's all about

03:42:41.100 --> 03:42:44.740
in ultimately, because living without love

03:42:45.500 --> 03:42:49.420
is kind of bland, boring, and so.

03:42:49.420 --> 03:42:51.140
And I don't think it's possible for science

03:42:51.140 --> 03:42:53.820
to explain exactly what it is.

03:42:53.820 --> 03:42:56.860
You can do evolutionary biology perspective.

03:42:56.860 --> 03:42:59.980
You can talk about some kind of sociology perspective,

03:42:59.980 --> 03:43:02.420
psychology perspective, but the experience,

03:43:02.420 --> 03:43:04.420
the intensity, where you forget,

03:43:04.420 --> 03:43:07.860
where time, where reminded becomes an illusion,

03:43:07.860 --> 03:43:09.220
and everything just freezes.

03:43:09.220 --> 03:43:10.700
Oh my God.

03:43:10.700 --> 03:43:13.660
And then it's kind of beautiful and painful

03:43:13.660 --> 03:43:16.700
to hear you say that when you've experienced love,

03:43:16.700 --> 03:43:19.100
the deepest is when you lost it.

03:43:19.100 --> 03:43:21.220
Yes, but in a sense, you can say that

03:43:22.180 --> 03:43:23.980
you could not have one without the other.

03:43:23.980 --> 03:43:27.060
I could not have that deep connection with my father,

03:43:27.060 --> 03:43:30.020
like really on so, so many levels.

03:43:30.020 --> 03:43:32.780
If there weren't a moment, that's how I see it.

03:43:32.780 --> 03:43:34.940
And I'm not trying to say that's how everybody should see.

03:43:34.940 --> 03:43:37.060
For instance, I respect Ray Kurzweil.

03:43:37.060 --> 03:43:39.180
I respect, and I feel, and I almost like,

03:43:39.180 --> 03:43:41.260
I feel good bumps right now.

03:43:41.260 --> 03:43:45.900
I feel that desire to reconnect,

03:43:47.020 --> 03:43:51.260
even if it is in the form of a computer program,

03:43:51.260 --> 03:43:52.980
let's be honest about it.

03:43:52.980 --> 03:43:55.460
I find it to be very moving.

03:43:55.460 --> 03:43:57.060
I find it very moving, and I understand

03:43:57.060 --> 03:43:59.700
because he actually didn't have a chance to spend much time.

03:43:59.700 --> 03:44:02.340
I think he was 16 or 17 when he was a teenager,

03:44:02.340 --> 03:44:03.180
when his dad died.

03:44:03.180 --> 03:44:04.660
I was lucky because my father died.

03:44:04.660 --> 03:44:05.700
I was much older.

03:44:05.700 --> 03:44:08.980
I've had so many moments with him, but that's not my thing.

03:44:09.780 --> 03:44:12.100
I think it is a feature, it's not a bug,

03:44:12.100 --> 03:44:13.380
and it sounds crazy.

03:44:13.380 --> 03:44:14.980
I would love, I would give anything

03:44:14.980 --> 03:44:16.500
to have him here right now.

03:44:16.500 --> 03:44:19.660
Right now, everything I have, I give it away right now.

03:44:19.660 --> 03:44:20.740
Where do I sign?

03:44:20.740 --> 03:44:22.580
Just see him for one hour.

03:44:22.580 --> 03:44:24.460
I promise you, I will.

03:44:24.460 --> 03:44:29.460
But I also know that then I'll still lose him,

03:44:30.020 --> 03:44:31.940
or I will die, or whatever.

03:44:31.940 --> 03:44:34.340
That thing, so why is it so worse

03:44:34.340 --> 03:44:36.740
to just hold onto, holding onto it?

03:44:36.780 --> 03:44:37.620
Why?

03:44:37.620 --> 03:44:39.100
Why are we holding onto this?

03:44:39.100 --> 03:44:41.620
And I am the first sucker, I'm the first one to hold on.

03:44:41.620 --> 03:44:43.060
But I'm questioning it now.

03:44:43.060 --> 03:44:46.060
I'm like, is there another way to approach life

03:44:46.060 --> 03:44:48.300
where you just, you know how Buddha is like,

03:44:50.180 --> 03:44:51.300
just let it go.

03:44:51.300 --> 03:44:53.500
Enjoy, and let it go.

03:44:53.500 --> 03:44:54.860
Enjoy, and let it go.

03:44:54.860 --> 03:44:56.460
Is it possible?

03:44:56.460 --> 03:44:59.300
Accept the paradox of it.

03:44:59.300 --> 03:45:01.460
Well, ask me in a couple of years, you know?

03:45:01.460 --> 03:45:02.700
I will report.

03:45:02.700 --> 03:45:06.140
But I think that, but to my mathematical mind,

03:45:06.140 --> 03:45:09.740
it sounds like a very interesting idea, to be honest.

03:45:09.740 --> 03:45:14.220
Because to me, the idea of holding sounds like an impasse.

03:45:14.220 --> 03:45:16.220
Because no matter, in all my experience,

03:45:16.220 --> 03:45:19.980
and if you look in history, every time somebody's holding,

03:45:19.980 --> 03:45:21.460
you know, it's how they said in The Matrix,

03:45:21.460 --> 03:45:23.020
whatever has a beginning has an end.

03:45:23.020 --> 03:45:24.940
It's like, you cannot go around it.

03:45:24.940 --> 03:45:27.220
If you have a beginning, you will have an end.

03:45:27.220 --> 03:45:29.860
So then, might as well just enjoy it

03:45:29.860 --> 03:45:32.980
and not worry too much about extending it longer.

03:45:34.060 --> 03:45:34.980
That's how I see it now.

03:45:34.980 --> 03:45:37.060
But maybe tomorrow will be something else, you know?

03:45:37.060 --> 03:45:41.060
Yeah, the rollercoaster of life, the paradox of life.

03:45:41.060 --> 03:45:41.900
Right.

03:45:41.900 --> 03:45:43.060
Edward, you're an incredible human being.

03:45:43.060 --> 03:45:44.220
I've been a fan for a long time.

03:45:44.220 --> 03:45:45.620
Thank you for writing Love and Math.

03:45:45.620 --> 03:45:48.460
Thank you for being who you are,

03:45:48.460 --> 03:45:52.060
being both one of the greatest living mathematicians

03:45:52.060 --> 03:45:56.780
and still childlike wanderer of the,

03:45:56.780 --> 03:45:59.780
exploring how this whole world works,

03:45:59.780 --> 03:46:01.260
the nature of the universe.

03:46:01.260 --> 03:46:03.620
And thank you so much for speaking with me today.

03:46:03.620 --> 03:46:04.540
This is amazing.

03:46:05.500 --> 03:46:06.420
It's been a pleasure.

03:46:06.420 --> 03:46:08.060
Thank you.

03:46:08.060 --> 03:46:09.540
Thanks for listening to this conversation

03:46:09.540 --> 03:46:10.660
with Edward Frankel.

03:46:10.660 --> 03:46:11.780

And now, let me leave you with some words

03:46:16.460 --> 03:46:21.060
from Sofia Kavalevska, a Russian mathematician.

03:46:21.060 --> 03:46:23.620
It is impossible to be a mathematician

03:46:23.620 --> 03:46:27.100
without being a poet in the soul.

03:46:27.100 --> 03:46:30.060
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

03:46:34.980 --> 03:46:35.820
Thank you.
