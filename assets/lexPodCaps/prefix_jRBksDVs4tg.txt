00:00.000 --> 00:01.800
Narcissism is not arrogance.

00:01.800 --> 00:04.220
Narcissism is the opposite of arrogance.

00:04.220 --> 00:08.240
There is such a deep sense of inadequacy

00:08.240 --> 00:10.800
and incompetence in the self

00:10.800 --> 00:14.080
that the defensive structure around that

00:14.080 --> 00:18.440
becomes dominated by rocket-fueled envy.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.560
The following is a conversation with Paul Conti,

00:24.560 --> 00:28.080
a psychiatrist and a brilliant scholar of human nature.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.440
My friend, Andrew Huberman,

00:30.440 --> 00:33.640
told me that Paul and I absolutely must meet and talk

00:33.640 --> 00:35.580
not just about the topic of trauma,

00:35.580 --> 00:38.320
which Paul wrote an amazing book about,

00:38.320 --> 00:40.080
but broadly about human nature,

00:40.080 --> 00:42.960
about narcissism, sociopathy, psychopathy,

00:42.960 --> 00:47.360
good and evil, hate and love, happiness and envy.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.360
As usual, Andrew was right.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.480
This was a fascinating conversation.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.900
As the old meme goes,

00:52.900 --> 00:55.940
one does not simply doubt the advice of Andrew Huberman.

00:56.820 --> 00:58.780
Allow me to also quickly mention

00:58.780 --> 01:02.220
that I disagree with Paul a bunch in this episode,

01:02.220 --> 01:05.220
as I do in other episodes, even with experts,

01:05.220 --> 01:07.940
in part for fun and in part because I think

01:07.940 --> 01:10.060
the tension of ideas and conversation

01:10.060 --> 01:12.400
is what creates insights and wisdom.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.400
My goal is to always empathize, understand,

01:14.400 --> 01:17.780
and explore ideas of the person sitting across from me.

01:17.780 --> 01:19.640
Disagreement is just one of the ways

01:19.640 --> 01:21.740
I think it's fun to do just that,

01:21.740 --> 01:25.660
as long as I do so from a place of curiosity

01:25.700 --> 01:27.340
and compassion.

01:27.340 --> 01:29.220
This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

01:31.060 --> 01:32.360
in the description.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.820
And now, dear friends, here's Paul Conte.

01:36.820 --> 01:39.620
Do you see psychiatry as fundamentally a study

01:39.620 --> 01:42.200
of the human mind and not just a set of tools

01:42.200 --> 01:43.860
for treating psychological maladies?

01:43.860 --> 01:44.700
Absolutely.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.860
I think psychiatry is our best way

01:46.860 --> 01:49.260
to understand who we are as people.

01:49.260 --> 01:51.140
I mean, it looks at our biology.

01:51.140 --> 01:52.300
How does our brain work?

01:52.300 --> 01:54.680
How does it connect the parts with one another?

01:54.680 --> 01:56.400
How does the chemistry in it work?

01:56.400 --> 01:59.280
It's the very foundational aspects of who we are

01:59.280 --> 02:01.480
and then it manifests as psychology.

02:01.480 --> 02:02.300
What do we think?

02:02.300 --> 02:03.140
What do we feel?

02:03.140 --> 02:03.980
What are our strivings?

02:03.980 --> 02:05.200
What are our fears?

02:05.200 --> 02:08.340
So yeah, I think psychiatry provides tools

02:08.340 --> 02:10.700
that we can use to help each other,

02:10.700 --> 02:12.280
but those tools come through it being

02:12.280 --> 02:14.320
a discipline of understanding.

02:14.320 --> 02:18.880
So with every patient you see, with every mind you explore,

02:18.880 --> 02:20.640
are you picking up a deeper understanding

02:20.640 --> 02:21.560
of the human mind?

02:22.760 --> 02:23.720
I think I'm trying to.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.200
I think we should learn,

02:25.200 --> 02:27.080
should be able to take something away

02:27.080 --> 02:30.280
from everything we do, every interaction

02:30.280 --> 02:31.360
to some small degree.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.760
Every conversation, it doesn't have to be a patient,

02:33.760 --> 02:34.720
just anywhere.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.720
At Starbucks, getting a coffee,

02:36.720 --> 02:38.800
you can learn something from that little experience.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.080
Yeah, even if you just reinforce

02:41.080 --> 02:45.680
gentle kindness and gratitude and decent human interaction,

02:45.680 --> 02:46.880
there's a reinforcement of that,

02:46.880 --> 02:49.600
that even if we don't take away memories or lessons,

02:49.600 --> 02:52.340
so to speak, we can reinforce who we choose to be.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.620
So understanding ourselves from those interactions too,

02:55.620 --> 02:58.180
not just the general sort of philosophical human mind,

02:58.180 --> 03:01.340
but understanding our own mind,

03:02.260 --> 03:05.660
introspect on how our own mind works.

03:05.660 --> 03:06.900
Yeah, because everything we understand

03:06.900 --> 03:10.300
about anyone or anything else is coming through here, right?

03:10.300 --> 03:12.900
So yeah, we're understanding others,

03:12.900 --> 03:15.140
we're also understanding ourselves.

03:15.140 --> 03:18.140
It's all feeding through us.

03:18.140 --> 03:19.700
Yeah, but it's a tricky thing to step away

03:19.700 --> 03:20.940
and look at your own mind

03:22.260 --> 03:24.700
and understand that it's just a machine.

03:24.700 --> 03:27.500
You can kind of control the way that machine processes

03:27.500 --> 03:29.060
the external environment

03:29.060 --> 03:32.700
and the way that machine converts the things

03:32.700 --> 03:35.060
it perceives into actual emotions,

03:35.060 --> 03:38.060
like how it interprets the things it perceives.

03:38.060 --> 03:41.180
You just sort of step away and analyze it in that way

03:41.180 --> 03:42.380
and then you can control it.

03:42.380 --> 03:44.660
You can oil the machine,

03:44.660 --> 03:47.420
you can control how it actually interprets the perceptions

03:47.420 --> 03:49.660
in order to generate positive emotions

03:49.660 --> 03:51.020
and be like a, what is it,

03:51.020 --> 03:55.660
like a mechanic for the gears in the machine.

03:55.660 --> 03:57.620
I mean, I think to some degree, to some degree,

03:57.620 --> 04:01.700
but the difference I think, at least as I understand,

04:01.700 --> 04:05.540
I think of machines as not being inscrutable, right?

04:05.540 --> 04:07.820
That if there's enough study,

04:07.820 --> 04:09.980
there's enough acumen applied

04:09.980 --> 04:12.500
that we can understand whatever it is

04:12.500 --> 04:13.820
we're trying to figure out.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.500
Whereas part of understanding ourselves

04:16.500 --> 04:19.620
is understanding that there are things we can't understand.

04:19.620 --> 04:24.420
And I think that's indispensable important

04:24.420 --> 04:25.460
to health and happiness

04:25.460 --> 04:28.540
and also to having enough humility

04:28.540 --> 04:31.260
to see how people can be different from us,

04:31.260 --> 04:34.220
how we can be different from ourselves at times.

04:34.220 --> 04:37.740
So knowing that we don't know a lot

04:37.740 --> 04:40.140
and having some idea of what that might be,

04:40.140 --> 04:43.100
I think is an indispensable part of the process,

04:43.100 --> 04:46.020
which I think is different from machines, I think.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.540
Yeah, the machines, you're basically saying machines,

04:48.540 --> 04:52.100
generally because they're engineered from a design,

04:52.100 --> 04:55.380
they're usually going to be simpler, therefore understandable.

04:55.380 --> 04:57.540
And you're saying the complexity of the human mind

04:57.540 --> 05:01.980
is at least from our perspective, nearly infinite.

05:01.980 --> 05:03.220
Is there a meta-phenomena,

05:03.220 --> 05:06.060
what sometimes gets described as sort of levels of emergence

05:06.060 --> 05:09.300
where at increasing levels of complexity,

05:09.300 --> 05:12.940
you have novelty evolve that you can't predict

05:12.940 --> 05:15.820
from lower levels of complexity,

05:16.220 --> 05:20.380
for example, atoms to molecules, it's just one example.

05:20.380 --> 05:23.820
I think neurons to consciousness,

05:23.820 --> 05:26.140
consciousness to culture, right?

05:26.140 --> 05:28.460
That there are meta-phenomena that separate

05:28.460 --> 05:31.700
from the phenomena underneath of them

05:31.700 --> 05:35.860
and thereby add an entire aspect of novelty.

05:35.860 --> 05:39.460
So I think we are, I mean, I really think this is true

05:39.460 --> 05:41.420
that we are all infinitely fascinating

05:41.420 --> 05:44.260
because of these levels of emergence of novelty

05:44.260 --> 05:46.220
that are inscrutable because you can't predict

05:46.220 --> 05:49.660
from one level to the next or understand fully

05:49.660 --> 05:51.980
are what make us, and not just us,

05:51.980 --> 05:53.900
but I think sentient creatures, right?

05:53.900 --> 05:55.340
Human beings, right?

05:55.340 --> 05:59.180
But sentient creatures, inestimably more interesting

05:59.180 --> 06:00.940
than creatures that aren't sentient.

06:00.940 --> 06:03.820
And I don't know, I think when we think about

06:03.820 --> 06:05.740
machine learning and artificial intelligence,

06:05.740 --> 06:08.260
I think it's that that we're trying to create,

06:08.260 --> 06:10.740
the levels of emergence that now

06:10.740 --> 06:13.100
we don't fully understand anymore,

06:13.100 --> 06:15.700
which I guess is both exciting and maybe scary too.

06:16.820 --> 06:20.100
Yeah, so you start at the physics of atoms,

06:20.100 --> 06:24.340
quantum mechanics, go into chemistry, go into biology.

06:24.340 --> 06:27.500
From the biology, you have the functional phenomena,

06:27.500 --> 06:30.220
especially as manifested in the human brain,

06:30.220 --> 06:32.820
and then multiple brains connecting together

06:32.820 --> 06:36.180
through consciousness and intelligence creates civilizations.

06:36.180 --> 06:37.060
It's pretty interesting.

06:37.060 --> 06:38.700
Where do you think the magic is?

06:38.700 --> 06:40.420
At which layer of the cake?

06:40.420 --> 06:41.420
Every layer.

06:41.420 --> 06:44.700
Because every time you emerge from one thing to another,

06:44.700 --> 06:48.060
I see it as an analog, the concept of the dialectic,

06:48.060 --> 06:51.900
where I think it was Hegel who realized,

06:51.900 --> 06:54.980
hey, when you have thing A and thing B

06:54.980 --> 06:57.700
and they're complicated and they come together,

06:57.700 --> 07:00.220
you don't get a hybrid of A and B.

07:00.220 --> 07:03.420
You end up getting something that's new, that's novel.

07:03.420 --> 07:07.540
And I think that describes to some degree

07:07.540 --> 07:09.180
what emergence is,

07:09.260 --> 07:12.940
except there's a whole new, in a sense,

07:12.940 --> 07:17.940
universe of novelty that comes at each layer of emergence

07:17.940 --> 07:19.700
that allows infinite possibilities

07:19.700 --> 07:21.580
that weren't possible before.

07:21.580 --> 07:23.180
And I think that's why we're so complicated,

07:23.180 --> 07:26.020
that our functional neuroscience,

07:26.020 --> 07:27.220
which I think is psychology,

07:27.220 --> 07:28.980
our ability to think about ourselves,

07:28.980 --> 07:30.820
about others, to be reflective,

07:30.820 --> 07:35.100
is sitting on top of so many layers of emergence.

07:35.100 --> 07:37.180
Like the idea of standing on the shoulders of giants,

07:38.020 --> 07:41.340
each of us, our consciousness is standing on the shoulder

07:41.340 --> 07:46.220
of a giant of many, many, many levels of emergence,

07:46.220 --> 07:49.020
of novelty, so many of which we don't understand.

07:49.020 --> 07:50.460
I mean, about subatomic particles,

07:50.460 --> 07:53.460
everything that quantum physics means,

07:53.460 --> 07:56.100
when does time become important, right?

07:56.100 --> 07:58.780
As opposed to things happening outside of time

07:58.780 --> 08:00.140
and outside of space,

08:00.140 --> 08:03.140
when do we slot into one temporal perspective

08:03.140 --> 08:04.660
and then the complexity just, I think,

08:04.660 --> 08:06.740
grows and grows and grows.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.180
Yeah, the interesting word he uses is novelty.

08:10.180 --> 08:12.780
If true, this really blows my mind.

08:12.780 --> 08:16.900
In some either shallow or deep sense, it is true.

08:16.900 --> 08:18.300
I'm trying to figure that out.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.420
I don't know if you know something about cellular automata

08:20.420 --> 08:23.500
is this very simple mathematical objects

08:23.500 --> 08:26.180
where you have rules that govern each individual little cell

08:26.180 --> 08:27.820
and they interact locally,

08:27.820 --> 08:30.340
and that you understand the very simple operation

08:30.340 --> 08:31.340
of those individual cells,

08:31.340 --> 08:33.980
but at another layer of abstraction,

08:34.020 --> 08:36.700
you just kind of zoom out with blurry vision,

08:36.700 --> 08:41.020
these meta objects starts appearing that function.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.060
You could build a torrent machine with it.

08:43.060 --> 08:47.460
You can build an arbitrary complexity of computation

08:47.460 --> 08:50.380
on top of this kind of very simple object.

08:50.380 --> 08:51.820
Yes, and it's an interesting question

08:51.820 --> 08:55.460
whether that was always there.

08:56.900 --> 09:01.420
The atoms somehow know about love, right?

09:02.140 --> 09:06.220
About consciousness, about war and violence

09:06.220 --> 09:07.940
and evil and hate and all that.

09:07.940 --> 09:10.540
That's already laid in the possibility of that,

09:10.540 --> 09:12.940
the capacity for that, it's already in the atoms.

09:12.940 --> 09:15.860
It's already in the physics, it's already in the,

09:15.860 --> 09:19.060
in all the different chemistry and that builds up.

09:19.060 --> 09:22.500
Even the origin of life, still a mystery.

09:22.500 --> 09:26.980
That's known, that's in the physics.

09:26.980 --> 09:28.100
That's known to the universe,

09:28.100 --> 09:31.060
the basic background physics in the universe.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.580
Because if that's not the case,

09:34.580 --> 09:35.700
it's like where does that come from?

09:35.700 --> 09:37.420
Where's that magic?

09:37.420 --> 09:40.020
And how many layers can the cake possibly have?

09:40.020 --> 09:41.620
How many are we gonna keep building?

09:41.620 --> 09:46.660
If we're constantly through this process of abstraction

09:46.660 --> 09:50.300
of adding a layer to the cake, adding novel things,

09:50.300 --> 09:51.500
like where's the ceiling?

09:53.140 --> 09:54.940
As we expand out into the cosmos,

09:54.940 --> 09:56.420
if we successfully can do that,

09:56.420 --> 10:01.180
are we gonna keep building more miraculous complex objects

10:01.180 --> 10:05.540
and then the brain is just a middle layer thing?

10:05.540 --> 10:08.580
We tend to think of ourselves as truly, truly special

10:08.580 --> 10:10.820
manifestations of what's possible in the universe,

10:10.820 --> 10:14.580
but maybe we're just the basic tiny building block

10:14.580 --> 10:16.860
of something much, much, much bigger.

10:16.860 --> 10:19.860
We're in the early days of being a brick

10:19.860 --> 10:21.620
and a very large building.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.820
Sure, I think that's entirely possible.

10:24.820 --> 10:29.340
I think the only emergent thing, so to speak,

10:29.340 --> 10:33.060
that we build is culture, the aggregation of us.

10:33.060 --> 10:35.860
So you have individual human minds

10:35.860 --> 10:39.020
which are entirely unique.

10:39.020 --> 10:41.580
I mean, even the fact that time is different for you and me.

10:41.580 --> 10:43.860
It may be by picoseconds,

10:43.860 --> 10:48.860
but we can engage because our perceptions of time

10:49.300 --> 10:52.020
are parallel enough, they're close enough

10:52.020 --> 10:54.060
that we can share a reality.

10:54.060 --> 10:58.060
But we're all living in a different dimension of time.

10:58.060 --> 10:59.140
I mean, we know that.

10:59.140 --> 11:01.740
So we're unique in that way.

11:01.740 --> 11:04.180
And then the unique individuals that we are,

11:04.180 --> 11:08.540
just like the cells, start to create not just one thing,

11:08.540 --> 11:10.180
not just a culture, but culture

11:10.180 --> 11:14.860
on top of our individuality, our uniqueness,

11:14.860 --> 11:17.980
our even dimensional uniqueness of time

11:17.980 --> 11:20.620
and experience and consciousness.

11:20.620 --> 11:23.060
So we create cultures on top of us,

11:23.340 --> 11:25.580
what could be beyond culture, right?

11:25.580 --> 11:29.020
And what is different from us,

11:29.020 --> 11:30.460
either on underlying levels,

11:30.460 --> 11:33.340
like quantum physics or chemistry or biology,

11:33.340 --> 11:36.620
or entirely different and unconceived, I think,

11:36.620 --> 11:39.460
is it's an immense question.

11:39.460 --> 11:42.700
And I think it's one that should create humility in us, right?

11:42.700 --> 11:44.780
That look how much we don't know,

11:44.780 --> 11:47.420
and then how reckless we are with ourselves,

11:47.420 --> 11:50.620
with our resources, with human life.

11:51.020 --> 11:54.060
And I think there, it's important to say,

11:54.060 --> 11:58.020
think about how entropy rules the universe around us.

11:58.020 --> 12:00.780
How over-selected are we?

12:00.780 --> 12:04.980
How many, not just hundreds or thousands of times,

12:04.980 --> 12:07.340
but how many millions of times

12:07.340 --> 12:09.460
does there have to be a selection branch point

12:09.460 --> 12:13.660
before we get into a sort of eddy pool of counter entropy,

12:13.660 --> 12:16.980
where you can begin to create?

12:16.980 --> 12:18.540
Which I think is why you say,

12:18.540 --> 12:20.900
okay, do the atoms know about love, right?

12:20.900 --> 12:23.940
The fact that anything is being created, right,

12:23.940 --> 12:26.900
means there's this over-selection for counter entropy,

12:26.900 --> 12:30.700
where there can be a building of greater complexity,

12:30.700 --> 12:32.940
of ultimately of novelty.

12:32.940 --> 12:34.980
And we don't often think about that,

12:34.980 --> 12:39.420
of how far removed we are, maybe light years, so to speak,

12:40.500 --> 12:45.500
from any other location, temporally, physically

12:46.540 --> 12:48.260
in the universe where this could happen.

12:48.780 --> 12:52.140
We don't think about, what does that mean?

12:52.140 --> 12:55.100
Everything they just said, love, everything,

12:55.100 --> 12:57.020
is counter entropy.

12:57.020 --> 13:00.540
Goes against the way the basic physics in the universe.

13:00.540 --> 13:01.580
So maybe actually the atoms

13:01.580 --> 13:04.340
really don't like what we're doing.

13:04.340 --> 13:05.260
They want us to stop.

13:05.260 --> 13:07.180
They've been trying really hard to stop.

13:07.180 --> 13:09.900
And despite that, we somehow started

13:09.900 --> 13:12.220
this whole bacteria thing for like a billion years,

13:12.220 --> 13:13.420
and now we're here.

13:13.420 --> 13:15.620
I actually think of it kind of the other way.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.940
I don't think there's any purpose to purposelessness, right?

13:18.940 --> 13:21.860
So why would anything be here

13:21.860 --> 13:26.860
if the drive weren't towards creativity, right?

13:28.020 --> 13:30.980
If the drive weren't towards those subatomic particles

13:30.980 --> 13:33.820
not being nothingness that blips in and out of existence,

13:33.820 --> 13:36.180
right, like we think is going on in empty space,

13:36.180 --> 13:38.500
you know, for light years upon light years, right?

13:38.500 --> 13:43.500
But is there a design, either natural or intentional,

13:44.180 --> 13:46.620
for a schema, right?

13:46.620 --> 13:50.660
A scenario that allows for the incredibly rare

13:50.660 --> 13:54.540
but not non-existent eddy pool of counter entropy

13:54.540 --> 13:56.420
where good can happen, right?

13:56.420 --> 13:58.220
Where creativity can happen,

13:58.220 --> 14:00.700
where ultimately something can grow,

14:00.700 --> 14:02.620
something novel can happen.

14:02.620 --> 14:04.820
There's no novelty in the vastness of space,

14:04.820 --> 14:07.340
even though there's not nothing there.

14:07.340 --> 14:11.060
There's novelty here because I think the layers

14:11.060 --> 14:15.420
of emergence start stacking very, very, very high

14:15.420 --> 14:18.540
when we're in a place of counter entropy,

14:18.540 --> 14:21.460
which then could provide even thoughts

14:21.460 --> 14:22.660
about like good and evil, right?

14:22.660 --> 14:26.700
The idea that creating, that preserving is good, right?

14:26.700 --> 14:27.700
It's what we build upon.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.460
It's how we get to the eddy pool of counter entropy, right?

14:30.460 --> 14:33.580
So then destruction is not good.

14:33.580 --> 14:38.220
What good comes of aggression and destruction, right?

14:38.220 --> 14:39.300
Unless we're protecting,

14:39.300 --> 14:41.620
or even you can think of outline cases,

14:41.620 --> 14:43.580
but just think in general concepts, right?

14:43.580 --> 14:45.580
Destruction destroys.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.820
It brings us towards a state of entropy,

14:47.820 --> 14:49.220
towards a state of nothingness,

14:49.220 --> 14:54.220
whereas goodness, commonality, collaboration, right?

14:55.260 --> 14:58.460
Nurturing, right, brings novelty.

14:58.460 --> 15:01.020
It brings new existence into the universe.

15:01.020 --> 15:03.100
And I think we don't think about that.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.420
We're in the middle of something so vast

15:05.420 --> 15:07.180
and built on top of so many layers.

15:07.180 --> 15:12.020
And I think it leads us to be cavalier with human life,

15:12.020 --> 15:14.020
including often our own.

15:14.020 --> 15:16.740
So you think there's an underlying creative force

15:16.740 --> 15:20.580
to the universe that might even have

15:20.580 --> 15:24.140
a kind of built-in morality to it,

15:24.140 --> 15:27.860
where creating is better than destroying.

15:27.860 --> 15:31.380
And then that somehow maps on onto our society,

15:31.380 --> 15:34.180
where we kind of try to figure out what that actually means

15:34.180 --> 15:35.820
in terms of good and evil.

15:35.820 --> 15:38.740
So something is there like that.

15:38.740 --> 15:43.620
But it has to be, it's so nice, it's so perfect,

15:43.620 --> 15:45.300
because it's rare.

15:45.300 --> 15:47.420
It's sufficiently rare where we have our own space,

15:47.420 --> 15:48.780
like you can close the door,

15:48.780 --> 15:50.620
and it's like, I need to be alone right now,

15:50.620 --> 15:53.580
as our human civilization, to work on my thing.

15:53.580 --> 15:55.100
So it's sufficiently rare that there's not

15:55.100 --> 15:57.220
other alien civilizations that are just constantly

15:57.220 --> 15:59.020
knocking on our door, destroying us.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.340
But it still exists.

16:01.340 --> 16:02.460
That's weird.

16:03.340 --> 16:06.060
It's so fantastically improbable

16:06.060 --> 16:09.140
that I think we should be very respectful of it.

16:09.140 --> 16:11.300
And I think you said there's a creative force

16:11.300 --> 16:13.300
that values creativity.

16:13.300 --> 16:16.180
This would be, well, sure, if it's a creative force,

16:16.180 --> 16:19.820
its existence, its ability to exist and to create

16:20.780 --> 16:23.260
comes from something other than entropy,

16:23.260 --> 16:25.060
something other than so much dispersion

16:25.060 --> 16:26.700
that there's nothingness.

16:26.700 --> 16:31.700
So the creative force will value the sanctity of things,

16:32.020 --> 16:34.740
keeping things together, not destroying things,

16:34.740 --> 16:37.900
building novelty, including novelty of knowledge,

16:37.900 --> 16:39.380
novelty of sentience.

16:39.380 --> 16:43.020
It fits with the idea that we're not nothing,

16:43.020 --> 16:45.260
that that's incredibly improbable,

16:45.260 --> 16:48.180
and that there are these many, many layers of emergence

16:48.180 --> 16:49.980
that we're standing upon.

16:49.980 --> 16:51.820
And I think it tells us something

16:51.820 --> 16:56.220
that we're not doing ourselves a service to ignore.

16:56.220 --> 16:58.220
It's not just a jump to saying,

16:58.220 --> 16:59.940
oh, there's a religious answer to everything.

17:00.100 --> 17:03.780
No, it's saying, science isn't a god either, right?

17:03.780 --> 17:07.020
So if we think of science as a tool

17:07.020 --> 17:08.980
and not as an endpoint in and of itself,

17:08.980 --> 17:11.020
what is the science telling us?

17:11.020 --> 17:13.180
I remember showing up at medical school,

17:13.180 --> 17:14.380
and it really is true.

17:14.380 --> 17:17.460
I knew so little about the human body.

17:17.460 --> 17:19.380
I'd only been in hospitals to visit people.

17:19.380 --> 17:22.460
I'd taken pre-med classes, but sort of intensely at once

17:22.460 --> 17:25.100
after I didn't take any, and I was working in business.

17:25.100 --> 17:27.580
I knew next to nothing, and I had this idea

17:27.580 --> 17:29.980
that was so naive in retrospect

17:29.980 --> 17:31.900
that I was gonna learn so much, right?

17:31.900 --> 17:33.140
I was gonna answer these questions

17:33.140 --> 17:34.500
because I was going, what's going on in the body?

17:34.500 --> 17:35.460
What are these organs doing?

17:35.460 --> 17:36.660
What are these cells?

17:36.660 --> 17:41.660
And what I learned was there was so much more

17:41.780 --> 17:45.700
that was amazing and mysterious and seemingly impossible,

17:45.700 --> 17:48.020
like even how a cell functions, right?

17:48.020 --> 17:49.860
Like what is going on inside of a cell,

17:49.860 --> 17:52.820
the transport mechanisms and energy functions

17:52.820 --> 17:54.100
and diffusion functions.

17:54.100 --> 17:57.340
And then you can go down to smaller levels than that.

17:57.340 --> 17:58.780
But when you come back out and you say,

17:58.780 --> 18:00.980
how all those cells make a kidney?

18:00.980 --> 18:03.980
It's not explanatory.

18:03.980 --> 18:05.660
I remember asking the OB,

18:05.660 --> 18:07.540
who had delivered my first child, right?

18:07.540 --> 18:08.860
I was so amazed.

18:08.860 --> 18:11.220
And I asked him, like, what do you think?

18:11.220 --> 18:12.140
Like, what do you know?

18:12.140 --> 18:13.180
You do this, right?

18:13.180 --> 18:15.300
You're seeing this life created.

18:15.300 --> 18:19.420
And his thought was nothing, but I just marvel.

18:19.420 --> 18:22.140
I mean, I get to do this, but I just marvel at it.

18:22.140 --> 18:25.980
And I think the more we know about us,

18:25.980 --> 18:29.020
the more we respectfully marvel.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.020
And we should do that.

18:30.020 --> 18:33.180
We should proactively marvel at every aspect,

18:33.180 --> 18:38.180
at every layer that where the novelty emerges.

18:38.860 --> 18:41.500
Yes, we'd be a lot less likely to say,

18:41.500 --> 18:43.420
hey, I don't like you because of something,

18:43.420 --> 18:46.220
whatever it is, you know, race, religion, culture,

18:46.220 --> 18:48.740
sexuality, gender identity, whatever it is, you know.

18:48.740 --> 18:51.180
Or I wanna say, I want rights that you don't have, right?

18:51.180 --> 18:53.260
Or I want what you have, right?

18:53.260 --> 18:54.780
I mean, there's so much of this.

18:54.780 --> 18:56.820
And I understand it's driven by scarcity

18:56.820 --> 19:00.220
and by human insecurity and envy and all of these things

19:00.220 --> 19:02.740
that I think could drive us towards destruction.

19:02.740 --> 19:05.900
But all of that recklessness comes from

19:07.060 --> 19:10.340
not having this initial appreciation and respect

19:10.340 --> 19:12.540
that you're referring to and just marveling at.

19:12.540 --> 19:14.420
Like, wow, okay, we're here.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.260
That's amazing.

19:15.260 --> 19:16.940
Let's start with that.

19:16.940 --> 19:20.300
But if we marvel at this whole thing,

19:20.300 --> 19:22.140
the human project, the human condition,

19:22.300 --> 19:25.460
all the different kinds of human beings that are possible,

19:25.460 --> 19:29.260
what do you then make of that some humans

19:29.260 --> 19:31.540
do evil onto the world?

19:31.540 --> 19:34.500
First of all, are all human beings capable of evil?

19:34.500 --> 19:35.940
If we're in the process,

19:35.940 --> 19:37.540
now we've got a little bit of momentum

19:37.540 --> 19:40.900
in terms of marveling at the layers of the cake.

19:40.900 --> 19:44.220
Should we also marvel at the capacity for evil in all of us?

19:44.220 --> 19:45.340
Is that capacity there?

19:45.340 --> 19:47.340
I believe that it is, yes.

19:47.340 --> 19:49.940
So what do we understand about the psychology of evil?

19:49.940 --> 19:52.300
Where does that originate in the human mind?

19:52.300 --> 19:54.300
Is it there in the neurobiology?

19:54.300 --> 19:56.900
Is it there in the environment, in the upbringing?

19:56.900 --> 19:57.780
Can I clarify first?

19:57.780 --> 19:59.940
I think the capacity for evil, I do believe,

19:59.940 --> 20:01.100
is in all of us.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.140
There's a difference between enacting evil

20:04.140 --> 20:09.140
and a sort of pre-set, followed, developed plan of evil.

20:10.580 --> 20:13.940
I don't believe that all of us are capable of doing

20:13.940 --> 20:17.900
what the people who perpetrate the most evil do.

20:17.900 --> 20:22.860
But I do believe that we're capable of perpetrating evil.

20:22.860 --> 20:27.780
And one thought would be that there are drives in us.

20:27.780 --> 20:30.420
I mean, there certainly seem to be drives in us

20:30.420 --> 20:34.780
towards survival, towards gratification,

20:34.780 --> 20:36.780
in some ways towards pleasure.

20:36.780 --> 20:38.220
And that can get very complicated

20:38.220 --> 20:41.260
because pleasure inside can be relief of distress.

20:41.260 --> 20:44.580
So if I feel very badly about myself,

20:44.580 --> 20:46.700
and I can feel a little better about myself

20:46.700 --> 20:49.060
by making you feel worse about yourself, right,

20:49.060 --> 20:51.620
which that plays out in a lot of human beings,

20:51.620 --> 20:54.300
is that an indirect way of bringing pleasure, right?

20:54.300 --> 20:58.020
So it gets very complicated what's going on inside of us.

20:58.020 --> 21:00.980
And sometimes the perpetration of evil things

21:00.980 --> 21:03.980
can be through misunderstandings, anger, impulsivity.

21:03.980 --> 21:07.220
I mean, there are things that we can have in us.

21:07.220 --> 21:10.980
And other times there can be other things going on

21:10.980 --> 21:14.340
which are through the lens of unhealthy human psychology.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.820
So for example, the psychology of envy,

21:16.820 --> 21:19.980
which I think drives the lion's share

21:19.980 --> 21:21.860
of the orchestrated evil, right?

21:21.860 --> 21:25.860
There's a difference between impulsive, reflexive evil

21:27.140 --> 21:29.660
and highly orchestrated evil,

21:29.660 --> 21:33.460
which I think is driven by envy.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.540
Highly orchestrated evil,

21:35.540 --> 21:37.220
we're talking about a scale of societies

21:37.220 --> 21:38.700
like totalitarianism.

21:38.700 --> 21:43.020
So if we're thinking about somebody like Hitler,

21:43.020 --> 21:48.020
so at scale, orchestration of evil, envy driving that.

21:48.020 --> 21:51.380
So I mean, that's really interesting to think about.

21:51.380 --> 21:52.500
I'd love to hear more about it.

21:52.500 --> 21:55.820
So some of it, there might be some psychological forces

21:55.820 --> 21:58.620
that are in tension with each other.

21:58.620 --> 22:02.420
So one is, if you look at somebody like Hitler,

22:04.300 --> 22:07.980
it's difficult to know what was going on in his mind,

22:07.980 --> 22:09.220
but it's possible to imagine

22:09.220 --> 22:12.300
if you just look at dictator's thought history,

22:12.340 --> 22:14.860
that he thought he was doing good,

22:14.860 --> 22:15.980
not just for himself,

22:15.980 --> 22:20.660
but for the people he believed have value.

22:20.660 --> 22:25.220
So one way you can achieve what we consider as evil

22:26.180 --> 22:30.020
is by devaluing some group of people.

22:30.020 --> 22:32.020
And that could be all group of people.

22:32.020 --> 22:35.540
So it could have sort of a narcissistic type of idea

22:35.540 --> 22:38.700
that you basically don't care about other human beings.

22:38.700 --> 22:39.540
That's one.

22:39.540 --> 22:41.580
Envy is different.

22:41.580 --> 22:44.420
I mean, maybe they can collaborate together,

22:44.420 --> 22:46.180
or even, like you mentioned,

22:46.180 --> 22:49.940
you can actually enjoy doing bad to others.

22:49.940 --> 22:51.140
That's almost like different,

22:51.140 --> 22:54.820
because if all it is is like narcissism,

22:54.820 --> 22:58.340
you disregard, you don't care how others feel,

22:58.340 --> 23:02.140
then you can just make cold calculated military,

23:02.140 --> 23:04.220
almost economic decisions,

23:04.220 --> 23:07.700
and you don't care if a million people die here or there.

23:07.700 --> 23:10.540
But if you actually enjoy some aspect of that,

23:10.540 --> 23:12.980
or there is like a resentment that fuels it,

23:12.980 --> 23:15.220
it's not just cold calculation,

23:15.220 --> 23:17.700
it's like fueled by some kind of personal

23:17.700 --> 23:20.100
or cultural resentment.

23:20.100 --> 23:21.700
I think it's all fueled by that.

23:21.700 --> 23:22.540
You think so?

23:22.540 --> 23:23.380
I think it's all fueled by that.

23:23.380 --> 23:26.300
I think the idea that Hitler thought he was doing good,

23:27.220 --> 23:32.220
is like, that is such a thin facade

23:32.220 --> 23:35.460
that it flies away like a handkerchief in a hurricane.

23:38.340 --> 23:39.700
Okay, yeah, thank you.

23:39.700 --> 23:41.180
Wow, that's beautiful, yeah.

23:42.300 --> 23:45.500
It's built upon, like it says,

23:45.500 --> 23:47.260
I'll explain, logical lies, right?

23:47.260 --> 23:52.100
Because people can build lies upon specious logic, right?

23:52.100 --> 23:54.620
So the idea that, okay, I am doing good

23:54.620 --> 23:59.620
because I believe that this ethnicity of people is good,

23:59.740 --> 24:02.140
and this is bad, and now I'm going to do this,

24:02.140 --> 24:03.420
and I'm gonna make the world different,

24:03.420 --> 24:05.300
and it's gonna bring better to the world,

24:05.300 --> 24:06.860
and now I'm raising armies,

24:06.860 --> 24:08.340
and I'm building concentration camps,

24:08.340 --> 24:10.100
and I think this is all in the service of good,

24:10.100 --> 24:14.020
is I don't think anyone ever thinks that, right?

24:14.020 --> 24:17.260
Or they think that because they're living

24:17.260 --> 24:19.500
in the surface patina, right?

24:19.500 --> 24:20.940
They're not allowing the hurricane in

24:20.940 --> 24:22.380
that blows away the handkerchief

24:22.380 --> 24:26.060
and says this is all evil, right?

24:26.060 --> 24:29.220
How do you decide that some group of people is good

24:29.220 --> 24:30.060
and some is bad?

24:30.060 --> 24:32.740
And what is it that you take upon yourself

24:32.740 --> 24:36.580
to play God or make decisions about the world?

24:36.580 --> 24:38.180
And I think what really is going on

24:39.020 --> 24:40.460
is people are not doing that, right?

24:40.460 --> 24:42.540
There's something cobbled together to say like,

24:42.540 --> 24:44.540
why this is right, and this is okay, right?

24:44.540 --> 24:46.060
And this is even good, right?

24:46.060 --> 24:49.660
But it is all a lie, right?

24:49.660 --> 24:54.420
It's a lie that's adorning what I believe is the fact,

24:54.420 --> 24:57.980
I believe that what's going on is the gratification

24:57.980 --> 25:00.100
of envy inside of the person.

25:00.100 --> 25:01.940
And whether someone says, oh, I think this is good

25:01.940 --> 25:03.500
and it's okay if a million people die,

25:03.500 --> 25:06.300
or I'm gonna enjoy that a million people die,

25:06.300 --> 25:07.460
I think is the same.

25:07.460 --> 25:10.220
I think the enjoyment, the gratification

25:10.220 --> 25:13.020
of the orchestrated evil is there

25:13.020 --> 25:17.100
and that it all comes from vulnerability and insecurity.

25:17.100 --> 25:21.900
It all comes from deficits in the sense of self, right?

25:21.900 --> 25:23.740
I'm gonna have to process that.

25:25.380 --> 25:28.740
My slow penny and PC is processing that,

25:28.740 --> 25:30.860
so envy underlies all of it.

25:30.860 --> 25:35.180
The psychological concept of envy, what is that?

25:35.300 --> 25:37.860
I keep putting myself in the mind of Hitler, I guess.

25:37.860 --> 25:40.460
That has nothing to do, it doesn't have to do

25:40.460 --> 25:43.580
with Jews or Slavic people.

25:43.580 --> 25:48.140
Does it have to do with specific amorphous other

25:49.100 --> 25:51.660
in his mind that he's envious of?

25:51.660 --> 25:55.860
I think it has all to do with him, all to do with him.

25:55.860 --> 25:58.740
There's not a love of the people with whom he allied

25:58.740 --> 26:01.460
or even a sense of the people who he persecuted

26:01.460 --> 26:02.620
were worse than him.

26:02.660 --> 26:06.300
It's all projections out of what was going on inside of him,

26:06.300 --> 26:10.180
which was an intense sense of inadequacy,

26:10.180 --> 26:15.180
a rage at being someone he perceived as lesser than.

26:16.180 --> 26:18.140
That's the difference between, so we can define words

26:18.140 --> 26:19.780
in different ways even within psychology,

26:19.780 --> 26:21.980
but let's say we take the definition here

26:21.980 --> 26:24.780
of sort of jealousy as being sort of benign, right?

26:24.780 --> 26:26.340
The idea that, oh, I might see something

26:26.340 --> 26:28.380
that you have that I don't, and I might think,

26:28.380 --> 26:30.900
I'd like that, maybe I'll work harder to get it, right?

26:30.900 --> 26:32.100
Or maybe I can't get it,

26:32.100 --> 26:33.780
maybe it's that you're younger than I am.

26:33.780 --> 26:36.740
They say, okay, you have that and I don't.

26:36.740 --> 26:39.260
I mean, I have other things too, I'm okay anyway.

26:39.260 --> 26:41.060
But I might want those things,

26:41.060 --> 26:42.660
but it's very benign, the jealousy.

26:42.660 --> 26:44.260
I'd like to be younger, I'd like to be richer,

26:44.260 --> 26:46.460
whatever it is that we people think, right?

26:47.420 --> 26:49.260
But it's just a thought, and it's a thought

26:49.260 --> 26:53.220
that can result in strivings or acceptance, right?

26:53.220 --> 26:55.860
It's very, very different, so it's completely different

26:55.860 --> 26:58.940
than envy, which is destructive.

26:58.940 --> 27:02.060
It's a thought of, I see something that you have

27:03.020 --> 27:03.860
that I don't have, right?

27:03.860 --> 27:05.540
And instead of me working for it

27:05.540 --> 27:07.340
or accepting that I don't have it,

27:07.340 --> 27:10.420
what I'd like to do then is bring you down,

27:10.420 --> 27:13.060
take you down to where I am, and then I'll feel better,

27:13.060 --> 27:16.180
right, because from the perspective of envy,

27:16.180 --> 27:18.780
it is all relative.

27:18.780 --> 27:21.940
So is jealousy a kind of, because you said

27:21.940 --> 27:23.740
completely different, but is jealousy

27:23.740 --> 27:26.460
potentially like a gateway drug to envy?

27:26.460 --> 27:29.020
Like, is it a slippery slope?

27:29.020 --> 27:30.900
I think no, I think that jealousy

27:30.940 --> 27:33.340
is a natural, just part of the human phenomenon

27:33.340 --> 27:34.860
that we go through life, and we see like,

27:34.860 --> 27:35.700
oh, I'd like to have that.

27:35.700 --> 27:37.700
I think it's part of our incentives, right?

27:37.700 --> 27:42.700
If I'm farming and I have one row of crops

27:42.700 --> 27:44.500
and I look over and I see that you're working harder

27:44.500 --> 27:46.660
and you have two, and I'd like to have two,

27:46.660 --> 27:48.420
that can make me work harder to have two.

27:48.420 --> 27:49.620
You don't think it's a slippery slope

27:49.620 --> 27:52.060
from one to the other to, at first you're like,

27:52.060 --> 27:53.900
I'd like to work harder, but then you keep failing

27:53.900 --> 27:55.500
and the weather sucks and you keep failing

27:55.500 --> 27:57.420
and the other person becomes more successful,

27:57.420 --> 27:59.660
plus he's got a new hot wife now,

27:59.660 --> 28:02.980
there's a nice tractor, there's a field that's all working

28:02.980 --> 28:04.820
and then you get this idea that, you know what,

28:04.820 --> 28:08.940
I'm gonna steal all this stuff and I'm gonna murder him

28:08.940 --> 28:11.900
and that, don't you think that's just like a leap

28:11.900 --> 28:13.460
of the same phenomenon?

28:13.460 --> 28:14.300
No.

28:14.300 --> 28:15.940
No, because I think there are things

28:15.940 --> 28:17.700
that are in us as humans, right?

28:17.700 --> 28:20.500
So there are things that just by being human,

28:20.500 --> 28:22.140
like we can, for example, feel,

28:22.140 --> 28:23.620
we can feel compassion, right?

28:23.620 --> 28:25.340
We can feel interest, right?

28:25.340 --> 28:27.620
We can feel jealousy in that benign sense.

28:27.900 --> 28:29.980
It's all part of just being human.

28:29.980 --> 28:33.780
If we start going from, hey, you have more crops

28:33.780 --> 28:36.580
than I have and it seems like I actually have a better life

28:36.580 --> 28:38.780
in a lot of ways than I have, I'm gonna kill you.

28:38.780 --> 28:41.420
That's not, that is not a progression

28:41.420 --> 28:43.020
of something benign, right?

28:43.020 --> 28:43.860
That is-

28:43.860 --> 28:46.060
But wait a minute, but that is a human leap

28:46.060 --> 28:48.180
of the same thing, isn't it?

28:48.180 --> 28:51.180
Is, because you're drawing a line, stuff,

28:51.180 --> 28:53.340
you're saying like, this is the, this human stuff,

28:53.340 --> 28:55.900
it's regular life, it's benign,

28:55.940 --> 28:57.420
but it feels like this benign thing

28:57.420 --> 29:00.020
is just a low magnitude thing,

29:00.020 --> 29:02.620
version of the thing that's not benign.

29:02.620 --> 29:05.820
Like there's probably a gray area where it stops being benign.

29:05.820 --> 29:08.500
Like jealousy, you can have like healthy jealousy,

29:08.500 --> 29:10.660
you can have a little bit slightly unhealthy.

29:10.660 --> 29:12.900
There's a, I think, jealous guy,

29:12.900 --> 29:15.180
this John Lennon song that I love is beautiful.

29:15.180 --> 29:18.420
I mean, there's like, this jealousy inside relationships

29:18.420 --> 29:20.940
can make you feel like, you know,

29:20.940 --> 29:24.500
could take your minds in all kinds of silly directions.

29:24.540 --> 29:27.220
And it's crazy, but like, it feels like that,

29:27.220 --> 29:30.260
that's a next door neighbor to like being really crazy

29:30.260 --> 29:32.620
and toxic and all that kind of stuff inside relationships.

29:32.620 --> 29:34.420
And then that feels like a next door neighbor,

29:34.420 --> 29:35.460
it's like an apartment building,

29:35.460 --> 29:37.820
that feels like an next door neighbor

29:37.820 --> 29:41.460
that eventually gets to Hitler with envy and resentment

29:41.460 --> 29:43.220
of entire population of people.

29:43.220 --> 29:45.300
You're right, and that there's a causal,

29:45.300 --> 29:47.060
there can be a causal chain, right?

29:47.060 --> 29:48.900
Like if I'm not feeling jealous,

29:48.900 --> 29:51.180
maybe I won't ever feel envious, right?

29:51.180 --> 29:53.620
So as you can see, okay, so it can kind of lead

29:53.620 --> 29:56.620
to it can open gates to, huh, like how much do I dislike

29:56.620 --> 29:58.420
that you have things that I don't have, right?

29:58.420 --> 30:01.420
So yes, in that sense, but, and I think,

30:01.420 --> 30:03.100
this is the part that I think is so important

30:03.100 --> 30:06.340
that I think there is a disjunction, right?

30:06.340 --> 30:10.260
There's an asymptotic shift from one thing to another

30:10.260 --> 30:11.100
because it is very-

30:11.100 --> 30:12.620
Now you're speaking my language mathematically.

30:12.620 --> 30:13.460
Yeah.

30:13.460 --> 30:14.300
Sympathetic leap, yep.

30:14.300 --> 30:16.620
Yes, that's, it's a way to convey, right,

30:16.620 --> 30:18.260
something that's entirely different

30:18.260 --> 30:21.500
because if I start thinking, you know,

30:21.540 --> 30:23.700
I'm not gonna try and make things better, right?

30:23.700 --> 30:25.300
I'd like instead to harm you,

30:25.300 --> 30:27.900
that's qualitatively different.

30:27.900 --> 30:29.780
Oh, it's almost like, you know what it is?

30:29.780 --> 30:31.860
It could be, I don't know what you think about this,

30:31.860 --> 30:36.860
but it's in which direction your motivation is pointing.

30:39.140 --> 30:42.700
So if in the response to the feeling of jealousy,

30:42.700 --> 30:45.980
your sort of, the motivation says,

30:45.980 --> 30:49.460
okay, I understand this feeling, I wanna do less of it.

30:49.540 --> 30:51.660
I think there must be a threshold

30:51.660 --> 30:53.180
to which you actually wanna do more of it.

30:53.180 --> 30:55.460
Like it becomes a vicious downward cycle.

30:55.460 --> 30:57.060
So that's what envy becomes.

30:57.060 --> 30:59.260
Like the first feeling, this idea

31:00.220 --> 31:02.660
that I'm gonna kill the farmer

31:02.660 --> 31:04.620
turns into like more and more and more

31:04.620 --> 31:06.780
and you can't sleep and you're visualizing the farmer

31:06.780 --> 31:10.300
and he becomes the devil and like you have this very,

31:10.300 --> 31:12.140
you know, it's basically a thing

31:12.140 --> 31:13.620
that builds into the negative direction

31:13.620 --> 31:16.580
versus returns to the stable center.

31:16.580 --> 31:18.420
And now a person is cultivating evil.

31:18.420 --> 31:19.260
Yeah.

31:19.940 --> 31:20.900
And then he's saying, hey, there can be seeds of evil

31:20.900 --> 31:23.220
in all of us, let me take that seed out,

31:23.220 --> 31:26.260
dust it off, plant it, nurture it, right?

31:26.260 --> 31:27.940
And then grow that seed of evil,

31:27.940 --> 31:30.860
which will affect all other parts of the person's life,

31:30.860 --> 31:32.340
right, they won't behave the same

31:32.340 --> 31:34.540
towards others in their life.

31:34.540 --> 31:39.260
They'll become different as they nurture fantasies of evil,

31:39.260 --> 31:43.740
as they begin to create inside of themselves

31:43.740 --> 31:47.620
the motivation and the will, right, to enact evil.

31:48.020 --> 31:49.620
The Hitler analogy would say,

31:49.620 --> 31:51.900
when you take someone who had a bad childhood, right,

31:51.900 --> 31:56.220
who like was not loved, who was taught and told

31:56.220 --> 31:58.380
that he was less than, okay, like that,

31:58.380 --> 31:59.700
we know that happens, I mean,

31:59.700 --> 32:02.420
that's why child abuse is so evil, right?

32:02.420 --> 32:06.580
It's telling children the worst possible wrong lessons,

32:06.580 --> 32:08.660
right, they're not good enough, they'll always be hurt,

32:08.660 --> 32:10.100
you know, they can't keep themselves safe,

32:10.100 --> 32:11.860
they don't deserve safety, right?

32:11.860 --> 32:16.020
So then you take someone who then nurtures that seed

32:16.020 --> 32:18.060
of evil, which is a choice.

32:18.060 --> 32:19.620
And this is why I can't paint well enough

32:19.620 --> 32:21.500
and no one appreciates me and I don't like how I look

32:21.500 --> 32:23.980
and I don't fit in with the people I wanna fit in with

32:23.980 --> 32:27.140
and then on and on and on and on and on.

32:27.140 --> 32:32.140
And there's a hatred of self through that lens of misery,

32:33.220 --> 32:35.580
of just being repulsed by the self,

32:35.580 --> 32:38.420
but that's unacceptable to the self.

32:38.420 --> 32:42.060
So, oh, it has to be someone else's fault, right?

32:42.060 --> 32:44.380
It's not my fault, whose fault is it, right?

32:44.380 --> 32:47.580
And then you see en masse the inaction of evil

32:47.580 --> 32:51.180
towards groups of people who somehow,

32:51.180 --> 32:52.740
in this person's mind, right,

32:52.740 --> 32:55.300
are responsible for his misery.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.420
And there's the justification of evil

32:57.420 --> 33:00.060
and then all the, you know, whether it's,

33:00.060 --> 33:01.380
this will be better for the economy,

33:01.380 --> 33:02.500
this will be good, this will be that,

33:02.500 --> 33:06.100
like that's all lies built to justify the evil.

33:06.100 --> 33:07.700
Those are surface level narratives.

33:07.700 --> 33:08.940
Yes.

33:08.940 --> 33:13.660
And the envy is the deep down mechanism that enables.

33:13.660 --> 33:15.380
And that's the end point that's being served.

33:15.380 --> 33:17.780
What's being served is destruction, right?

33:17.780 --> 33:21.100
Which is why it always brings more destruction, right?

33:21.100 --> 33:24.380
I mean, how many times do wars that were started

33:24.380 --> 33:26.020
for purposes that we would look and say,

33:26.020 --> 33:27.500
like those were evil purposes?

33:27.500 --> 33:30.420
Like how many times does good come of that?

33:30.420 --> 33:31.980
Even if we look at the modern world,

33:31.980 --> 33:36.020
what comes of it is more evil, is more destruction.

33:36.020 --> 33:39.460
And Hitler's outward destruction eventually came inward

33:39.460 --> 33:42.460
and, you know, you see pictures of what Berlin looked like

33:42.460 --> 33:43.820
after the Second World War, right?

33:43.820 --> 33:46.620
It wasn't just destruction perpetrated outward

33:46.620 --> 33:50.820
as awful as that is, it's catchy, right?

33:50.820 --> 33:52.380
Like people used to worry if you, you know,

33:52.380 --> 33:54.620
before the, during the time of the Manhattan Project, right?

33:54.620 --> 33:56.500
If you start this chain reaction, you know,

33:56.500 --> 33:58.500
will you blow the whole world up, right?

33:58.500 --> 34:00.900
Or will it stop within this bomb or not?

34:00.900 --> 34:04.060
And we see, okay, the chain reaction of evil

34:04.060 --> 34:06.140
hasn't yet blown the whole world up,

34:06.140 --> 34:10.100
but look at the, look at how the catastrophe spreads.

34:10.100 --> 34:12.020
And you think 50 to 60 million people

34:12.020 --> 34:13.380
dead in the Second World War,

34:13.380 --> 34:15.980
which truly was a world war,

34:15.980 --> 34:19.500
what destruction was spread around the globe.

34:19.500 --> 34:22.220
And this is something that can't be stopped

34:22.220 --> 34:24.220
once the chain reaction starts.

34:24.220 --> 34:26.700
Like if Hitler was successful,

34:26.700 --> 34:27.940
like he would just keep going.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.740
If he had been, think of it, if he just-

34:29.740 --> 34:31.420
On his personal psychological level, I mean.

34:31.420 --> 34:32.780
Right, because if we think from the perspective

34:32.780 --> 34:35.460
of destruction, success would have needed,

34:35.460 --> 34:37.020
led to the need to conquer more

34:37.020 --> 34:38.660
than there's factions and infighting

34:38.660 --> 34:41.340
and then eventually you get the same mass destruction, right?

34:41.500 --> 34:44.580
And never does the inaction of evil

34:44.580 --> 34:46.940
satisfy what the person is initially seeking.

34:46.940 --> 34:49.980
Like people wanna feel better about themselves, right?

34:49.980 --> 34:54.940
Winnicott, who was a British pediatrician

34:54.940 --> 34:57.540
who wrote about children and adults

34:57.540 --> 34:58.980
from very deep perspectives,

34:58.980 --> 35:01.180
he wrote about the idea of good enough, right?

35:01.180 --> 35:03.340
And then you can sort of extrapolate that to like,

35:03.340 --> 35:04.940
we all wanna feel good enough,

35:04.940 --> 35:07.060
like not just limp over the line good enough,

35:07.060 --> 35:08.540
but I wanna feel good enough

35:08.540 --> 35:10.100
that I'm a decent person in the world

35:10.100 --> 35:11.420
and like what I do matters

35:11.420 --> 35:13.940
and I can have an impact on people

35:13.940 --> 35:17.220
and people can like me and care about me.

35:17.220 --> 35:20.100
There's a simplicity there that people want

35:20.100 --> 35:21.780
that when people don't have

35:21.780 --> 35:23.260
and there's certain other factors,

35:23.260 --> 35:26.100
maybe they're temperamental factors or historical factors

35:26.100 --> 35:30.940
can lead to trying to soothe that deficit, right?

35:30.940 --> 35:32.660
Through envy.

35:32.660 --> 35:35.620
And I think it starts with that

35:35.620 --> 35:38.540
and it often starts in childhood, not always,

35:38.580 --> 35:40.140
but it often starts in childhood

35:40.140 --> 35:44.380
when the child's brain and psychology are so vulnerable

35:44.380 --> 35:47.300
and you see salient child abuse.

35:47.300 --> 35:49.260
If you look at what was Hitler's background

35:49.260 --> 35:50.980
and what was Stalin's background,

35:50.980 --> 35:53.380
I mean, you could look at almost anyone

35:53.380 --> 35:56.060
who's perpetrated evil or they're serial killers

35:56.060 --> 35:57.700
or whatever it may be,

35:57.700 --> 35:59.740
the majority, not everyone,

35:59.740 --> 36:02.900
but the majority had these lessons in childhood

36:02.900 --> 36:04.500
that said you're not good enough,

36:04.500 --> 36:05.740
you can't keep yourself safe,

36:05.740 --> 36:06.820
no one cares about you.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.700
And in a subset of people,

36:09.700 --> 36:11.020
that's gonna generate envy

36:11.020 --> 36:14.340
and that seed of evil then gets planted and nurtured.

36:16.940 --> 36:18.860
As a fighter jet roars above us.

36:18.860 --> 36:20.780
The sound of a fighter jet above us.

36:20.780 --> 36:23.180
It's been good by an orchestrator.

36:23.180 --> 36:25.620
You forget, you quickly forget

36:25.620 --> 36:27.420
the comfort of being in a peaceful place.

36:27.420 --> 36:29.180
That's one thing I saw in Ukraine

36:30.700 --> 36:34.420
is, hey, you quickly get comfortable here.

36:34.460 --> 36:35.740
The whole trip back,

36:36.780 --> 36:41.780
I was thinking, it's so damn good to be in America.

36:42.220 --> 36:45.500
Just the whole, like, it's like a three day trip back.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.060
It's so good to be American.

36:49.580 --> 36:52.540
We might take that for granted as a population,

36:52.540 --> 36:53.500
but I do agree.

36:54.660 --> 36:57.260
So the destruction never alleviates the envy.

36:59.980 --> 37:03.140
Are all humans capable of envy?

37:05.100 --> 37:06.380
I believe the answer is yes.

37:06.380 --> 37:09.420
If you think, do we all have the possibility of evil in us?

37:09.420 --> 37:11.860
I think the answer to that is yes,

37:11.860 --> 37:14.980
but we have free will, we have choice.

37:14.980 --> 37:17.940
We can choose what we do with that,

37:17.940 --> 37:22.020
which is why just because someone is a sociopath,

37:22.020 --> 37:24.700
for example, doesn't mean that they're not responsible.

37:24.700 --> 37:28.740
I mean, our medical legal jurisprudence

37:28.740 --> 37:31.820
has absolutely borne that out,

37:31.820 --> 37:34.100
that legally, medically, we think,

37:35.060 --> 37:37.780
we're responsible, presuming we're healthy.

37:37.780 --> 37:39.300
We're not unhealthy in other ways

37:39.300 --> 37:42.700
that eliminates our ability to be circumspect,

37:42.700 --> 37:45.300
but that we're responsible for what we do

37:45.300 --> 37:47.780
and don't nurture inside of us.

37:47.780 --> 37:49.300
I mean, there are plenty of things we could decide

37:49.300 --> 37:52.020
to nurture anger and hatred about.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.020
I could think of slights, difficulties,

37:54.020 --> 37:55.780
whether it's something someone else has done to me,

37:55.780 --> 37:57.780
or I could blame fate, or I could be mad at God,

37:57.780 --> 38:01.140
or the world, we can all make those choices,

38:01.140 --> 38:03.100
and we're responsible for them,

38:03.100 --> 38:04.820
or for recognizing things in us that are like,

38:04.820 --> 38:09.180
oh, I too have that in me, but I don't wanna nurture that.

38:09.180 --> 38:10.700
I don't wanna foster that,

38:10.700 --> 38:13.140
or do I choose to nurture and foster that?

38:13.140 --> 38:16.860
And I think ultimately, a subject of Hitler as evil,

38:16.860 --> 38:19.500
if Hitler had kept winning and winning,

38:19.500 --> 38:21.020
I think ultimately, he would have been

38:21.020 --> 38:23.820
the only person on earth, and I really do believe it.

38:23.820 --> 38:27.020
Ultimately, everyone, everything else would be killed

38:27.020 --> 38:30.100
because it's such destruction, destroy everything.

38:30.100 --> 38:32.500
And probably when that didn't work,

38:32.540 --> 38:34.460
then there's the destruction of the self, right?

38:34.460 --> 38:39.460
Because nothing soothes envy

38:40.900 --> 38:44.540
that is stoked by the sort of flames of evil.

38:44.540 --> 38:46.660
And what you see is more and more anger

38:46.660 --> 38:47.820
and more and more frustration,

38:47.820 --> 38:50.540
which is why I really do believe someone like that,

38:50.540 --> 38:52.940
who nurtured evil in themselves that way,

38:52.940 --> 38:54.420
ultimately would destroy.

38:54.420 --> 38:56.020
They'd be like him and one other person,

38:56.020 --> 38:57.380
then he'd kill the other person.

38:57.380 --> 38:59.940
I think that's really powerfully said.

38:59.980 --> 39:03.420
But even just to return to the jealousy versus envy,

39:03.420 --> 39:07.140
I still think that it's the same flame.

39:08.700 --> 39:11.020
And envy is just the bigger version of it.

39:11.020 --> 39:15.220
So I think, I just, in my own personal life,

39:16.460 --> 39:19.220
I've felt jealousy towards others, like you said,

39:19.220 --> 39:23.060
like, oh, this person has a, I don't know,

39:23.060 --> 39:26.260
a cooler thing, trinket, whatever trinket I cared about.

39:26.260 --> 39:28.300
And usually, it's when somebody's really close

39:28.300 --> 39:30.180
to the trinket you're building.

39:33.060 --> 39:36.740
And I, early on, like in my teens,

39:37.940 --> 39:42.300
I realized that, just empirically speaking,

39:42.300 --> 39:44.740
that jealousy over a period of a week

39:44.740 --> 39:46.180
just doesn't feel good.

39:47.460 --> 39:48.860
And it's not productive.

39:48.860 --> 39:51.020
It doesn't help me build a better trinket.

39:52.860 --> 39:57.700
Or it does if I turn it, not into jealousy,

39:57.780 --> 39:59.340
towards another person,

39:59.340 --> 40:02.820
but into a love for building a better trinket.

40:02.820 --> 40:03.980
It's like, oh, cool.

40:03.980 --> 40:07.180
Almost, you know what, like proactively speaking,

40:07.180 --> 40:09.180
and later in life, like people like Joe Rogan

40:09.180 --> 40:11.860
actually have been really powerful in this for me,

40:11.860 --> 40:15.260
just as a fan of his, to celebrate other people.

40:15.260 --> 40:18.780
So it's almost, as opposed to ignoring that other person

40:18.780 --> 40:19.860
with a cool trinket,

40:19.860 --> 40:22.900
it's like celebrating their awesomeness in my mind.

40:22.900 --> 40:24.980
Like just saying how awesome

40:24.980 --> 40:26.500
that humans are able to do that.

40:26.540 --> 40:29.820
And actually just how awesome is that exact person

40:29.820 --> 40:31.140
at being able to do that.

40:31.140 --> 40:33.260
And that somehow made me more capable

40:33.260 --> 40:35.180
to build my own trinket better.

40:35.180 --> 40:36.780
And it feels good also.

40:36.780 --> 40:38.260
Like it makes me feel happy.

40:38.260 --> 40:39.820
And now you're not jealous anymore.

40:39.820 --> 40:41.140
You're not jealous anymore.

40:41.140 --> 40:43.020
So that's why I think jealousy is different, right?

40:43.020 --> 40:44.780
Because if you're saying there's a week of jealousy,

40:44.780 --> 40:46.460
like I don't like this, right, I don't like,

40:46.460 --> 40:48.500
but if you take that in a way that says,

40:48.500 --> 40:50.100
wait a second, actually this is awesome.

40:50.100 --> 40:52.060
This is fabulous, and this person did this.

40:52.060 --> 40:53.700
That person's awesome, right?

40:53.700 --> 40:58.300
Then you're not raining on anyone's parade, right?

40:58.300 --> 41:01.060
And in not doing that even inside your own mind,

41:01.060 --> 41:04.660
you gain a greater cognizance of your own capability, right?

41:04.660 --> 41:06.940
Well, if he can do that or she can do that,

41:06.940 --> 41:07.940
why can't I too?

41:07.940 --> 41:10.540
Like I wanna make the better trinket too, right?

41:10.540 --> 41:12.420
Now you're thinking creatively,

41:12.420 --> 41:17.420
nowhere in there was the emergence of evil.

41:17.900 --> 41:19.220
I just disagree with that.

41:19.220 --> 41:21.420
I think there was a choice made

41:21.420 --> 41:25.940
where I looked at my, if my life was darker,

41:25.940 --> 41:28.900
more difficult, I think it has nothing to do

41:28.900 --> 41:32.020
with the actual little flame of jealousy I felt.

41:32.020 --> 41:34.700
I think it has to do a lot more with the other context.

41:34.700 --> 41:39.700
If my life were more difficult, there was more abuse,

41:41.340 --> 41:44.580
there was more challenges, I think that decision,

41:44.580 --> 41:46.820
I could have made that decision in a different direction.

41:46.820 --> 41:51.060
Maybe, I don't know, you've written brilliantly

41:51.060 --> 41:53.780
about trauma, if there's a bit more trauma

41:53.780 --> 41:56.740
as the background noise of my decision-making,

41:56.740 --> 42:00.900
I would be more likely to not be able to pull away

42:00.900 --> 42:02.980
from the gravitational field of that jealousy

42:02.980 --> 42:04.780
and it would build and build and build and build.

42:04.780 --> 42:09.780
So I think, not to disagree with a brilliant person,

42:10.020 --> 42:14.220
but I feel like that flame has the capacity

42:14.220 --> 42:16.300
to engulf the whole world, I guess.

42:16.300 --> 42:19.140
The initial flame of jealousy, the little bit,

42:19.140 --> 42:23.500
especially the younger you are, it's almost like a habit

42:23.500 --> 42:26.420
that you get to build in either direction.

42:26.420 --> 42:29.900
Because I've early on built the habit of saying,

42:29.900 --> 42:34.900
I'm going to channel that jealousy into productivity

42:35.300 --> 42:36.780
and into celebrating other people

42:36.780 --> 42:38.340
and that jealousy disappears.

42:38.340 --> 42:40.940
That was like a little discovery for me.

42:40.940 --> 42:42.340
I discovered that.

42:42.340 --> 42:44.740
That doesn't come, nobody tells that to you.

42:44.740 --> 42:46.180
You kind of discover that little thing.

42:46.180 --> 42:48.020
I could have easily not discovered it.

42:48.020 --> 42:51.420
I could have easily discovered that it kind of feels good

42:51.420 --> 42:54.980
to mess with that other person,

42:54.980 --> 42:59.980
to think shitty thoughts, think negative thoughts,

43:00.300 --> 43:02.420
do negative things to that other person.

43:02.420 --> 43:05.100
Because I just think the capacity

43:05.100 --> 43:07.140
in that initial feeling is there

43:07.140 --> 43:08.580
and I think it's a decision we'll make.

43:08.580 --> 43:13.580
Because otherwise, I think it dissolves responsibility.

43:15.220 --> 43:17.220
Well, surely I'm not Hitler.

43:17.220 --> 43:19.780
Therefore, this jealousy is normal.

43:19.780 --> 43:21.380
No, I just feel like every jealousy

43:21.380 --> 43:23.860
has the capacity to turn into, maybe not Hitler,

43:23.860 --> 43:27.580
but a toxicity that destroys in a small way

43:27.580 --> 43:30.340
in your own little private life, but it could destroy.

43:30.340 --> 43:33.860
I agree that jealousy brings us,

43:35.820 --> 43:37.740
can bring us dangerously close to envy.

43:37.740 --> 43:42.540
I mean, maybe, let's see if a heuristic we could agree on.

43:42.540 --> 43:43.380
Let's see.

43:43.380 --> 43:47.140
So let's say, okay, if we look at the terrain of the mind

43:48.140 --> 43:48.900
and this is geography.

43:48.900 --> 43:51.100
So if I'm feeling happy, satisfied,

43:51.100 --> 43:54.500
like I'm pretty far from envy land,

43:54.500 --> 43:57.060
but if I'm feeling jealousy now,

43:57.060 --> 44:00.540
I'm coming kind of closer to that border.

44:01.580 --> 44:06.580
And I think it's a big thing to go over the border,

44:06.820 --> 44:08.980
that the border isn't a gray area.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.820
There's a border to go over

44:10.820 --> 44:13.340
and I think that I agree completely,

44:13.340 --> 44:16.740
certainly about trauma, that the more trauma there is,

44:16.740 --> 44:18.660
because then the more misunderstandings there are

44:18.660 --> 44:20.500
about self and feelings that I'm not good enough,

44:20.500 --> 44:22.340
and then that can be anger about why

44:22.340 --> 44:23.580
and who might be oppressing me,

44:23.580 --> 44:26.820
and I hate myself and everyone else who seems to be better.

44:26.820 --> 44:30.640
So the trauma can drive us in these negative directions,

44:30.640 --> 44:33.260
but we're still crossing over something, right?

44:33.260 --> 44:36.340
So if you have the trinket and I think, that's awesome,

44:36.340 --> 44:38.880
I want that, I wanna work harder.

44:38.880 --> 44:40.360
You know what I could do though is,

44:40.360 --> 44:42.340
I could sneak in tonight when no one's around

44:42.340 --> 44:43.860
and I could move something.

44:43.860 --> 44:45.380
No, no way, I don't wanna do that, right?

44:45.420 --> 44:47.300
But it's like I came over the border a little bit

44:47.300 --> 44:49.360
and I thought maybe that's a better way,

44:49.360 --> 44:51.020
but then I came back, right?

44:51.020 --> 44:54.240
And we're responsible for that, right?

44:54.240 --> 44:56.620
Because it is a choice to say, I don't wanna work hard,

44:56.620 --> 44:58.020
I'm already working how hard?

44:58.020 --> 44:59.220
I don't wanna make my trinket better,

44:59.220 --> 45:01.060
I wanna think mine's the best one.

45:01.060 --> 45:02.660
I could destroy yours, right?

45:02.660 --> 45:05.380
Then we're letting our mind go over that border

45:05.380 --> 45:08.120
and do we say, right, run that forward, right?

45:08.120 --> 45:09.900
Let's run that forward and put people around us

45:09.900 --> 45:11.580
who feel the same way and start doing it

45:11.580 --> 45:14.300
so we think less of ourselves and we debase ourselves.

45:14.300 --> 45:18.340
Do we run headlong in or do we come over that boundary

45:18.340 --> 45:20.300
and that's maybe the capacity for evil in us,

45:20.300 --> 45:24.140
that we come over that boundary, all of us, right, at times.

45:24.140 --> 45:25.820
But do we come over it and then say,

45:25.820 --> 45:27.660
no, that's not my choice.

45:27.660 --> 45:30.340
That's not my self-definition and I'm coming back.

45:30.340 --> 45:31.700
But I'm trying to justify,

45:31.700 --> 45:34.320
maybe there's certain other sociological forces

45:34.320 --> 45:36.100
that help us cross the border too.

45:36.100 --> 45:39.500
So in Nazi Germany, we've been talking about Hitler,

45:39.500 --> 45:43.300
but then there's also the German people.

45:43.300 --> 45:45.740
And so maybe when there's a bit of a mass hysteria,

45:45.740 --> 45:50.500
so all these effects of like a combination of propaganda

45:50.500 --> 45:53.620
with the small jealousies and resentments

45:53.620 --> 45:55.620
of the people that don't cross the border,

45:56.580 --> 46:00.140
together they can with great charismatic leaders

46:00.140 --> 46:03.820
that sort of really fuel that fire that we feel

46:03.820 --> 46:05.100
when we're a part of the crowd.

46:05.100 --> 46:07.900
So maybe those individual kind of psychological barriers

46:07.900 --> 46:11.260
we have to take that lead from jealousy to envy,

46:11.260 --> 46:13.280
those can be made easier.

46:13.280 --> 46:15.460
The leap can be catalyzed through this mass hysteria.

46:15.460 --> 46:17.780
100%, 100%.

46:17.780 --> 46:20.620
I think that to me is a massive point.

46:20.620 --> 46:22.140
We're talking about layers of emergence, right?

46:22.140 --> 46:24.420
So if there's individual consciousness,

46:24.420 --> 46:25.860
then there's culture, right?

46:25.860 --> 46:28.380
And we're products of the soup we swim in, so to speak.

46:28.380 --> 46:30.220
People would say that when I was growing up, right?

46:30.220 --> 46:32.180
We're products of the soup we swim in.

46:32.180 --> 46:34.140
So if the soup that we're swimming in

46:34.140 --> 46:36.660
is the soup of hatred, right?

46:36.660 --> 46:38.780
Then it's gonna foster all of those things.

46:38.780 --> 46:40.900
So then you think about just in a painting

46:40.900 --> 46:42.420
with a very broad brush,

46:42.420 --> 46:44.180
the culture created in Germany

46:44.180 --> 46:45.980
prior to the Second World War,

46:45.980 --> 46:48.740
and what was the impact of the reparations

46:48.740 --> 46:50.100
after the First World War, right?

46:50.100 --> 46:52.860
Of the punishing reparations, impoverishment,

46:52.860 --> 46:56.460
and basic humiliation that people were feeling.

46:56.460 --> 46:59.260
Okay, there were a whole bunch of decisions

46:59.260 --> 47:01.980
that impacted that cultural perspective, right?

47:01.980 --> 47:03.660
Then there must have been aspects,

47:03.660 --> 47:08.020
just like I see in many ways parallels in America now

47:08.020 --> 47:09.500
of what are our standards

47:09.500 --> 47:12.700
for what we're communicating to others, right?

47:12.700 --> 47:13.940
How is the media deciding?

47:13.940 --> 47:15.500
Like what's real and what's not real?

47:15.500 --> 47:16.540
What's true?

47:16.540 --> 47:17.380
What's not true?

47:17.380 --> 47:21.340
What's hatred that is only gonna do evil

47:21.340 --> 47:22.820
versus what's hatred that's okay

47:22.820 --> 47:26.300
because I might sell something by putting it out there?

47:26.300 --> 47:30.620
I mean, that was, we know that was going on in Germany

47:30.620 --> 47:31.900
during the rise of the Nazis.

47:31.900 --> 47:34.300
And I think there's a parallel to, you know,

47:34.300 --> 47:35.940
do we value truth?

47:35.940 --> 47:37.220
Can we stand together and say,

47:37.220 --> 47:38.660
no matter how much I might disagree

47:38.660 --> 47:40.020
with you politically, right?

47:40.020 --> 47:42.620
We can still understand like that there's right

47:42.620 --> 47:43.460
and there's wrong, right?

47:43.460 --> 47:45.340
There's truth and there's lies, right?

47:45.340 --> 47:48.060
So I think those are just two examples

47:48.060 --> 47:49.740
of determinants of culture.

47:49.740 --> 47:53.060
And then the culture is a determinant of, you know,

47:53.060 --> 47:56.220
is someone like Hitler marginalizes,

47:56.220 --> 47:58.540
like that's a crazy evil person.

47:58.540 --> 48:00.660
Oh my goodness, like, whoa, right?

48:00.660 --> 48:03.300
Or is that someone who gains a greater following

48:03.300 --> 48:06.420
and more adherence and then there starts to be a momentum

48:06.420 --> 48:09.220
because why, because what the demagogues do?

48:09.220 --> 48:12.860
I think they have a giant lasso and they harness the envy

48:12.860 --> 48:16.500
of thousands upon thousands upon thousands of people.

48:16.500 --> 48:18.380
That's right, you feel worse about yourself too.

48:18.380 --> 48:19.820
Doesn't matter what the reasons are.

48:19.820 --> 48:21.700
Maybe it's your childhood, maybe it's not,

48:21.700 --> 48:23.700
maybe it's job failings, maybe it's professional,

48:23.700 --> 48:25.100
maybe it's personal, doesn't matter.

48:25.100 --> 48:28.140
Like you have envy too, let's put it together

48:28.140 --> 48:29.340
and do some destruction

48:29.340 --> 48:32.300
because that'll make us feel better, which is a lie.

48:33.260 --> 48:35.740
So we've talked about envy, where does,

48:35.740 --> 48:39.660
from the leader perspective, things like narcissism

48:39.660 --> 48:42.820
or sociopathy, psychopathy come into play?

48:42.820 --> 48:46.620
What can you make of the world we live in,

48:46.620 --> 48:50.500
maybe the leaders that run the world from the perspective,

48:50.500 --> 48:52.380
from the lens of narcissism?

48:52.380 --> 48:57.380
So I am struck 20 years of doing what I do now.

48:57.420 --> 48:59.020
I've been a psychiatrist for 20 years

48:59.020 --> 49:00.940
and I practice in so many different settings

49:00.940 --> 49:02.380
and I consult in different settings.

49:02.380 --> 49:05.020
I've been fortunate to have a very wide purview

49:05.020 --> 49:06.500
of like what's going on in people

49:06.500 --> 49:08.260
and in the world around us.

49:08.260 --> 49:11.140
And I am struck with amazement

49:11.140 --> 49:14.900
that of all the things I see that are say abnormal,

49:14.900 --> 49:16.820
let's say from the mental health perspective,

49:16.820 --> 49:19.340
this could be depression, panic attacks,

49:20.300 --> 49:22.260
hearing voices, addiction,

49:22.260 --> 49:24.860
but there's so many things that cover everything

49:25.860 --> 49:30.460
that narcissism is not frequent

49:30.460 --> 49:32.140
compared to a lot of other things.

49:32.140 --> 49:36.380
So it's small in terms of say narcissistic diagnosis, right?

49:36.380 --> 49:38.540
It's much less than many other things,

49:38.540 --> 49:41.340
but it causes the lion's share.

49:41.340 --> 49:44.060
I don't just mean the most compared to anything else,

49:44.060 --> 49:49.060
but I think more than 50%, the majority of bad things,

49:49.700 --> 49:51.540
evil things, destructive things

49:51.540 --> 49:53.500
that I see in the world around us.

49:53.540 --> 49:57.060
I think narcissists are wildly destructive

49:57.060 --> 49:59.540
because they are driven completely.

49:59.540 --> 50:04.540
They are lodged completely in the lane of envy.

50:05.980 --> 50:08.900
Can you try to sneak up

50:08.900 --> 50:10.900
and we don't wanna be lost in definitions,

50:10.900 --> 50:13.460
but can you try to sneak up to a definition,

50:13.460 --> 50:15.460
non-clinical definition of narcissism

50:15.460 --> 50:17.180
that we're talking about?

50:17.180 --> 50:22.180
So narcissism is a deep pervasive

50:22.700 --> 50:27.700
and unquestioned sense of inadequacy in the self

50:28.740 --> 50:32.540
that comes along with anger and fear and vulnerability,

50:33.540 --> 50:35.980
fear of destruction, fear of annihilation

50:35.980 --> 50:40.940
that is compensated for by aggression,

50:40.940 --> 50:44.220
by the mechanics of envy,

50:44.220 --> 50:49.140
by trying to make the self seem better

50:49.140 --> 50:53.540
at the expense of others, by taking from others,

50:53.540 --> 50:55.820
by being completely cavalier

50:55.820 --> 50:58.220
to the thoughts and feelings of others.

50:58.220 --> 51:00.140
That narcissism is not arrogance.

51:00.140 --> 51:02.540
Narcissism is the opposite of arrogance.

51:02.540 --> 51:06.540
There is such a deep sense of inadequacy

51:06.540 --> 51:09.100
and incompetence in the self

51:09.100 --> 51:12.380
that the defensive structure around that

51:12.380 --> 51:16.740
becomes dominated by rocket-fueled envy.

51:17.740 --> 51:21.220
So the machinery of narcissism is envy,

51:21.220 --> 51:25.700
but what do you make of the kind of more popularly discussed

51:25.700 --> 51:28.580
kind of symptom of narcissism,

51:28.580 --> 51:33.140
which is a seeming not caring about other people,

51:34.220 --> 51:37.940
sort of a very inward-facing focus

51:37.940 --> 51:39.860
in terms of the calculation you make

51:39.860 --> 51:42.140
when making decisions about the world?

51:42.140 --> 51:46.020
Narcissistic people definitely care about other people, right?

51:46.220 --> 51:48.100
It's the people who are schizoid, right,

51:48.100 --> 51:51.700
and say that don't necessarily register other people, right?

51:51.700 --> 51:54.180
But narcissism, people care about other people,

51:54.180 --> 51:57.180
but it's entirely vis-a-vis the self, right?

51:57.180 --> 51:58.700
If I'm schizoid, I don't really notice

51:58.700 --> 52:00.300
or care much who you are, right?

52:00.300 --> 52:03.220
But if I'm narcissistic, I absolutely care

52:03.220 --> 52:05.220
because I'm watching every last detail of you,

52:05.220 --> 52:08.260
what might you have that's better than me, right?

52:08.260 --> 52:13.180
It's an incredibly intense focus upon individuals

52:13.180 --> 52:15.340
and demographics of people,

52:15.340 --> 52:20.340
but the priority, the goal is entirely about the self,

52:20.700 --> 52:22.580
which is why it can become easy to say,

52:22.580 --> 52:24.900
I don't care if a million people die, right?

52:24.900 --> 52:26.980
How different is that from going out

52:26.980 --> 52:30.380
and destroying one person or a million people, right?

52:30.380 --> 52:33.820
It's in the same category of those people only,

52:33.820 --> 52:35.420
their existence is only meaningful

52:35.420 --> 52:37.140
in how it relates to me.

52:38.780 --> 52:40.780
But it's still meaningful.

52:40.780 --> 52:44.260
It just seems like a very difficult leap to take

52:44.260 --> 52:46.620
that I don't care that a million people die.

52:47.740 --> 52:52.740
That seems to be, even with envy,

52:53.020 --> 52:58.020
that seems to be a big feeling and thought to have

52:58.300 --> 53:00.700
if you at all care about them.

53:00.700 --> 53:05.700
Are other people, I guess, tools for alleviation

53:06.620 --> 53:08.700
of your sense of inadequacy?

53:08.700 --> 53:10.260
Right, I mean, I don't even care about

53:10.260 --> 53:12.220
in that like being caring at all.

53:12.220 --> 53:14.660
I mean, caring about in that noticing

53:14.660 --> 53:17.020
that a person exists, right?

53:17.020 --> 53:18.860
I mean, someone who wants money

53:18.860 --> 53:21.420
and notices that there's a hundred dollar bill out

53:21.420 --> 53:22.260
cares about that.

53:22.260 --> 53:24.180
They don't care about the hundred dollar bill

53:24.180 --> 53:25.500
and that doesn't mean anything to them.

53:25.500 --> 53:27.140
It doesn't have thoughts and feelings,

53:27.140 --> 53:28.620
but it's gonna attract attention.

53:28.620 --> 53:31.980
They care about it because it's something that they want,

53:31.980 --> 53:32.820
right?

53:32.820 --> 53:34.100
The same way people will care about others,

53:34.100 --> 53:35.620
but only from the perspective of,

53:35.620 --> 53:37.260
do you have things that I want

53:37.260 --> 53:39.540
or can I feel better about myself

53:39.540 --> 53:40.820
by taking something from you,

53:40.820 --> 53:43.060
by making things worse for you?

53:43.060 --> 53:44.620
People often talk about narcissism

53:44.620 --> 53:46.300
as like the opposite of empathy.

53:48.180 --> 53:51.820
But sort of empathy, again, depends how you define it,

53:51.820 --> 53:56.820
but is a careful consideration

53:57.380 --> 54:00.020
of the mental space of another person,

54:00.020 --> 54:02.420
of how the other person sees the world.

54:02.420 --> 54:05.980
And so you're kind of saying that narcissism,

54:05.980 --> 54:09.420
narcissistic people would also be very good at that

54:10.300 --> 54:12.740
in order to understand how maybe the other person

54:12.740 --> 54:14.300
can be manipulated or something

54:14.300 --> 54:16.660
to alleviate your sense of inadequacy.

54:16.660 --> 54:17.620
Right, so there's a difference

54:17.620 --> 54:19.540
between the mechanics of empathy.

54:19.540 --> 54:21.860
So let's say, again, we can define things different ways.

54:21.860 --> 54:25.220
Let's say empathic attunement is the ability to be attuned

54:25.220 --> 54:27.220
and to think, okay, what's going on in you?

54:27.220 --> 54:28.340
What might you be thinking?

54:28.340 --> 54:29.940
What might you be feeling?

54:29.940 --> 54:32.380
There's some people have a lot of empathic attunement,

54:32.380 --> 54:35.940
but we could look at that as mechanistic, right?

54:35.940 --> 54:38.940
It doesn't equate to care, right?

54:39.100 --> 54:43.540
An empathic attunement can come along with empathy or not.

54:43.540 --> 54:46.300
Right, so yes, people who are narcissistic,

54:46.300 --> 54:47.500
they can mentalize well.

54:47.500 --> 54:52.100
So you mentalize meaning the ability to understand

54:52.100 --> 54:54.780
or to consider thoughts, feelings, motivations,

54:54.780 --> 54:56.460
and other people, right?

54:56.460 --> 54:59.980
So people who are narcissistic

54:59.980 --> 55:02.260
can have empathic attunement or mentalization

55:02.260 --> 55:04.460
depending upon how we wanna describe those things,

55:04.460 --> 55:08.420
but that has nothing to do with care,

55:08.420 --> 55:12.540
with actual empathy or kindness or consideration.

55:12.540 --> 55:16.380
So in that sense, empathy usually popularly used

55:16.380 --> 55:19.740
means that you care, like your happiness is aligned.

55:19.740 --> 55:22.260
There's this, I need to read this book.

55:22.260 --> 55:23.860
I've read so little science fiction.

55:23.860 --> 55:25.780
That's been one of my goals for this year,

55:25.780 --> 55:27.620
to catch up on some science fiction.

55:27.620 --> 55:31.140
So Robert Highland from Stranger in a Strange Land

55:31.140 --> 55:33.020
has this quote about love, which is,

55:33.020 --> 55:36.100
"'Love is that condition where another person's happiness

55:36.620 --> 55:38.420
is essential to your own.'"

55:38.420 --> 55:40.100
So that's a good definition, I guess, of empathy,

55:40.100 --> 55:42.340
where you're very sensitive,

55:42.340 --> 55:44.060
so mechanistically very sensitive

55:44.060 --> 55:46.460
to the state of another person's mind,

55:46.460 --> 55:50.380
and your goal is to maximize their happiness.

55:50.380 --> 55:52.500
It's like essential to your own happiness.

55:52.500 --> 55:54.980
So the happinesses are aligned,

55:54.980 --> 55:57.020
and when that's elevated to its highest forms,

55:57.020 --> 56:00.700
you can call that love, romantic love, friendship, and so on.

56:00.700 --> 56:01.540
Okay.

56:01.540 --> 56:03.100
There's one more thing about the narcissist

56:03.100 --> 56:05.940
is some people can be sort of benign narcissists,

56:06.780 --> 56:10.060
where they want great things for themselves, right?

56:10.060 --> 56:12.460
But if they have enough great things,

56:12.460 --> 56:15.420
they can sort of tolerate others being happy too.

56:15.420 --> 56:17.940
And these are people who sometimes

56:17.940 --> 56:19.700
are actually quite highly liked, right?

56:19.700 --> 56:21.780
Because they have to have the most money,

56:21.780 --> 56:23.660
the most power, the most of anything,

56:23.660 --> 56:25.900
anything more than anyone else could challenge.

56:25.900 --> 56:26.900
But as long as I have that,

56:26.900 --> 56:28.900
it's okay that you have some too, right?

56:28.900 --> 56:30.380
And then that can make you happy

56:30.380 --> 56:32.060
and can make you like me, right?

56:32.060 --> 56:35.460
So benign narcissists can be well-liked

56:35.540 --> 56:40.420
from that perspective, but it's still all about them.

56:40.420 --> 56:42.300
And that can change if, for example,

56:42.300 --> 56:44.660
there's a scarcity of resources now, right?

56:44.660 --> 56:45.860
But they're generally,

56:45.860 --> 56:48.020
they're not people who are being overtly destructive,

56:48.020 --> 56:50.340
although that they're over the border

56:50.340 --> 56:53.780
into the envy territory, right?

56:53.780 --> 56:55.740
Malignant narcissists are very different

56:55.740 --> 56:58.100
where they then want to have everything.

56:58.100 --> 57:00.860
So even if I have a thousand times more than you,

57:00.860 --> 57:02.540
do I still envy you what you have?

57:02.540 --> 57:04.180
Because I want to have,

57:04.180 --> 57:05.860
I don't think I can feel good enough about myself

57:05.860 --> 57:07.540
unless I have everything.

57:07.540 --> 57:08.380
And once I have everything,

57:08.380 --> 57:09.740
I won't feel good enough about myself either

57:09.740 --> 57:10.900
and then I don't have to have more, right?

57:10.900 --> 57:13.660
It's like that's malignant narcissism,

57:13.660 --> 57:16.660
which we think of as sociopathy, right?

57:16.660 --> 57:18.020
We can define these words in different ways,

57:18.020 --> 57:20.740
but they're very, very negative concepts.

57:20.740 --> 57:24.220
That's profound sociopathy, malignant narcissism,

57:25.380 --> 57:26.420
envy writ large.

57:26.420 --> 57:29.300
So sociopathy is malignant narcissism.

57:29.300 --> 57:31.420
That's a convenient way to think about it.

57:32.380 --> 57:35.300
No, because we can do sort of sociopathic things

57:35.300 --> 57:38.980
but not be sociopathic, like, well, we tell a white lie.

57:38.980 --> 57:41.580
It's like sort of sociopathy on steroids, right?

57:41.580 --> 57:45.180
Is then, you know, envy writ large is malignant narcissism.

57:45.180 --> 57:46.140
Well, just like you're saying,

57:46.140 --> 57:49.380
like there's empathic attunement, as you said.

57:49.380 --> 57:54.100
So there's the mechanistic aspect of empathy and sociopathy.

57:54.100 --> 57:56.100
And then there's the big label you get attached

57:56.100 --> 57:59.380
if you're just doing that thing regularly, I guess.

57:59.380 --> 58:01.580
Living your life through that lens, right?

58:01.580 --> 58:02.420
Yeah.

58:02.420 --> 58:06.620
And is there a nice spectrum that's like narcissism,

58:06.620 --> 58:08.580
sociopathy and psychopathy?

58:08.580 --> 58:12.220
Is it all the same kind of nice stroll through the woods

58:12.220 --> 58:13.860
till we're off the cliff?

58:13.860 --> 58:16.580
Not really, because the words don't have clear definitions

58:16.580 --> 58:18.300
like psychopathy and sociopathy.

58:18.300 --> 58:23.220
There's no real definition of psychopath or psychopathy.

58:23.220 --> 58:25.940
Or does that mean someone's sociopathic but psychotic?

58:25.940 --> 58:27.100
Like there's really not,

58:27.100 --> 58:29.740
we end up using those words colloquially, right?

58:29.740 --> 58:32.540
Which is why, you know, concepts that we can define,

58:32.540 --> 58:36.460
like envy, empathic attunement, narcissism,

58:36.460 --> 58:38.740
even though there might be nuances and definitions,

58:38.740 --> 58:42.580
like we can define them in ways that are widely accepted,

58:42.580 --> 58:45.340
including within psychology and psychiatry.

58:45.340 --> 58:47.660
So it's nice to just think about this broad umbrella

58:47.660 --> 58:50.020
of narcissism and the levels to which it's benign

58:50.020 --> 58:53.100
or malignant, and then also separating

58:53.100 --> 58:55.500
into the different mechanisms,

58:55.540 --> 58:57.300
like interaction by interaction,

58:57.300 --> 58:58.860
which sometimes can be narcissistic,

58:58.860 --> 59:01.220
but broadly speaking, do you do everything

59:01.220 --> 59:03.220
through the lens of malignant narcissism

59:03.220 --> 59:08.220
that makes you a sociopath or a malignant narcissist?

59:09.220 --> 59:10.820
Yes, and the thing I would add to that

59:10.820 --> 59:12.540
is the thought about culture.

59:12.540 --> 59:14.340
How does the cultures we're in,

59:14.340 --> 59:16.460
whether it's the culture of a household,

59:16.460 --> 59:17.620
the culture of a community,

59:17.620 --> 59:19.700
the culture of a nation or the world,

59:19.700 --> 59:23.860
how does that impact what unfolds in that person,

59:23.860 --> 59:26.220
and then how does what unfolds in that person

59:26.220 --> 59:27.340
impact that culture?

59:27.340 --> 59:30.540
Well, the question is, what unfolds in that person?

59:31.900 --> 59:33.180
How does culture affect it,

59:33.180 --> 59:37.780
but how does your own psychological development unfold that?

59:37.780 --> 59:39.820
Because narcissism in leaders

59:39.820 --> 59:42.820
is the most impactful thing, right?

59:42.820 --> 59:45.180
Who are the most impactful individuals?

59:45.180 --> 59:47.380
Well, what is the most impact of individual psychology?

59:47.380 --> 59:49.900
We have, it's usually leaders of countries

59:49.900 --> 59:52.540
or leaders of major organizations and so on.

59:52.540 --> 59:56.260
And one of the things you mentioned with benign narcissism,

59:56.260 --> 59:59.500
that seems to be aligned with success, right?

59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.780
If you care about your own success,

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:05.300
that's going to be, you're more likely to be,

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.340
have narcissistic tendencies, I suppose.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.660
And so my question is,

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:14.100
when you follow that thread of narcissism

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:16.740
to become the leader of a country,

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:21.420
now you have a lot of new, interesting psychological

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.980
complexities to deal with, like power.

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:26.060
That old cliche that power corrupts.

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:31.780
Does that, is it possible for power to corrupt the human mind

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:35.140
to where it pushes you farther and farther

01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:40.140
into malignant narcissism, into this destructive envy?

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:42.140
What are your thoughts on power,

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.500
like the effect of power in the human mind?

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.860
Yeah, I think power is,

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:50.660
let's say an accentuator, right?

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.420
An intensifier, right?

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:57.420
So I think it is true that there are people who can be

01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:59.300
sort of in a gray area where there are

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:04.020
malignant narcissistic tendencies and behaviors,

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.300
but there are also ways in which that person

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.900
can think outside of themselves and think in a broader way

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.220
and think sort of kindly about others.

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:14.860
And they're sort of trying to navigate

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.500
whether they're aware or not that they're trying

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.100
to navigate between one and the other.

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.980
And then the allure of power is,

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.660
well, just look, just exercise that power

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:22.940
and you'll feel better, right?

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.780
It'll show you that you're good enough.

01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:27.100
Look at the power you have and whatever may be going on

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:31.420
in the person's mind, that then power, yes, can corrupt.

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:35.020
Yes, I think that's why we have to have checks and balances

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:38.580
because we are all inscrutable to ourselves,

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:41.860
let alone to others, so we must have checks and balances

01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:44.020
and we should always have them on ourselves

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:45.140
as well as on others.

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.420
We should want that for the health of ourselves

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:49.460
and the world around us.

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:51.820
So I think all of that is true,

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:54.460
but there are also people who don't necessarily

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:57.740
become corrupted by power, right?

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:00.100
There can be an understanding and a grounding

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:03.100
that they're a steward of power, right?

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:07.020
A shepherd, I mean, the ways people describe utilizing power

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:10.180
and utilizing it in a benign way

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:14.980
that then fosters the healthy aspects of self, right?

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.340
So like gratitude and humility, right?

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:20.700
I mean, if we could add a healthy dose of gratitude

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.380
and humility to everyone or to our society,

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:24.940
there would be a sea change, right?

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.580
But how do you feel gratitude?

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.060
How do you feel humility?

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:32.300
Those things are incompatible with narcissism envy, right?

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:35.260
With really the bad pole of things that we're talking about.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:38.580
And part of the reason I'm so focused in my work

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:41.780
and really what runs through all of my thoughts about life

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:43.500
is the impact of trauma, right?

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.300
Because trauma creates these false lessons

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.540
and it walls us off from truth.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:52.860
And it starts to point towards the unhealthy ways

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:57.020
of trying to feel better about ourselves.

01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:00.140
But we have the health in us too.

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:01.820
We have those seeds of health too

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:04.100
that can grow into being a steward of power

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.500
and sharing power, being considerate and kind.

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:09.380
And we see a lot of that in the world too, right?

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:11.380
It's not all just the evil.

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:13.580
We see plenty of people who do good

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:14.940
and who are generous of spirit.

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:17.300
We have both in us and it is,

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:19.500
is I think you're talking about our culture

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:23.380
and the seeds that we sow and the climate that we set,

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.580
including putting governors and boundaries around,

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:29.300
like how do we rein in or say that the more aggressive,

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:32.340
the more envious or destructive is unacceptable, right?

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:36.060
How do we foster the part that's kind and considerate

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:38.660
and reflective and slow to judge of like,

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:39.700
hey, let's learn a little bit more.

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:40.980
Like, how do we foster that?

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.100
And I think a lot of that comes back

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:44.540
to early childhood education.

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:47.980
I think we don't do nearly enough to protect children.

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:50.100
And as a corollary to that,

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:52.420
we don't do nearly enough to educate children.

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:53.980
I wanna write a book.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:55.500
Second book I write is gonna be

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.220
everything I needed to know about life.

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:00.940
I learned as a second year post-graduate

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.660
psychiatry resident, I was like, why?

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:08.180
Why then did I learn so much about unconscious motivation,

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:11.580
about the impact of trauma, about how we can be envious

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.140
and how we can act out,

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:15.980
even about how our emotions trump logic in us.

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:19.660
Like, why don't we teach these things

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:21.340
when we're young enough to understand?

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:23.820
Like, why is that other kid bullying me, right?

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:26.420
Or why, just because I'm a little bit bigger,

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:28.780
do I wanna go thump that other kid on the head?

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.100
Like, what's going on?

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:33.180
That we don't do those things.

01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:35.460
You know, we're just tripping ahead of ourselves

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:37.340
and we don't stop and think.

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.780
How are we using our resources?

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:42.140
How are we shepherding forward the next generation,

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:43.220
which by the way is a generation

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.940
that's gonna determine our fates too, right?

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:48.580
As we get older, but we don't do that.

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:49.980
I often think of like in the Olympics

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:52.580
and you see like the great sprinters, right?

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.580
And they've gotta come out of the blocks perfectly, right?

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.460
So if they come out of the blocks a little bit too fast,

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:57.460
they're gonna fall over, right?

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.540
They're gonna just fall forward.

01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:03.420
And I often see that in my head about us as humans

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.220
and as a culture that we're rushing so far forward.

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:09.340
We don't stop and say, wait, let's keep the basics here.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.660
The basic techniques of like,

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.660
how are we navigating forward in life?

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:14.940
Or do we just throw all those away

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:18.780
because I can get some benefit by saying that you're bad,

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:21.620
even though what's being leveled against you is wrong, right?

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:23.820
Like why, do I take that?

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:26.580
Or do I say, no, there's something more important here

01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:29.020
that we wanna shepherd forward in ourselves as a culture.

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:31.660
And I think preventing childhood trauma

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:34.860
and changing the ways that we educate children and adults

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:37.020
could again make a sea change

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.500
and maybe set us on a course towards,

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.540
even towards a greater likelihood of survival as a species.

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:47.540
Yeah, so talking to like people in elementary school

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:52.220
about human nature and teaching them

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:55.460
so how people can be resentful and envious

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:58.540
and how to deal with your emotions,

01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:02.340
how to, yeah, so these basic interaction things

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:04.620
about human relationships, about friendships,

01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:08.540
about betrayal, about love, about all those things.

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:12.620
Like it just, it's actually strange that we don't,

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:16.620
we kind of hope the parents talk about that kind of stuff.

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:21.620
But then the parents often need therapy themselves.

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:24.420
The parents didn't learn it.

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:25.260
Yeah, the parents didn't learn it.

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:27.780
I mean, I'm not joking that I was mad.

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:29.380
You know, second year after medical school,

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:30.220
like how is it?

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.780
Like I think of even things in my own life

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:36.340
and how much shame I felt after my brother's suicide.

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.140
Like I was already an adult, right?

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:41.100
I was a young adult, but I felt so much shame.

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:43.780
I didn't, like I had no understanding that,

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:47.660
that, oh, like it's a reflex to trauma, right?

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:49.100
To feel guilt and shame.

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.300
And that of course I was feeling that.

01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:54.300
It didn't mean it was true because I felt it,

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.460
but I mapped the fact that I felt ashamed

01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:59.020
to the fact that I should have felt guilty and ashamed.

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:02.060
And it like led to some very negative things in my life

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:03.820
that I had to sort of pull myself back from

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:04.660
and recover from.

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:07.820
And like, I didn't know that, right?

01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:10.660
I didn't know the automaticity of the reflex

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.220
and how pervasive it can be and how it can put blinders on us.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:15.420
And I mean, it's just one example,

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:16.820
but it's an example of something big

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:19.860
that happens to people that we don't learn about.

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:22.740
And I find myself sometimes having conversations

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:23.580
with a person.

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:24.860
So, you know, I still do a lot of clinical care

01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:28.380
of having conversations with a person after a tragedy.

01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:30.060
And I'm saying, I can't believe, right?

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:33.380
Again, I'm saying the things that this person didn't learn

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.820
in elementary school, because like none of us did, right?

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.740
And then look at the misery and the suffering

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:39.420
and then I think this is one person

01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:42.220
among how many millions among us who, you know,

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:45.380
who try and go about their way without knowing things

01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:46.580
that are easily knowable,

01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:47.940
because they don't even know that they're knowable

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:50.500
because we don't teach them to ourselves.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.660
So how to deal with trauma.

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:54.540
The trauma happens, first of all,

01:07:55.620 --> 01:08:00.620
that suffering can happen and small trauma and big trauma,

01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:02.660
all of it can happen.

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:05.060
And there's natural ways to deal with it.

01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:08.540
So in the case of trauma, as you write about,

01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:11.940
and we can also just talk about some more of the details

01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:14.900
of that, but it's good to bring it to the surface

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:19.260
to talk about it, to not be ashamed to hide it inside,

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:22.140
to be some kind of secret that it's actually,

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:26.140
I mean, there's a lot of positive things to say here,

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:27.300
at least from my perspective.

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:30.260
One is it's discussing trauma and dealing with trauma

01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:32.820
together with other human beings by talking about it

01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:35.300
as a path to deep friendship and intimacy

01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:36.180
with those people.

01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:41.420
There's a dark aspect to trauma, to war,

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:46.420
that communicating it or sharing it bonds you.

01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:50.820
So like the other side of trauma is like love,

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:54.020
is you need that hardship, not you don't need it,

01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:56.540
but hardship and trauma can often be a catalyst

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:57.980
for a deep human connection.

01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:59.140
If you bring it to the surface,

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:02.180
it's supposed to kind of hide it on the inside.

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:03.780
If we can just linger on it,

01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:08.100
because you've been through a few very traumatic events

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:10.820
in your life, when you were 25 years old,

01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:13.580
as you mentioned, your brother committed suicide,

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:17.660
what did that event teach you about life,

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:21.740
about death, and about the human mind?

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:25.220
What certainly brought me face to face

01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:28.780
with the truths of life and death,

01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:33.380
because I had not had a major trauma before then,

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:36.980
so there wasn't a major trauma in my developmental years,

01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:39.100
that what can carry forward

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:40.860
is a sort of omnipotence defense, right?

01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:42.980
I mean, the thought is that when we're toddlers,

01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:45.020
we all have an omnipotence defense,

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:47.620
which is like, I can just try and get up and run and move,

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:49.900
and if I run into something, I'll get up and do it again,

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.460
right, that we kind of have to,

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:54.460
and it's partly the protection of the parent, et cetera,

01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:56.340
but we think we can get out there in the world

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:57.500
and do things, and we just do,

01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:00.140
and if we don't have major traumas,

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:01.740
we can sort of carry through the,

01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:04.260
oh, like, bad things aren't gonna happen to me, you know?

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:05.820
Like, I know that they're there,

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:06.780
and I know they happen to people,

01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:08.900
but they don't happen to me, right?

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:10.900
And sometimes what will happen

01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:13.700
is being confronted with such a tragedy,

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.380
wipes that away very, very quickly,

01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:18.220
and then the person feels extremely exposed,

01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:22.580
like, oh, I thought that, like, I was gonna be okay,

01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:24.500
and now I know that I'm not,

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.300
and then, and that can start to lead to,

01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:27.140
and what does that mean?

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:30.060
Now, is this all coming for me now?

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:33.580
You know, is, did I get so lucky for 25 years,

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.380
nothing bad happened, nothing but bad things

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:36.780
are gonna be happening, am I cursed?

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:38.620
Is my family cursed, right?

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:40.620
And I think that leads to, you say,

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:44.540
what the learning about the human mind, in retrospect,

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:47.820
I think I understood at the time to some degree,

01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:50.060
but not like I do now, I can put words to it now, right,

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:55.060
of, like, how incredibly important, powerful,

01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:58.660
powerfully important negative emotion is, right,

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:02.900
that how a sense of guilt and shame and vulnerability

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:07.860
can just pervade our entire life perspective,

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:10.740
so all of a sudden we're swimming in a very different soup,

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:14.140
and it's a frightening soup, and it's a toxic soup,

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:17.140
and I'm most struck by that,

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:19.420
and that goes along with the idea that, like,

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:23.420
we're not taught that emotion always beats logic,

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:25.260
you know, like, I think the idea of Descartes,

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:27.540
and, you know, the idea that we're rational creatures,

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:28.940
you know, that kind of comes down to us

01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:32.500
through Western thought is, like, completely not true,

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.740
like, we're rational creatures

01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:38.580
only if there is an emotion grabbing for our attention,

01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:40.420
right, like, you know, we're attending to one another,

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:42.860
we're being very logical, right, what we're doing now,

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:46.220
if we heard a frightening noise right outside the door,

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:47.780
like, we'd be entirely different, right,

01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:49.060
the emotion would trump everything,

01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:50.700
it's like, stop paying attention to this, right,

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.060
now safety is at stake, and we'd think differently,

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:55.220
feel differently, behave differently, right,

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:58.900
and this is what happens to us, not just in situations

01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:01.180
where something drags us from,

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:03.340
yanks us from one emotional state to another,

01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:05.140
but it can be very, very pervasive,

01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:09.180
so my sense of anger, frustration, inadequacy,

01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:10.780
and then soothing in unhealthy ways,

01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:13.100
you know, soothing by drinking too much,

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:15.140
and then kind of hating myself in the first place,

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:16.860
and hating the world around me,

01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:18.180
and then, you know, starting to think,

01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:19.900
well, who cares, you know, what happens,

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:22.660
like, you know, there's some very dark thoughts,

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:27.420
and choices that came from a changed perspective

01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:29.340
of self in the world.

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:33.260
So what do you do when that, because of trauma,

01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:38.260
again, small or large, you find yourself swimming

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:43.180
or drowning in a soup of negative emotion,

01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:44.020
what do you do?

01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:46.700
What do you do with that emotion?

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:49.420
I mean, we don't have to even talk about trauma,

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:51.940
I think the interesting thing is,

01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:56.860
you know, any one of us throughout the day

01:12:56.860 --> 01:13:00.220
can find ourselves taking a bit of a dip

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:02.500
in the pool of negative emotion.

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:03.820
What do we do with that?

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:06.980
The first thing is to separate how we feel

01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:10.740
from what's true, because we don't do a good job of that

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:14.380
as humans, if I feel bad about myself,

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:17.900
it's very easy to, then I conclude, like, I'm bad, right?

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:20.620
I feel ashamed of myself, I conclude I'm a terrible person

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:22.340
who's shameful, right?

01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:25.460
This is the, you know, there's an old psychodynamic concept

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:27.620
of what they used to call an observing ego,

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:28.780
it still gets called that.

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:31.140
It's not ego in the sense of arrogance, right?

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:34.820
It's the ability to step outside and to see ourselves, right?

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:37.060
So that's what lets us keep the difference

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:40.540
between our feelings, right, and what we know to be true.

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:41.940
Like, we can be very angry at someone,

01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:43.220
and so I think that person's terrible,

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:44.620
I think that person's stupid, and we're,

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.060
I think that right now, because, like,

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.940
something negative just passed between us,

01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:50.300
this inside of me, it's just because of how I feel,

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:51.780
like, when I can separate that,

01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:54.140
how do I actually think about that person, right?

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:59.140
And, you know, we get driven so, so frequently

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:02.620
by how we feel, because how we think,

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:04.780
therefore what we believe, right,

01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:06.260
just kind of comes on its heels,

01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:08.740
as if the feeling is dragging it along,

01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.420
and I've been struck by that.

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:13.980
It's one of the things that has struck me so the most,

01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:18.020
among the very most in 20 years of working as a psychiatrist

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:22.260
is how we are led by our feelings, our emotions,

01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:25.300
as if they are truth, and then they create truth

01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:28.900
because we embrace what they're telling us as true.

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:32.020
And that is, I think, incredibly,

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:33.620
I think it's how people learn prejudice,

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:36.140
I think it's how people learn self-hatred,

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:38.980
I think it's how we learn so many destructive behaviors,

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:41.420
and then the blinders on us

01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:44.060
come in more and more and more and more.

01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:46.340
So separate, you know, we're driven by what we feel,

01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:48.900
unless we understand that what we feel

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:51.260
is different from what we know to be true

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:53.420
or what we can decide on one way or another.

01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:55.940
And that requires realizing

01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:57.940
and catching the emotions themselves,

01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:59.820
realizing that it's an emotion.

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:01.700
A feeling comes into your mind, overtakes you,

01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:06.540
a feeling of anger, dislike, hatred, all of that,

01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:07.940
it just comes in.

01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:11.060
It's like, why did that person just cut me off

01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:13.540
in traffic or something like that, that feeling?

01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:16.140
So what, you just kind of take it as a feeling

01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:19.100
and realize it's a feeling that doesn't represent

01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:21.460
some deep reality about the world that's fundamental,

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:26.460
or you, that you just kind of watch it and let it pass,

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.860
which is the natural way of things.

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:32.460
Yeah, we decide if it means anything, you know?

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:34.260
If I'm mad, right, someone cut me off,

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:37.260
and I feel hatred and I want to destroy them, right,

01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:39.660
I just stop and think, look, I've got that in me.

01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:42.860
Are the stressors running too high in my life?

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:43.700
Like, is it really good?

01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:48.380
Should I be on this road, 10 minutes behind schedule?

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:49.220
What am I really doing?

01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:52.900
So we can learn, but yes, it's an observation skill, right?

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:56.180
And it's an observation skill that we can develop.

01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:59.500
I often think of something called the tapestry theory,

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:03.180
which I think initially was a theodicy of explaining,

01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:05.500
I believe this is true, I'm not sure of this,

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:09.140
the idea was that, oh, we don't see God's plan

01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:11.540
because we're up too close to it, right?

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:14.140
Like as if there was a beautiful tapestry on the wall

01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:15.420
and we're standing right up it,

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:17.580
we're only gonna see one part of it,

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:18.980
we need to stand back from it.

01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:21.940
And I remember learning that in a religion studies class,

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:24.620
I mean, really fascinated with that at the time.

01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:27.580
And I think that there are a lot of things

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:28.620
we do that about, right?

01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:32.180
And in training ourselves to have an observing ego,

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:36.140
what we're saying is, hey, just the busyness of life

01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:38.940
or my own impulses or the pool of emotions

01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:40.660
are trying to pull me up right close

01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:42.100
to whatever tapestry there is there.

01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:43.260
And I wanna sort of resist that.

01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:47.580
I mean, I'm better off if I really stay further behind it

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:50.340
and then I make a choice if I wanna come close to it.

01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:52.180
If there's some really positive emotion,

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:54.620
it's friendship or it's love or it's nurturing,

01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:57.140
you know what, let me come right up to this, right?

01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:59.580
But I wanna choose when I'm doing that,

01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:02.700
I don't want some drive, I didn't decide

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:04.300
to like take me by the back of the head

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:07.300
and put me up against that tapestry.

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:11.300
So the interesting exercise for me,

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:13.620
and I think for a lot of people in modern civilization

01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:16.220
is the internet with social media

01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:19.260
that it's almost like going to the gym

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:21.620
or something like that, at least that's the way I see it.

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:25.980
Because there's a bunch of forces on social media

01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:28.900
that are trying to make you feel things.

01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:33.500
Most of it is kind of in the negative space of feelings.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:36.860
Because there is actually a strong gravity pull

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:39.020
to negative feelings for some reason.

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:42.620
And so the, and the brain notices them more.

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:45.020
I don't know what that pull is, but it's there.

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:46.700
And you get to observe it on social media.

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:49.460
Like if you actually just scroll through social media,

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:54.620
you feel the gravitational pull of negative emotions.

01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:58.420
And I just see as a kind of exercise of like,

01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.340
you feel the pull, just like when you go to the gym,

01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:01.420
there's a resistance.

01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:03.940
And I practice like stepping away

01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:05.940
to look at the tapestry, right?

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:07.300
And there's different mechanisms

01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:09.140
I think all of us have to learn.

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.500
For me, there's a kind of,

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:14.740
you mentioned gratitude and humility.

01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:20.060
So like if somebody, if it's me personally,

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:22.980
I've recently gotten attacked a few places here and there.

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.340
If they're saying that they're much smarter than me,

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:30.100
I practice kind of humility, like you mentioned.

01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:33.020
And I kind of imagine that they are smarter than me.

01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:35.380
Those things like help me to kind of like pull away,

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:38.180
like, and then maybe they have a lesson to teach me.

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:42.180
Like I don't take their sort of negative comments to heart,

01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:44.700
but I imagine the human being and like that they,

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:46.380
they might have a lesson to teach me.

01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:48.460
And in general, when it's more amorphous

01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:49.700
kind of negative feeling,

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:52.140
I think the other thing is the gratitude,

01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:54.780
just like different versions,

01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:57.620
almost meme-ifiable versions of like,

01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:59.020
oh, this is pretty cool.

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:00.540
Like we got a thing going here.

01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:01.780
There's like human civilization,

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:04.180
like bickering and having a little fun,

01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:06.900
like lunch food fight.

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.100
And it's kind of cool.

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:09.940
Like we get to interact in this way

01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:12.660
and there's a bit of humor.

01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:13.900
There's, it's like Thanksgiving dinner.

01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:16.140
Like if you, like Thanksgiving dinner,

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.620
if you're arguing about politics,

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:18.980
you can feel like really intense.

01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:20.300
Like, I can't believe you said this,

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:22.660
but if you zoom out, it's like family.

01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:24.540
This is like, this is amazing.

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:27.500
So that kind of feeling really helps.

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:29.820
But it's like, it really is like going to the gym.

01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:31.940
It's like building up a muscle

01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:36.100
to be able to pull away from those emotions.

01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:39.500
I don't think I get to practice that kind of emotion

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.020
regular day-to-day life.

01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:43.460
Cause like you can't, it's hard to get those reps.

01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:45.500
On social media, you can really get the reps in.

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:46.340
It's kind of cool.

01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:48.580
Like that's the way I see social media

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:51.620
is a chance to sort of practice that stoicism

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.220
of like, of gratitude, of humility,

01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:56.140
of loving other people in the face

01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:58.140
of this negative emotion, all that.

01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:01.900
Yes, and you know, there's a certain kind of psychotherapy

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:04.180
that talks a lot about this idea that like,

01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:06.180
oh, everything is as it should be, right?

01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:09.580
Which doesn't mean from some moral or justice point.

01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:12.180
It's just that often if you look at things,

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:16.020
one thing leads to another, to another, to another

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:19.060
in a way that's actually very, very predictable,

01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:21.580
even though we might be surprised about it, right?

01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:26.180
And so an example, so I would say that gratitude

01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:30.180
often does come along with a healthy pride, right?

01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:33.220
So you could say in the example you gave,

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:35.260
hey, I'm being assailed on social media.

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:37.900
Okay, so you could say, well, you know,

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:42.220
there was a time I sat at, I set forth to impact people,

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:46.100
right, to be able to reach people and to impact them, right?

01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:49.420
And look, I feel a sense of both gratitude and pride

01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:50.620
that I've done that, right?

01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:53.660
Because look, you did it because of your effort, right?

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:55.380
Your work, your intelligence, your thoughts,

01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:57.420
like you're responsible for it, right?

01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:01.380
But also you feel gratitude because any one of us

01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:03.020
who's here and has any opportunity

01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:05.220
has reason to feel immense gratitude, right?

01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:08.020
So then you can say, okay, what's actually going on here

01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:09.540
is something successful.

01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:13.580
I set out to do something and I'm doing it, right?

01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:16.380
And what it brings with it

01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:19.140
absolutely includes being assailed.

01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.540
There's no surprise there, right?

01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:24.900
Because people who have anything good

01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:27.060
serve as lightning rods for envy.

01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:30.780
So then, yes, there'll be people who wanna make up lies

01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:31.940
or whatever they wanna do

01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:34.420
because you become a lightning rod for envy

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:37.420
by having succeeded at the thing you set out to do

01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:40.300
about which you can feel a healthy pride and gratitude,

01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:41.140
right?

01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:43.460
And then I think that kind of puts it in its place.

01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:45.180
I mean, you're still gonna make decisions about it,

01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:47.020
but it makes sense then.

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:49.820
Like you have a mechanism of understanding it

01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:52.260
that not only makes sense to you,

01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:56.420
but reflects the truth of what you actually have done

01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:58.820
and achieved and what's going on in the world around you.

01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:01.780
Well, I wonder if we're all kind of a little bit unique

01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:03.060
in this because for me,

01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:06.340
I mean, maybe it's useful to kind of talk

01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:08.220
through my own experience of it,

01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:11.940
is for me, I try to avoid,

01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:14.620
especially in those situations to feel pride

01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:18.420
because I'm just looking empirically.

01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:23.020
I feel way happier if I focus on humility.

01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:25.860
If I ever think of like,

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:28.180
oh yeah, when you do something meaningful

01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:29.820
or you become more popular,

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.420
you're going to experience these kinds of,

01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:35.980
I feel the attacks more and it's like me versus the world.

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:37.540
That's the feeling that you start getting

01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:39.860
and that does not create a pleasant feeling.

01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:43.740
So to me, the pleasant feeling is like stepping away,

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:45.700
like kind of laughing at it all,

01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:47.940
like with a smile and not like in a negative,

01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:50.380
like laughing at people but just like laughing

01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:52.780
at the theater of it, the circus of it,

01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:55.260
like this whole absurd existence we've got going on

01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:57.660
and then just having a humility in like,

01:22:57.660 --> 01:22:59.140
everybody has a lesson to teach me.

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.460
It just makes me feel good.

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:03.660
The pride thing, I do like feeling

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:07.700
in a positive pool of emotion.

01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:11.140
So if I'm building a trinket and I finish it,

01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:12.580
I'm like really happy with myself.

01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:13.740
Like I finished this thing

01:23:13.740 --> 01:23:16.820
and I usually actually like to do that alone.

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:18.540
Like I don't need an audience for pride.

01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:21.300
I like to sit there and just like, ooh, this is cool.

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:22.980
I did that, you know?

01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:25.900
But I just, I find that in social interactions,

01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:31.300
pride is just a danger, it's a dangerous drug for me

01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:34.140
because it like, it's such a small,

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:39.860
it's a small step away from then losing all the humility

01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:42.420
and then you start getting very defensive

01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:43.620
and that's not going to,

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:47.540
it just starts you on a spiral of negative emotion.

01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:51.340
But I also, I mean, with everybody you've mentioned this,

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:54.140
it will probably sneak up to it in different directions.

01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:58.340
I do think there's different brains that we all have.

01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:02.060
Like my brain is exceptionally self-critical,

01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:06.180
like nonstop, it's like an engine that's always there.

01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:13.220
But at the same time, I'm able to zoom out and have gratitude

01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:16.060
as if there's like two brains

01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:19.340
and they're like cohabitating happily.

01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:21.500
And I can, the better I get at this,

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.940
the more I can use the one that's self-critical

01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:25.460
when I'm trying to be productive

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.060
because naturally I'm super lazy.

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:30.340
So I'm trying not to be less lazy, I'll be self-critical.

01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:33.700
And then when I'm not being lazy,

01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.340
when there's a special moment, I want to enjoy that moment,

01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:38.660
I'll turn on the gratitude engine.

01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:40.780
I feel like generic advice that people would give,

01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:43.460
if your brain is self-critical, that's not a good thing.

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:45.420
Like you should probably get rid of that.

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:48.620
I don't know about that because it seems to be working.

01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:50.940
Like I kind of like it.

01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:54.580
I kind of like this grumpy old man that's in there

01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:58.740
that's like that thing you did that really sucked.

01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:01.860
I was like, and I kind of, you know,

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:03.140
there's a movie, Grumpy Old Men,

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:07.020
like I like that grumpy voice, the grumpy cat is in there.

01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:10.100
And it's nice, but yeah, it can have bad effects

01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:14.340
on relationships and on maybe my wellbeing,

01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:16.060
maybe as you get older and all that kind of stuff.

01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:17.940
So yeah, you have to monitor all this kind of stuff,

01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:20.740
but I don't know, I don't know which one is like,

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:22.260
because you've kind of highlighted,

01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:24.060
it's good to have gratitude and humility,

01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:25.660
but it's also good to have a little bit of pride.

01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:29.620
I wonder what that like set of ingredients for a healthy,

01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:32.860
what like healthy life looks like for each of us,

01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:37.020
whether we have to customize and figure out what that is.

01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:40.180
Because some of the cake is already baked is the problem.

01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:43.500
And because of the trauma, like if I was like eight years old,

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:45.140
maybe I could be a little more flexible.

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:47.940
But at this point, like you got the thing you got

01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:49.780
and it's hard to like fix it.

01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:50.940
You can do a lot with it.

01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:51.780
You could.

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:54.300
It may not be easy, but there's a lot of plasticity

01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:56.300
and a lot of pliability there.

01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:58.540
Across all ages.

01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:01.260
Again, people are different and there may be idiosyncrasies

01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:03.060
of why one person is in a different place.

01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:05.860
But as a general rule, I think the answer is absolutely yes.

01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:08.580
And people have evolved and I've worked with people

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:10.580
who've really changed themselves

01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:12.460
and broadened their conception and understanding.

01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:13.660
You know, they're in their eighties

01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:16.500
or I think we can do it at any stage of life.

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:21.340
And I would make a case for intra-psychic.

01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:23.900
So not between people necessarily, right?

01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:26.460
But inside of oneself or the feeling of pride.

01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:28.140
And maybe if we call it self-esteem, right?

01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:30.300
Let's say we call it self-esteem, right?

01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:31.820
Or we could call it healthy pride.

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:33.300
We could put either word to it.

01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:36.180
But if you think about what we're trying to avoid,

01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:38.740
is say a sense of inadequacy,

01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:42.060
then it is good to sort of own what's ours.

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:44.820
We can put ourselves a little bit out of balance,

01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:47.700
either in terms of building up resentments

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:50.660
or in terms of decreasing self-confidence, right?

01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:54.140
If we're not owning everything that's ours, right?

01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:56.900
So a thought I would have about,

01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:00.740
let's say about some pride or some self-esteem, right?

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:03.820
Is it can work against vulnerability, right?

01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:06.140
Which we know can also in some situations

01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:09.260
push us towards jumping the boundary into envy

01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:10.100
and all of that.

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:12.260
So let's think about vulnerability.

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:16.700
If you conceive, okay, people are assailing me

01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:20.180
and you just go to a place of gratitude,

01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:24.100
you know, it can send a message that,

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:26.820
okay, I'm just lucky and I hope I continue to get lucky

01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:29.020
as opposed to like, that's not true, right?

01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:31.620
Like there's ability inside of me

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:34.060
and discernment inside of me that tells me

01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:36.220
I can have a greater sense of confidence

01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:38.820
that I'll navigate what comes my way, right?

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:42.060
So because the pride or the self-esteem part

01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:44.020
is owning what we've contributed

01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:46.180
to the goodness we've created, right?

01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:49.700
Which does in a sense helps us feel better about ourselves.

01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:52.580
And it also helps us feel armed against say

01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:54.740
the slings and arrows of, you know,

01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:56.980
whatever outrageous fortune may come next.

01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:58.860
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:00.740
Again, disagreeing with an expert here.

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:02.900
Yes, I think that's generally good advice

01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:05.460
but I think you mentioned vulnerability.

01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:10.580
I think it's like I've just been doing a lot of research

01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:12.940
on rocket engines and rocket fuel.

01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:16.780
Speaking of fuel, I just think I get a lot

01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:20.220
from being vulnerable because vulnerable leads to intimacy

01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:22.100
in friendships and relationships.

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:24.660
I get a lot from being intimately close with human beings

01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:29.180
just on a friendship, on a like a ideal level

01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:31.060
in conversations and so on.

01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:36.060
And so I would rather err on the side of vulnerability.

01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:38.580
Like to me, pride is destructive.

01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:39.540
I think I already,

01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:46.100
I already have a pretty good engine that says like,

01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:49.260
life is awesome.

01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:51.540
I don't need help for that, that's fine.

01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:52.580
That one is working.

01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:58.460
It's the, I just feel like the way to face the world

01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:01.140
that's full of uncertainty, that could be full of cruelty

01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:03.900
is with humility and gratitude.

01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:07.860
I don't know, this pride thing, it feels like,

01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:09.740
I know that for a lot of people,

01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:14.740
it's really important to really, really work on pride

01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:17.900
to make sure they don't crumble under the pressure

01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:21.100
of like, they don't give into this insecurity

01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:22.180
that destroys them.

01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:25.180
But I just, for me, empirically speaking,

01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:29.100
I seem to be happier facing the world with humility

01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:30.140
and just being grateful.

01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:32.340
The pride, I'm really worried about.

01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:35.980
Like, I just, it feels more destructive than anything.

01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:38.100
See, what I think as you're telling me that,

01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:39.140
and I don't wanna be presumptuous,

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:42.260
but I make some thoughts or some conclusions that tell me,

01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:44.420
hey, you're in a pretty healthy place, right?

01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:46.580
And the reason I say that is because

01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:48.740
I agree completely about vulnerability.

01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:51.060
I mean, think about humility and gratitude

01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:52.180
make us vulnerable, right?

01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:53.620
If like, wow, I'm grateful, thank you,

01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:54.500
I'm grateful for you.

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:56.700
You know, we could get shot down or something,

01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:57.540
something bad could happen

01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:59.140
or something could make us feel bad.

01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:01.900
So yes, we need vulnerability.

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:03.860
If we try and eliminate vulnerability,

01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:08.180
we're living miles into the envy land, right?

01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:11.420
So you're describing a healthy vulnerability,

01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:14.260
but then my brain says that's because on the other side

01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:16.260
of the seesaw, so to speak,

01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:18.940
has to be a healthy sense of self,

01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:21.300
whether we call it self-esteem or healthy pride.

01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:24.340
And then I'll cite what I think is the evidence for that

01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:27.220
is you described the negative voice, right?

01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:29.300
As like the grumpy cat, right?

01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:33.260
But that's a good negative voice to have, right?

01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:35.660
Because it's telling you like, hey, that wasn't your best.

01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:37.460
Like, come on, do better or, right?

01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:38.300
Like, you can do better.

01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:41.100
Like there's a negative voice in some ways,

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:42.940
but it believes in you, right?

01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:45.700
It's where that voice could be,

01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:48.100
it could be a negative voice that says,

01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:50.260
you didn't do that well because you suck.

01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:52.860
You don't deserve anything good, right?

01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:54.220
Why should you even be alive, right?

01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:56.380
I mean, that's the negative voice

01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:58.980
that can gain so much force

01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:01.260
if there isn't a balance of healthy self-esteem.

01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:03.500
So I think because you're well-balanced,

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:06.820
you have what you need and then having more of it

01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:08.460
seems like, oh, that's not so good.

01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.060
But there are people whose negative voice

01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:14.460
isn't the grumpy cat, it's hateful, right?

01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:16.340
And then that's a person who needs

01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:20.140
to bring that into greater balance.

01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:24.260
Yeah, I think my negative voice is like a grumpy cat

01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:26.820
that's like a French existentialist,

01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:28.780
maybe a little bit of a nihilist,

01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:30.140
but it's just kind of-

01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:31.220
Sartre's cat.

01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:33.740
Yeah, Sartre's cat, so it doesn't get hateful.

01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:34.740
It's not like a Hitler cat.

01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:38.500
So it's a little more...

01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:40.700
Yeah, I guess there is kind of like this line

01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:42.740
that we've come across a couple of times

01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:45.140
between the benign and the malignant.

01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:48.020
But of course, you have to monitor that line.

01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:50.580
I think you have to be careful

01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:54.100
when you face really difficult situations of,

01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:57.980
as you go on through life, more and more difficulty,

01:31:57.980 --> 01:31:59.940
you face a lot of loss and suffering,

01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:01.180
especially later in life.

01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:04.220
You have to be careful with that voice.

01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:07.700
That grumpy cat can get awfully confident.

01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:09.220
And then if you don't have any source

01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:11.860
of positive emotions in your life,

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:14.420
it can become too heavy of a burden.

01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:16.780
Yes, which I think this leads us to,

01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:19.580
well, I think it's a really important fact, right?

01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:20.860
That there are some people,

01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:23.100
like a significant subset of people

01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:26.180
who get happier as they get older.

01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:28.540
They have more contentment, a stronger sense of self.

01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:30.700
You might think, how could that ever happen, right?

01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:32.540
Like we're getting closer to death.

01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:34.340
We're accumulating insults, right?

01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:35.660
Like everything hurts a little bit more

01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:36.540
and we have less energy

01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:38.540
and we accumulate losses and traumas.

01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:41.900
Why would anyone be healthier across time,

01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:43.660
if you're happier across time?

01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:46.100
And what we see is it's linked to the things

01:32:46.100 --> 01:32:47.300
that we're talking about, right?

01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:50.180
It's linked to say, let's say vulnerability versus pride.

01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:51.500
Like there's a good balance there, right?

01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:52.700
There's a lot of humility.

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:54.380
There's a lot of self-esteem.

01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:56.820
The person is spending a lot of time

01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:59.940
standing back from the tapestry and looking at it, right?

01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:02.780
And what can come into people

01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:04.540
is in sort of a sense of equanimity.

01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:06.700
Like I sort of understand, you know,

01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:08.220
I'm being the best person I can be.

01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:10.460
And that's not always even great.

01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:12.180
And there are things that I don't feel great about

01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:13.540
even while I'm trying to do that.

01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:17.780
But look, I'm being who I'm choosing to be, right?

01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:19.620
And that doesn't have to be in some big way.

01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:22.220
I'm not saying that means any one specific thing.

01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:23.220
You know, that can mean the person

01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:25.620
who's taking care of their cat and tending their garden.

01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:26.780
Like that's enough.

01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:28.900
We have to have love,

01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:31.380
the ability to put good things out in the world, right?

01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:33.820
And to put our ability to work

01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:36.260
and to make things different out into the world

01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:37.500
and make things better.

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.220
And if we're doing that,

01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:40.900
we get happier across time

01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:44.420
because we come to a sense of peace with ourselves.

01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:45.660
I'm not supposed to be everything.

01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:46.820
I'm not supposed to do everything.

01:33:46.820 --> 01:33:48.860
I'm not supposed to fix everything, right?

01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:50.540
I'm also not supposed to suffer all the time

01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:52.420
for the things I haven't gotten right.

01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:53.460
You know what?

01:33:53.460 --> 01:33:56.300
I guess I'm kind of, and it leads back to Winnicott, right?

01:33:56.300 --> 01:34:00.900
The British physician, you know, I'm good enough.

01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:05.300
And that seems to help people feel happy, you know,

01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:07.460
contentment and be generative and productive

01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:08.380
into later life.

01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:10.940
It's like, that's what we all should be wanting.

01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:12.660
But it's even, it's kind of an afterthought though.

01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:15.220
Some people are like that as opposed to, wait a second,

01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:17.780
right, like what's going on with them

01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:20.060
and let's do all of that.

01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:24.540
Albert Camus writes a myth of Sisyphus, quote,

01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:27.100
there's only one real serious philosophical problem

01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:29.180
and that is suicide.

01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:31.860
Deciding whether or not life is worth living

01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:34.580
is to answer the fundamental question in philosophy.

01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:38.340
All other questions follow from that.

01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:40.260
So basically to be or not to be.

01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:46.060
Do you think there's a truth to that statement?

01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:48.820
This question of why live at all?

01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:52.860
Do you think there's truth to that statement

01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:55.380
being a really, really important question for us to answer?

01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:57.100
Yes, yes.

01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:58.740
And what's the answer?

01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:00.700
I think the answer is yes.

01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:02.700
And I think Kemu answered it.

01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:03.700
Yes, too.

01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:09.180
I love his writing and I think there was a streak

01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:15.380
of nihilism that I think grew in his writing over the years

01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:18.260
and the thought is that Kemu died by suicide.

01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:21.500
I think we're not sure of that because it was a car accident.

01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:25.380
But I've always read that as the primary scholarly opinion.

01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:27.980
And I think it's interesting that after his death,

01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:30.700
a book called The First Man was published,

01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:32.740
which I don't know if he had intended to publish.

01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:34.260
I don't remember the specifics about it.

01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:36.540
But it's about him as a child, right?

01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:38.260
And it's interesting, the first man,

01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:41.420
he was the first man in his existence, right?

01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:44.940
The most, the one that felt and experienced everything.

01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:48.700
And there's sadness and distress and all in that book,

01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:52.300
but there's a beauty of life and living and experience.

01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:55.100
And then I think to compare that beauty,

01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:57.900
like that's life, even if something's difficult

01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:59.780
and scary and sad, like there's something beautiful

01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:01.500
around the corner and here's a kind person

01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:05.060
and a new discovery, more what was in him as a child.

01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:07.900
And I think that we can get jaded as we get,

01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:09.460
as you and I were just talking about a few minutes ago,

01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:12.140
we can accentuate the negative and foster the negative

01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:14.940
and come to a place where we're looking

01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:18.460
for some in-depth philosophical answer,

01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:22.060
some thick book that's gonna explain all that to us

01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:25.580
instead of the simplicity that we've been talking about.

01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:30.580
I think humility, gratitude helps us have just simple,

01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:33.420
positive experiences, feelings of contentment,

01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:35.300
feelings of connection with another person,

01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:36.660
learning, discovery.

01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:39.260
And I think the answer to Kemu's question is yes.

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:41.420
And I think it lies in his writing

01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:43.300
about when he was a child,

01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:45.900
which I think he saw as less important

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:48.780
than his later writings and the intellectual heaviness

01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:52.340
when I think maybe he had lost his way a little bit

01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:54.860
from the things he understood when he was younger.

01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:56.860
So another way to talk about it,

01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:59.700
and I'd love to hear what you think is

01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:03.260
about these broad categories.

01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:05.300
Let me be started with Kierkegaard

01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:08.940
of existentialism, absurdism, and nihilism.

01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:12.180
And I think Kemu considered himself an absurdist,

01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:13.780
not actually an existentialist.

01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:16.780
It's kind of a middle ground where I think existentialist,

01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:21.060
I don't wanna characterize it in the wrong way,

01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:22.500
and there's a lot of different definitions,

01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:27.140
but I think existentialists ultimately do think

01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:31.300
that there is meaning in sort of pursuing

01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:35.900
the passion of life, like in living life.

01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:37.220
That's where you discover the meaning

01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:41.660
at that individual level of fully embracing life.

01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:46.620
And I think sort of nihilism is,

01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:48.060
again, it's kind of like a spectrum,

01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:52.020
but nihilism basically says there's no meaning

01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:56.540
and it doesn't matter, nothing matters.

01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:59.500
I don't even know, but somehow that lands you

01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:02.900
in a place that's totally uninspired.

01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:05.540
Maybe nihilists would disagree with that.

01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:08.300
Maybe there's a way to live a creative life

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:10.260
in a nihilistic mindset.

01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:14.580
And I think absurdism is somewhere in the middle

01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:19.580
where pursuing meaning at all is not a good idea.

01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:23.900
So kind of I think existentialists say

01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:25.580
you should be looking for meaning,

01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:28.100
and it's to be discovered in your own actions,

01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:30.180
in your own life, in the moment.

01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:34.460
And absurdism says life is absurd, nothing makes sense.

01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:37.660
Don't look for the meaning, just live, just be.

01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:42.660
I think that's kind of the later Camus kind of philosophy.

01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:44.380
I don't know if you can sort of comment

01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:47.420
on these kind of nuanced ideas here.

01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:52.420
If there is no religious guide to your life,

01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:56.820
what do you think about this kind of search for meaning?

01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:58.500
Do you see that there's some wisdom

01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:01.620
in the existentialist perspective of discovering it

01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:03.700
in your own life, in this passion,

01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:06.260
in this kind of day-to-day existence,

01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:08.180
in the moments of your life that bring you joy,

01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:09.020
that kind of thing?

01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:10.780
You're bringing different sort of perspectives

01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:12.220
and trying to tease apart, like wait,

01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:14.500
what are the differences in those perspectives?

01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:17.060
And I think what it points out is that,

01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:19.780
okay, we tend to conflate things as human beings

01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:21.140
and to take two different things

01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:22.700
and try and make them into one.

01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:24.820
But we also, I think on the other end of the spectrum,

01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:26.980
get very overly reductionist.

01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:30.380
And I think that when we get too overly reductionist,

01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:32.380
we lose the ability to learn from anything

01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:33.460
or to generate meaning, right?

01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:35.020
I mean, the thing about Sartre,

01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:37.180
who the thought of existentialism

01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.660
is so consistent with him, right?

01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:43.140
Who, on the one hand, wrote about very clear terms,

01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:44.620
like this is what it is and this is what it isn't,

01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:45.980
and here's how you're gonna make your meaning

01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:48.820
in a very academically proscribed way.

01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:52.380
But he also wrote short stories like The Wall, right,

01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:54.980
where something totally absurd happens, right,

01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:56.420
as part of the story, right?

01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:58.780
So I think what ends up happening

01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:00.300
is people either reduce themselves

01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:02.220
or get associated with something

01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:04.220
that by being overly reductionist

01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:05.940
takes us away from meaning, right?

01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:08.700
The idea that, look, we don't know

01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:12.260
if there is an overarching religious meaning

01:40:12.260 --> 01:40:14.860
or what we call a religious meaning or purpose.

01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:16.880
We don't know that, right?

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:18.780
So, okay, if we take that as a given,

01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:21.500
that people who say that they know are having faith,

01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:23.140
like how Spinoza described faith, right?

01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:27.180
Faith is that you don't know, but you believe anyway, right?

01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:30.820
It's not because you have faith now you know something, right,

01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:33.140
because I think that's a slippery slope

01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:35.260
to the persecution of others, right?

01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:38.580
So if we say, okay, we don't know,

01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:41.420
then we're left either deciding,

01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:43.340
okay, well, then to hell with everything.

01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:46.300
You know, like, there's that movie, A Strange Brew, right,

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:47.860
Bob and Doug McKenzie where like,

01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:49.540
the brakes don't work on the car

01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:52.100
and one of them says, oh, why bother steering, right?

01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:53.620
So if we don't know that there's meaning,

01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:54.460
like, why bother steering?

01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:55.940
Let's just give up the ghost, right?

01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:58.180
And I don't think that's even what the nihilists said.

01:40:58.180 --> 01:40:59.820
I mean, I think Bakunin said,

01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:02.780
we should get rid of everything that we've ever created

01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:06.180
except Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and start over from there.

01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:08.340
But so even people who are very nihilistic

01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:10.100
or associated with that,

01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:12.540
a lot of them were just not liking what we had built, right?

01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:15.740
So if we accept that a lot of what we have built

01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:17.780
as humans inside of us and outside of us

01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:19.900
is really counterproductive and doesn't help us

01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:23.140
and that absurd things happen in the world, right?

01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:24.820
And that often the way social structures

01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:28.060
and systems build up, you build themselves up is absurd.

01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:30.140
I think our healthcare system operates

01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:32.100
in a way that's absurd, right?

01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:34.540
So if we accept that there are absurdities

01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:36.620
that we don't know if there's truth,

01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:37.820
then what are we left with?

01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:40.780
But like, well, let's try and make meaning, right?

01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:44.820
Ortega Igaset said, yo soy yo Amy Circunstancia, right?

01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:46.860
I myself and my circumstances, right?

01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:49.220
Which is like, look, we can't control everything.

01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:51.980
We live in circumstances around us,

01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:54.060
but within those circumstances,

01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:58.060
we can make decisions and define ourselves.

01:41:58.060 --> 01:41:59.740
And I think the brilliance of that,

01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:01.900
and I think tying it all together, right?

01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:04.100
In a way that's not trying to be,

01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:06.740
in a sense it ties it all together by not trying

01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:08.260
to answer everything concisely.

01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:10.740
That yes, we can make meaning, like we see that.

01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:12.580
If someone trips in front of me,

01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:14.380
I could walk around them or I could help them up.

01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:17.780
No one can tell me that it doesn't matter what I do.

01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:19.940
I absolutely reject the idea that,

01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:22.260
oh, I could step over them or on them,

01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:24.140
or I could help them up and it doesn't matter.

01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:27.340
Oh yeah, try being the person on the ground, right?

01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:31.580
So we create meaning, but we live in our circumstances

01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:34.180
and there are absurdities both within us

01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:36.500
and outside of us in our social structures.

01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:37.380
And there are a lot of things

01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:40.060
that pretend to have meaning that don't.

01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:42.140
And there's the shades of nihilism,

01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:44.340
but ultimately there's something going on here

01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:46.620
that's doing the best we can

01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:48.540
in the context of just not knowing.

01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:50.540
Yeah, I tend to see, I don't know if it's genetic,

01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:53.820
I think, I tend to think just observing the internet,

01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:55.380
the number of memes there are.

01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:58.900
I think many other people are like me.

01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:01.900
I tend to see the humor in the absurdity.

01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:03.940
I tend to enjoy it from that kind of angle.

01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:06.300
I see the Kafkaesque nature of society,

01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:07.900
a different aspect of society,

01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:11.300
and just kind of notice the magic with a smile.

01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:15.820
And just laugh at the circus of it all.

01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:18.900
Because it is magical that the circus all comes together.

01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:20.100
It's like a little bit out of sync

01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:22.380
and then just a guy playing trombone,

01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:25.380
but overall it's pretty good, it's pretty good.

01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:27.260
And we can look at that and just kind of marvel and go,

01:43:27.260 --> 01:43:30.500
huh, right, which I think is a relation

01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:33.420
to at least a lot of what we in the Western world

01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:36.340
think of as Eastern, as non-attachment, right?

01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:38.580
Because then if there's something absurd

01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:40.580
and it's like not good for me,

01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:42.580
then I accept that too,

01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:44.820
instead of getting angry about it and railing about it

01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:47.100
or seeing some cosmic meaning in it, right?

01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:49.060
I think there's also a healthy non-attachment

01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:50.580
in what you're saying too.

01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:53.340
So there's, I mean, you mentioned Eastern thought,

01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:57.180
there's Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, but also Buddha

01:43:57.180 --> 01:44:00.420
have kind of spoke of life as suffering.

01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:01.940
Do you think there's truth to that,

01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:06.060
that suffering is a fundamental part of life?

01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:08.620
I think it is a fundamental part of life.

01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:11.820
I don't think that means that life is suffering, right?

01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:14.780
If we say, well, life is suffering, then what am I doing?

01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:16.740
That I'm trying to erase from my mind

01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:18.420
like the birth of my children, right?

01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:20.740
Things that were filled with joy, right?

01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:23.500
Like life is not entirely suffering,

01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:26.060
but life brings a lot of suffering.

01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:29.700
And for some people it brings such disproportionate suffering

01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:31.500
and the people don't survive the suffering.

01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:34.660
And I think when people are conscientious and empathic,

01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:36.740
that really bothers us, right?

01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:38.060
The suffering in our own lives

01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:39.540
and the fact that others at times

01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:42.420
could seem to be so overwhelmed by suffering

01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:45.060
that they don't even get a chance to see good.

01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:48.020
And I think there's, I do think there's truth to that

01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:50.260
and there's sadness and distress to that.

01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:52.860
But to say, therefore life is suffering,

01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:54.780
I think is just completely untrue.

01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:56.900
And, you know, it ignores the fact

01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:58.500
that someone even made a trombone, right?

01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:00.180
Let alone that there's a little bit out of sync

01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:02.420
and someone's playing the trombone, like that's cool.

01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:05.340
There's elements of the absurd

01:45:05.340 --> 01:45:06.980
that you said are neat and interesting.

01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:10.660
And if we start accepting that we can't understand

01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:13.340
or control everything, then we can accept

01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:18.340
and I think really love and foster the beauty in our lives.

01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:21.540
Yeah, I think the word suffering

01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:24.100
is doing a little bit too much work

01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:25.300
because I think it's probably referring

01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:27.980
to the philosophical concept of that,

01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:32.060
yeah, that it's absurd, the absurdity.

01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:33.860
That stuff just happens randomly.

01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:37.900
Evil people succeed, good people fail.

01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:41.980
There's a seeming random injustice on occasion.

01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:46.660
And on occasion there's justice in, yeah, all of it.

01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:51.140
That feels like, and maybe because it,

01:45:51.140 --> 01:45:52.940
often there's a lot of loss.

01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:57.940
And then there's a kind of matching complementary aspect

01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:02.620
to any good feeling that all comes crashing down.

01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:06.820
Like every hello from a physics perspective

01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:08.020
ends in a goodbye.

01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:14.820
That's a really sad thing.

01:46:17.220 --> 01:46:20.260
All the amazing people I get to meet in my life,

01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:23.540
all the amazing experiences, eventually they have to end.

01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:26.220
And that's part of what makes them amazing.

01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:27.820
Why is that sad?

01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:30.540
Is it because we're taught to think that it's a look,

01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:32.340
at some point you and I are gonna say goodbye today.

01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:33.820
I hope we're richer for it.

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:36.300
And then we take that goodness off with us.

01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:39.860
I wanna celebrate that because it's all part of the goodness.

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.660
I think we're taught to think, oh, that's so bad.

01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:43.700
And it equates to death and misery.

01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:47.460
And I think it's often not that way.

01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:48.700
I think there is a sadness to it,

01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:53.420
but I also don't think that sadness is a negative thing.

01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:56.300
It's a different way to celebrate a beautiful thing.

01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:58.340
So there's a melancholic nature to it,

01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:01.180
something passing of it leaving.

01:47:01.460 --> 01:47:05.780
It's that old Louis CK thing that I go back to over and over

01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:10.780
from his show, Louis, where he was all heartbroken

01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:16.180
that he just broke up with somebody he loved.

01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:18.980
And he told about that to an old man.

01:47:18.980 --> 01:47:21.700
And the old man said, you're a fool.

01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:22.900
That's the best part.

01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:26.540
I missed that part where you sort of are lingering

01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:28.980
in that loss, you're feeling the pain of that loss.

01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:30.940
Because that lasts the longest.

01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:33.780
It's the most intense, it's the most reliable.

01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:37.020
And it's the kind of celebration of the love you had.

01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:41.740
Like losing the love is still a celebration of the love.

01:47:43.220 --> 01:47:45.940
I think you don't wanna over romanticize that,

01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:48.260
but there's some aspect of truth to that.

01:47:48.260 --> 01:47:51.900
Like that melancholic feeling of remembering

01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:54.700
a beautiful time that's no longer there

01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:57.380
is a kind of celebration of it

01:47:57.420 --> 01:47:59.380
and is a kind of joyful experience,

01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:04.380
even though it's very easy to experience it

01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:06.260
as a negative emotion.

01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:07.580
I think it's just like you said,

01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:09.420
I mean, it's up to our mind to determine

01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:11.300
how that emotion is really felt.

01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:12.460
But it's a tricky one,

01:48:12.460 --> 01:48:14.060
because it's like heartbreak to experience

01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:15.420
that as a positive thing.

01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:17.940
People can reminisce at funerals and laugh,

01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:19.780
because people can be very, very, very sad

01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:23.220
and perceive that this person has died

01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:25.020
and perceive the sadness of it.

01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:28.020
But in perceiving that and really living in it,

01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:30.820
then you can have people who wanna remember that person

01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:32.660
by like telling a funny story.

01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:33.500
Why?

01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:35.340
Because each of those people carries that with them.

01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:38.060
So I think what you're saying is consistent

01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:40.300
with healthy function as human beings,

01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:42.420
because we're gonna encounter sadness and loss.

01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:44.380
Like what do we do with that, right?

01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:47.260
And do we do things that ultimately create some redemption

01:48:47.260 --> 01:48:49.540
or even reparation inside of us?

01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:52.420
And like reparation is a big word in psychology, right?

01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:54.180
It's how we repair damage and loss.

01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:56.300
So if we lose someone and we're sad,

01:48:56.300 --> 01:48:59.620
can we, by telling funny stories about that person,

01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:01.780
remind ourselves that, hey, they're still inside of us.

01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:03.380
Whether they're out there looking at me, I don't know,

01:49:03.380 --> 01:49:05.740
but I can call that person of mine inside of us.

01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:08.260
And then we have something that's good and beautiful

01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:09.460
that comes of that too.

01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:15.100
In the introduction to your book on trauma,

01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:18.140
Lady Gaga wrote it, she wrote the intro.

01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:21.460
She said this about you, quote,

01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:26.220
I can now say with certainty that this man saved my life.

01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:29.140
He made life worth living.

01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:30.540
This goes to our discussion

01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:35.540
about the mythicist Camus question about why live.

01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:39.580
So I think, at least to me,

01:49:39.580 --> 01:49:43.140
she's one of the most brilliant and unique artists ever.

01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:47.380
So it's a difficult question, but a question of creativity.

01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:52.380
What role does trauma play in somebody like that,

01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:57.820
in this artist that has created some incredible things?

01:49:57.820 --> 01:50:02.820
What positive, constructive role does trauma serve

01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:08.180
and what limiting role does it serve

01:50:08.180 --> 01:50:10.980
in preventing that person from flourishing more?

01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:15.980
Trauma can certainly drive us to creativity, right?

01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:19.020
Even to push against or to protest against

01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:21.060
what the trauma tells us.

01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:23.260
Trauma tells us lessons, like nothing matters

01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:25.700
and you don't matter and nothing will ever be good

01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:30.180
and nothing is beautiful and we can push against trauma.

01:50:30.180 --> 01:50:31.780
There is life in me, there's something,

01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:33.940
there's goodness for me to spread in the world,

01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:35.500
to express and spread.

01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:38.180
So I think trauma fuels creativity

01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:39.740
in many, many, many ways.

01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:42.260
Trauma also shuts down creativity, right?

01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:45.300
People who are, for one example,

01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:47.380
trauma that escalates to the point

01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:49.900
where now the person is soothing it with alcohol,

01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:52.460
one example, and now the impact of the alcohol

01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:53.980
shuts down any creativity.

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:56.500
So can people be creative

01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:58.620
and outward thinking without trauma?

01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:00.580
I think sometimes, if I remember correctly,

01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:02.620
people will use Immanuel Kant as an example,

01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:04.260
someone who I think hadn't traveled much

01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:05.980
and didn't have trauma and like, look at what he knew.

01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:07.900
So, okay, there are gonna be exceptions, right?

01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:12.100
But a lot of our creativity is in some ways fueled

01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:14.780
by our suffering, although it's complicated

01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:17.020
because it comes from generative places in us, right?

01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:18.220
So those places are there,

01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:20.020
they're not created by suffering,

01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:22.740
but maybe suffering makes an incentive

01:51:22.740 --> 01:51:24.900
or a passion inside of us.

01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:28.380
And a person, Stephanie, who you referred to,

01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:33.100
is just such an incredible, astounding creative force.

01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:35.100
And sure, some of that comes from trauma,

01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:37.860
some of it comes from trauma fueling

01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:40.580
the generative creative places in her.

01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:41.980
But what I helped her to do,

01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:43.580
she's very generous with her words,

01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:48.580
but what I helped her to do was to see all that she is

01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:51.140
and all that the creativity in her is

01:51:51.140 --> 01:51:56.140
and all that there is to create through love and caring

01:51:56.300 --> 01:52:00.700
and compassion, and to, again, see that.

01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:03.300
I mean, a lot of time, that's what I'm doing clinically.

01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:04.660
I think it's what's good psychiatrists

01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:06.180
or mental health professionals do

01:52:06.180 --> 01:52:09.620
is we help people see the beauty that is there, right?

01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:13.060
Because oftentimes we're way too close up to that tapestry

01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:15.740
and what brings us close is often the sad thing.

01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:18.340
So we're up close and all we see is the negative.

01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:21.140
I mean, it's easy then to get classically nihilistic,

01:52:21.140 --> 01:52:23.700
but by helping someone take a step back

01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:26.660
and to see who they are and what's in them,

01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:28.300
that's how people get better

01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:31.340
and it's how people re-engage in life.

01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:33.340
It's such a difficult thing,

01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:38.140
because if you were to, from studying human beings,

01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:40.580
it seems like the optimal trajectory

01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:45.020
is having some trauma that doesn't destroy you,

01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:50.620
that forces you early in life to really struggle

01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:54.060
with the intricacies of the human condition,

01:52:54.060 --> 01:52:56.620
and then later in life, as you form

01:52:56.620 --> 01:53:00.020
and you build an expertise around and mastery,

01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:02.380
start to do exactly what you said,

01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:04.700
which is step back and look at the tapestry.

01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:08.660
So if you don't have the trauma,

01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:10.660
it seems like, just empirically speaking,

01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:12.620
there's of course just a huge amount of data

01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:15.380
and all kinds of anecdotal evidence,

01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:17.860
but I wanna be careful here

01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:22.620
because maybe I'm romanticizing hardship,

01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:25.900
but it does seem that hardship in childhood,

01:53:25.900 --> 01:53:28.500
if it doesn't break you, can be constructive.

01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:31.460
It's like you said, having that trauma,

01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:33.340
one of the ways to fight it

01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:35.740
is to say, I am worth something.

01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:40.740
I am, and this is, David Goggins talks about this,

01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:45.940
is like, I am somebody, I can be somebody special,

01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:48.700
and I'm gonna prove it to you, I'm gonna do this,

01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:49.980
I'm gonna do this big thing.

01:53:49.980 --> 01:53:52.260
It's this engine that drives you forward.

01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:56.500
Yeah, comment on that, because from a parent's perspective,

01:53:56.500 --> 01:54:01.500
you want a child to have an easy life, right?

01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:05.300
You want them to not have hardship,

01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:09.380
certainly not have trauma, but that's such a difficult dance

01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:13.460
because in some ways, a little bit of hardship

01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:17.300
and a gradually increasing amount of hardship

01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:19.780
that doesn't break you can really develop you

01:54:19.780 --> 01:54:23.820
into a really interesting, complicated person

01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:26.700
and it helps you flourish as a creative being.

01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:29.100
I don't know if there's a question to that.

01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:31.100
I just keep saying random things.

01:54:31.780 --> 01:54:34.620
Look, I think it makes good sense to me.

01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:37.460
I think you're trying to get at, we need trauma

01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:39.780
and how are we defining it, right?

01:54:39.780 --> 01:54:42.820
Because we say trauma, hardship, difficulties.

01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:45.940
I mean, we could set aside, we could set apart, say,

01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:48.980
and differentiate things that are difficult,

01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:52.380
but that are overcomeable versus things

01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:54.940
that we could use the word trauma this way,

01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:57.940
if we chose to, that are just entirely negative.

01:54:57.940 --> 01:55:02.180
Like someone saying, oh, you can't do that

01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:04.060
and you'll never succeed because what?

01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:05.700
And then they tell you something about yourself,

01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:07.580
because you're from here or you're this race, religion,

01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:08.660
whatever it is, right?

01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:11.460
We think, well, that could make someone say,

01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:13.780
hey, I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna overcome, right?

01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:16.860
But then they're overcoming something bad, right?

01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:19.500
Like there's nothing good or helpful about that, right?

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:22.140
If someone's saying that, so the person has to overcome it.

01:55:22.140 --> 01:55:24.820
That's different than something that is placed

01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:29.860
in front of a person where the whole conception of it

01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:33.900
is something positive that you can make through effort,

01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:34.740
right?

01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:37.780
So, I remember, I don't know, I think I was 15 years old,

01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:40.220
there was some rule like where you could then go,

01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:42.220
I don't think it was picking raspberries or blueberries,

01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:43.060
right?

01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:44.020
And I think, and my parents wanted me to see,

01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:45.940
like, hey, go see how that works as you,

01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:47.860
and now you've got 50 cents at the end of it, right?

01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:50.180
And then you think about that when you wanna buy

01:55:50.180 --> 01:55:53.700
baseball cards or you think about it and you work hard.

01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:55.540
And I could remember, like, it was hard

01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:58.020
and I was sweating and I was tired,

01:55:58.020 --> 01:55:59.260
but I learned from it.

01:55:59.260 --> 01:56:00.860
I mean, it's the reason I remember it today.

01:56:00.860 --> 01:56:03.740
So, yes, parents might want their kids to have, like,

01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:04.580
a good life, right?

01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:06.660
But not necessarily an easy life, you know?

01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:10.460
And I think that was done, they took me to do that

01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:12.220
so I'd have a greater sense of responsibility

01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:14.100
in a sense of, like, hard work is meaningful

01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:15.580
and it's important.

01:56:15.580 --> 01:56:18.340
And I think that that kind of thing is good,

01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:20.420
but if we separate that from something

01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:22.580
that's just denigrating, prejudicial,

01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:24.380
like, I think those things aren't good,

01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:25.740
but they're unavoidable.

01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:28.420
So it's not necessarily that, oh, is some trauma good?

01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:30.660
I would look at it more that some trauma's unavoidable.

01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:33.380
I mean, you know, it's hard to, how do you go through life

01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:36.380
and not have any losses or anything negative

01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:38.100
or anything sad?

01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:39.100
And then people are people.

01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:41.100
There may be people who have not a lot of that

01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:42.980
and then there's a sort of complacency

01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:44.860
and they don't do it as much as they could

01:56:44.860 --> 01:56:46.220
or feel as good as they could.

01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:47.380
You know, then there's other people

01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:49.060
who have a highly attuned emotional,

01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:51.500
so there's people with very highly attuned emotional

01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:54.100
compasses for which a little bit of trauma

01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:55.980
becomes so intrusive.

01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:58.380
So it's so much of it is person driven,

01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:00.220
but I do want to distinguish between things

01:57:00.220 --> 01:57:03.180
that are just purely bad that we might overcome

01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:04.860
or find some fire in our belly about

01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:06.340
or whatever the case may be.

01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:08.780
And things that may be boundaries or barriers,

01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:11.860
either directly, purposely placed or not,

01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:16.140
that in a sense, invite us or inform us of the possibility

01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:17.580
of striving and overcoming.

01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:20.620
Finally, attuned emotional compasses,

01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:22.020
it's so true that there is,

01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:24.940
that's a component of it too.

01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:27.940
It's almost genetic.

01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:30.380
How sensitive you are to a particular trauma,

01:57:30.380 --> 01:57:32.660
so little things can have a huge impact

01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:34.340
or gigantic things.

01:57:34.340 --> 01:57:38.500
Serious abuse in childhood can be,

01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:40.940
by some people, overcome more easily.

01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:41.780
It's so interesting.

01:57:41.780 --> 01:57:42.620
It's not just what's the trauma.

01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:44.820
What's the trauma that makes certain problems?

01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:46.780
You have to match the trauma to the person

01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:48.460
and a big part of what you're matching to

01:57:48.460 --> 01:57:51.460
is that genetically based characteristic

01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:54.820
of how finely attuned is that empathic attunement

01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:55.740
to that compass.

01:57:55.740 --> 01:57:56.940
So when you think about,

01:57:56.940 --> 01:57:58.820
if you just return to childhood,

01:57:58.820 --> 01:58:00.820
when you think about trauma in childhood,

01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:09.860
what can we say about the impact of child abuse

01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:13.300
on the development of a human being?

01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:18.300
I think the impact of it is so,

01:58:19.100 --> 01:58:23.220
disproportionately bad and hurtful

01:58:24.940 --> 01:58:27.580
compared to things that happen when we're not children.

01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:29.980
And I wanna be very careful about how I'm saying that

01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:34.180
because people can, through their strength and resilience

01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:38.220
and human interconnectedness, can overcome that.

01:58:38.220 --> 01:58:41.420
I don't mean to say that anyone

01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:42.820
who's experienced those things

01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:46.300
is can't make it through it or over it.

01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:48.180
That part is not true.

01:58:48.180 --> 01:58:51.860
But it is true that the impact is so disproportionate

01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:53.540
to anything else that can happen

01:58:53.540 --> 01:58:56.300
because the brain is formulating.

01:58:56.300 --> 01:59:00.700
So if we say psychology is like applied neurobiology

01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:05.700
and we look at both of those as different ends,

01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:08.380
even though there's a lot of gray in the middle,

01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:10.460
the neurobiology is changed.

01:59:10.460 --> 01:59:15.140
So just one example of a much greater salience

01:59:15.140 --> 01:59:20.140
of vigilance mechanisms, of mechanisms of self-protection,

01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:24.740
mechanisms that can make a person feel more fear

01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:27.620
and more insecurity and hide themselves away from the world

01:59:27.620 --> 01:59:28.940
and not trust the world.

01:59:28.940 --> 01:59:31.980
And I mean not trust the world even enough that,

01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:33.620
oh, I'd like to have a better job

01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:36.580
and another one is here that I could take,

01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:38.340
but maybe it could be worse.

01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:40.340
And then being afraid of that.

01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:43.900
There are all sorts of ways in which the changes

01:59:43.900 --> 01:59:45.980
to those pathways impact someone.

01:59:45.980 --> 01:59:48.060
And that's just one of,

01:59:48.060 --> 01:59:49.740
we could bring trauma experts together

01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:51.580
that could talk about that for days.

01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:54.060
What is the impact upon the brain biology?

01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:57.660
So that then gets changed inside the person.

01:59:57.660 --> 02:00:00.060
And from the perspective of those changes,

02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:01.940
the psychology on top of it changes.

02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:03.320
Like, what do I think about myself?

02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:05.220
Do I think that I'm worthwhile?

02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:10.220
Even in my mid-20s without formative traumas

02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:13.100
and a pretty strong sense of self and some achievements,

02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:16.140
there's a big trauma then with the death of my brother

02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:18.220
and I start questioning, am I cursed?

02:00:18.220 --> 02:00:19.500
Am I worth anything?

02:00:19.500 --> 02:00:20.940
I mean, I was 20 something years old

02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:24.740
and doing reasonably well at the time.

02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:29.340
How does this impact a child of six, seven,

02:00:29.340 --> 02:00:31.820
10, 12 years old, right?

02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:34.340
We're sending such powerful messages

02:00:34.340 --> 02:00:37.420
that then change conception of self

02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:39.860
and that negatively changed conception

02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:42.400
sits upon the negatively changed neurobiology.

02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:44.400
And I think if we really thought,

02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:46.880
hey, let's do the best we can just for humans in general,

02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:48.800
for the human race, for species in general,

02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:51.080
is we would handle children

02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:54.240
and caring for children so much differently

02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:57.600
in terms of protection mechanisms, intervention mechanisms.

02:00:57.600 --> 02:00:59.620
How many times do you see where like,

02:00:59.620 --> 02:01:01.400
now there's been some tragedy

02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:03.540
and the child gets a little bit of support

02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:06.920
and they had some therapy that was provided

02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:10.920
by some insurance carrier that they got once a week

02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:12.680
for 16 weeks or whatever.

02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:16.560
I mean, we should be wrapping our societal resources

02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:20.400
around children, but we don't use our resources well.

02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:22.200
You know, I was just reading, it's a little bit of an aside,

02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:26.040
but about 300 and something billion dollars a year

02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:30.440
in cost to the US economy just from schizophrenia.

02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:33.840
And you think, it costs a fraction.

02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:36.120
What do we actually put into caring for people

02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:37.400
who have schizophrenia?

02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:39.800
So first there's a moral imperative.

02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:41.200
Let's say we put that aside

02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:43.920
and we only care about the economy, right?

02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:46.040
Because there are mechanisms of thinking

02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:46.880
that look at it that way.

02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:49.560
How could we not amend that, right?

02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:52.560
But we are so reckless with our resources

02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:54.360
and we're tripping ahead of ourselves

02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.300
that we don't think, oh my goodness,

02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:59.520
there is no better place on God's earth for prevention

02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:02.920
than here, prevention in terms of human suffering.

02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:05.240
And also where do people like that go?

02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:07.460
I mean, more often people like that go

02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:08.960
to a place of increased suffering,

02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:10.640
inability to take care of themselves

02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:13.360
or to be in supportive relationships.

02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:15.640
Okay, we know there's a higher prevalence of that,

02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:18.120
but we're also creating the pool of people

02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:21.640
through which the envy, the narcissism,

02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:24.840
the sociopathy, the destruction arises.

02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:26.960
So again, if we care about people,

02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:29.400
we would be so focused on that.

02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:32.060
If we don't care about other people and just ourselves

02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:34.840
or just economic costs, we would still be so focused.

02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:37.840
But you know, we're not and we tend to just kind of

02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:41.000
call it good because we don't see anything disastrous

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:42.240
happening at the moment.

02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:45.720
And I think there's a societal negligence there

02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:50.520
to the shame really of all of us when child abuse

02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:53.880
and the impact neurobiologically and psychologically

02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:56.640
is potentially the greatest cause of suffering

02:02:56.640 --> 02:02:59.140
directly and indirectly on the face of the planet.

02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:06.000
How much does trauma of that kind and later in life

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.960
affect your ability to love another human being,

02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:13.400
say inside a relationship, connect with another human being?

02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:14.880
It can impact it a lot.

02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:17.160
And again, I wanna say, can people overcome

02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:20.800
and be as loving to a partner or a child or anyone else?

02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:23.800
Yes, but we're talking across society, right?

02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:25.720
How are we setting the odds, right?

02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:29.120
We're setting the odds towards a higher sense of vigilance,

02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:31.640
a decreased sense of self-confidence,

02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:33.840
an increased sense of vulnerability, right?

02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:36.600
Decreased comfort interacting with others, right?

02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:39.240
What we're doing is we're pushing towards isolation

02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:41.800
and misery and depression and resentment.

02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:44.120
I mean, those factors push towards that.

02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:46.480
You know, we know that the research is so strong

02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:49.120
that adverse childhood experiences,

02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:52.160
that these things that happen, the more, the worse,

02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:56.000
the more prolonged, the more that person is up against

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.560
as they try and navigate life.

02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:03.260
And I suppose one of the elements of intimacy

02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:06.420
like what we're talking about is vulnerability.

02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:11.420
And maybe there's a, is there a fear of being vulnerable,

02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:14.380
of being hurt again?

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:17.340
Is that ultimately the barrier to intimacy?

02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:19.220
Yeah, if you're taught a lesson that says

02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:21.420
the world is not safe,

02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:24.260
and you're not good enough for someone to keep safe,

02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:27.300
and you're not strong enough to keep yourself safe,

02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:28.900
that's a final common pathway

02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:31.860
of the vast majority of child abuse,

02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:34.180
is telling those lessons to people.

02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:38.700
Then how can that not change the lay of the land

02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:41.820
against openness, against the ability

02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:45.420
to rationally consider trust and mutuality

02:04:45.420 --> 02:04:47.580
and to protect oneself, but also take chances

02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:49.900
and do the things that we have to do

02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:52.820
to create the greatest happiness in our lives.

02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:56.180
We set the odds so much against that.

02:04:56.180 --> 02:05:00.380
There's another pathway which I think is really interesting

02:05:00.380 --> 02:05:04.260
because I've seen it in people is this kind of ability

02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:08.920
to detach yourself from feeling any emotions,

02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:11.660
to like protect yourself.

02:05:11.660 --> 02:05:14.300
It's almost like you're not quite there.

02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:16.420
There's a word for it, it's isolation of affect.

02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:17.860
It's a defense mechanism.

02:05:17.860 --> 02:05:19.180
Yeah. Isolation of affect.

02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:21.340
Yeah. Is that a common way,

02:05:21.340 --> 02:05:25.020
another common way to deal with trauma?

02:05:25.020 --> 02:05:28.460
Well, isolation of affect can cut both ways.

02:05:29.420 --> 02:05:30.980
If there's been a major trauma,

02:05:30.980 --> 02:05:33.020
let's say someone has seen something terrible

02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:35.860
and they're isolated from their affect,

02:05:35.860 --> 02:05:38.300
and at one time it was thought, well, maybe that's good.

02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:40.500
They're not hysterical, they're not distraught,

02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:42.420
but we see that is not good

02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:46.900
because what needs to be held, processed,

02:05:46.900 --> 02:05:49.020
we need to get our arms around in some way, shape or form

02:05:49.020 --> 02:05:50.580
has just been separated off.

02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:53.780
So we know that is not good,

02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:57.700
but isolation of affect can also serve us very well.

02:05:57.820 --> 02:06:01.060
When I think back to being an intern,

02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:02.380
medical intern in the hospital,

02:06:02.380 --> 02:06:06.900
and you might have to go and pronounce someone dead

02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:11.140
with hysterical family members,

02:06:11.140 --> 02:06:14.860
and then 10 minutes later, five minutes later,

02:06:14.860 --> 02:06:17.100
might be two minutes later, really,

02:06:17.100 --> 02:06:19.220
you have to go to another room

02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:21.500
and you've got to maybe do some procedure

02:06:21.500 --> 02:06:25.260
that involves having your focus on a certain thing

02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:27.260
and making sure your hand movements are the right way

02:06:27.260 --> 02:06:30.980
or talking to a person in a way that's very different

02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:33.060
than where you just came from, that's very hopeful,

02:06:33.060 --> 02:06:35.500
and so then you have to isolate the affect

02:06:35.500 --> 02:06:36.860
of what's going on around you,

02:06:36.860 --> 02:06:39.940
and it happens not just in, it's just one example,

02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:41.900
but we have to do it in life

02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:45.780
so that we can put affect aside to process later

02:06:45.780 --> 02:06:48.220
or not feel the full weight of affect

02:06:48.220 --> 02:06:49.420
where we know the meaning,

02:06:49.420 --> 02:06:50.980
like I know the meaning of the tragedy

02:06:50.980 --> 02:06:52.980
of the person I just pronounced dead,

02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:54.700
but I want to separate that for myself

02:06:54.700 --> 02:06:56.700
because I'm also aware that it's not my tragedy

02:06:56.700 --> 02:06:59.260
so that I can then, okay, put that affect aside

02:06:59.260 --> 02:07:00.980
and go do the next thing that I have to do,

02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:03.500
so that I think can cut both ways.

02:07:04.700 --> 02:07:08.340
Right, but then you have to like reattach it,

02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:11.300
understand that it's good to be close with emotion,

02:07:11.300 --> 02:07:14.420
even painful emotion, right?

02:07:14.420 --> 02:07:16.420
Because that's the human experience.

02:07:16.420 --> 02:07:17.260
Right.

02:07:17.260 --> 02:07:20.260
It's, I feel like if you build up a skill

02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:22.700
that you can detach yourself from emotion,

02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:25.700
I think that can become its own kind of

02:07:25.700 --> 02:07:29.420
yeah, it can become too easy to do it, right?

02:07:29.420 --> 02:07:33.340
And to reinforce, that's when people are suffering too much

02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:35.820
over too long a period of time,

02:07:35.820 --> 02:07:38.380
then we're creatures of habit, right?

02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:40.180
And even though our brains are,

02:07:40.180 --> 02:07:42.140
you can talk about our brains are sitting on the shoulders

02:07:42.140 --> 02:07:46.060
of the giant of the maybe thousand levels of emergence

02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:47.700
that come underneath of them,

02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:51.980
our brains are also working very simple habit-based ways.

02:07:51.980 --> 02:07:54.220
Like if you and I chose a word right now

02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:56.220
and said it 500 times,

02:07:56.220 --> 02:07:58.340
we would know it's just a silly experiment,

02:07:58.340 --> 02:08:01.060
but we'd both be saying it tonight, right?

02:08:01.060 --> 02:08:03.540
Because our brains are also creatures of habit.

02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:07.540
So if you over and over and over have to isolate yourself

02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:09.700
from affect and you develop those mechanisms,

02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:11.540
well, you develop those mechanisms

02:08:11.540 --> 02:08:13.660
and they don't go away any easier

02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:17.180
than if we said the word 500 times and decided to forget.

02:08:17.180 --> 02:08:19.220
We won't forget no matter what we decided.

02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:23.020
So how do we find our way back?

02:08:23.780 --> 02:08:27.220
How do we overcome trauma?

02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:28.500
What are the different pathways?

02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:30.580
The first thing, the very first thing

02:08:30.580 --> 02:08:35.580
is to acknowledge to ourselves and often to others,

02:08:35.580 --> 02:08:36.780
which might be one other person,

02:08:36.780 --> 02:08:39.700
it might be in words, spoken, it might be written,

02:08:39.700 --> 02:08:42.380
what the trauma has been, right?

02:08:42.380 --> 02:08:47.300
Because the lessons of trauma, the evil lessons of trauma,

02:08:47.300 --> 02:08:49.620
and I'll use the example of my own life,

02:08:49.620 --> 02:08:54.340
the lesson that told me that I was shameful,

02:08:54.340 --> 02:08:57.740
cursed and hopeless, right?

02:08:57.740 --> 02:09:00.700
It's a very evil lesson, right?

02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:03.660
But my brain will say it over and did say it over

02:09:03.660 --> 02:09:05.180
and over and over to me.

02:09:05.180 --> 02:09:08.980
And if that just sits inside, that's how trauma festers,

02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:12.340
that's how trauma hijacks our thoughts, our emotions.

02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:16.060
So being able to say to ourselves and to another,

02:09:16.060 --> 02:09:18.500
like this is what's happened, right?

02:09:18.540 --> 02:09:19.620
Okay, this is what's happened.

02:09:19.620 --> 02:09:22.540
We're built to massage words

02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:24.380
and to create meaning through words, right?

02:09:24.380 --> 02:09:26.660
Like we don't massage pictures, right, images,

02:09:26.660 --> 02:09:29.100
we talk and massage meaning with words.

02:09:29.100 --> 02:09:31.940
So when I finally went to see a therapist

02:09:31.940 --> 02:09:34.860
and I could say, you know,

02:09:35.940 --> 02:09:38.260
my brother, whatever words I would have said,

02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:43.260
like he killed himself and I can't accept it

02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:45.620
or I can't imagine it and like I let it happen.

02:09:45.620 --> 02:09:47.460
Like so I had to say those things, right?

02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:51.740
So then I could begin to bring some sense of truth to it,

02:09:51.740 --> 02:09:53.580
you know, and I think it was a long time ago,

02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:55.220
but the therapist probably said something like,

02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:57.460
okay, probably season, you let it happen,

02:09:57.460 --> 02:09:58.300
it's your fault, right?

02:09:58.300 --> 02:10:00.020
Because you got to get at those things

02:10:00.020 --> 02:10:03.780
so that one can begin to bring into focus

02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:06.980
what does the trauma mean and what does it not mean?

02:10:06.980 --> 02:10:09.700
I mean, a classic example is that what would you say

02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:11.260
to someone else example, you know,

02:10:11.260 --> 02:10:14.140
or you'll say, well, how many times have I,

02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:16.180
it's just, I cry if I stop and think about it

02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:17.980
and if you stop and talk to someone

02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:21.300
who is sexually assaulted through no fault of their own,

02:10:21.300 --> 02:10:22.860
who comes in and tells the story

02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:25.060
they've been telling themselves about how it's their fault.

02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:26.180
They should have walked home a different way,

02:10:26.180 --> 02:10:27.100
they should have dressed differently,

02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:28.620
they should have left earlier, right?

02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:31.460
I wrote about it in the book over and over and over.

02:10:31.460 --> 02:10:35.140
Now you have a person who, let's say you take a person

02:10:35.140 --> 02:10:37.180
who's intelligent, engaged in the world,

02:10:37.180 --> 02:10:38.420
who's like capable of understanding

02:10:38.420 --> 02:10:39.740
lots and lots and lots of things,

02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:42.220
but doesn't understand that, right?

02:10:42.220 --> 02:10:43.900
If it were someone else that person would understand

02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:45.540
in a moment, it's not that person's fault, right?

02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:48.700
So what you wanna do is overcome the fact

02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:50.100
that the negative emotions,

02:10:50.100 --> 02:10:52.740
that the hijacked emotion systems of trauma

02:10:52.740 --> 02:10:54.660
are telling that person a lie

02:10:54.660 --> 02:10:59.420
and they're telling them so strongly and so awfully,

02:10:59.420 --> 02:11:02.380
so meanly that the person just takes it inside

02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:05.540
and starts to see it as true, right?

02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:07.660
So you begin to hold that up to the light of day

02:11:07.660 --> 02:11:09.500
and again, one example could be, okay,

02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:11.900
so someone, the person who's coming in next

02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:13.580
has actually been through something similar, right?

02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:17.900
And can you stay and just tell her how it's her fault, right?

02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:20.260
And like, oh my God, no, no, because I could never,

02:11:20.260 --> 02:11:21.980
like then they see, right?

02:11:21.980 --> 02:11:23.780
And again, this is not always how you do it,

02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:26.020
but sometimes you can get a person to see like,

02:11:26.020 --> 02:11:28.340
well, that would be the most horrible.

02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:29.900
How could you do that, right?

02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:31.100
And the person can maybe come out there

02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:31.980
doing it to themselves.

02:11:31.980 --> 02:11:36.420
So you begin to put words in a structure and say,

02:11:36.420 --> 02:11:38.340
okay, let's look at what's going on inside of you.

02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:39.180
Like you don't have to be scared

02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:40.620
of anything you're thinking and feeling.

02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:43.860
In fact, the fear is in not exposing it

02:11:43.860 --> 02:11:44.900
to the light of day.

02:11:44.900 --> 02:11:46.660
That's where it gets the best of us.

02:11:46.660 --> 02:11:48.860
And now like everything is different.

02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:51.700
And whether that involves use of medications

02:11:51.700 --> 02:11:53.900
for intrusive thoughts and depression,

02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:56.140
or there's no medicines needed, but it's all reframing,

02:11:56.140 --> 02:11:58.860
like whatever it may be that comes next,

02:11:58.860 --> 02:12:00.780
the whole world has changed

02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:04.140
when the person has acknowledged what's happened,

02:12:04.140 --> 02:12:08.860
exposed it to themselves and to trusted others around them

02:12:09.020 --> 02:12:11.540
and begun to look at it in some way

02:12:11.540 --> 02:12:16.180
other than the stuff in an evil box place

02:12:16.180 --> 02:12:18.700
that the trauma initially puts us through our,

02:12:18.700 --> 02:12:20.540
the reflexes it creates in us.

02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:22.020
It's interesting that there's power

02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:23.620
to just saying it out loud.

02:12:23.620 --> 02:12:24.620
Right.

02:12:24.620 --> 02:12:28.500
So first saying your perception of it out loud,

02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:31.100
other than in that case, that might be your fault.

02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:33.900
And then working through out loud,

02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:38.420
working through that it may not be.

02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:40.660
Any experienced therapist will tell you this,

02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:43.020
that every now and then it will happen

02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:46.660
that someone will come and they'll say something.

02:12:46.660 --> 02:12:48.780
Usually it's very early on in the process.

02:12:48.780 --> 02:12:50.620
They'll say something they've never said before

02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:54.980
and they immediately are like in an entirely different place

02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:56.900
and they may have been for decades.

02:12:56.900 --> 02:12:57.740
Right.

02:12:57.740 --> 02:12:58.980
And I can remember a person saying

02:12:58.980 --> 02:13:02.860
that a coach had raped him and just saying it.

02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:06.900
This was decades before and everything was different.

02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:08.740
I'm not saying everything is now perfect,

02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:09.860
but his life was in a different,

02:13:09.860 --> 02:13:12.180
but as soon as he said it, he could see how dare,

02:13:12.180 --> 02:13:15.180
like he thought that person did that to this child.

02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:16.460
The child was me.

02:13:16.460 --> 02:13:18.500
He never thought it until he said it out loud

02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:20.020
because his mind was going over and over

02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:22.700
with why it was his fault, what he did to deserve it,

02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:25.900
how he kept going back so it must be his fault.

02:13:25.900 --> 02:13:28.060
It was in, as soon as he put words to it,

02:13:28.060 --> 02:13:31.820
he saw the truth of it and it was a bifurcation

02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:32.900
in the path of life then.

02:13:32.900 --> 02:13:35.340
And any therapist has stories like that

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:36.860
which just shows the immense power

02:13:36.860 --> 02:13:40.300
that it can even be that just uttering the words

02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:44.140
makes just a cascade of change all at once.

02:13:44.140 --> 02:13:46.540
Just saying those words to another human being.

02:13:47.980 --> 02:13:51.580
Yeah, it makes you wonder what that compulsive loop

02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:53.500
that happens in our heads.

02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:54.980
Right.

02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:57.620
Until it's brought to the surface.

02:13:57.620 --> 02:13:58.860
It's so interesting.

02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:00.620
Entirely non-productive, the loops.

02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:03.060
And sometimes even if we put, what would I say to another?

02:14:03.060 --> 02:14:04.340
Let me write it down.

02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:07.420
It can get rid of those loops in our brains.

02:14:07.420 --> 02:14:09.580
Any even thought of outward expression

02:14:09.580 --> 02:14:11.820
is the enemy of those internal

02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:14.260
persecutory negative thought loops.

02:14:14.260 --> 02:14:15.980
How do you find a good therapist?

02:14:17.740 --> 02:14:22.340
I tend to think of, listen, I'm a fan of podcasts.

02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:23.900
I'm a fan of conversations.

02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:25.940
It feels like a real, you know,

02:14:25.940 --> 02:14:29.140
it's like finding a good friend or something.

02:14:29.140 --> 02:14:30.900
It feels like a difficult journey.

02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:33.380
Maybe I'm wrong in that but it just feels

02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:37.460
like such a, it feels like a partnership,

02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:40.740
a journey together versus some very

02:14:40.740 --> 02:14:43.420
simple clinical procedure.

02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:45.940
The first thing I would say is

02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:47.700
to change the entire paradigm.

02:14:47.700 --> 02:14:50.140
Like most people, like okay, I need a therapist.

02:14:50.140 --> 02:14:52.780
So people feel often like they're in a weakened position

02:14:52.780 --> 02:14:56.020
because they need, you know, quote unquote, a therapist.

02:14:56.020 --> 02:14:58.900
Then therapists are rationed, right?

02:14:58.900 --> 02:15:01.700
I mean, how many insurance panels have

02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:04.700
lists a mile long of qualified therapists

02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:07.620
who could be on that insurance panel

02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:09.460
but there's a certification process.

02:15:09.460 --> 02:15:10.540
Like these things make no sense, right?

02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:12.700
The state's already certified the person, right?

02:15:12.700 --> 02:15:14.420
But there's so many barriers to entry

02:15:14.420 --> 02:15:16.900
that now we're rationing this resource

02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:19.020
which we should all stop and pause for a second

02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:21.380
and think like we're okay with that as a society.

02:15:21.380 --> 02:15:23.300
And by the way, everything else is like that too

02:15:23.300 --> 02:15:25.500
when we're trying to get help for our health.

02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:27.860
So let's step back from that for a second.

02:15:27.860 --> 02:15:30.900
Now it's a resource that's not in great supply

02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:33.100
and then a person begins to think,

02:15:33.100 --> 02:15:34.780
you know, essentially I'll take what I can get.

02:15:34.780 --> 02:15:35.740
Like I just gotta get somebody

02:15:35.740 --> 02:15:37.940
and I don't know enough to know anyway, right?

02:15:37.940 --> 02:15:40.580
And those are very disempowering thoughts

02:15:40.580 --> 02:15:42.980
as opposed to saying, look, I'm gonna be an empowered

02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:46.620
consumer and I need to choose someone

02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:48.940
who gets over just some basic hurdles

02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:51.980
of what I think are reasonable human interaction, right?

02:15:51.980 --> 02:15:53.660
So like is a person making eye contact?

02:15:53.660 --> 02:15:55.100
Do they seem interested, right?

02:15:55.100 --> 02:15:57.620
Like these are basic points about any human interaction

02:15:57.620 --> 02:15:59.420
including a therapist, right?

02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:01.180
Then you can say, okay, is there a word of mouth?

02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:02.340
Anyone else has something good?

02:16:02.340 --> 02:16:04.220
Nothing better than a word of mouth recommendation

02:16:04.220 --> 02:16:05.980
from someone you trust, right?

02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:07.860
Or anybody can have a good website

02:16:07.860 --> 02:16:09.180
but you say, let me look at the website.

02:16:09.180 --> 02:16:11.860
What is it saying if there is one, right?

02:16:11.860 --> 02:16:15.500
Does it resonate with me or not, right?

02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:19.060
But after all of that, then you go to see the person

02:16:19.060 --> 02:16:21.740
with the idea that you're interviewing them, right?

02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:24.020
The idea that, yeah, I hope this person can help me

02:16:24.020 --> 02:16:25.820
and if so, great, I'm with the program

02:16:25.820 --> 02:16:27.140
but I'm thinking about it.

02:16:27.140 --> 02:16:28.700
Do I want this person?

02:16:28.700 --> 02:16:29.780
Do I feel heard?

02:16:29.780 --> 02:16:31.540
Do I feel cared for?

02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:33.420
Which doesn't mean, is it easy, right?

02:16:33.420 --> 02:16:34.700
It might mean, is it hard?

02:16:34.700 --> 02:16:38.980
And I leave and I feel like emotional for a couple of days

02:16:38.980 --> 02:16:41.660
but I see that I'm facing new things.

02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:43.740
You know, this process of assessment

02:16:43.740 --> 02:16:46.820
so that one isn't settling for something

02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:48.940
that is formulaic, over-packaged

02:16:48.940 --> 02:16:51.180
and I'm not trying to be overly critical of therapists.

02:16:51.180 --> 02:16:53.140
I mean, there are people everywhere who do their jobs well

02:16:53.140 --> 02:16:55.220
and people who don't do their jobs well

02:16:55.220 --> 02:16:58.620
but most therapists are working in systems

02:16:58.620 --> 02:17:01.740
that push against doing the job well, right?

02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:02.980
Because they're rationing care

02:17:02.980 --> 02:17:04.500
and there's a lot of number of sessions

02:17:04.500 --> 02:17:07.060
and there's enough in such time before a person can return

02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:09.140
and so often it's an uphill battle

02:17:09.140 --> 02:17:10.940
because we're trying to be helped

02:17:10.940 --> 02:17:14.260
within systems we've created and tolerate

02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:17.620
that are pushing against helping us.

02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:22.980
Yeah, but you know, that interview process is tricky.

02:17:22.980 --> 02:17:25.380
I mean, if you're in a rough place mentally,

02:17:26.380 --> 02:17:29.300
just like with any kind of interview,

02:17:29.300 --> 02:17:33.020
it's hard not to think that a failed interaction,

02:17:33.020 --> 02:17:37.420
failed interview, there's something wrong with you.

02:17:37.420 --> 02:17:38.780
Sure, right.

02:17:38.780 --> 02:17:41.020
There is an authority to a therapist, I think,

02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:44.700
where you think like they've got it all figured out

02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:49.420
and I'm a mess and therefore if there's something off,

02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:50.540
it's all my fault.

02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:53.020
All right, so it's a very tricky

02:17:53.020 --> 02:17:54.380
and it's easy to then give up

02:17:55.020 --> 02:17:57.780
because that's a step to try to get a therapist,

02:17:57.780 --> 02:17:59.540
the first step.

02:17:59.540 --> 02:18:02.220
To get help, if I get a therapist, any kind of help,

02:18:02.220 --> 02:18:04.060
that's a big leap to take.

02:18:04.060 --> 02:18:04.900
I agree.

02:18:04.900 --> 02:18:05.740
Especially when you're in a rough place.

02:18:05.740 --> 02:18:06.900
I agree completely.

02:18:06.900 --> 02:18:11.580
We should not make people swim against such a strong current

02:18:11.580 --> 02:18:12.900
to get their needs met.

02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:15.260
I mean, we see this in such obvious places

02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:18.340
where you have an elderly homebound person

02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:20.180
who can't get their medicine

02:18:20.180 --> 02:18:21.540
because, oh, there's been some change

02:18:21.540 --> 02:18:24.180
and they didn't put the new number into the form

02:18:25.020 --> 02:18:25.860
and the Lord knows what.

02:18:25.860 --> 02:18:28.740
I mean, it's incredible how we force people

02:18:28.740 --> 02:18:30.860
to swim against strong currents

02:18:30.860 --> 02:18:33.020
to get things that are just basic

02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:34.980
at times for their survival.

02:18:34.980 --> 02:18:38.300
And with that in mind, I don't have a lot of respect

02:18:38.300 --> 02:18:39.780
for where healthcare is at

02:18:39.780 --> 02:18:41.980
or where mental health is at.

02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:44.660
The field that I work in has accepted

02:18:44.660 --> 02:18:48.980
all sorts of aspects of how things go.

02:18:48.980 --> 02:18:53.540
Someone else controlling how long the interaction can go on,

02:18:53.540 --> 02:18:55.060
how the interaction is bounded,

02:18:55.060 --> 02:18:56.140
what can be said and done,

02:18:56.140 --> 02:18:58.140
what medicines can be prescribed.

02:18:58.140 --> 02:19:00.820
There's so many external controls

02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:03.980
in the systems we work in that we,

02:19:03.980 --> 02:19:07.900
and I say me included, like all of us in the field,

02:19:07.900 --> 02:19:09.820
have let it get to a place

02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:13.260
where it's obscenely difficult to get help.

02:19:13.260 --> 02:19:15.020
Obscenely difficult.

02:19:15.020 --> 02:19:18.900
And we should say that's not okay.

02:19:18.900 --> 02:19:21.820
I think psychiatrists and therapists

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:23.940
and master's level social workers,

02:19:23.940 --> 02:19:25.620
psychologists and you name it.

02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:29.500
I think we should all say this is not okay.

02:19:29.500 --> 02:19:32.140
And then we as a society should be saying this is not okay.

02:19:32.140 --> 02:19:33.300
Otherwise what you're saying,

02:19:33.300 --> 02:19:35.420
which is I think completely true,

02:19:35.420 --> 02:19:38.620
will only become worse as there are more and more barriers

02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:40.060
to getting the help a person needs.

02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:42.260
And each time a person isn't helped,

02:19:42.260 --> 02:19:44.620
it sets the odds against them getting more help.

02:19:44.620 --> 02:19:47.740
I should say here that when I started working,

02:19:47.740 --> 02:19:50.180
there were times I would send people to an emergency room,

02:19:50.340 --> 02:19:52.940
if there was some emergency in their mental health

02:19:52.940 --> 02:19:54.180
and they were at risk.

02:19:54.180 --> 02:19:56.500
And there were times I'd send somebody to an emergency room

02:19:56.500 --> 02:19:58.220
where if you stopped and looked,

02:19:58.220 --> 02:20:00.460
it would have been malpractice not to do that.

02:20:01.380 --> 02:20:06.380
Now it's not just me who has an incredibly high threshold

02:20:08.460 --> 02:20:09.900
for sending someone to an emergency room

02:20:09.900 --> 02:20:12.580
because you just send someone who's in a lot of distress

02:20:12.580 --> 02:20:15.460
and oftentimes they're sitting on a gurney in a hallway

02:20:15.460 --> 02:20:17.500
or they're locked in a small white room

02:20:17.500 --> 02:20:19.060
and all they had was depression.

02:20:19.260 --> 02:20:22.180
They're scared when they go in and 36 hours later,

02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:23.340
oh, they're feeling a little better.

02:20:23.340 --> 02:20:24.860
Wives are desperate to get out of there

02:20:24.860 --> 02:20:26.260
and someone sends them home.

02:20:26.260 --> 02:20:29.820
I mean, so our systems have shifted so much

02:20:29.820 --> 02:20:33.180
that we tolerate now en masse

02:20:33.180 --> 02:20:35.340
what is egregious to the individual.

02:20:37.260 --> 02:20:42.260
So you are a psychiatrist in terms of doing therapy,

02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:47.220
psychotherapy, what does a successful interaction look like?

02:20:47.260 --> 02:20:50.660
Perhaps a fun question, perhaps not.

02:20:50.660 --> 02:20:52.260
What do you think of the psychiatrist Sean

02:20:52.260 --> 02:20:55.380
in Good Will Hunting played by Robin Williams?

02:20:55.380 --> 02:20:58.140
So what is the full range of interesting interactions?

02:20:58.140 --> 02:20:59.820
Can there be an intimacy, a friendship,

02:20:59.820 --> 02:21:04.580
a kind of varied interaction that kind of blends the lines

02:21:04.580 --> 02:21:09.340
of 30 minutes session once a week or whatever

02:21:09.340 --> 02:21:14.340
versus like a really kind of deliberate long-term project

02:21:15.300 --> 02:21:17.740
that cares about the wellbeing of a person

02:21:17.740 --> 02:21:20.220
across the months and years?

02:21:20.220 --> 02:21:24.700
Or what can you say about a successful interaction

02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:26.940
between therapist and patient?

02:21:26.940 --> 02:21:30.220
I think we're much better served by the latter, right?

02:21:30.220 --> 02:21:32.340
And again, it doesn't have to be over years.

02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:34.940
I mean, maybe person might need that over weeks.

02:21:34.940 --> 02:21:36.060
They might need it over months.

02:21:36.060 --> 02:21:37.740
They might need it over years.

02:21:37.740 --> 02:21:39.980
But if I'm understanding correctly,

02:21:39.980 --> 02:21:41.980
you're describing something that is

02:21:41.980 --> 02:21:44.020
like a real human engagement.

02:21:44.540 --> 02:21:49.100
And I work in a field that for years and years and years,

02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:51.500
the patient didn't get to see,

02:21:51.500 --> 02:21:53.220
the therapist was sitting in a place,

02:21:53.220 --> 02:21:54.900
sitting behind the person, right?

02:21:54.900 --> 02:21:57.380
So that's not, of course, the only tradition

02:21:57.380 --> 02:21:59.380
and there are aspects of that tradition

02:21:59.380 --> 02:22:00.980
that can be very humanized.

02:22:00.980 --> 02:22:04.540
But the idea that we're supposed to not be human,

02:22:04.540 --> 02:22:06.500
I mean, this medicine is shot through with this, right?

02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:07.740
That the doctor is supposed to be God

02:22:07.740 --> 02:22:09.180
and it protects the doctor.

02:22:09.180 --> 02:22:11.100
And that makes its way into therapy.

02:22:11.100 --> 02:22:15.060
And the idea of the superiority, the therapist knows more.

02:22:16.380 --> 02:22:18.420
I mean, in some ways, yes,

02:22:18.420 --> 02:22:21.300
but the idea is like to know more about mechanical things,

02:22:21.300 --> 02:22:22.380
like, right?

02:22:22.380 --> 02:22:25.100
To know more about like facts and knowledge,

02:22:25.100 --> 02:22:26.700
not as a human being, right?

02:22:26.700 --> 02:22:30.740
If we approach therapy as a collaborative human endeavor,

02:22:30.740 --> 02:22:31.580
right?

02:22:31.580 --> 02:22:33.140
Where if we're gonna do it together,

02:22:33.140 --> 02:22:35.380
of course I'm gonna learn from you too, right?

02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:36.700
I mean, we're two human beings

02:22:36.700 --> 02:22:38.300
and we're talking about things that are deep

02:22:38.300 --> 02:22:39.420
and personal and intimate.

02:22:39.580 --> 02:22:41.980
And I'm not gonna participate in a way

02:22:41.980 --> 02:22:45.220
that makes it like about me as much as it's about you,

02:22:45.220 --> 02:22:46.420
but we're two humans

02:22:46.420 --> 02:22:48.780
and what's gone on in me may have relevance

02:22:48.780 --> 02:22:50.460
and sharing it may have relevance.

02:22:50.460 --> 02:22:53.580
And at times you doing something back for me

02:22:53.580 --> 02:22:54.700
may have relevance.

02:22:54.700 --> 02:22:56.020
I'll give you an example of a person

02:22:56.020 --> 02:22:58.580
who would not let me help him.

02:22:58.580 --> 02:22:59.620
It was a young man.

02:22:59.620 --> 02:23:00.580
So when I was in training,

02:23:00.580 --> 02:23:02.340
he was very, very sick

02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:05.740
and needed to change certain choices and habits

02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:07.540
or he was not gonna survive.

02:23:07.540 --> 02:23:11.620
And I had no ability to help him whatsoever.

02:23:11.620 --> 02:23:13.300
And I went and I saw a supervisor

02:23:13.300 --> 02:23:14.780
who was existentially trained,

02:23:14.780 --> 02:23:16.860
where here it's different from existentialism

02:23:16.860 --> 02:23:17.860
in the classic sense,

02:23:17.860 --> 02:23:20.420
but it's about really human connection, right?

02:23:20.420 --> 02:23:23.500
And the guy was always wanting to teach me something, right?

02:23:23.500 --> 02:23:25.100
Cause I can get by in Spanish,

02:23:25.100 --> 02:23:26.380
but he was fluent in Spanish.

02:23:26.380 --> 02:23:27.820
And he wanted to, he'd,

02:23:27.820 --> 02:23:30.780
oh, you traveled here and he'd say a word

02:23:30.780 --> 02:23:31.620
to see if I knew.

02:23:31.620 --> 02:23:33.020
And I was always directing back

02:23:33.020 --> 02:23:34.260
to what I was supposed to do, right?

02:23:34.260 --> 02:23:35.700
And the supervisor, I'll never forget,

02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:37.860
he said, let him teach you Spanish.

02:23:37.860 --> 02:23:39.300
Like, okay, come on.

02:23:39.300 --> 02:23:40.460
So we had a couple of sessions

02:23:40.460 --> 02:23:41.900
where if you look from the outside,

02:23:41.900 --> 02:23:43.060
you say, what is going on there?

02:23:43.060 --> 02:23:44.340
Like, right, like it was,

02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:46.980
they were Spanish lessons to me, right?

02:23:46.980 --> 02:23:49.380
And then at some point he brought in his mother

02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:51.460
and it was, we hadn't brought her in yet.

02:23:51.460 --> 02:23:53.780
And he was in part showing off

02:23:53.780 --> 02:23:55.180
that he taught me something, right?

02:23:55.180 --> 02:23:58.140
And I said a couple of things and he felt more powerful.

02:23:58.140 --> 02:23:59.140
Like he was younger than me

02:23:59.140 --> 02:24:01.380
and he felt sick and disempowered,

02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:02.780
but he didn't feel that way

02:24:02.780 --> 02:24:03.980
once he taught me something

02:24:03.980 --> 02:24:06.220
and we showed it off to his mother, right?

02:24:06.220 --> 02:24:07.900
And his behavior started to change.

02:24:07.900 --> 02:24:10.100
He started taking better care of himself.

02:24:10.100 --> 02:24:11.980
He could see a little more what I was saying.

02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:13.340
He was like, you're a wonderful person.

02:24:13.340 --> 02:24:15.140
Look, you love your mother and your aunt

02:24:15.140 --> 02:24:15.980
and they love you.

02:24:15.980 --> 02:24:18.420
And like, he could start seeing that about himself,

02:24:18.420 --> 02:24:20.180
but that came from humanness.

02:24:20.180 --> 02:24:23.780
And I think that's the way we help people.

02:24:23.780 --> 02:24:25.780
I don't understand why we don't do everything that way.

02:24:25.780 --> 02:24:27.660
It was like, we're two humans,

02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:29.140
but if you're doing something for me,

02:24:29.140 --> 02:24:29.980
then there's something,

02:24:29.980 --> 02:24:31.420
you have an expertise and I don't,

02:24:31.420 --> 02:24:32.820
that's why you're doing it for me.

02:24:32.820 --> 02:24:34.060
The reverse could be true,

02:24:34.060 --> 02:24:36.340
but it doesn't mean we're not just two humans

02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:37.740
doing something together.

02:24:37.740 --> 02:24:39.860
And the healthcare system and the legal system

02:24:39.860 --> 02:24:40.940
should not get in the way of that.

02:24:40.940 --> 02:24:43.500
I mean, there's liability and all these kinds of things

02:24:43.500 --> 02:24:48.380
that can get in the way of the humanness.

02:24:49.340 --> 02:24:50.740
I mean, some of that is justified.

02:24:50.740 --> 02:24:51.620
You have to be careful.

02:24:51.620 --> 02:24:54.660
You have to make sure there's irresponsible,

02:24:54.660 --> 02:24:57.900
but a little too much can destroy the humanness.

02:24:57.900 --> 02:25:00.820
I'll use a way to usually say something is insane.

02:25:00.820 --> 02:25:02.500
Like it's not consistent with sanity.

02:25:03.180 --> 02:25:06.540
And the presence of the legal system.

02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:07.980
Look, I'm all for, of course,

02:25:07.980 --> 02:25:09.300
physicians have to be held,

02:25:09.300 --> 02:25:12.100
we have to be responsible and everybody makes mistakes

02:25:12.100 --> 02:25:15.100
and people have to be accountable for their mistakes.

02:25:15.100 --> 02:25:17.300
I understand all of that.

02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:21.740
But what we see now, it's so absurd that,

02:25:21.740 --> 02:25:23.740
oh, like everyone is frightened.

02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:25.780
Everyone is frightened.

02:25:25.780 --> 02:25:26.900
And then just looking to like,

02:25:26.900 --> 02:25:28.260
how do I slot into the box,

02:25:28.260 --> 02:25:31.020
check the boxes of what I'm supposed to do

02:25:31.020 --> 02:25:32.620
and not get in trouble?

02:25:32.620 --> 02:25:36.180
You know, people get sued because someone was

02:25:36.180 --> 02:25:38.580
at that hospital and that doctor touched their care.

02:25:38.580 --> 02:25:39.740
It happens in the VA system.

02:25:39.740 --> 02:25:41.540
It happens in other systems too.

02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:42.860
So you might've touched their care

02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:44.500
and no one's even saying you did anything wrong,

02:25:44.500 --> 02:25:45.980
but they say the next person did.

02:25:45.980 --> 02:25:47.660
Oh, someone settled on your behalf

02:25:47.660 --> 02:25:49.340
and now you have a malpractice.

02:25:49.340 --> 02:25:51.820
Ding, and maybe you can't get a license somewhere else.

02:25:51.820 --> 02:25:53.860
Like doctors are terrified

02:25:53.860 --> 02:25:57.260
and they're terrified for good reason

02:25:57.260 --> 02:26:00.020
because the same society that has given doctors

02:26:00.020 --> 02:26:01.940
in many ways too much power over time

02:26:01.940 --> 02:26:05.380
and treated doctors maybe too much like gods now

02:26:05.380 --> 02:26:07.780
is I think enacting some of society's anger

02:26:07.780 --> 02:26:10.620
and envy out on the physicians.

02:26:10.620 --> 02:26:13.780
Even the idea that like a person would know what medicine,

02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:16.460
like I saw a couple of TV commercials give me this.

02:26:16.460 --> 02:26:18.620
It's like, it's interesting, right?

02:26:18.620 --> 02:26:21.540
Because even if, let's say I take myself out of it,

02:26:21.540 --> 02:26:22.620
it doesn't feel good, obviously,

02:26:22.620 --> 02:26:25.500
but it's like, wow, like I went to school

02:26:25.500 --> 02:26:26.580
for like eight years for this

02:26:26.580 --> 02:26:28.540
and you didn't even wanna hear my opinion, right?

02:26:28.540 --> 02:26:30.420
You're not taking good care of yourself, right?

02:26:30.420 --> 02:26:32.460
It doesn't mean you should think my opinion is gospel

02:26:32.460 --> 02:26:33.700
because I said it,

02:26:33.700 --> 02:26:36.260
but people then don't have an understanding

02:26:36.260 --> 02:26:37.620
of like what is expertise?

02:26:37.620 --> 02:26:39.100
What do people learn?

02:26:39.100 --> 02:26:42.740
How can people help us understand and make better decisions?

02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:44.460
It kind of goes out with the wash

02:26:44.460 --> 02:26:47.500
and then the position of the expert,

02:26:47.500 --> 02:26:48.900
I mean, a lot has been written about this, right?

02:26:48.900 --> 02:26:52.820
Gets diminished over time very much to our own peril.

02:26:52.820 --> 02:26:56.060
And then often with aggression in the medical world,

02:26:56.060 --> 02:26:59.860
coming back towards the alleged expert.

02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:01.860
Yeah, expertise is a tricky one.

02:27:01.860 --> 02:27:04.460
It's such a tricky thing because

02:27:08.860 --> 02:27:10.860
coupled with expertise,

02:27:10.860 --> 02:27:12.940
the attention is this arrogance

02:27:12.940 --> 02:27:14.900
that can come with expertise.

02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:18.020
The arrogance can make the expert feel

02:27:18.020 --> 02:27:22.060
like they're more of an expert and it's a vicious cycle.

02:27:22.060 --> 02:27:25.020
And then the arrogance in the 21st century,

02:27:25.020 --> 02:27:25.980
especially with the internet,

02:27:26.900 --> 02:27:29.660
the arrogance can completely force the public

02:27:29.660 --> 02:27:30.940
to distrust the expert

02:27:30.940 --> 02:27:33.980
because all they see is the arrogance versus the expertise.

02:27:33.980 --> 02:27:37.780
So ultimately you have to have, I think,

02:27:38.900 --> 02:27:41.100
the greatest experts and masters I know

02:27:41.100 --> 02:27:44.340
are the ones that have complete humility.

02:27:44.340 --> 02:27:45.860
Right, humility and gratitude.

02:27:45.860 --> 02:27:46.700
And gratitude.

02:27:46.700 --> 02:27:47.540
Leads us back.

02:27:47.540 --> 02:27:49.420
Which is usually a really good sign

02:27:49.420 --> 02:27:53.260
that somebody is at the top of their field.

02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:54.540
Right, and they'll acknowledge

02:27:54.540 --> 02:27:55.620
that they don't know everything.

02:27:55.620 --> 02:27:57.380
Right, which is hilarious, right?

02:27:57.380 --> 02:28:00.260
So like the best experts I know

02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:05.260
are the ones that will say that they don't know.

02:28:05.580 --> 02:28:06.420
Right.

02:28:06.420 --> 02:28:08.100
That would not call themselves an expert.

02:28:08.100 --> 02:28:09.220
Right, right.

02:28:09.220 --> 02:28:11.060
It's very confusing.

02:28:11.060 --> 02:28:12.260
Or know that they know a lot

02:28:12.260 --> 02:28:13.420
but don't know the answer to this.

02:28:13.420 --> 02:28:14.620
You see that a lot in medicine.

02:28:14.620 --> 02:28:16.660
That person knows they're an expert surgeon

02:28:16.660 --> 02:28:18.460
but they also acknowledge they don't know

02:28:18.460 --> 02:28:20.220
if this is the right time to operate.

02:28:20.220 --> 02:28:21.740
That's how you get to the best answer

02:28:21.740 --> 02:28:23.220
instead of someone who is an expert

02:28:23.220 --> 02:28:24.540
and always knows the answer.

02:28:24.540 --> 02:28:27.020
Yeah, if we actually rewind

02:28:27.020 --> 02:28:28.940
to the beginning of our conversation,

02:28:28.940 --> 02:28:31.540
we talked about, you mentioned something

02:28:31.540 --> 02:28:33.340
I wanted to return to.

02:28:33.340 --> 02:28:36.540
So there's layers that are,

02:28:36.540 --> 02:28:38.660
there's an emergent novelty.

02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:40.660
And you mentioned that we as human beings

02:28:40.660 --> 02:28:43.940
and we introspect on our own mind,

02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:46.180
we really can't know most of it.

02:28:47.140 --> 02:28:51.100
Which of course makes me think of the unconscious mind,

02:28:51.100 --> 02:28:53.460
subconscious mind and Carl Jung,

02:28:53.460 --> 02:28:55.500
how much is hiding there in the shadows?

02:28:55.500 --> 02:28:58.900
You've investigated a lot of trauma.

02:28:58.900 --> 02:29:00.820
How much is there in our mind

02:29:00.820 --> 02:29:03.460
that's not directly accessible to us?

02:29:03.460 --> 02:29:06.460
Like what can you say maybe philosophically

02:29:06.460 --> 02:29:08.300
about how much is there

02:29:10.300 --> 02:29:13.380
lurking in the Jungian shadow?

02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:15.820
I think there's a tremendous amount there.

02:29:15.820 --> 02:29:19.580
But I wouldn't, I don't immediately go to

02:29:20.540 --> 02:29:21.900
an ominous perspective, right?

02:29:21.900 --> 02:29:23.380
Because if it's lurking there, right?

02:29:23.380 --> 02:29:24.700
It can come get us, right?

02:29:24.700 --> 02:29:26.740
And to some extent that's true, right?

02:29:26.740 --> 02:29:28.300
Because the seeds of evil are there

02:29:28.300 --> 02:29:29.980
if we want to plant and nurture them.

02:29:29.980 --> 02:29:32.180
You think good things can't lurk?

02:29:32.180 --> 02:29:33.020
I guess so.

02:29:33.020 --> 02:29:34.820
I'm being poetic.

02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:35.940
But you're right, you're absolutely right.

02:29:35.940 --> 02:29:38.620
And the Jungian shadow is supposed to not just be dark things,

02:29:38.620 --> 02:29:39.780
it's supposed to be everything.

02:29:39.780 --> 02:29:42.060
It's supposed to be a lot of positive things as well, yeah.

02:29:42.060 --> 02:29:46.060
Right, which I think brings us to self-knowledge, to truth,

02:29:46.060 --> 02:29:50.780
where I think the opposite of envy, narcissism, sociopathy,

02:29:50.780 --> 02:29:53.540
I do think is all rooted in truth.

02:29:53.540 --> 02:29:55.940
It's both the truth of the good things about us

02:29:55.940 --> 02:29:59.100
or the ways we're not blamable,

02:29:59.100 --> 02:30:01.260
blameworthy for the things we're blaming ourselves for,

02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:02.220
et cetera.

02:30:02.220 --> 02:30:04.740
But the self-knowledge and the truth

02:30:04.740 --> 02:30:09.060
and getting away from the reflex of anger, frustration,

02:30:09.060 --> 02:30:12.140
envy, shame, what I think happens then

02:30:12.140 --> 02:30:14.300
is all of that underneath the surface.

02:30:14.300 --> 02:30:17.100
If we look at the consciousness as the top of the iceberg,

02:30:17.100 --> 02:30:19.660
outside the top, outside the water,

02:30:19.660 --> 02:30:22.260
so is what's underneath shifting

02:30:22.260 --> 02:30:24.100
and it can pull the top under, right?

02:30:24.100 --> 02:30:26.020
Or is it supporting the top?

02:30:26.020 --> 02:30:31.020
And really, I believe is honesty, truth, self-knowledge,

02:30:31.020 --> 02:30:33.300
humility, gratitude, all this simple stuff.

02:30:33.300 --> 02:30:36.820
Good mental health is always consistent with simplicity.

02:30:36.820 --> 02:30:39.660
Humility, gratitude are easy things to say.

02:30:39.660 --> 02:30:41.220
We know what that is, right?

02:30:41.220 --> 02:30:42.620
We understand what that is.

02:30:42.620 --> 02:30:46.300
Soothing envy by having immense power

02:30:46.300 --> 02:30:49.260
and subjugating others is getting very, very complicated,

02:30:49.260 --> 02:30:51.500
what that is and how that plays out.

02:30:51.500 --> 02:30:54.140
So if we are in touch with ourselves,

02:30:54.140 --> 02:30:57.220
if we're honest with ourselves, if we own what's ours,

02:30:57.220 --> 02:30:59.620
we don't try and own what's not ours,

02:30:59.620 --> 02:31:02.260
what happens then is something isn't waiting inside of us

02:31:02.260 --> 02:31:06.700
to sort of jump us with some new fact of self

02:31:06.700 --> 02:31:08.340
or challenge of self, right?

02:31:08.340 --> 02:31:10.700
Then I think what happens are phenomena

02:31:10.700 --> 02:31:11.660
like intrinsic learning,

02:31:11.660 --> 02:31:14.020
like the way that so much happens inside of us

02:31:14.020 --> 02:31:15.500
automatically, right?

02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:18.820
How people who have high levels of expertise

02:31:18.820 --> 02:31:23.740
know the answer to complex questions more rapidly, right?

02:31:23.740 --> 02:31:25.660
It doesn't take them longer to think through it,

02:31:25.660 --> 02:31:27.420
but they have more knowledge to think through.

02:31:27.420 --> 02:31:30.540
It's that more happens rapidly and unconsciously

02:31:30.540 --> 02:31:33.260
so they know the more complex answer

02:31:33.260 --> 02:31:35.140
more quickly and readily, right?

02:31:35.140 --> 02:31:37.020
And we can build that in ourselves,

02:31:37.020 --> 02:31:39.380
not just in terms of factual knowledge,

02:31:39.380 --> 02:31:42.220
but in terms of how we respond to things, right?

02:31:42.220 --> 02:31:45.980
If I make a mistake, do I respond with reflexive shame, right?

02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:49.100
If I see someone has something I'd like, how do I respond?

02:31:49.100 --> 02:31:51.780
We're more in accord with ourselves

02:31:51.780 --> 02:31:56.460
and then the automaticity in us is serving us better.

02:31:56.460 --> 02:31:57.460
So that's in the positive.

02:31:57.460 --> 02:31:59.340
Do you think, do you draw some wisdom

02:31:59.340 --> 02:32:03.780
from the early pioneers of psychotherapy

02:32:03.780 --> 02:32:05.820
like Freud and Jung?

02:32:05.820 --> 02:32:06.660
Yes.

02:32:06.660 --> 02:32:07.620
Repressed.

02:32:09.900 --> 02:32:12.420
There's some stuff to work through

02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:15.700
that is in the unconscious mind.

02:32:15.700 --> 02:32:20.340
Yes, I think there's always like 100% of the time.

02:32:20.340 --> 02:32:21.420
If you have a living human,

02:32:21.420 --> 02:32:24.380
you have things to work through in the unconscious mind,

02:32:24.380 --> 02:32:25.220
right?

02:32:25.220 --> 02:32:26.500
There's too much that goes on around us

02:32:26.500 --> 02:32:30.140
that we might find unacceptable and suppress, right?

02:32:30.140 --> 02:32:33.740
There can be smaller, but important examples, right?

02:32:33.740 --> 02:32:38.460
Someone who feels that they're not a good enough parent

02:32:38.460 --> 02:32:43.460
and they, I don't know, they drop the child's plate, right?

02:32:46.660 --> 02:32:50.100
And there's a feeling about that of badness in them

02:32:50.100 --> 02:32:53.460
that the person that can't tolerate and pushes away, right?

02:32:53.460 --> 02:32:55.500
And maybe they become a little bit less confident,

02:32:55.500 --> 02:32:56.620
a little bit less assertive.

02:32:56.620 --> 02:32:59.660
Like those small examples are important

02:32:59.660 --> 02:33:01.220
because they may be low valence,

02:33:01.260 --> 02:33:04.220
but there can be many, many, many, many, many of them, right?

02:33:04.220 --> 02:33:06.220
Then you can look at the opposite end of the spectrum

02:33:06.220 --> 02:33:08.340
where someone, for example, feels,

02:33:08.340 --> 02:33:12.420
or they're repressing their sexuality unconsciously.

02:33:12.420 --> 02:33:15.460
There's something that is so important, say,

02:33:15.460 --> 02:33:16.900
to how a person feels about themselves,

02:33:16.900 --> 02:33:18.380
to whether they can seek fulfillment,

02:33:18.380 --> 02:33:20.820
to how they feel about their ability to interact

02:33:20.820 --> 02:33:23.060
and engage with others in ways that are loving

02:33:23.060 --> 02:33:24.780
and generative over time.

02:33:24.780 --> 02:33:28.340
So from smaller things that accumulate often

02:33:28.340 --> 02:33:30.860
at rapid pace to really big things,

02:33:30.860 --> 02:33:33.180
we are pushing things into the unconscious

02:33:33.180 --> 02:33:36.500
because they're not acceptable and we need to explore.

02:33:36.500 --> 02:33:37.980
Like, why is that not acceptable?

02:33:37.980 --> 02:33:39.420
Maybe there's an unacceptable urge

02:33:39.420 --> 02:33:41.380
because it's really not acceptable to me, right?

02:33:41.380 --> 02:33:42.660
Like a violent urge.

02:33:42.660 --> 02:33:44.740
Maybe there's an unacceptable urge

02:33:44.740 --> 02:33:47.660
because I'm actually listening to the lies society

02:33:47.660 --> 02:33:50.500
is telling me about what's okay and what's not okay, right?

02:33:50.500 --> 02:33:52.660
So in exploring those things,

02:33:52.660 --> 02:33:54.940
yes, we become happier and healthier,

02:33:54.940 --> 02:33:57.980
and that could mean if we're already happy and healthy,

02:33:57.980 --> 02:33:58.980
it gets better.

02:33:58.980 --> 02:34:01.220
We get more insulated against the negative,

02:34:01.220 --> 02:34:03.620
or it can mean the person who's really nurturing

02:34:03.620 --> 02:34:06.500
some of those seeds of evil and envy

02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:08.820
does that less or steps away from it.

02:34:08.820 --> 02:34:10.420
So whether it's good or it's bad,

02:34:10.420 --> 02:34:12.420
it's in there inside of us,

02:34:12.420 --> 02:34:15.180
and we benefit from understanding

02:34:15.180 --> 02:34:16.860
that idea of the observing ego, right?

02:34:16.860 --> 02:34:18.700
Like I said, the part that can stop and say,

02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:22.220
hey, this is what I see what's going on in me.

02:34:22.220 --> 02:34:25.300
What have you learned about exploring the human mind

02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:27.460
about the art of conversation?

02:34:27.460 --> 02:34:29.500
Is ultimately therapy is conversation.

02:34:29.500 --> 02:34:30.540
Yeah.

02:34:30.540 --> 02:34:33.220
Is there something you can put into words?

02:34:33.220 --> 02:34:34.060
Yeah.

02:34:34.060 --> 02:34:37.380
Like what makes it a good conversation?

02:34:37.380 --> 02:34:41.660
I think language is among the most amazing gifts we have,

02:34:41.660 --> 02:34:45.340
and it's also one of the most like clunky routes

02:34:45.340 --> 02:34:47.020
to misunderstanding, right?

02:34:47.020 --> 02:34:49.100
I think of like, there's a concept of facticity,

02:34:49.100 --> 02:34:50.620
you know, things that are like, I guess,

02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:52.940
unnecessary evils and from the religious perspective,

02:34:52.940 --> 02:34:54.540
I think is where the word started,

02:34:54.540 --> 02:34:57.420
but of language being like a facticity, right?

02:34:58.380 --> 02:34:59.580
That we need to communicate with one another,

02:34:59.580 --> 02:35:01.620
we wanna communicate, so we develop words

02:35:01.620 --> 02:35:03.700
and we have these amazing brains that can have language,

02:35:03.700 --> 02:35:05.620
and that's all well and good,

02:35:05.620 --> 02:35:08.580
but our fantasy would be more like Mr. Spock, right?

02:35:08.580 --> 02:35:10.380
You know, the Vulcan mind mail was like,

02:35:10.380 --> 02:35:11.500
I communicate with you

02:35:11.500 --> 02:35:12.860
because we put our hands on one another,

02:35:12.860 --> 02:35:15.020
and we know, you know, by doing this,

02:35:15.020 --> 02:35:17.340
what we're thinking and what we're feeling,

02:35:17.340 --> 02:35:19.540
and we won't have misunderstanding.

02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:22.500
So because I think we can approximate that,

02:35:22.500 --> 02:35:25.340
we can come kind of close with language, right?

02:35:25.340 --> 02:35:28.100
Or we can be so far away from it

02:35:28.100 --> 02:35:31.220
that we can say the same word and have opposite meanings

02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:33.980
and have it generate immediate animosity, right?

02:35:33.980 --> 02:35:38.180
That we need to be very, very careful with language,

02:35:38.180 --> 02:35:40.260
with communication, with conversations.

02:35:40.260 --> 02:35:43.220
And I've come to understand that much, much more

02:35:43.220 --> 02:35:46.460
as I've gotten older, both in terms of how hurtful,

02:35:47.780 --> 02:35:51.220
you know, reckless speeches, which is why I'm horrified

02:35:51.220 --> 02:35:53.860
by so much of what we see in our political discourse, right?

02:35:53.860 --> 02:35:57.220
The slurs, the negativity that's attached to something,

02:35:57.220 --> 02:36:00.180
to some word, you know, how one can utter something

02:36:00.180 --> 02:36:02.900
and it can go into another person just into the ear,

02:36:02.900 --> 02:36:05.020
but then go through so many parts of the meaning

02:36:05.020 --> 02:36:07.420
of the brain that that person feels a pervasive sense

02:36:07.420 --> 02:36:10.420
of shame or beleagueredness, right?

02:36:10.420 --> 02:36:15.020
So yes, reckless language absolutely hurts people.

02:36:15.020 --> 02:36:16.820
And we see that all the time in ways

02:36:16.820 --> 02:36:18.580
that I think are just atrocious.

02:36:18.580 --> 02:36:22.500
And also how bad miscommunication harms us.

02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:24.420
I mean, I really learned that through a lot

02:36:24.420 --> 02:36:26.460
of different ways, but in the work as a therapist

02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:28.460
of like really wanting to make sure

02:36:28.460 --> 02:36:30.500
that I'm really understanding you

02:36:30.500 --> 02:36:32.460
and you're really understanding me.

02:36:32.460 --> 02:36:34.820
And a lot of work goes into that communication.

02:36:34.820 --> 02:36:36.420
I think people, we can get into a rhythm of it

02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:38.060
and then it happens more easily.

02:36:38.060 --> 02:36:41.500
But I think it's like, it's a life and death difference

02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:44.060
at times, you know, lots of times, right?

02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:46.020
In the world around us between clear

02:36:46.020 --> 02:36:47.260
and accurate communication.

02:36:47.260 --> 02:36:48.420
And just, oh, I said a word because like,

02:36:48.420 --> 02:36:50.980
I think you know what I mean or something like that.

02:36:50.980 --> 02:36:54.620
Yeah, so to that, I mean, there's the Camus quote

02:36:54.620 --> 02:36:57.580
that I like, as much unhappiness has come

02:36:57.580 --> 02:37:00.260
into the world because of things left unsaid.

02:37:02.180 --> 02:37:05.060
So that has to do with clear communication.

02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:11.500
But there's also a dance to a conversation,

02:37:12.660 --> 02:37:15.220
a poetry to it.

02:37:15.220 --> 02:37:17.700
There is ambiguity to language.

02:37:17.700 --> 02:37:20.580
And if you have a kind of awareness of that ambiguity

02:37:21.140 --> 02:37:23.500
and you play with it, that's where wit and humor come in.

02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:27.660
That allows you to sneak up to difficult topics

02:37:27.660 --> 02:37:30.420
without sort of trampling on them.

02:37:30.420 --> 02:37:34.140
I don't know, there's an art to it as well.

02:37:34.140 --> 02:37:36.380
There's an art to the silence, you know?

02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:40.300
Just allowing both human beings,

02:37:40.300 --> 02:37:41.900
one of the most intimate things you can share

02:37:41.900 --> 02:37:43.460
with a human being is silence.

02:37:43.460 --> 02:37:45.460
Yeah, that's communication.

02:37:45.460 --> 02:37:48.860
It's a different communication, but at times more powerful.

02:37:48.860 --> 02:37:53.300
Yeah, giving a person space to accumulate,

02:37:53.300 --> 02:37:55.980
to integrate, to make sense of their thoughts,

02:37:55.980 --> 02:37:58.780
enough to say a word, maybe a memory spark

02:37:58.780 --> 02:38:00.940
so they can think about that memory

02:38:00.940 --> 02:38:03.220
and process that memory.

02:38:03.220 --> 02:38:04.540
So it's not just words, right?

02:38:04.540 --> 02:38:05.460
It's not just words, right?

02:38:05.460 --> 02:38:06.740
Because now you're talking about communication

02:38:06.740 --> 02:38:11.060
as it's body language, it's expressions of empathy,

02:38:11.060 --> 02:38:13.380
it's movements, it's pauses, right?

02:38:13.380 --> 02:38:17.220
The communication process is very, very complicated

02:38:17.220 --> 02:38:18.700
and deep.

02:38:19.420 --> 02:38:20.740
Some of that is building trust,

02:38:20.740 --> 02:38:22.900
but also challenging a person.

02:38:22.900 --> 02:38:25.740
I wonder about that whole process with strangers,

02:38:25.740 --> 02:38:29.500
for example, of how you do that successfully.

02:38:29.500 --> 02:38:31.620
Like you and I just met today,

02:38:32.820 --> 02:38:37.220
but I think a lot of our interaction is very free.

02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:39.740
We can get to know each other in any way we want.

02:38:39.740 --> 02:38:43.380
There's a few conversations I have coming up in general

02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:45.620
where there's a lot of other pressures and constraints

02:38:45.620 --> 02:38:46.620
on those conversations.

02:38:46.620 --> 02:38:48.380
There's a danger to it.

02:38:49.060 --> 02:38:49.900
There's risks.

02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:51.700
There's political forces involved,

02:38:53.260 --> 02:38:56.180
not from my perspective, but probably from my as well

02:38:56.180 --> 02:38:58.140
of how do you say this thing?

02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:00.500
What are the words that are going to offend?

02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:03.660
And you're learning that about a stranger at the same time.

02:39:03.660 --> 02:39:08.260
And you don't, it's an interesting dance

02:39:08.260 --> 02:39:12.700
because you have to walk carefully but deliberately, right?

02:39:12.700 --> 02:39:17.140
Carefully because I've learned this about myself,

02:39:17.140 --> 02:39:18.340
about others.

02:39:18.340 --> 02:39:22.380
There's certain words that can trigger a person,

02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:25.540
that can make a person feel poorly,

02:39:25.540 --> 02:39:28.100
like shitty about themselves.

02:39:29.540 --> 02:39:33.300
So you can push, you can challenge a person about something

02:39:33.300 --> 02:39:34.740
and they're totally okay with it,

02:39:34.740 --> 02:39:36.820
but if you use a certain word to do it,

02:39:36.820 --> 02:39:40.220
it's gonna, maybe it maps to some childhood thing

02:39:40.220 --> 02:39:41.620
that their father or mother used to say

02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:43.020
or something like this.

02:39:43.020 --> 02:39:46.260
And I mean, part of the art of conversation

02:39:46.260 --> 02:39:50.060
is actually being a little bit free in using those words

02:39:50.060 --> 02:39:53.020
but being extremely sensitive in detecting

02:39:53.020 --> 02:39:55.460
when a person reacts to a particular word

02:39:55.460 --> 02:39:58.620
and like storing that away as like, okay,

02:39:58.620 --> 02:40:01.500
then we might wanna return to that later

02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:03.140
because there might be an interesting,

02:40:03.140 --> 02:40:04.380
that could be a tip of an iceberg

02:40:04.380 --> 02:40:06.540
that's actually representing something beautiful

02:40:06.540 --> 02:40:09.740
or you might wanna just, it's a nothing word

02:40:09.740 --> 02:40:12.660
that you just wanna avoid because it's a distraction.

02:40:12.660 --> 02:40:15.020
And so all of that kind of has to be integrated

02:40:15.060 --> 02:40:16.260
into the dance of language.

02:40:16.260 --> 02:40:17.580
This is really interesting,

02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:19.100
especially when the stakes are really high,

02:40:19.100 --> 02:40:20.820
when you get one conversation.

02:40:20.820 --> 02:40:21.660
Right.

02:40:21.660 --> 02:40:24.340
When you sit down, you have one conversation

02:40:24.340 --> 02:40:27.300
and it makes the difference between like,

02:40:27.300 --> 02:40:29.260
say you had one conversation with a patient,

02:40:29.260 --> 02:40:31.420
this is the only conversation you get to help them.

02:40:31.420 --> 02:40:34.020
Sometimes that is the case, yeah.

02:40:34.020 --> 02:40:35.700
This is pretty high stakes.

02:40:35.700 --> 02:40:36.540
Yeah.

02:40:36.540 --> 02:40:37.500
Oh man.

02:40:38.900 --> 02:40:39.740
Yeah, it's tough.

02:40:39.740 --> 02:40:41.660
I guess you get over,

02:40:41.660 --> 02:40:45.580
and like over time, I guess you get used

02:40:45.580 --> 02:40:48.340
to the high stakes nature of it.

02:40:48.340 --> 02:40:49.820
When you develop an ability

02:40:49.820 --> 02:40:51.700
and all that unconscious processing.

02:40:51.700 --> 02:40:52.620
Right, right.

02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:55.180
All that part of the iceberg that's underneath the surface

02:40:55.180 --> 02:40:56.300
is doing all of that, right?

02:40:56.300 --> 02:40:59.380
Is reading behavioral cues, verbal cues

02:40:59.380 --> 02:41:03.780
and recognizing the primacy of emotion over logic, right?

02:41:03.780 --> 02:41:05.820
If we're all logic, it'd be different.

02:41:05.820 --> 02:41:06.900
Okay, we're gonna talk about this thing.

02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:08.380
I'll say things, you say things back,

02:41:08.380 --> 02:41:10.580
even if it's politically contentious say.

02:41:10.580 --> 02:41:12.060
Okay, we're just gonna talk logically.

02:41:12.060 --> 02:41:13.820
But that's not the case, right?

02:41:13.820 --> 02:41:17.340
There could be a word that raises a certain emotion

02:41:17.340 --> 02:41:18.780
and you know you don't wanna tread there

02:41:18.780 --> 02:41:21.180
because the emotion will color the person's ability

02:41:21.180 --> 02:41:24.580
to engage and so you're aware of all of this.

02:41:24.580 --> 02:41:27.980
And then I think from the perspective of all of that,

02:41:27.980 --> 02:41:29.420
it's like standing on the shoulders

02:41:29.420 --> 02:41:31.620
of your own internal giant, right?

02:41:31.620 --> 02:41:36.020
That understands language and emotions and body language

02:41:36.020 --> 02:41:40.020
and attunement and history and triggering and all of that.

02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:41.900
And then on top of that,

02:41:41.900 --> 02:41:43.300
as you're standing up on those shoulders,

02:41:43.300 --> 02:41:45.500
you're trying to be effective, right?

02:41:45.500 --> 02:41:47.620
And then I think that's where, you know,

02:41:47.620 --> 02:41:51.180
effectiveness can be unilateral or it can be together.

02:41:51.180 --> 02:41:53.700
I mean, I think some of what emerged

02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:56.300
from Viktor Frankl's writing after the Second World War

02:41:56.300 --> 02:42:00.300
was how much shared humanness means to us,

02:42:00.300 --> 02:42:02.860
how much of that can be an incentive

02:42:02.860 --> 02:42:05.460
for survival beyond all others, right?

02:42:05.460 --> 02:42:07.980
So the idea of are we doing something

02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:09.580
if we're communicating unilateral,

02:42:09.940 --> 02:42:12.540
like I want information from you

02:42:12.540 --> 02:42:14.620
or I want you to do a certain thing

02:42:14.620 --> 02:42:16.300
when we're done talking, right?

02:42:16.300 --> 02:42:17.900
Right, done communicating.

02:42:17.900 --> 02:42:20.780
That's a very unilateral type of effectiveness

02:42:20.780 --> 02:42:21.820
which can make sense.

02:42:21.820 --> 02:42:23.460
Sometimes I want information out of a patient

02:42:23.460 --> 02:42:25.060
because I wanna know what to do next, right?

02:42:25.060 --> 02:42:26.940
So it doesn't have to always be negative

02:42:26.940 --> 02:42:29.380
but it can also be a tool of manipulation, right?

02:42:29.380 --> 02:42:31.860
If someone would say coming from envy or narcissism,

02:42:31.860 --> 02:42:33.700
I wanna communicate with you in a way

02:42:33.700 --> 02:42:36.060
that makes you do what I want you to do, right?

02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:39.580
Different from that is where it's a shared communication

02:42:39.580 --> 02:42:42.740
where there's like an umbrella, so to speak, over us

02:42:42.740 --> 02:42:46.100
and we're doing something that can only happen together

02:42:46.100 --> 02:42:48.420
because we're us, we're each person, right?

02:42:48.420 --> 02:42:50.380
And we come together to do something

02:42:50.380 --> 02:42:53.500
that's a shared effectiveness like I think we're doing now

02:42:53.500 --> 02:42:56.060
of like elucidating and pursuing thoughts

02:42:56.060 --> 02:42:57.420
and getting ideas out.

02:42:57.420 --> 02:42:59.420
And I think the best situations

02:42:59.420 --> 02:43:01.260
are shared effectiveness situations

02:43:01.260 --> 02:43:03.220
because you call upon the resourcefulness

02:43:03.220 --> 02:43:05.980
and the internal resources of both people.

02:43:06.980 --> 02:43:09.340
But you, especially with strangers,

02:43:09.340 --> 02:43:12.100
especially when it's not labeled a therapy session,

02:43:13.420 --> 02:43:18.100
you kind of actually stumble into that cooperative state.

02:43:20.860 --> 02:43:25.860
You have to organically develop a trust together

02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:30.420
and almost lose yourself.

02:43:30.420 --> 02:43:32.420
Ultimately, I think you put it really nice.

02:43:32.420 --> 02:43:34.100
I think successful conversations,

02:43:34.100 --> 02:43:36.700
even when it's with like,

02:43:36.700 --> 02:43:40.580
even if it's like with world leaders or logicians,

02:43:40.580 --> 02:43:42.700
people that operate in the space of reason,

02:43:42.700 --> 02:43:46.220
the most successful conversation will ultimately be

02:43:46.220 --> 02:43:49.940
in the layer, in the landscape of emotion.

02:43:49.940 --> 02:43:52.220
Like that's where the interesting stuff will happen.

02:43:52.220 --> 02:43:53.740
That's where you'll discover anything

02:43:53.740 --> 02:43:55.500
and that's where you get to actually meet

02:43:55.500 --> 02:43:57.980
to start getting an understanding of each other

02:43:57.980 --> 02:44:01.420
or what you actually mean even by the statements

02:44:01.420 --> 02:44:04.180
that are supposed to be kind of rationally based.

02:44:05.820 --> 02:44:06.900
You lose yourself.

02:44:06.900 --> 02:44:10.340
You lose yourself in the way you do when you're children

02:44:10.340 --> 02:44:13.180
and you're just shooting the shit about whatever topic

02:44:13.180 --> 02:44:14.700
and you just forget yourself,

02:44:14.700 --> 02:44:15.540
forget the things you're supposed to say.

02:44:15.540 --> 02:44:17.060
You lose yourself from the context, right?

02:44:17.060 --> 02:44:20.860
Yeah, well you kind of plug into the unconscious mind

02:44:20.860 --> 02:44:24.660
a little bit and you get to speak maybe indirectly

02:44:24.660 --> 02:44:27.900
but to the things that really drive you,

02:44:27.900 --> 02:44:30.500
to the thing that really, to the things,

02:44:30.540 --> 02:44:35.140
to the emotions I suppose that underlie your worldview.

02:44:35.140 --> 02:44:38.860
I feel like that's where productive conversations

02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:41.620
can happen whether it's a patient or just a stranger

02:44:41.620 --> 02:44:45.180
you're talking to at a bar about geopolitics.

02:44:46.260 --> 02:44:48.100
You mentioned Viktor Frankl.

02:44:48.100 --> 02:44:50.420
What do you make of his work, Man's Search for Meaning?

02:44:50.420 --> 02:44:53.500
What are the lessons you draw from his work

02:44:53.500 --> 02:44:56.780
of him as a psychologist but also from that

02:44:56.780 --> 02:44:59.500
very powerful work that reflects on his experience

02:44:59.500 --> 02:45:02.020
in a Nazi concentration camp?

02:45:02.020 --> 02:45:07.020
Yeah, I think that it was almost a profound reinvention

02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:11.900
of humanness, right?

02:45:11.900 --> 02:45:16.900
After something so awful, so bleak and so despairing

02:45:17.700 --> 02:45:22.700
to speak anew about shared humanness, human connection,

02:45:23.660 --> 02:45:28.660
meaning, compassion that I think it was an intellectual

02:45:29.980 --> 02:45:34.980
direction that was adorned with all of the emotions

02:45:35.140 --> 02:45:38.460
that we need to adorn the logic with in order

02:45:38.460 --> 02:45:40.500
to make real change in the world.

02:45:40.500 --> 02:45:45.500
And I think that his work has fueled so many branches

02:45:45.780 --> 02:45:49.940
have come from his work, the existential psychotherapy

02:45:50.460 --> 02:45:54.420
and its place in helping human activities today, right?

02:45:56.420 --> 02:46:01.420
A trend away from the idea that we're all quite isolated

02:46:01.420 --> 02:46:03.220
and that what's going on between us

02:46:03.220 --> 02:46:04.660
is all very transactional, right?

02:46:04.660 --> 02:46:06.180
I'm putting something out and you take it in,

02:46:06.180 --> 02:46:07.980
you put something out, I take it in, right?

02:46:07.980 --> 02:46:09.420
The idea that no, there's a difference there.

02:46:09.420 --> 02:46:12.700
There's a shared humanness that creates a meaning

02:46:12.700 --> 02:46:15.220
beyond the transactional, kind of like you were just saying.

02:46:15.220 --> 02:46:17.620
The logical stuff isn't really that interesting

02:46:18.620 --> 02:46:21.380
because the logic is, there's an answer

02:46:21.380 --> 02:46:23.660
to whatever logic is, we can do math, right?

02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:27.260
It's where does the surprises come in, right?

02:46:27.260 --> 02:46:30.580
Either in terms of wonderful behavior

02:46:30.580 --> 02:46:32.100
or destructive behavior, right?

02:46:32.100 --> 02:46:33.860
They're coming from people's emotions,

02:46:33.860 --> 02:46:36.380
so that's what we want to understand

02:46:36.380 --> 02:46:39.020
and that occurs in the context of a person

02:46:39.020 --> 02:46:41.420
and other humans, even if it's the conception

02:46:41.420 --> 02:46:44.740
of someone and other humans as enemy,

02:46:44.820 --> 02:46:49.340
or it's the conception of two people sitting together,

02:46:49.340 --> 02:46:50.980
the idea that there's a shared humanness

02:46:50.980 --> 02:46:52.820
and it's not all transactional

02:46:52.820 --> 02:46:55.220
and that he could take that out of

02:46:57.220 --> 02:47:00.860
a pinnacle of human tragedy and utilize it

02:47:00.860 --> 02:47:05.020
in a way that informs us being better as a species

02:47:05.020 --> 02:47:07.980
going forward, I think is really monumental.

02:47:07.980 --> 02:47:11.900
What do you think is the role of emotion in the human mind,

02:47:12.780 --> 02:47:15.020
in the human condition?

02:47:15.020 --> 02:47:18.100
Because you've, we've talked several times

02:47:18.100 --> 02:47:21.820
in different ways that emotion matters

02:47:21.820 --> 02:47:23.820
and it's a big part of who we are,

02:47:25.380 --> 02:47:28.300
but why is it there?

02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:29.580
Why is it useful?

02:47:29.580 --> 02:47:30.660
What's good about it?

02:47:32.220 --> 02:47:35.420
We've almost said it's almost like a negative thing

02:47:35.420 --> 02:47:37.380
that we just have to live with,

02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:39.660
but why is it also maybe a beautiful thing?

02:47:40.340 --> 02:47:42.140
Well, I think you said, what's the role of emotion?

02:47:42.140 --> 02:47:44.500
Emotion is the king, if we wanna use that analogy.

02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:47.060
It's the CEO, if you wanna use that analogy.

02:47:47.060 --> 02:47:49.940
Emotion rules all.

02:47:49.940 --> 02:47:51.740
We're taught that we're logical creatures,

02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:54.060
but we have innumerable pieces of data,

02:47:54.060 --> 02:47:55.940
even over the course of just a day,

02:47:55.940 --> 02:47:58.140
let alone a human experience to tell us

02:47:58.140 --> 02:47:59.500
that is not the truth.

02:47:59.500 --> 02:48:02.500
Is it ever logical to run into a burning building?

02:48:03.380 --> 02:48:04.340
No, right?

02:48:04.340 --> 02:48:06.140
I mean, logic's never gonna tell one to do that.

02:48:06.140 --> 02:48:07.500
Okay, so many love is in the building.

02:48:07.500 --> 02:48:10.580
Person's already sprinted halfway to the building, right?

02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:15.420
Emotion rules us and so the thought,

02:48:15.420 --> 02:48:18.820
a thought is some of that is evolutionary, right?

02:48:18.820 --> 02:48:21.980
That strong negative emotion stays with us

02:48:21.980 --> 02:48:24.220
very, very profoundly, right?

02:48:24.220 --> 02:48:26.780
So example I'll give is if we're hunter-gatherers

02:48:26.780 --> 02:48:29.140
and like, I find a new berry and it tastes good

02:48:29.140 --> 02:48:32.300
and it seems nutritious and then, and it is, right?

02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:34.780
Everything's fine, it'd be good to remember that, right?

02:48:34.780 --> 02:48:36.620
But if I find a new berry and it tastes good

02:48:36.620 --> 02:48:39.020
and it seems nutritious and we both eat it

02:48:39.020 --> 02:48:43.220
and almost die of sickness, we better remember that, right?

02:48:43.220 --> 02:48:47.340
So the primacy of emotion is in us

02:48:47.340 --> 02:48:49.860
for reasons that are about survival,

02:48:49.860 --> 02:48:52.420
that the emotion of it's my child in that building

02:48:52.420 --> 02:48:55.140
or my loved one is why I don't give a damn about logic

02:48:55.140 --> 02:48:56.820
and run into the building, right?

02:48:56.820 --> 02:48:58.860
The emotion of I thought that was good

02:48:58.860 --> 02:49:01.420
and I got really sick and I better never forget

02:49:01.420 --> 02:49:04.340
is also about survival and the same applies to humans.

02:49:04.700 --> 02:49:06.660
If we're from different tribes back then

02:49:06.660 --> 02:49:09.220
and in my tribe, when you put your hand out,

02:49:09.220 --> 02:49:11.380
it's a greeting, in your tribe,

02:49:11.380 --> 02:49:13.540
if someone puts their hand out, it means,

02:49:13.540 --> 02:49:16.060
hey, I'm gonna attack you and take your stuff, right?

02:49:16.060 --> 02:49:19.620
Then I put my hand out and you slug me, right?

02:49:19.620 --> 02:49:22.420
Then it's like, I better remember that, right?

02:49:22.420 --> 02:49:25.380
But you see how that can lead into, you know,

02:49:25.380 --> 02:49:27.340
are the constructs around that.

02:49:27.340 --> 02:49:30.140
I say, oh, people in your tribe are violent, right?

02:49:30.140 --> 02:49:33.020
We start then to make stories around that.

02:49:33.020 --> 02:49:35.500
But the primacy of emotion, whether it's berries

02:49:35.500 --> 02:49:37.420
or it's humans who might threaten us

02:49:37.420 --> 02:49:41.740
or it's humans we love, I think it's hard to even look

02:49:41.740 --> 02:49:43.980
at that anthropological, psychological literature

02:49:43.980 --> 02:49:46.020
and to look at what's out there

02:49:46.020 --> 02:49:47.540
and I think the face validity,

02:49:47.540 --> 02:49:49.820
that's part of survival, right?

02:49:49.820 --> 02:49:50.660
It's part of survival.

02:49:50.660 --> 02:49:53.780
But it's so cool that you get also things like love,

02:49:53.780 --> 02:49:57.620
which are not often rational or grounded in logic and so on.

02:49:57.620 --> 02:50:00.940
If you look from a transactional perspective,

02:50:01.860 --> 02:50:06.340
a lot of times falling in love or whether it's with friends

02:50:06.340 --> 02:50:10.700
or friendship or romantic love, it doesn't really make sense.

02:50:10.700 --> 02:50:14.940
I'm still not sure what the hell it is.

02:50:14.940 --> 02:50:19.940
Because I mean, it's the thing that is one of the things

02:50:20.180 --> 02:50:22.780
or love for your kids when they're born.

02:50:22.780 --> 02:50:26.020
Like that love, the parental love.

02:50:27.940 --> 02:50:29.380
What is that?

02:50:29.380 --> 02:50:31.740
That's so cool that we get to have that.

02:50:31.740 --> 02:50:34.940
If you're looking for the, in the menu of items

02:50:34.940 --> 02:50:37.740
that give life meaning, that seems like a pretty good one.

02:50:37.740 --> 02:50:42.140
Yeah, so my response, you just said that gives life meaning.

02:50:42.140 --> 02:50:43.660
My response initially was gonna be,

02:50:43.660 --> 02:50:45.820
it's the meaning of life, right?

02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:48.220
Because saying, okay, emotion is about survival.

02:50:48.220 --> 02:50:49.780
That's one part, right?

02:50:49.780 --> 02:50:51.020
And it's a very important part, right?

02:50:51.020 --> 02:50:53.900
If we don't survive, then we're not there

02:50:53.900 --> 02:50:55.060
to have emotions, right?

02:50:55.060 --> 02:50:58.820
So yes, it's about survival, but as important as that is,

02:50:58.820 --> 02:51:00.460
that's the small part of it, right?

02:51:00.460 --> 02:51:02.820
I think it is about the meaning of life

02:51:02.820 --> 02:51:04.940
because it's about the beyond self.

02:51:04.940 --> 02:51:07.660
And I think it relates back to what we talk,

02:51:07.660 --> 02:51:08.820
we're talking about at the very beginning

02:51:08.820 --> 02:51:11.500
and the sort of levels of emergence, right?

02:51:11.500 --> 02:51:14.580
And when we feel love, we feel happiness

02:51:14.580 --> 02:51:17.340
because that person feels happiness, right?

02:51:17.340 --> 02:51:19.140
There's something that's so generative,

02:51:19.140 --> 02:51:20.540
so creative about that.

02:51:20.540 --> 02:51:22.260
Like we wanna bring order to things

02:51:22.260 --> 02:51:26.100
and happiness is consistent with simplicity, right?

02:51:26.100 --> 02:51:27.580
If we're healthy, there's nothing negative

02:51:27.580 --> 02:51:28.740
to say about our health, right?

02:51:29.620 --> 02:51:30.900
If we have health problems, there's a lot to say, right?

02:51:30.900 --> 02:51:35.300
And it's emotion that pushes us towards the goodness

02:51:35.300 --> 02:51:38.020
that I think makes all the meaning for us.

02:51:38.020 --> 02:51:39.100
I mean, it's interesting.

02:51:39.100 --> 02:51:40.900
I actually was wondering what your thoughts

02:51:40.900 --> 02:51:42.500
about this as a scientist, right?

02:51:42.500 --> 02:51:45.820
Because we accept it by and large that we have free will,

02:51:45.820 --> 02:51:48.140
right, we have free will, but then we get upset

02:51:48.140 --> 02:51:50.020
that there's not justice, right?

02:51:50.020 --> 02:51:52.420
But how is it like if we have free will,

02:51:52.420 --> 02:51:55.260
I could act in an unjust way and then you're surprised

02:51:55.260 --> 02:51:57.060
or vice versa, why, right?

02:51:57.740 --> 02:51:59.820
We have these thoughts because I think

02:51:59.820 --> 02:52:03.180
because we're rooted, we want logic to rule.

02:52:03.180 --> 02:52:04.820
Like there's a way which I can understand logic,

02:52:04.820 --> 02:52:06.740
I can manage it, I can manipulate it.

02:52:06.740 --> 02:52:08.940
We sort of want it to be that way.

02:52:08.940 --> 02:52:13.940
So then we glorify logic and then we misapply it.

02:52:14.140 --> 02:52:16.460
Like ideas like, oh, I know we have free will,

02:52:16.460 --> 02:52:19.220
but I'm now shaking my fist at the heavens

02:52:19.220 --> 02:52:21.220
because there's no justice, right?

02:52:21.220 --> 02:52:23.980
And I think maybe what we're looking for is

02:52:23.980 --> 02:52:25.540
we should go back and look at the givens.

02:52:25.540 --> 02:52:28.020
Like why is there, there's only goodness if there's justice?

02:52:28.020 --> 02:52:30.900
I mean, that doesn't make, I think the goodness,

02:52:30.900 --> 02:52:32.820
why is the goodness have to be tied to that, right?

02:52:32.820 --> 02:52:35.180
Maybe it goes back to the counter entropy

02:52:35.180 --> 02:52:37.140
and the fact that when there is something,

02:52:37.140 --> 02:52:38.620
there is not nothing, right?

02:52:38.620 --> 02:52:40.860
And where there is something, there can be awareness,

02:52:40.860 --> 02:52:44.260
there can be goodness, there can be compassion, right?

02:52:44.260 --> 02:52:48.860
Is it that what's really going on is not about justice?

02:52:48.860 --> 02:52:52.780
Yes, we have free will, but it's that goodness,

02:52:52.780 --> 02:52:56.420
creating, shoring up, making better,

02:52:56.420 --> 02:53:01.420
that is the meaning, that is the good, right?

02:53:01.500 --> 02:53:04.300
And that the evil is the destruction

02:53:04.300 --> 02:53:07.260
as evidenced by the fact that it's over determined

02:53:07.260 --> 02:53:09.780
probably a million times that we're in this eddy current

02:53:09.780 --> 02:53:13.300
of counter entropy and we could destroy that quite readily,

02:53:13.300 --> 02:53:14.140
right?

02:53:14.140 --> 02:53:17.020
And then we're nothingness like everything else

02:53:17.020 --> 02:53:19.060
that we know of that's not us,

02:53:19.060 --> 02:53:21.180
that doesn't have the ability to do something

02:53:21.180 --> 02:53:23.940
that's creative or constructive.

02:53:23.940 --> 02:53:27.260
I mean, I think that that's the answer

02:53:27.260 --> 02:53:29.860
and I think that our science really tells us

02:53:29.860 --> 02:53:30.820
that that's the answer.

02:53:30.820 --> 02:53:33.140
And I think it beckons us with ideas,

02:53:33.140 --> 02:53:36.660
like we know that things happen outside of space and time,

02:53:36.660 --> 02:53:37.500
right?

02:53:37.500 --> 02:53:38.340
I mean, they're physics experiments, right?

02:53:38.340 --> 02:53:40.740
Like we know this from the science of it,

02:53:40.740 --> 02:53:42.740
yet we don't stop and look and say, wait,

02:53:42.740 --> 02:53:44.780
is that the magic of the idea?

02:53:44.780 --> 02:53:47.700
Einstein said, God doesn't play dice with the universe.

02:53:47.700 --> 02:53:51.300
And I think, okay, maybe God doesn't play dice

02:53:51.300 --> 02:53:52.140
with the universe.

02:53:52.140 --> 02:53:54.140
That quantum indeterminacy and all of that

02:53:54.140 --> 02:53:56.620
is not just a flip of the coin, so to speak.

02:53:56.620 --> 02:53:59.980
But maybe it's in that indeterminacy

02:53:59.980 --> 02:54:03.980
that we're given the opportunity to assert ourselves, right?

02:54:03.980 --> 02:54:06.420
To make something one way or another.

02:54:06.420 --> 02:54:08.820
Maybe it's not God playing dice with the universe,

02:54:08.820 --> 02:54:11.540
but it's God loading the dice in our favor

02:54:11.540 --> 02:54:14.260
if we'll only listen to truth.

02:54:14.260 --> 02:54:15.860
The truth that being destructive

02:54:15.860 --> 02:54:17.300
doesn't help or soothe anything,

02:54:17.300 --> 02:54:19.740
even in the person who thinks it will for themselves.

02:54:19.740 --> 02:54:22.060
And that creativity and generativeness

02:54:22.060 --> 02:54:24.860
and kindness and compassion, like this is,

02:54:24.860 --> 02:54:26.220
doesn't that seem sort of analogous

02:54:26.220 --> 02:54:27.900
to the eddy current of counterentropy

02:54:27.900 --> 02:54:29.940
that has us here in the first place?

02:54:29.940 --> 02:54:32.540
And I think that's where I pin meaning.

02:54:32.540 --> 02:54:33.860
And that meaning then,

02:54:33.860 --> 02:54:35.740
going back to the initial question, right,

02:54:35.740 --> 02:54:38.860
is generated in us through emotion,

02:54:38.860 --> 02:54:40.820
through what we feel that leads us to feel something

02:54:40.820 --> 02:54:43.660
that is mysterious, because I don't know why I feel it.

02:54:43.660 --> 02:54:46.460
Yeah, in some sense, emotion is kind of the fuel

02:54:46.460 --> 02:54:48.940
of that creative imperative we have.

02:54:48.940 --> 02:54:52.860
But if you step back and look at the tapestry a little bit,

02:54:52.860 --> 02:54:54.740
it does seem that the destruction,

02:54:54.740 --> 02:54:55.980
the creation of the destruction

02:54:55.980 --> 02:54:58.700
are the yin and yang of life.

02:54:58.700 --> 02:55:03.420
That it all works only if the main engine

02:55:03.420 --> 02:55:05.060
is towards creativity.

02:55:05.060 --> 02:55:10.060
But destruction also makes way for new things.

02:55:10.460 --> 02:55:13.780
So that's this kind of struggle.

02:55:13.780 --> 02:55:15.740
It seems like life is struggle

02:55:15.740 --> 02:55:16.820
between the different forces

02:55:16.820 --> 02:55:18.460
that make up the individual human,

02:55:18.460 --> 02:55:19.500
that make up society.

02:55:19.500 --> 02:55:23.420
All these tensions are necessary for growth,

02:55:23.420 --> 02:55:26.660
for development, this kind of inner conflict

02:55:26.660 --> 02:55:29.980
and outer conflict are necessary for growth.

02:55:29.980 --> 02:55:33.180
It's not just, I mean, in some sense,

02:55:33.180 --> 02:55:34.460
it's from the logic aspect,

02:55:34.460 --> 02:55:37.940
you kind of want everything to be perfect and just.

02:55:37.980 --> 02:55:40.540
For nobody to suffer, for everything to be perfect.

02:55:40.540 --> 02:55:42.060
But just like we talked about with trauma,

02:55:42.060 --> 02:55:45.460
it just seems like it's such a big, giant mess.

02:55:45.460 --> 02:55:46.300
What is it?

02:55:46.300 --> 02:55:48.980
Bukowski said, fine, would you love and let it kill you?

02:55:49.980 --> 02:55:53.380
There's some aspect of, the negative aspect

02:55:53.380 --> 02:55:55.260
of passion and pursuit and obsession

02:55:55.260 --> 02:56:00.260
and the turmoil of the pursuit of happiness,

02:56:03.340 --> 02:56:05.260
of the creative pursuits and all of that.

02:56:05.260 --> 02:56:07.900
I mean, that's part of life as well.

02:56:08.860 --> 02:56:10.500
I don't know what to do with that

02:56:11.700 --> 02:56:13.700
from an individual perspective

02:56:13.700 --> 02:56:16.620
in terms of figuring out how do you live a good life?

02:56:16.620 --> 02:56:18.300
How do you live a healthy life?

02:56:18.300 --> 02:56:21.260
Because it does seem that a bit of hardship

02:56:21.260 --> 02:56:23.580
or sometimes a lot of hardship

02:56:23.580 --> 02:56:25.940
can make a pretty interesting life.

02:56:25.940 --> 02:56:28.380
I think it brings us back to the discussion

02:56:28.380 --> 02:56:31.220
that we were having before about what does it mean,

02:56:31.220 --> 02:56:34.100
like the challenges of trauma and of overcoming.

02:56:34.100 --> 02:56:36.820
And I think here we gotta be careful with the language

02:56:36.820 --> 02:56:40.780
because I would then say, let's take destruction

02:56:40.780 --> 02:56:43.420
and separate it into two things.

02:56:43.420 --> 02:56:47.100
One is, you say destruction is like the breaking down,

02:56:47.100 --> 02:56:48.940
the tearing down of something

02:56:48.940 --> 02:56:53.660
versus a process that has malice in it.

02:56:53.660 --> 02:56:56.980
So just like when we were talking about trauma

02:56:56.980 --> 02:56:59.900
and the setbacks, things to overcome.

02:56:59.900 --> 02:57:00.980
We might say, okay, if you say,

02:57:00.980 --> 02:57:03.020
hey, you have it harder than the next person

02:57:03.020 --> 02:57:04.980
and you have more to overcome

02:57:04.980 --> 02:57:07.020
or someone put a barrier in front of you

02:57:07.020 --> 02:57:08.660
for you to overcome,

02:57:08.660 --> 02:57:10.380
that there can be a lot of growth in that

02:57:10.380 --> 02:57:12.100
including the times when you don't know if you,

02:57:12.100 --> 02:57:13.260
gosh, can I do this, right?

02:57:13.260 --> 02:57:14.940
Can I get over it, right?

02:57:14.940 --> 02:57:17.900
We're saying like that's challenge

02:57:17.900 --> 02:57:19.980
and something to overcome that's very positive.

02:57:19.980 --> 02:57:21.660
But we're saying, but there's no benefit

02:57:21.660 --> 02:57:24.220
of like throwing a racial slur in there, right?

02:57:24.220 --> 02:57:25.940
We're saying, because that's all bad.

02:57:25.940 --> 02:57:27.140
Like that's not, even the person says,

02:57:27.140 --> 02:57:29.220
I'm angry about that and I'm gonna overcome that.

02:57:29.220 --> 02:57:30.180
It's like, that didn't need to be,

02:57:30.180 --> 02:57:31.740
that didn't make anything better.

02:57:31.740 --> 02:57:33.260
If the person sees that and says,

02:57:33.660 --> 02:57:38.060
I'm gonna overcome that, it makes things less worse, right?

02:57:38.060 --> 02:57:40.500
But there's no good to something

02:57:40.500 --> 02:57:42.260
that's created as destructive.

02:57:42.260 --> 02:57:45.220
We might look at forest fires, like, look, controlled burns.

02:57:45.220 --> 02:57:46.820
You say, there's a forest burning down,

02:57:46.820 --> 02:57:50.260
but that's, okay, there's some we could say destruction there.

02:57:50.260 --> 02:57:51.700
There's a tearing down there,

02:57:51.700 --> 02:57:53.700
but it's in the service of the next fire

02:57:53.700 --> 02:57:55.380
not running through the community,

02:57:55.380 --> 02:57:57.100
the town that's on the other side of it.

02:57:57.100 --> 02:57:59.340
That's very different than a forest fire,

02:57:59.340 --> 02:58:01.300
say, started by arson, right?

02:58:01.300 --> 02:58:03.020
So you might say, they're both a tearing down.

02:58:03.020 --> 02:58:04.820
They're a tearing down of the forest.

02:58:04.820 --> 02:58:06.900
But one is in the service of goodness,

02:58:06.900 --> 02:58:09.300
even though it's hurting the animals and the plants,

02:58:09.300 --> 02:58:10.780
it's not all good, right?

02:58:10.780 --> 02:58:12.700
But it's in the service of something,

02:58:12.700 --> 02:58:15.420
as opposed to something else that's wantonly destructive.

02:58:15.420 --> 02:58:17.580
I think there's no good to the racial slur.

02:58:17.580 --> 02:58:19.380
There's no good to the arson, right?

02:58:19.380 --> 02:58:22.060
That's destruction in a way that's incorporating,

02:58:22.060 --> 02:58:24.020
I think, the malice of envy,

02:58:24.020 --> 02:58:26.500
that, you know, something that's really purely,

02:58:26.500 --> 02:58:30.060
if there's a yin and yang, that's the destructive.

02:58:30.060 --> 02:58:31.300
That's the badness end.

02:58:31.300 --> 02:58:36.260
So racial slurs is a surface wave of a deeper thing.

02:58:36.260 --> 02:58:39.900
And so, I mean, the reason I bring that up is like,

02:58:39.900 --> 02:58:42.860
all right, well, you have these discussions of censorship.

02:58:42.860 --> 02:58:46.300
What good does allowing racial slurs

02:58:46.300 --> 02:58:49.340
in public communication do, right?

02:58:49.340 --> 02:58:52.140
And it's like, our communication would surely be better

02:58:52.140 --> 02:58:54.180
if we don't say bad things to each other.

02:58:54.180 --> 02:58:58.500
But it's like, it seems like the truth is

02:58:58.500 --> 02:59:00.020
our communication will be better

02:59:00.020 --> 02:59:02.060
if the amount of bad things

02:59:02.060 --> 02:59:04.980
is a small fraction of communication.

02:59:04.980 --> 02:59:06.780
That seems to be more true.

02:59:06.780 --> 02:59:09.860
Because another aspect of human nature with power,

02:59:09.860 --> 02:59:13.620
the moment you start censoring and removing bad words

02:59:13.620 --> 02:59:15.980
that everyone agrees are bad words,

02:59:15.980 --> 02:59:19.220
then the people at the top, they're doing the censoring,

02:59:19.220 --> 02:59:20.660
start getting greedy.

02:59:20.660 --> 02:59:22.340
It starts expanding.

02:59:22.340 --> 02:59:25.380
And this is the giant mess of human civilization,

02:59:25.380 --> 02:59:28.420
where we can't, the nice piles you created

02:59:28.500 --> 02:59:29.660
are kind of overlapping piles.

02:59:29.660 --> 02:59:32.060
It's a gray area.

02:59:32.060 --> 02:59:33.740
That's the problem with it.

02:59:33.740 --> 02:59:34.860
No, I agree completely.

02:59:34.860 --> 02:59:36.540
There's a control of language.

02:59:36.540 --> 02:59:37.740
There are slippery slopes there.

02:59:37.740 --> 02:59:40.820
I think there's a very big problem there.

02:59:40.820 --> 02:59:41.900
So I agree.

02:59:41.900 --> 02:59:44.820
I think, again, split parsing out the language.

02:59:44.820 --> 02:59:47.420
I'm not saying, hey, we shouldn't have racial slurs

02:59:47.420 --> 02:59:49.060
as if like, let's stop saying the words.

02:59:49.060 --> 02:59:52.580
I mean, the idea is the premise behind it, right?

02:59:52.580 --> 02:59:54.340
Like, the prejudices,

02:59:54.340 --> 02:59:57.180
if we could eliminate the prejudice behind it.

02:59:57.180 --> 03:00:00.820
I was struck, I said, I do almost nothing about medicine.

03:00:00.820 --> 03:00:04.020
I get to medical school and start with anatomy, right?

03:00:04.020 --> 03:00:06.300
And it's remarkable as, you know,

03:00:06.300 --> 03:00:09.620
to see as the bodies are being dissected

03:00:09.620 --> 03:00:11.300
that like we're all humans.

03:00:11.300 --> 03:00:15.620
Like, does it matter any of these things on the outside?

03:00:15.620 --> 03:00:19.100
Like, and that's true, not just like in our bodies,

03:00:19.100 --> 03:00:21.140
but in our minds and the part of the person

03:00:21.140 --> 03:00:22.140
that's not there, right?

03:00:22.140 --> 03:00:24.020
Because now we're trying to learn from the body.

03:00:24.020 --> 03:00:27.660
And, you know, it shows how ridiculous it is.

03:00:27.660 --> 03:00:29.300
If you think that we're 99.

03:00:29.300 --> 03:00:32.060
How many nines, you know, percent all alike genetically.

03:00:32.060 --> 03:00:34.380
And by the way, it's only like take another 10th off

03:00:34.380 --> 03:00:36.340
and we're all orangutans, right?

03:00:36.340 --> 03:00:40.740
But somehow we have to see these differences between us,

03:00:40.740 --> 03:00:41.580
right?

03:00:41.580 --> 03:00:42.740
And where does that come from?

03:00:42.740 --> 03:00:46.100
And I think that I believe that all comes from envy

03:00:46.100 --> 03:00:47.300
in that classical sense.

03:00:47.300 --> 03:00:49.340
That if I don't feel good enough,

03:00:49.340 --> 03:00:51.980
I'm gonna want someone to feel better about.

03:00:52.020 --> 03:00:54.140
And so there can be visual things

03:00:54.140 --> 03:00:56.740
that that person looks different, right?

03:00:56.740 --> 03:00:59.420
Or you think about the, you know,

03:00:59.420 --> 03:01:01.260
I spent some time in Great Britain

03:01:01.260 --> 03:01:03.660
and when there's a lot of conflict

03:01:03.660 --> 03:01:05.540
between Northern Ireland and Ireland, right?

03:01:05.540 --> 03:01:08.220
And you thought, wow, there's not even a look difference,

03:01:08.220 --> 03:01:09.060
right?

03:01:09.060 --> 03:01:11.580
It's the same general religious umbrella,

03:01:11.580 --> 03:01:12.740
same ethnicity, right?

03:01:12.740 --> 03:01:14.500
But now there's some religious difference.

03:01:14.500 --> 03:01:17.140
And I thought, it's not me trying to be denigrating,

03:01:17.140 --> 03:01:18.580
you know, around the Irish conflict.

03:01:18.580 --> 03:01:20.220
It's like, that's human of,

03:01:20.220 --> 03:01:22.260
oh, there's no actual difference between us.

03:01:22.260 --> 03:01:25.620
If I don't feel good about myself, I'm gonna find one, right?

03:01:25.620 --> 03:01:30.180
It's that that I believe could go away.

03:01:30.180 --> 03:01:32.980
It's driven by maybe the trauma of just being alive

03:01:32.980 --> 03:01:34.740
in the world and things can happen to us,

03:01:34.740 --> 03:01:38.660
but we certainly promote in the human created trauma,

03:01:38.660 --> 03:01:41.300
people feeling not good enough, finding differences.

03:01:41.300 --> 03:01:43.220
There's a place for the envy to attach

03:01:43.220 --> 03:01:46.460
and we're off to the races of, you know, wars.

03:01:46.460 --> 03:01:47.980
I mean, we're talking about the second world war

03:01:47.980 --> 03:01:50.260
and we think, well, what have we learned since then?

03:01:50.260 --> 03:01:53.100
It would take us a day to map out all the wars since then,

03:01:53.100 --> 03:01:53.940
right?

03:01:53.940 --> 03:01:55.300
Let alone, for goodness sakes,

03:01:55.300 --> 03:01:57.260
everything that's salient right now.

03:01:57.260 --> 03:01:59.780
So we're not pretty, we're not good at learning

03:01:59.780 --> 03:02:03.260
from what seemed to be some very salient lessons.

03:02:05.260 --> 03:02:08.380
I should mention one thing is that I also know

03:02:08.380 --> 03:02:11.580
that you're interested in Russian culture a little bit.

03:02:11.580 --> 03:02:12.420
Yes.

03:02:13.620 --> 03:02:17.780
Churchill said, I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia.

03:02:18.460 --> 03:02:20.620
It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.

03:02:20.620 --> 03:02:23.780
So what do you or some interesting differences

03:02:23.780 --> 03:02:28.780
between this Eastern part of the world of Russia, Ukraine,

03:02:29.580 --> 03:02:32.020
the Slavic countries, the former Soviet Union,

03:02:32.020 --> 03:02:35.060
all of that versus sort of the US culture?

03:02:35.060 --> 03:02:37.100
What stands out to you from the literature,

03:02:37.100 --> 03:02:40.940
from the music, from the science, all that kind of stuff?

03:02:40.940 --> 03:02:44.820
I think there's so much intensity,

03:02:44.820 --> 03:02:49.460
intensity, and I guess I would say fearlessness

03:02:49.460 --> 03:02:54.460
of expression that I see in a Slavic culture,

03:02:55.540 --> 03:02:58.420
maybe it's across cultures,

03:02:58.420 --> 03:03:00.420
because there's a different way that expression occurs.

03:03:00.420 --> 03:03:02.980
We say like, oh, it's different in the French

03:03:02.980 --> 03:03:05.660
than the Spanish or is different than in parts of Africa.

03:03:05.660 --> 03:03:08.260
And I think when you take that part of the world

03:03:08.260 --> 03:03:10.860
for whatever reason, and maybe it's just totally random,

03:03:10.860 --> 03:03:13.420
or maybe it's aspects of geography

03:03:13.420 --> 03:03:17.020
and experience and migration, but there's such an intensity.

03:03:17.020 --> 03:03:21.380
And I remember listening to Tchaikovsky very early on,

03:03:21.380 --> 03:03:23.660
maybe not for the very first time, but early on in my life,

03:03:23.660 --> 03:03:26.940
or reading Dostoyevsky and feeling like,

03:03:26.940 --> 03:03:30.940
oh, Dostoyevsky's willingness, his ability,

03:03:30.940 --> 03:03:35.500
and his willingness to express and create

03:03:35.500 --> 03:03:40.060
such powerful aberrant states of human experience.

03:03:40.060 --> 03:03:43.380
Tchaikovsky in his music, the depths of suffering

03:03:44.380 --> 03:03:47.060
that it expresses, has always stood out to me

03:03:48.860 --> 03:03:52.020
as a way that if that's the brightest light,

03:03:52.020 --> 03:03:54.020
so to speak, communicating information,

03:03:54.020 --> 03:03:56.140
that that's a place to look.

03:03:56.140 --> 03:03:59.780
And it's also a place that resonated with me so strongly

03:03:59.780 --> 03:04:03.420
because I think for some people who are informative years

03:04:03.420 --> 03:04:05.780
and having very difficult feelings, right?

03:04:05.780 --> 03:04:07.860
I have a depth of feeling of fear

03:04:07.860 --> 03:04:09.500
and how's the world gonna be?

03:04:09.500 --> 03:04:10.900
Am I gonna be annihilated?

03:04:10.900 --> 03:04:11.900
What do I even want?

03:04:11.900 --> 03:04:13.740
What do I feel inside of me?

03:04:13.740 --> 03:04:18.220
To encounter that being expressed so intensely,

03:04:18.220 --> 03:04:21.180
I found to be very, very moving.

03:04:21.180 --> 03:04:22.820
So I don't know if that's a good answer or not,

03:04:22.820 --> 03:04:24.900
but I think there's an intensity of expression

03:04:24.900 --> 03:04:26.180
and a fearlessness.

03:04:26.180 --> 03:04:29.260
Dostoyevsky wrote about terrible things.

03:04:29.260 --> 03:04:30.940
What happens in the person?

03:04:30.940 --> 03:04:34.300
Is there a person who is brilliant intellectually

03:04:34.300 --> 03:04:39.180
and very persuasive and very capable of being effective

03:04:39.220 --> 03:04:42.860
who also just chooses to be a child rapist, right?

03:04:42.860 --> 03:04:44.380
I mean, he wrote about that.

03:04:44.380 --> 03:04:48.980
He wrote about the truth of this is what we can be as humans.

03:04:48.980 --> 03:04:52.460
And I think there's so many lessons, including the truth.

03:04:52.460 --> 03:04:53.460
Like people will tend to think,

03:04:53.460 --> 03:04:56.340
oh, evil's not very bright or not very intelligent.

03:04:56.340 --> 03:04:58.740
That's a way to let evil propagate, right?

03:04:58.740 --> 03:05:03.740
Evil can be effective and attractive and very compelling,

03:05:04.300 --> 03:05:05.500
but evil nonetheless.

03:05:05.500 --> 03:05:08.260
And I just think there's a fearless willingness

03:05:08.460 --> 03:05:10.180
to look at that and to describe it

03:05:10.180 --> 03:05:14.180
that I see primarily I've studied in Russian culture.

03:05:14.180 --> 03:05:18.780
Yeah, the fearless exploration of this whole human drama,

03:05:18.780 --> 03:05:21.460
definitely Dostoyevsky and others since in the 20th century

03:05:21.460 --> 03:05:24.340
and the 19th century have done an incredible job of that.

03:05:24.340 --> 03:05:25.540
Some of that, just like you said,

03:05:25.540 --> 03:05:27.260
is the language, the culture.

03:05:27.260 --> 03:05:30.420
I think that intense romanticism is there

03:05:30.420 --> 03:05:35.340
that is almost an overdramatic exploration

03:05:35.340 --> 03:05:37.140
of human nature.

03:05:38.100 --> 03:05:41.460
It can err on the side or falter

03:05:41.460 --> 03:05:45.700
when it goes into a kind of cynical view of life.

03:05:45.700 --> 03:05:47.420
Life is suffering.

03:05:47.420 --> 03:05:49.860
I think that also has to do with the way you deal

03:05:49.860 --> 03:05:52.820
with the trauma of the world wars and so on.

03:05:52.820 --> 03:05:55.060
This is something the different nations throughout Europe

03:05:55.060 --> 03:05:57.140
had to deal with that in different ways.

03:05:57.140 --> 03:05:59.420
Some of them have channeled into envy and resentment.

03:05:59.420 --> 03:06:03.260
Some of them channeled into a kind of nihilism

03:06:03.260 --> 03:06:08.020
or a cynicism and ultimately,

03:06:08.020 --> 03:06:09.620
the intensity of feeling is there,

03:06:09.620 --> 03:06:12.460
which is sort of interesting to see

03:06:12.460 --> 03:06:14.100
and interesting how that manifests itself

03:06:14.100 --> 03:06:18.900
in the kind of governments it builds up.

03:06:18.900 --> 03:06:23.900
There's more authoritarianism in that part of the world

03:06:24.780 --> 03:06:27.060
versus the Western world that's more focused

03:06:27.060 --> 03:06:29.180
on the individual versus the collective

03:06:29.180 --> 03:06:31.100
and when more focused on the individual,

03:06:31.260 --> 03:06:34.180
you have a propensity to value individual rights

03:06:34.180 --> 03:06:35.660
with democracy and so on.

03:06:35.660 --> 03:06:37.220
It's interesting to watch and yeah,

03:06:37.220 --> 03:06:40.020
to reconstruct how that all came to be.

03:06:40.020 --> 03:06:42.820
Is it in the blood?

03:06:42.820 --> 03:06:44.460
Is it in the mind?

03:06:44.460 --> 03:06:47.980
Is it in some kind of thing that more ethereal,

03:06:47.980 --> 03:06:50.300
a collective set of ideas that we pass from generation

03:06:50.300 --> 03:06:52.660
to generation between each other,

03:06:52.660 --> 03:06:54.860
sort of the collective of it?

03:06:54.860 --> 03:06:57.660
Yeah, it's fascinating to see,

03:06:57.660 --> 03:07:00.620
but now reinvigorated because there's conflict

03:07:00.620 --> 03:07:01.980
in that part of the world.

03:07:02.860 --> 03:07:06.060
You've also thought about the Cold War.

03:07:06.060 --> 03:07:09.060
What lessons about the human mind,

03:07:09.060 --> 03:07:10.820
about psychiatry, psychology,

03:07:11.860 --> 03:07:14.340
and about looking at the Cold War,

03:07:15.500 --> 03:07:18.140
can we take forward in the 21st century

03:07:18.140 --> 03:07:22.220
so that we can avoid World War III,

03:07:22.220 --> 03:07:27.220
a major cold or hot war in the 21st century?

03:07:27.820 --> 03:07:32.820
I think unspoken animosities are very, very, very dangerous.

03:07:32.820 --> 03:07:34.540
It was a Cold War.

03:07:34.540 --> 03:07:38.340
There was fighting through proxies.

03:07:38.340 --> 03:07:42.500
The superpowers were fighting surrogate wars through proxies,

03:07:42.500 --> 03:07:46.140
which of course in and of itself causes immense suffering,

03:07:46.140 --> 03:07:51.140
but it becomes the opposite of an exchange of ideas

03:07:51.420 --> 03:07:53.060
or an exchange of thought.

03:07:53.060 --> 03:07:55.100
You know, maybe even Khrushchev,

03:07:55.100 --> 03:07:57.740
not believing that the kitchen could look like it did

03:07:57.740 --> 03:07:59.060
at the World's Fair, right?

03:07:59.060 --> 03:08:02.100
And some of the misconceptions here

03:08:02.100 --> 03:08:04.500
of like what things were like in Russia, right?

03:08:04.500 --> 03:08:05.980
It was an utter,

03:08:05.980 --> 03:08:08.140
it was a thought that those other people

03:08:08.140 --> 03:08:09.700
are not actually people, right?

03:08:09.700 --> 03:08:12.420
There's an enemy society of evil,

03:08:12.420 --> 03:08:14.660
which then paints with a broad brush

03:08:14.660 --> 03:08:18.060
in a way that makes it too easy for the Cold War,

03:08:18.060 --> 03:08:20.340
the war to go from being cold, right,

03:08:20.340 --> 03:08:23.660
to boiling over into utter destruction.

03:08:23.660 --> 03:08:27.220
And, you know, I wrote, it was really a true story

03:08:27.220 --> 03:08:31.500
that when I was in, it was still the Soviet Union,

03:08:31.500 --> 03:08:33.580
but it was right around the time of the Soviet Union

03:08:33.580 --> 03:08:34.420
coming to an end,

03:08:34.420 --> 03:08:39.420
and I had gone on a trip for students from England,

03:08:39.860 --> 03:08:42.420
and we got to go places that people hadn't gone.

03:08:42.420 --> 03:08:45.700
You know, foreigners hadn't gone in many, many years.

03:08:45.700 --> 03:08:48.780
It was just kind of the right timing to experience that.

03:08:48.780 --> 03:08:52.740
And like it really is true that someone set on short notice

03:08:52.740 --> 03:08:55.220
to these poor kids that like

03:08:55.220 --> 03:08:57.060
these group of Americans were coming,

03:08:57.060 --> 03:09:00.580
and I have a picture somewhere of the kid in a gas mask.

03:09:00.580 --> 03:09:03.500
Like they went under their desks and put on a gas mask,

03:09:03.500 --> 03:09:06.300
and they thought, right, that's what,

03:09:06.300 --> 03:09:09.620
I mean, that's what they're taught to think about us,

03:09:09.620 --> 03:09:11.460
and we're taught to think about them.

03:09:11.460 --> 03:09:15.540
And like now we're back in an us them, right?

03:09:15.540 --> 03:09:18.360
When, you know, we're all trying to survive,

03:09:18.360 --> 03:09:20.840
and we're all such, you know,

03:09:20.840 --> 03:09:25.120
human life is so delicate, right?

03:09:25.120 --> 03:09:27.240
You know, let alone human happiness,

03:09:27.240 --> 03:09:29.040
and we make these divisions,

03:09:29.040 --> 03:09:31.560
and we create this aggression and latent aggression.

03:09:31.560 --> 03:09:33.200
We do the Cold War, we developed, right,

03:09:33.200 --> 03:09:35.400
the ability to destroy the earth, right?

03:09:35.400 --> 03:09:37.680
And then just sat looking at one another, you know,

03:09:37.680 --> 03:09:40.320
with further growing misunderstanding

03:09:40.320 --> 03:09:42.720
and the opportunity for the proxy fights,

03:09:42.720 --> 03:09:44.840
like when they say the Cuban Missile Crisis,

03:09:44.840 --> 03:09:46.000
which I know wasn't a war,

03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:47.240
but it's an aspect of that, right?

03:09:47.240 --> 03:09:50.680
Where we just have ourselves wildly, you know,

03:09:50.680 --> 03:09:54.680
at risk of destruction without any mutual understanding.

03:09:54.680 --> 03:09:57.640
And again, I would argue that that is the opposite

03:09:57.640 --> 03:09:59.480
of the counter entropy, right?

03:09:59.480 --> 03:10:01.080
Like we are setting everything up

03:10:01.080 --> 03:10:03.140
for less lack of communication, lack of understanding.

03:10:03.140 --> 03:10:07.920
How do those feelings of love and shared humanness happen?

03:10:07.920 --> 03:10:08.800
They don't, right?

03:10:08.800 --> 03:10:10.500
If you separate people,

03:10:10.500 --> 03:10:13.560
and then we push ourselves more and more and more

03:10:13.560 --> 03:10:16.000
towards reinstating the state of entropy

03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:18.160
that's present in the rest of the universe.

03:10:19.160 --> 03:10:21.360
What advice would you give to young people

03:10:23.360 --> 03:10:25.720
that are fighting entropy with all their might?

03:10:26.840 --> 03:10:30.640
So young people and people that are wondering

03:10:30.640 --> 03:10:32.680
how to find their way in life,

03:10:32.680 --> 03:10:35.920
what advice would you give how to have a career,

03:10:35.920 --> 03:10:38.280
how to have a life they can be proud of?

03:10:39.360 --> 03:10:43.840
I think starting off with sort of first principles,

03:10:43.880 --> 03:10:46.240
I'm like, okay, what are my values, right?

03:10:46.240 --> 03:10:47.540
How do I wanna live life?

03:10:47.540 --> 03:10:49.800
Because, you know, I'm in my early 50s,

03:10:49.800 --> 03:10:52.320
and when I was a kid, you know, we waited for the,

03:10:52.320 --> 03:10:53.920
the newspaper came in the afternoon,

03:10:53.920 --> 03:10:55.880
and then, you know, and then we'd see something,

03:10:55.880 --> 03:10:57.040
okay, what's going on in the world?

03:10:57.040 --> 03:10:57.880
We'd learn something.

03:10:57.880 --> 03:11:00.200
I'd get the West Coast baseball scores, right?

03:11:00.200 --> 03:11:02.640
Right, and learn about, oh, here's what happened

03:11:02.640 --> 03:11:04.280
in different parts of the world.

03:11:04.280 --> 03:11:06.920
And by and large, I and everyone else there,

03:11:06.920 --> 03:11:10.980
adult or child, were like living in a reality

03:11:10.980 --> 03:11:13.000
that was largely, our conception was largely

03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:14.960
what was around us, right?

03:11:14.960 --> 03:11:17.720
And now, in many ways, it is, I'm not saying

03:11:17.720 --> 03:11:19.120
it's entirely negative, of course,

03:11:19.120 --> 03:11:20.140
that we have more information,

03:11:20.140 --> 03:11:22.720
we can sort of think globally, so to speak, right?

03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:25.440
But the other side of that is so much

03:11:25.440 --> 03:11:29.600
of the world's problems are on us all the time, right?

03:11:29.600 --> 03:11:31.400
Like, here's this awful thing that happened,

03:11:31.400 --> 03:11:33.080
how many awful things happen each day,

03:11:33.080 --> 03:11:34.760
and they're right in front of us,

03:11:34.760 --> 03:11:37.760
and there's such an immediacy to it all

03:11:37.760 --> 03:11:40.280
that I think it can be, it can like paralyze us

03:11:40.280 --> 03:11:41.640
with terror, right?

03:11:41.640 --> 03:11:44.960
And for someone who's young and trying to make their way,

03:11:44.960 --> 03:11:46.880
it's like, how do you figure your way out in this world

03:11:46.880 --> 03:11:49.200
that your word isn't even gonna exist, right?

03:11:49.200 --> 03:11:51.320
And then you see how profligate

03:11:51.320 --> 03:11:54.360
the generations before you are, right?

03:11:54.360 --> 03:11:57.400
In so many ways, and there can become,

03:11:57.400 --> 03:11:58.920
I think, a push towards extremes,

03:11:58.920 --> 03:12:03.400
either nihilism or I'm gonna change everything, right?

03:12:03.400 --> 03:12:05.720
And it's like, how about, let's start from,

03:12:05.720 --> 03:12:08.600
how do I wanna behave in my own community, right?

03:12:08.600 --> 03:12:09.820
Which starts with like, how do I wanna behave

03:12:09.820 --> 03:12:11.200
in my household, right?

03:12:11.200 --> 03:12:12.400
What kind of neighbor do I wanna be?

03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:14.000
I mean, it might seem like things like that

03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:17.400
are silly or small in comparison to the big things,

03:12:17.400 --> 03:12:18.600
but I don't think they are.

03:12:18.600 --> 03:12:22.080
I think that's how we start building foundations

03:12:22.080 --> 03:12:24.640
that lets us tackle the big things.

03:12:24.640 --> 03:12:27.280
And then I do find myself saying, when I'm working with,

03:12:27.280 --> 03:12:29.600
sometimes doing therapy with younger people,

03:12:29.600 --> 03:12:33.880
of helping them kind of bring back their thoughts,

03:12:33.880 --> 03:12:37.240
their strivings, their decisions more to themselves,

03:12:37.240 --> 03:12:40.440
and living with and around themselves more

03:12:40.480 --> 03:12:44.560
instead of in something that becomes very theoretical

03:12:44.560 --> 03:12:48.560
and therefore very threatening and unnerving.

03:12:48.560 --> 03:12:50.160
So focusing on the people around them,

03:12:50.160 --> 03:12:52.400
taking one small step at a time

03:12:52.400 --> 03:12:56.120
to form deeper connections, to build something locally.

03:12:57.040 --> 03:12:57.960
How do I wanna be today?

03:12:57.960 --> 03:12:59.560
If I go into the grocery store

03:12:59.560 --> 03:13:01.960
and the person in front of me drops something,

03:13:01.960 --> 03:13:04.600
I can scowl, because I'm in a rush, right?

03:13:04.600 --> 03:13:06.480
And I could be like that, right?

03:13:06.480 --> 03:13:07.300
I can be like that.

03:13:07.300 --> 03:13:09.220
I've been that way many, many times in my life, right?

03:13:09.220 --> 03:13:11.340
And it's never done anyone a damn bit of good,

03:13:11.340 --> 03:13:12.580
including me, right?

03:13:12.580 --> 03:13:15.100
Or I can realize, like the 10 seconds aren't gonna matter.

03:13:15.100 --> 03:13:17.420
Can I help pick that thing up or just smile?

03:13:17.420 --> 03:13:19.500
These are the seemingly small things

03:13:19.500 --> 03:13:22.580
that I think make the tenor of our lives.

03:13:22.580 --> 03:13:25.740
Yeah, I moved, I think I mentioned to you offline,

03:13:25.740 --> 03:13:30.740
one of the, really the main reason I moved to Austin, Texas.

03:13:31.060 --> 03:13:34.260
I just remember deciding it when I went to Walmart

03:13:34.260 --> 03:13:39.260
and a lady said, you look handsome in that tie,

03:13:39.620 --> 03:13:42.020
or in that suit and tie, whatever.

03:13:42.020 --> 03:13:43.700
Like, I don't think anyone's ever,

03:13:43.700 --> 03:13:45.300
it's an older lady, she was very sweet,

03:13:45.300 --> 03:13:46.260
there's kindness in her eyes.

03:13:46.260 --> 03:13:48.260
She said that, I don't think anyone ever said anything

03:13:48.260 --> 03:13:51.260
like that to me in my entire life.

03:13:51.260 --> 03:13:54.340
And it was just, I don't know,

03:13:54.340 --> 03:13:56.500
it was like, wow, there's kindness in this world.

03:13:56.500 --> 03:13:58.260
I know it sounds ridiculous, but like-

03:13:58.260 --> 03:13:59.500
Does not sound ridiculous.

03:13:59.500 --> 03:14:02.260
It's like those, you could be that for somebody.

03:14:02.700 --> 03:14:04.380
Go walk around in Walmarts.

03:14:04.380 --> 03:14:06.180
Right, think about, you remember that?

03:14:06.180 --> 03:14:07.020
Yeah.

03:14:07.020 --> 03:14:09.260
And it's pivotal, you're citing it as,

03:14:09.260 --> 03:14:11.340
hey, that was a big part of me moving here.

03:14:11.340 --> 03:14:13.460
So think about the branch point in your life

03:14:13.460 --> 03:14:15.900
that comes from the simple kindness, right,

03:14:15.900 --> 03:14:18.540
of a person who had goodness to give, right,

03:14:18.540 --> 03:14:21.860
and wasn't scared that you're gonna be upset by it,

03:14:21.860 --> 03:14:22.700
or whatever, right?

03:14:22.700 --> 03:14:23.520
Took the risk.

03:14:23.520 --> 03:14:26.520
Right, right, she probably didn't have the thought

03:14:26.520 --> 03:14:28.320
that you could be a sailing, right?

03:14:28.320 --> 03:14:30.380
Probably she looks at you, she's got goodness to give,

03:14:30.380 --> 03:14:31.320
it's simple to give it.

03:14:31.320 --> 03:14:34.560
It's that simple, and it's beautiful,

03:14:34.560 --> 03:14:36.000
and it's worth more to you than like,

03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:37.160
how many studies would be on,

03:14:37.160 --> 03:14:39.040
where's the right to live, or this, or that?

03:14:39.040 --> 03:14:39.880
None of that matters.

03:14:39.880 --> 03:14:42.360
What mattered was the freedom to be kind.

03:14:42.360 --> 03:14:43.560
And that's emotion.

03:14:43.560 --> 03:14:44.800
That's not logic at all.

03:14:46.560 --> 03:14:48.160
That's purely just human emotion,

03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:49.800
and a little bit of humanness,

03:14:49.800 --> 03:14:51.960
that little bit of connection.

03:14:51.960 --> 03:14:54.960
And then that's what makes life great.

03:14:54.960 --> 03:14:56.680
Which is why it's not a bad idea, right,

03:14:56.680 --> 03:14:59.480
that you moved here that way, instead of,

03:14:59.640 --> 03:15:02.200
one could say, well, I can't believe you did that,

03:15:02.200 --> 03:15:04.480
instead of looking at all the data and hiring consultants

03:15:04.480 --> 03:15:05.720
of what's the best place to live.

03:15:05.720 --> 03:15:07.160
But that would be wrong, right?

03:15:07.160 --> 03:15:09.480
Like, you made a good decision, right?

03:15:09.480 --> 03:15:12.560
Like, that was good data, it was impactful data,

03:15:12.560 --> 03:15:15.280
even in your thoughts about how you're happy living here,

03:15:15.280 --> 03:15:17.240
right, it's not that, oh, you discount,

03:15:17.240 --> 03:15:20.480
you shortchange yourself by not relying on all the logic,

03:15:20.480 --> 03:15:22.560
right, you felt something about the place,

03:15:22.560 --> 03:15:24.880
and you felt it as symbolized in a person,

03:15:24.880 --> 03:15:26.680
and that made the choice for you.

03:15:26.680 --> 03:15:28.080
It's a balance, of course,

03:15:28.080 --> 03:15:30.680
but you also have to know yourself a little bit.

03:15:30.680 --> 03:15:33.280
Sometimes you can find stability and comfort

03:15:33.280 --> 03:15:36.800
in kind of reasoning things out a little bit.

03:15:36.800 --> 03:15:41.320
Maybe, as people close to me have sometimes criticized

03:15:41.320 --> 03:15:44.120
in that I'm a little bit too romantic,

03:15:44.120 --> 03:15:46.560
where I'll just follow the feeling.

03:15:46.560 --> 03:15:50.280
And, you know, life, you know, there's physics,

03:15:50.280 --> 03:15:52.320
there's a reality to this world,

03:15:52.320 --> 03:15:57.320
and sometimes reality doesn't allow you to flourish

03:15:58.800 --> 03:16:00.160
if you just follow your feelings,

03:16:00.160 --> 03:16:02.120
but there's a dance there,

03:16:02.120 --> 03:16:05.680
and happiness is ultimately found in that landscape

03:16:05.680 --> 03:16:10.680
of feeling and emotion versus facts and reason and logic.

03:16:11.320 --> 03:16:12.920
Because you said have their place, right?

03:16:12.920 --> 03:16:13.760
Everything, yeah.

03:16:13.760 --> 03:16:15.160
They have their place,

03:16:15.160 --> 03:16:17.000
but they're not to be all in and all.

03:16:18.520 --> 03:16:20.400
You're an incredible person.

03:16:20.400 --> 03:16:22.160
Andrew Huberman is a friend of yours,

03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:24.520
he said you absolutely must talk,

03:16:26.040 --> 03:16:29.080
Carl Dyseroth, the number of people you know,

03:16:29.080 --> 03:16:30.320
they're just incredible people.

03:16:30.320 --> 03:16:32.800
There's just this group of folks

03:16:32.800 --> 03:16:36.000
that somehow helped each other flourish and grew together.

03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:38.440
And I'm just, I'm so happy you exist.

03:16:38.440 --> 03:16:40.440
I'm so happy you're doing the work you're doing.

03:16:40.440 --> 03:16:42.120
I can't wait for your second book.

03:16:42.120 --> 03:16:42.960
Thank you.

03:16:42.960 --> 03:16:44.120
And thank you for talking today.

03:16:44.120 --> 03:16:45.240
This was really cool.

03:16:45.240 --> 03:16:46.080
Thank you so much.

03:16:46.080 --> 03:16:50.360
I'm proud to be among the group of people that you cited,

03:16:50.360 --> 03:16:51.240
proud to be their friend

03:16:51.280 --> 03:16:52.880
and proud that you've had me on today.

03:16:52.880 --> 03:16:53.720
Thank you so much.

03:16:53.720 --> 03:16:55.080
Thank you, Paul.

03:16:55.080 --> 03:16:57.640
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Paul Conte.

03:16:57.640 --> 03:16:58.720

And now let me leave you with some words from Victor Frankel.

03:17:05.920 --> 03:17:08.320
Everything can be taken from a man,

03:17:08.320 --> 03:17:10.800
but the last of the human freedoms

03:17:10.800 --> 03:17:14.480
to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.

03:17:15.480 --> 03:17:18.560
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

03:17:21.240 --> 03:17:22.080
Thank you.
