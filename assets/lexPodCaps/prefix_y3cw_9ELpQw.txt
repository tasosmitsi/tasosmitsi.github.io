00:00.000 --> 00:07.880
A black hole is a mirror, and the way it's a mirror is if light, a photon, bounces off

00:07.880 --> 00:14.640
your face towards the black hole, it goes straight to the black hole, just falls in,

00:14.640 --> 00:16.840
you never see it again.

00:16.840 --> 00:25.160
But if it just misses the black hole, it'll swing around the back and come back to you,

00:25.160 --> 00:31.400
and you see yourself from the photon that went around the back of the black hole.

00:31.400 --> 00:39.400
But not only can that happen, the black hole, the photon can swing around twice and come

00:39.400 --> 00:40.400
back.

00:40.400 --> 00:46.760
So you actually see an infinite number of copies of yourself.

00:46.760 --> 00:51.480
The following is a conversation with Andrew Strominger, theoretical physicist at Harvard

00:51.480 --> 00:56.760
whose research seeks to shed light on the unification of fundamental laws of nature,

00:56.760 --> 01:02.840
the origin of the universe, and the quantum structure of black holes and event horizons.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.320
This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

01:04.320 --> 01:08.080
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:08.080 --> 01:12.920
And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Strominger.

01:12.920 --> 01:19.240
You are part of the Harvard Black Hole Initiative, which has theoretical physicists, experimentalists,

01:19.720 --> 01:21.440
and even philosophers.

01:21.440 --> 01:23.320
So let me ask the big question.

01:23.320 --> 01:29.880
What is a black hole from a theoretical, from an experimental, maybe even from a philosophical

01:29.880 --> 01:30.960
perspective?

01:30.960 --> 01:41.180
So a black hole is defined theoretically as a region of space-time from which light can

01:41.180 --> 01:45.000
never escape, therefore it's black.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.120
Now that's just the starting point.

01:48.120 --> 01:56.720
Many weird things follow from that basic definition, but that is the basic definition.

01:56.720 --> 01:57.720
What is light?

01:57.720 --> 02:00.280
It can't escape from a black hole.

02:00.280 --> 02:07.360
Well light is the stuff that comes out of the sun, that stuff that goes into your eyes.

02:07.360 --> 02:11.440
Light is one of the stuff that disappears when the lights go off.

02:11.440 --> 02:15.440
This is stuff that appears when the lights come on.

02:15.440 --> 02:21.000
Of course, I could give you a mathematical definition or physical mathematical definition,

02:21.000 --> 02:28.680
but I think it's something that we all understand very intuitively.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.000
What is light?

02:30.000 --> 02:33.320
Black holes, on the other hand, we don't understand intuitively.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.360
They're very weird.

02:35.360 --> 02:45.400
And one of the questions is about black holes, which I think you were alluding to, is why

02:45.400 --> 02:51.520
doesn't light get out, or how is it that there can be a region of space-time from

02:51.520 --> 02:54.840
which light can't escape?

02:54.840 --> 02:57.160
It definitely happens.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.060
We've seen those regions.

02:59.060 --> 03:06.640
We have spectacular pictures, especially in the last several years of those regions.

03:06.640 --> 03:07.640
They're there.

03:07.640 --> 03:13.400
In fact, they're up in the sky, thousands or millions of them.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.920
We don't yet know how many.

03:16.920 --> 03:31.520
But the proper explanation of why light doesn't escape from a black hole is still a matter

03:31.520 --> 03:36.560
of some debate.

03:36.560 --> 03:48.400
One explanation, which perhaps Einstein might have given, is that light carries energy.

03:48.400 --> 03:54.480
You know it carries energy because we have photocells and we can take the light from

03:54.480 --> 03:58.320
the sun and collect it, turn it into electricity.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.160
So there's energy in light.

04:01.160 --> 04:06.960
And anything that carries energy is subject to a gravitational pull.

04:06.960 --> 04:11.320
Gravity will pull at anything with energy.

04:11.320 --> 04:20.600
Now it turns out that the gravitational pull exerted by an object is proportional to its

04:20.600 --> 04:22.160
mass.

04:22.160 --> 04:35.080
And so if you get enough mass in a small enough region, you can prevent light from

04:35.080 --> 04:36.240
escaping.

04:36.240 --> 04:40.960
And let me flesh that out a little more.

04:40.960 --> 04:50.280
If you're on the Earth and you're on a rocket ship leaving the surface of the Earth, and

04:50.280 --> 05:00.000
if we ignore the friction from the air, if your rocket accelerates up to 11 km per second,

05:00.000 --> 05:03.200
that's escape velocity.

05:03.200 --> 05:08.920
If there were no friction, it could just continue forever to the next galaxy.

05:08.920 --> 05:17.000
On the Moon, which has less mass, it's only 7 km per second.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.360
But going in the other direction, if you have enough mass in one place, the escape

05:23.360 --> 05:29.760
velocity can become the speed of light.

05:29.760 --> 05:34.040
If you shine light straight up away from the Earth, it doesn't have too much trouble.

05:34.040 --> 05:39.440
It's going way above the escape velocity.

05:39.440 --> 05:45.600
But if you have enough mass there, even light can't escape the escape velocity.

05:45.600 --> 05:56.200
And according to Einstein's theory of relativity, there is an absolute speed limit in the universe,

05:56.200 --> 06:01.140
the speed of light, and nothing makes any sense.

06:01.140 --> 06:08.380
Nothing could be self-consistent if there were objects that could exceed light speed.

06:08.380 --> 06:16.340
And so in these very, very massive regions of space-time, even light cannot escape.

06:16.340 --> 06:22.900
And the interesting thing is Einstein himself didn't think that these objects, we call

06:22.900 --> 06:24.540
the black holes, could exist.

06:24.540 --> 06:26.460
But let me actually linger on this.

06:26.460 --> 06:27.460
That's incredibly interesting.

06:27.460 --> 06:29.060
There's a lot of interesting things here.

06:29.060 --> 06:31.500
First, the speed limit.

06:31.500 --> 06:37.060
How wild is it to you, if you put yourself in the mind in the time of Einstein before

06:37.740 --> 06:42.780
him, to come up with a speed limit, that there is a speed limit, and that speed limit is

06:42.780 --> 06:44.220
the speed of light?

06:44.220 --> 06:47.180
How difficult of an idea is that?

06:47.180 --> 06:52.660
You said from a mathematical physics perspective, everything just kind of falls into place,

06:52.660 --> 06:59.700
but he wasn't perhaps maybe initially had the luxury to think mathematically.

06:59.700 --> 07:03.620
He had to come up with it intuitively, yes?

07:03.620 --> 07:06.260
How common intuitive is this notion to you?

07:06.260 --> 07:07.860
Is it still crazy?

07:07.860 --> 07:08.860
No, no.

07:08.860 --> 07:12.060
So it's a very funny thing in physics.

07:12.060 --> 07:19.500
The best discoveries seem completely obvious in retrospect.

07:19.500 --> 07:25.020
Even my own discoveries, which of course are far lesser than Einstein's, but many of my

07:25.020 --> 07:29.540
papers, many of my collaborators get all confused.

07:29.540 --> 07:30.820
We'll try to understand something.

07:30.820 --> 07:32.460
We say, we've got to solve this problem.

07:32.460 --> 07:33.460
We'll get all confused.

07:33.460 --> 07:35.060
Finally, we'll solve it.

07:35.060 --> 07:43.060
We'll get it all together, and then all of a sudden everything will fall into place.

07:43.060 --> 07:47.820
We'll explain it, and then we'll look back at our discussions for the proceedings of

07:47.820 --> 07:56.860
months and literally be unable to reconstruct how confused we were and how we could ever

07:56.860 --> 08:01.180
have thought of it any other way.

08:01.180 --> 08:13.940
Not only can I not fathom how confused Einstein was when he started thinking about the issues,

08:13.940 --> 08:21.420
I can't even reconstruct my own confusion from two weeks ago.

08:21.420 --> 08:26.980
So the really beautiful ideas of physics have this very hard to get yourself back into the

08:26.980 --> 08:28.540
mindset.

08:28.540 --> 08:34.980
Of course, Einstein was confused about many, many things.

08:34.980 --> 08:38.180
It doesn't matter if you're a physicist.

08:38.180 --> 08:40.320
It's not how many things you got wrong.

08:40.320 --> 08:44.740
It's not the ratio of how many you got wrong to how many you got right.

08:44.740 --> 08:47.420
It's the number that you got right.

08:47.420 --> 08:53.740
So Einstein didn't believe black holes existed, even though he predicted them.

08:53.740 --> 08:57.060
I went and I read that paper, which he wrote.

08:57.060 --> 09:04.900
Einstein wrote down his field equations in 1915, and Schwarzschild solved them and discovered

09:04.900 --> 09:14.380
the black hole solution three or four months later in very early 1916.

09:14.380 --> 09:17.540
Twenty-five years later, Einstein wrote a paper.

09:17.540 --> 09:23.540
So with 25 years to think about what this solution means, wrote a paper in which he

09:23.540 --> 09:29.020
said that black holes didn't exist.

09:29.020 --> 09:37.620
And I'm like, well, if one of my students in my general relativity course wrote this,

09:37.620 --> 09:38.620
I wouldn't pass them.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.060
You'd get a C-, oh, you wouldn't pass them, okay.

09:41.060 --> 09:43.020
Get a C-, okay.

09:43.020 --> 09:44.260
Same thing with gravity waves.

09:44.260 --> 09:45.260
He didn't believe-

09:45.260 --> 09:46.680
Oh, he didn't believe in gravitational waves either?

09:46.680 --> 09:51.920
He went back and forth, but he wrote a paper in, I think, 34 saying that gravity waves

09:51.920 --> 09:57.640
didn't exist because people were very confused about what a coordinate transformation is.

09:57.640 --> 10:06.880
And in fact, this confusion about what a coordinate transformation is has persisted, and we actually

10:06.880 --> 10:19.000
think we were on the edge of solving it a hundred years later, a hundred years later.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.080
What is coordinate transformation as it was a hundred years ago to today?

10:23.080 --> 10:30.840
Let's imagine I want to draw a map with pictures of all the states and the mountains, and then

10:30.840 --> 10:37.120
I want to draw the weather forecast, what the temperatures are going to be all over

10:37.120 --> 10:40.360
the country.

10:40.360 --> 10:48.160
And I do that using one set of weather stations, and I number the weather stations.

10:48.160 --> 10:55.520
And you have some other set of weather stations, and you do the same thing.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.920
So the coordinates are the locations of the weather stations.

10:58.920 --> 11:01.880
They're how we describe where the things are.

11:01.880 --> 11:07.800
At the end of the day, we should draw the same map.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.360
That is coordinate invariance.

11:10.360 --> 11:17.720
And if we're going to tell somebody at a real physical operation, we want you to stay as

11:17.720 --> 11:23.680
dry as possible on your drive from here to California, we should give them exactly the

11:23.680 --> 11:26.160
same route.

11:26.160 --> 11:33.000
No matter which weather stations we use or how we – it's a very trivial – the labeling

11:33.000 --> 11:38.920
of points is an artifact and not in the real physics.

11:38.920 --> 11:46.920
So it turns out that that's almost true, but not quite.

11:46.920 --> 11:49.440
There's some subtleties to it.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.920
The statement that you should always have the same – give at least the same kind of

11:53.000 --> 11:57.400
trajectory, the same kind of instructions, no matter the weather stations.

11:57.400 --> 12:09.040
Yeah, there's some very delicate subtleties to that which began to be noticed in the 50s.

12:09.040 --> 12:18.200
It's mostly true, but when you have a spacetime with edges, it gets very tricky how you label

12:18.200 --> 12:19.200
the edges.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.760
And spacetime in terms of space or in terms of time, in terms of everything, just spacetime?

12:22.760 --> 12:23.760
Another one.

12:23.760 --> 12:24.760
Okay.

12:24.760 --> 12:25.760
Spacer time.

12:25.760 --> 12:26.760
That gets very tricky.

12:26.760 --> 12:35.440
And Einstein didn't have it right, and in fact, he had an earlier version of general

12:35.440 --> 12:48.680
relativity in 1914, which he was very excited about, which was wrong.

12:48.680 --> 12:53.320
It wasn't fully coordinate invariant, it was only partially coordinate invariant.

12:53.320 --> 12:55.360
It was wrong.

12:55.360 --> 13:01.360
It gave the wrong answer for bending light to the sun by a factor of two.

13:01.360 --> 13:06.840
There was an expedition sent out to measure it during World War I.

13:06.840 --> 13:15.160
They were captured before they could measure it, and that gave Einstein four more years

13:16.160 --> 13:21.640
to clean his act up by which time he'd gotten it right.

13:21.640 --> 13:29.240
It's a very tricky business, but once it's all laid out, it's clear.

13:29.240 --> 13:36.280
Then why do you think Einstein didn't believe his own equations and didn't think that black

13:36.280 --> 13:37.280
holes are real?

13:37.280 --> 13:40.040
Why was that such a difficult idea for him?

13:40.520 --> 13:52.280
Well, something very interesting happens in Shoreshield's solution of the Einstein equation.

13:52.280 --> 14:03.800
I think his reasoning was ultimately wrong, but let me explain to you what it was.

14:03.800 --> 14:11.480
At the center of the black hole, behind the horizon, in a region that nobody can see

14:11.480 --> 14:16.680
and live to tell about it, at the center of the black hole, there's a singularity.

14:16.680 --> 14:26.120
If you pass the horizon, you go into the singularity, you get crushed, and that's the end of everything.

14:26.120 --> 14:38.880
The word singularity just means that Einstein's equations break down.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.720
They become infinite.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.320
You write them down, you put them on the computer.

14:43.320 --> 14:47.700
When the computer hits that singularity, it crashes.

14:47.700 --> 14:50.840
Everything becomes infinite, there's two.

14:50.840 --> 14:54.520
So the equations are just no good there.

14:54.520 --> 15:01.160
Now, that's actually not a bad thing.

15:01.160 --> 15:09.760
It's a really good thing, and let me explain why.

15:09.760 --> 15:20.920
It's an odd thing that Maxwell's theory and Newton's theory never exhibit this phenomenon.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.640
You write them down, you can solve them exactly.

15:24.120 --> 15:28.240
Newton's theory of gravity, they're really very simple theories.

15:28.240 --> 15:29.240
You can solve them.

15:29.240 --> 15:35.760
Well, you can't solve the three-body problem, but you can certainly solve a lot of things

15:35.760 --> 15:38.480
about them.

15:38.480 --> 15:51.200
Nevertheless, there was never any reason, even though Maxwell and Newton perhaps fell

15:51.360 --> 15:58.160
for this trap, there were never any reason to think that these equations were exact.

16:07.680 --> 16:11.920
There's some equations that we've written down that we still think are exact.

16:13.360 --> 16:15.360
Some people still think are exact.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.760
My view is that there's no exact equation.

16:17.760 --> 16:19.200
Everything is an approximation.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.560
Everything is an approximation.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.480
And you're trying to get as close as possible.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.480
Yeah.

16:23.480 --> 16:26.080
So you're saying objective truth doesn't exist in this world.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.600
The internet is going to be very mad.

16:29.600 --> 16:32.400
We could discuss that, but that's a different thing.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.840
We wouldn't say Newton's theory was wrong.

16:36.800 --> 16:41.520
It had very, very small corrections, incredibly small corrections.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.320
It's actually a puzzle why they're so small.

16:45.280 --> 16:49.760
So if you watch the precession of Mercury's perihelion, this was the first indication

16:50.720 --> 16:52.400
of something going wrong.

16:53.280 --> 16:57.040
According to Newton's theory, Mercury has an elliptical orbit.

16:57.920 --> 17:06.640
The long part of it moves around as other planets come by and perturb it and so on.

17:06.640 --> 17:14.960
And so this was measured by Le Verrier in 1859, and he compared theory and experiment,

17:14.960 --> 17:20.640
and he found out that the perihelion process moves around the sun

17:21.680 --> 17:29.600
once every 233 centuries instead of every 231 centuries.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.880
Now, this is the wonderful thing about science.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.280
Why was this guy?

17:36.560 --> 17:39.360
I mean, you don't get any idea how much work this is.

17:39.600 --> 17:44.240
You know, but of course, he made one of the greatest discoveries in the

17:44.240 --> 17:49.280
history of science without even knowing what good it was going to be.

17:52.960 --> 17:57.440
So that's how small, that was the first sign that there was something wrong with Newton.

18:00.480 --> 18:04.960
So the corrections to Newton's law are very, very small, but they're definitely there.

18:05.920 --> 18:14.160
The corrections to electromagnetism, the ones that we see are mostly coming from quantum effects.

18:17.120 --> 18:23.520
So the corrections for Maxwell's equations is when you get super tiny,

18:23.520 --> 18:31.280
and then the corrections for Newton's laws of gravity is when you get super big.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.560
That's when you require corrections.

18:34.640 --> 18:38.000
That's true, but I would phrase it as saying when it's super accurate.

18:38.800 --> 18:45.200
If you look at the Bohr atom, Maxwell electromagnetism is not a very good approximation

18:45.920 --> 18:49.840
to the force between the proton and the electron.

18:53.920 --> 18:59.040
If you didn't have quantum mechanics, the electron would spiral into the proton

18:59.600 --> 19:03.840
and the atom would collapse. So that's a huge correction there.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.920
So every theory gets corrected as we learn more.

19:09.520 --> 19:13.840
There'd just be no reason to suppose that it should be otherwise.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.160
How does this relate to the singularity?

19:17.120 --> 19:26.960
So when you hit the singularity, you know that you need some improvement to Einstein's

19:26.960 --> 19:33.600
theory of gravity, and that improvement, we understand what kind of things that improvement

19:33.600 --> 19:39.760
should involve. It should involve quantum mechanics, quantum effects become important

19:39.760 --> 19:48.720
there. It's a small thing. We don't understand exactly what the theory is, but we know there's

19:48.720 --> 19:58.560
no reason to think Einstein's theory was invented to describe weakly curved things, the solar system,

19:58.560 --> 20:06.560
and so on. It's incredibly robust that we now see that it works very well near the horizons of

20:07.280 --> 20:15.120
round black holes and so on. So it's a good thing that the theory drives itself,

20:16.240 --> 20:18.080
that it predicts its own demise.

20:20.480 --> 20:25.600
Newton's gravity had its demise. There were regimes in which it wasn't valid.

20:26.560 --> 20:34.880
Maxwell's electromagnetism had its demise. There were regimes in which quantum effects

20:34.880 --> 20:43.440
greatly modified the equations. But general relativity all on its own

20:43.440 --> 20:53.600
found a system, which originally was fine, would perversely wander off into a configuration

20:54.320 --> 20:57.040
in which Einstein's equations no longer applied.

20:57.040 --> 21:00.560
So to you, the edges of the theory are wonderful, the failures of the theory.

21:00.560 --> 21:05.200
Edges are wonderful because that keeps us in business.

21:05.200 --> 21:10.640
So one of the things you said, I think, in your TED talk, that the

21:10.720 --> 21:17.440
fact that quantum mechanics and relativity don't describe everything and then they clash

21:17.440 --> 21:21.280
is wonderful. I forget the adjective you used, but it was something like this.

21:21.280 --> 21:26.320
So why is that? Why is that interesting? Do you mean in that same way that there's

21:26.320 --> 21:28.240
contradictions that create discovery?

21:28.240 --> 21:32.560
There is no question in my mind, of course, many people would disagree with me,

21:32.560 --> 21:36.880
there is no question in my mind, of course, many people would disagree with me,

21:37.520 --> 21:44.640
that now is the most wonderful time to be a physicist.

21:45.600 --> 21:57.760
So people look back at, it's a classical thing to say among physicists, I wish it were 1920.

21:58.640 --> 21:59.120
Right.

21:59.120 --> 22:05.360
Quantum mechanics had been just understood. There was the periodic table.

22:07.120 --> 22:19.360
But in fact, that was such a rich thing that, well, a lot of exciting stuff happened around

22:19.360 --> 22:27.520
1920. It took a whole century to sort out the new insights that we got.

22:27.760 --> 22:32.320
Especially adding some experimental stuff into the bunch, actually making observations.

22:32.320 --> 22:33.920
Adding experimental thing.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.880
All the computers also help with visualizations and all that kind of stuff.

22:36.880 --> 22:42.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was all sort of wonderful century. I mean, the seed of

22:43.200 --> 22:52.080
general relativity was the incompatibility of Maxwell's theory of the electromagnetic field

22:52.240 --> 23:00.640
with Newton's laws of gravity. They were incompatible because if you look at Maxwell's theory,

23:02.880 --> 23:08.080
there's a contradiction if anything goes faster than the speed of light.

23:10.320 --> 23:19.200
But Newton's theory of gravity, the gravitational field, the gravitational force is

23:20.160 --> 23:32.320
instantaneously transmitted across the entire universe. So if you had a friend in another

23:32.320 --> 23:38.320
galaxy with a very sensitive measuring device that could measure the gravitational field,

23:38.320 --> 23:43.520
they could just take this cup of coffee and move it up and down in Morse code and they could

23:44.480 --> 23:50.080
get the message instantaneously over another galaxy. That leads to all kinds of contradictions.

23:50.720 --> 23:57.600
It's not self-consistent. It was exactly in resolving those contradictions that Einstein

23:57.600 --> 24:05.680
came up with the general theory of relativity. It's fascinating how this contradiction,

24:06.400 --> 24:08.960
which seems like maybe it's kind of a technical thing,

24:10.320 --> 24:17.440
led to a whole new vision of the universe. Now, let's not get fooled because

24:19.200 --> 24:27.280
lots of contradictions are technical things. We run into other kinds of contradictions

24:27.280 --> 24:34.640
that are technical. We understood something wrong. We made a mistake. We set up our equations in the

24:34.640 --> 24:39.440
wrong way. We didn't translate the formalisms. As opposed to revealing some deep mystery that's

24:39.440 --> 24:46.080
yet to be uncovered. Yeah. And so we're never very sure which are the really important ones.

24:47.120 --> 24:50.320
But to you, the difference between quantum mechanics and general relativity,

24:51.680 --> 24:56.560
the tension, the contradiction there seems to hint at some deeper, deeper thing that's

24:56.560 --> 25:02.240
going to be discovered in the century. Yes, because that one has been understood since

25:02.240 --> 25:12.160
the 50s. Pauli was the first person to notice it. Hawking in the early 70s gave it a really

25:12.160 --> 25:23.520
much more visceral form. People have been hurling themselves at it, trying to reduce it to some

25:24.320 --> 25:30.960
technicality, but nobody has succeeded. The efforts to understand it have led to

25:33.200 --> 25:42.320
all kinds of interesting relations between quantum systems and applications to other fields and so on.

25:42.320 --> 25:46.640
Well, let's actually jump around. We'll return to black holes. I have a million questions there,

25:46.640 --> 25:53.680
but let's go into this unification, the battle against the contradictions and the tensions

25:53.680 --> 25:59.440
between the theories of physics. What is quantum gravity? What is the standard model

26:00.000 --> 26:04.400
of physics? What is quantum mechanics? What is general relativity? What's quantum gravity?

26:05.520 --> 26:07.520
What are all the different unification efforts?

26:10.320 --> 26:12.640
Okay, so- Again, five questions.

26:12.640 --> 26:23.280
Yeah. It's a theory that describes everything with astonishing accuracy. It's the most

26:23.280 --> 26:32.080
accurate theory in the history of human thought. Theory and experiment have been successfully

26:32.080 --> 26:42.720
compared to 16 decimal place. We have that stenciled on the door where I work. It's an

26:43.200 --> 26:53.920
amazing feat of the human mind. It describes the electromagnetic interaction, unifies the

26:53.920 --> 27:01.440
electromagnetic interaction with the so-called weak interaction, which you need some good tools

27:01.440 --> 27:09.200
to even view the weak interaction. Then there's the strong interaction, which binds the quarks

27:09.840 --> 27:18.720
into protons. The forces between them are mediated by something called Yang-Mills theory,

27:19.360 --> 27:30.960
which is a beautiful mathematical generalization of electromagnetism in which the analogues of the

27:30.960 --> 27:44.080
photons themselves carry charge. The final piece of this, of the standard model, everything in the

27:44.080 --> 27:50.640
standard model has been observed. Its properties have been measured. The final particle to be

27:50.640 --> 27:56.160
observed was the Higgs particle observed over a decade ago.

27:56.160 --> 27:58.080
The Higgs is already a decade ago.

27:58.080 --> 27:59.680
I think it is, yeah.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.400
Wow. But you better check me on that.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.400
That's true, but so much fun has been happening.

28:06.400 --> 28:17.120
So much fun has been happening. That's all pretty well understood. There are some things

28:17.760 --> 28:24.400
that might or might not, around the edges of that, dark matter, neutrino masses,

28:25.280 --> 28:32.560
some sort of fine points or things we haven't quite measured perfectly and so on. But

28:33.360 --> 28:44.480
it's largely a very complete theory, and we don't expect anything very new

28:45.680 --> 28:49.040
conceptually in the completion of that.

28:49.680 --> 28:51.760
Anything contradictory by new?

28:52.560 --> 28:54.160
Anything contradictory, yeah.

28:54.160 --> 29:01.760
I'll have some wild questions for you on that front. Because there's no gaps. It's so accurate,

29:01.760 --> 29:04.480
so precise in its predictions, it's hard to imagine something completely new.

29:04.480 --> 29:11.680
Yeah. And it was all based on something called, let me not explain what it is,

29:11.680 --> 29:16.960
let me just throw out the buzzword, renormalizable quantum field theory. They all

29:17.760 --> 29:22.720
fall in the category of renormalizable quantum field theory.

29:22.720 --> 29:26.960
I'm going to throw that at a bar later to impress the girls.

29:28.480 --> 29:29.360
Good luck.

29:29.360 --> 29:29.860
Thank you.

29:34.880 --> 29:43.920
They all fall under that rubric. Gravity will not put that suit on. So the force of gravity

29:44.880 --> 29:53.040
cannot be tamed by the same renormalizable quantum field theory to which all the other forces

29:54.000 --> 29:55.920
so eagerly submitted.

29:55.920 --> 29:59.600
What is the effort of quantum gravity? What are the different efforts to

30:01.840 --> 30:07.600
have these two dance together effectively to try to unify the standard model and

30:09.280 --> 30:11.600
general relativity, any kind of model of gravity?

30:12.240 --> 30:22.720
I'm sort of the one fully consistent model that we have that reconciles,

30:24.960 --> 30:34.880
that sort of tames gravity and reconciles it with quantum mechanics, is string theory and its

30:34.880 --> 30:42.480
cousins. And we don't know what or if in any sense string theory describes the world,

30:43.120 --> 30:53.280
the physical world, but we do know that it is a consistent reconciliation of quantum mechanics

30:53.280 --> 31:05.360
and general relativity, and moreover one which is able to incorporate particles and forces like the

31:05.360 --> 31:15.760
ones we see around us. So it hasn't been ruled out as an actual sort of unified theory of nature,

31:15.760 --> 31:27.520
but there also isn't a, in my view, some people would disagree with me, but there isn't a reasonable

31:29.200 --> 31:34.560
possibility that we would be able to do an experiment in the foreseeable future,

31:34.560 --> 31:39.440
which would be sort of a yes or no to string theory.

31:40.080 --> 31:43.920
Okay, so you've been there from the early days of string theory, you've seen its developments.

31:43.920 --> 31:48.800
What are some interesting developments? What do you see as also the future of string theory?

31:49.600 --> 31:50.720
And what is string theory?

31:53.280 --> 32:01.760
Well, the basic idea which emerged in the early 70s was that if you

32:01.760 --> 32:15.680
take the notion of a particle and you literally replace it by a little loop of string,

32:16.880 --> 32:22.400
the strings are sort of softer than particles.

32:22.400 --> 32:23.600
What do you mean by softer?

32:24.640 --> 32:31.360
Well, if you hit a particle, if there were a particle on this table, a big one, and you hit it,

32:31.360 --> 32:36.080
you might bruise yourself. But if there was a string on the table, you would probably just

32:36.080 --> 32:44.240
push it around. And the source of the infinities in quantum field theory is that when particles

32:44.240 --> 32:54.880
hit each other, it's a little bit of a jarring effect. And I've never described it this way

32:54.880 --> 32:59.360
before, but it's actually scientifically accurate. But if you throw strings at each other, it's a

32:59.360 --> 33:07.920
little more friendly. One thing I can't explain is how wonderfully precise the mathematics is

33:08.560 --> 33:13.280
that goes into describing string theory. We don't just wave our hands and throw strings around.

33:14.560 --> 33:21.040
There are some very compelling mathematical equations that describe it. Now,

33:21.920 --> 33:28.480
what was realized in the early 70s is that if you replace particles by strings,

33:28.560 --> 33:38.880
these infinities go away, and you get a consistent theory of gravity without the infinities.

33:43.280 --> 33:47.840
That may sound a little trivial, but at that point, it had already been

33:49.440 --> 33:56.880
15 years that people had been searching around for any kind of theory that could do this.

33:57.600 --> 34:06.400
And it was actually found kind of by accident. And there are a lot of accidental discoveries

34:07.040 --> 34:13.920
in this subject. Now, at the same time, it was believed then that string theory was

34:13.920 --> 34:19.920
an interesting sort of toy model for putting quantum mechanics and general relativity together

34:20.880 --> 34:30.240
on paper, but that it couldn't describe some of the very idiosyncratic phenomena

34:31.280 --> 34:37.360
that pertain to our own universe, in particular, the form of so-called parity violation.

34:39.360 --> 34:42.800
Another term for the bar later tonight. Yeah, yeah.

34:42.800 --> 34:45.680
Parity violation. So if you go to the bar and...

34:46.640 --> 34:50.560
I already got the renormalizable quantum. And you look in the mirror across the bar,

34:51.280 --> 34:55.120
the universe that you see in the mirror is not identical.

34:57.280 --> 35:05.680
You would be able to tell if you show the lady in the bar a photograph that shows both the

35:05.680 --> 35:12.640
mirror and you, if she's smart enough, she'll be able to tell which one is the real world

35:13.360 --> 35:17.120
and which one is you. Now, she would have to do some very precise measurements.

35:19.760 --> 35:24.160
And if the photograph was too grainy, it might not be possible, but in principle is possible.

35:24.160 --> 35:27.360
Why is this interesting? Does this mean that there is some

35:29.280 --> 35:32.640
not perfect determinism? Or what does that mean? There's some uncertainty?

35:32.640 --> 35:38.960
No, it's a very interesting feature of the real world that it isn't parity invariant.

35:38.960 --> 35:42.640
In string theory, it was thought could not tolerate that.

35:44.640 --> 35:50.960
And then it was learned in the mid-'80s that not only could it tolerate that,

35:51.600 --> 36:00.480
but if you did things in the right way, you could construct a world involving strings that

36:00.480 --> 36:07.120
reconciled quantum mechanics and general relativity, which looked more or less like

36:07.120 --> 36:16.400
the world that we live in. Now, that isn't to say that string theory predicted our world.

36:17.280 --> 36:24.480
It just meant that it was consistent, that the hypothesis that string theory describes

36:25.280 --> 36:35.520
our world can't be ruled out from the get-go. And it is also the only proposal

36:36.000 --> 36:45.280
for a complete theory that would describe our world. Still, nobody will believe it

36:46.720 --> 36:52.960
until there's some kind of direct experiment. And I don't even believe it myself.

36:52.960 --> 36:58.080
Sure, which is a good place to be mentally as a physicist. Einstein didn't believe his own

36:58.800 --> 37:01.040
equations with the black hole. Okay.

37:01.040 --> 37:05.520
Well, when he was wrong about that, he was wrong about that.

37:05.520 --> 37:11.360
But you might be wrong too, right? So do you think string theory is dead if you were to bet

37:11.360 --> 37:20.960
all your money on the future of string theory? No. I think it's a logical error to think that

37:20.960 --> 37:29.520
string theory is either right or wrong or dead or alive. What it is, is a stepping stone.

37:31.280 --> 37:41.600
And an analogy I like to draw is Yang-Mills theory, which I mentioned a few minutes ago

37:41.600 --> 37:48.640
in the context of standard model. Yang-Mills theory was discovered by Yang and Mills in the 50s.

37:49.840 --> 37:58.160
And they thought that the symmetry of Yang and Mills theory described the relationship

37:58.160 --> 38:04.240
between the proton and the neutron. That's why they invented it. That turned out to be

38:04.240 --> 38:11.280
completely wrong. It does, however, describe everything else in the standard model.

38:13.520 --> 38:18.720
And it had a kind of inevitability. They had some of the right pieces, but not the other ones.

38:18.720 --> 38:19.120
Sure.

38:19.120 --> 38:24.720
They didn't have it quite in the right context. And it had an inevitability to it,

38:24.720 --> 38:32.480
and it eventually sort of found its place. And it's also true of Einstein's theory of

38:32.480 --> 38:37.760
general relativity. He had the wrong version of it in 1914, and he was missing some pieces.

38:38.320 --> 38:42.720
And you wouldn't say that his early version was right or wrong. He'd understood the equivalence

38:42.720 --> 38:48.800
principle. He'd understood space-time curvature. He just didn't have everything. Technically,

38:48.800 --> 38:52.720
you would have to say it was wrong. And technically, you would have to say Yang and

38:52.720 --> 39:02.800
Mills were wrong. And I guess in that sense, I would believe just odds are. We always keep

39:02.800 --> 39:07.360
finding new wrinkles. Odds are we're going to find new wrinkles in string theory. And

39:07.360 --> 39:10.640
technically, what we call string theory now isn't quite right.

39:11.680 --> 39:15.920
We're always going to be wrong, but hopefully a little bit less wrong every time.

39:15.920 --> 39:20.640
Exactly. And I would bet the farm, as they say.

39:20.640 --> 39:21.360
Do you have a farm?

39:22.320 --> 39:27.360
I say that much more seriously because not only do I have a farm, but we just renovated it.

39:29.360 --> 39:31.520
This is a very serious statement.

39:31.520 --> 39:35.680
So before I renovated, better get the farm. My wife and I spent five years renovating it.

39:37.280 --> 39:40.480
You were much looser with that statement, but now it really means something.

39:41.280 --> 39:46.240
Now it really means something. And I would bet the farm on the

39:51.600 --> 39:58.800
guess that 100 years from now, string theory will be viewed as a stepping stone

39:58.800 --> 40:07.040
towards a greater understanding of nature. And another thing that I didn't mention about

40:07.040 --> 40:14.800
string theory is, of course, we knew that it solved the infinities problem. And then we later

40:14.800 --> 40:23.520
learned that it also solved Hawking's puzzle about what's inside of a black hole. And

40:25.120 --> 40:30.320
you put in one assumption, you get five things out, somehow you're doing something right.

40:31.040 --> 40:36.800
Probably not everything, but there's some good signposts. And there have been a lot of good

40:36.800 --> 40:42.560
signposts like that. It is also a mathematical toolkit and you've used it. You've used it with

40:42.560 --> 40:48.160
Kamranwafa. Maybe we can sneak our way back from string theory into black holes.

40:49.520 --> 40:53.920
What was the idea that you and Kamranwafa developed with the holographic principle

40:53.920 --> 40:59.680
in string theory? What were you able to discover through string theory about black holes?

41:01.920 --> 41:04.960
That connects us back to the reality of black holes.

41:05.840 --> 41:13.120
So that is a very interesting story. I was interested in black holes before I was interested in

41:13.760 --> 41:20.560
string theory. I was sort of a reluctant string theorist in the beginning. I thought I had to

41:20.560 --> 41:26.000
learn it because people were talking about it. But once I studied it, I grew to love it.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.480
First, I did it in a sort of dutiful way. These people say they've claimed quantum gravity. I

41:30.480 --> 41:36.320
ought to read their papers at least. And then the more I read them, the more interested I got and

41:36.320 --> 41:44.800
I began to see. They phrased it in a very clumsy way. The description of string theory was very

41:44.800 --> 41:47.360
clumsy. Mathematically clumsy or just the interpretation?

41:47.360 --> 41:57.120
Mathematically clumsy, yeah. It was all correct, but mathematically clumsy. But it often happens

41:57.680 --> 42:06.000
that in all kinds of branches of physics that people start working on it really hard and they

42:06.000 --> 42:11.840
sort of dream about it and live it and breathe it and they begin to see inner relationships and

42:12.720 --> 42:19.280
they see a beauty that is really there. They're not deceived. They're really seeing something

42:19.280 --> 42:26.160
that exists, but if you just kind of look at it, you can't grasp it all in the beginning.

42:26.160 --> 42:41.920
And so, our understanding of string theory in 1985 was almost all about

42:45.120 --> 42:51.520
weakly coupled waves of strings colliding and so on. We didn't know how to describe

42:52.400 --> 42:58.480
a big thing like a black hole in string theory. Of course, we could show that strings

42:59.040 --> 43:03.200
in theory in some limit reproduced Einstein's theory of general relativity

43:04.240 --> 43:09.600
and corrected it, but we couldn't do any better with black holes than

43:13.280 --> 43:17.600
before my work with Cormann. We couldn't do any better than Einstein and Schwarzschild had done.

43:17.600 --> 43:31.440
Now, one of the puzzles, if you look at the Hawking's headstone and also Boltzmann's headstone

43:31.440 --> 43:42.240
and you put them together, you get a formula for their really central equations in 20th century

43:42.240 --> 43:47.600
physics. I don't think there are many equations that made it to headstones.

43:50.960 --> 43:57.760
And they're really central equations and you put them together and you get a formula for the number

43:57.760 --> 44:04.080
of gigabytes in a black hole. Now, in Schwarzschild's description,

44:06.400 --> 44:11.280
the black hole is literally a hole in space and there's no place to store the gigabytes.

44:12.640 --> 44:19.360
And it's not too hard to, and this really was Wheeler and Bekenstein and

44:20.560 --> 44:25.680
Wheeler, Bekenstein and Hawking to come to the conclusion that

44:27.440 --> 44:34.320
if there isn't a sense in which a black hole can store some large number of gigabytes,

44:35.600 --> 44:39.760
that quantum mechanics and gravity can't be consistent.

44:40.720 --> 44:46.000
We've got to go there a little bit. So how is it possible, when we say gigabytes,

44:46.000 --> 44:49.200
that there's some information. So black holes can store information. How is this thing that

44:49.200 --> 44:55.520
sucks up all light and it's supposed to basically be super homogeneous and boring?

44:55.520 --> 44:59.040
How is that actually able to store information? Where does it store information?

44:59.040 --> 45:06.880
On the inside, on the surface? Where? And what's information? I'm liking this

45:06.880 --> 45:09.440
ask five questions to see which one you actually answer.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.960
Oh, okay. I shouldn't try to memorize them and answer each one in order just to answer.

45:14.960 --> 45:20.480
I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm desperately trying to figure it out as we go

45:20.480 --> 45:25.440
along here. So Einstein's black holes is Schwarzschild's black hole. They can't

45:25.440 --> 45:31.040
store information. The stuff goes in there and it just keeps flying and it goes into

45:31.120 --> 45:38.720
singularity and it's gone. However, Einstein's theory is not exact. It has corrections.

45:40.240 --> 45:44.000
And string theory tells you what those corrections are.

45:46.560 --> 45:55.120
And so you should be able to find some way of, some alternate way of describing the black hole

45:55.920 --> 46:03.920
that enables you to understand where the gigabytes are stored.

46:04.960 --> 46:11.680
So what Hawking and Bekenstein really did was they showed that physics is inconsistent

46:12.640 --> 46:22.720
unless a black hole can store a number of gigabytes proportional to its area

46:22.720 --> 46:28.720
divided by four times Newton's constant times Planck's constant.

46:28.720 --> 46:31.520
And that's another wild idea. You said area, not volume.

46:32.320 --> 46:35.360
Exactly. And that's the holographic principle.

46:35.360 --> 46:37.040
The universe is so weird.

46:37.040 --> 46:38.400
And that's the holographic principle.

46:38.400 --> 46:44.160
That's called the holographic principle that it's the area. We're just jumping around. What

46:44.160 --> 46:48.320
is the holographic principle? What does that mean? Is there some kind of weird projection going on?

46:48.880 --> 46:49.440
What the heck?

46:50.160 --> 46:54.880
Well, I was just before I came here writing an introduction to a paper and the first sentence was

46:56.240 --> 47:04.960
the as yet imprecisely defined holographic principle, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

47:05.520 --> 47:12.560
So nobody knows exactly what it is. But roughly speaking, it says just what we were alluding to

47:13.440 --> 47:20.960
that really all the information that is in some volume of space time

47:20.960 --> 47:24.720
can be stored on the boundary of that region.

47:26.320 --> 47:29.600
So this is not just about black holes. It's about any area of space.

47:29.600 --> 47:34.800
Any area of space. However, we've made sense of the holographic principle for black holes.

47:36.240 --> 47:40.400
We've made sense of the holographic principle for something which could be

47:40.400 --> 47:48.400
called anti-dissider space, which could be thought of as a giant, as a black hole turned

47:48.400 --> 47:58.800
into a whole universe. And we don't really understand how to talk about the holographic

47:58.800 --> 48:07.920
principle for either flat space, which we appear to live in, or asymptotically dissider space,

48:07.920 --> 48:14.000
which astronomers tell us we actually live in as the universe continues to expand.

48:14.800 --> 48:28.080
So it's one of the huge problems in physics is to apply or even formulate the holographic principle

48:28.080 --> 48:36.960
for more realistic, well, black holes are realistic, we see them. But yeah, in more

48:36.960 --> 48:40.640
general context, to give a more general statement of the holographic principle.

48:41.280 --> 48:46.800
What's the difference between flat space and asymptotic dissider space? So flat space is

48:46.800 --> 48:52.560
just an approximation of like the world we live in. So like dissider space, asymptotic,

48:52.560 --> 48:57.760
I wonder what that even means, meaning like asymptotic over what?

48:57.760 --> 49:03.440
Okay. So for thousands of years, you know, until the last half of the 20th, well, sorry,

49:03.440 --> 49:09.360
until the 20th century, we thought space time was flat.

49:10.240 --> 49:14.320
Can you elaborate on flat? What do we mean by flat?

49:15.680 --> 49:23.040
Well, like the surface of this table is flat. Let me just give an intuitive explanation.

49:23.600 --> 49:32.640
Surface of the table is flat, but the surface of a basketball is curved. So the universe itself

49:34.080 --> 49:39.440
could be flat like the surface of a table, or it could be curved like a basketball,

49:39.440 --> 49:44.320
which actually has a positive curvature. And then there's another kind of curvature called

49:44.320 --> 49:52.080
a negative curvature. And curvature can be even weirder because that kind of curvature

49:52.080 --> 49:57.840
I've just described is the curvature of space. But Einstein taught us that we really live in a

49:57.840 --> 50:03.840
space-time continuum. So we can have curvature in a way that mixes up space and time.

50:05.760 --> 50:07.600
And that's kind of hard to visualize.

50:07.600 --> 50:11.120
Because you have to step what? A couple of dimensions up. So it's hard to...

50:11.760 --> 50:21.120
You have to step a couple. But even if you have flat space and it's expanding in time,

50:23.040 --> 50:26.880
you know, we could imagine we're sitting here, this room, good approximation, it's flat,

50:26.880 --> 50:32.080
but imagine we suddenly start getting further and further apart. Then space is flat,

50:34.320 --> 50:38.000
but it's expanding, which means that space-time is curved.

50:39.280 --> 50:43.200
Ultimately, it's about space-time. Okay, so what's the Sitter and Entity-Sitter space?

50:45.280 --> 50:51.360
The three simplest space-times are flat space-time, which we call Minkowski space-time,

50:52.160 --> 50:59.680
and negatively curved space-time, anti-de Sitter space, and positively curved space-time,

50:59.680 --> 51:12.320
de Sitter space. And so astronomers think that on large scales, even though for thousands of years

51:12.320 --> 51:19.920
we hadn't noticed it, beginning with Hubble, we started to notice that space-time was curved.

51:19.920 --> 51:29.360
Space is expanding in time, means that space-time is curved. And the nature of this curvature is

51:29.360 --> 51:36.880
affected by the matter in it, because matter itself causes the curvature of space-time.

51:37.760 --> 51:44.880
But as it expands, the matter gets more and more diluted. And one might ask, when it's all diluted

51:44.880 --> 51:55.440
away, is space-time still curved? And astronomers believe they've done precise enough measurements

51:55.440 --> 52:01.920
to determine this, and they believe that the answer is yes. The universe is now expanding.

52:02.480 --> 52:11.280
Eventually, all the matter in it will be expanded away, but it will continue to expand

52:11.520 --> 52:17.600
because, well, they would call it the dark energy. Einstein would call it a cosmological constant.

52:18.160 --> 52:24.800
In any case, in the far future, matter will be expanded away and will be left with empty

52:24.800 --> 52:29.520
de Sitter space. Okay, so there's this cosmological, Einstein's cosmological constant

52:30.000 --> 52:35.120
that now hides this thing that we don't understand called dark energy. What's dark energy?

52:35.120 --> 52:40.640
What's your best guess at what this thing is? Why do we think it's there? It's because of

52:41.600 --> 52:48.480
it comes from the astronomers. Dark energy is synonymous with positive cosmological constant.

52:53.200 --> 53:02.720
We think it's there because the astronomers have told us it's there, and they know what they're

53:02.720 --> 53:08.080
doing. It's a really, really hard measurement, but they really know what they're doing.

53:08.800 --> 53:16.560
And we have no frigging idea why it's there. Another big mystery. Another reason it's fun

53:16.560 --> 53:24.720
to be a physicist. And if it is there, why should it be so small? Why should there be so little?

53:24.720 --> 53:30.880
Why should it have hid itself from us? Why shouldn't there be enough of it to substantially

53:31.680 --> 53:36.800
curve the space between us and the moon? Why did there have to be such a

53:38.560 --> 53:42.640
small amount that only the crazy best astronomers in the world could find it?

53:43.520 --> 53:51.120
Well, can't the same thing be said about all the constants? Can't that be said about gravity? Can't

53:51.120 --> 53:54.720
that be said about the speed of light? Why is the speed of light so slow?

53:56.000 --> 53:56.960
So fast.

53:56.960 --> 54:01.520
So slow. Relative to the size of the universe, can't it be faster?

54:04.720 --> 54:09.440
Well, the speed of light is a funny one because you could always choose units

54:10.880 --> 54:18.240
in which the speed of light is one. We measure it in kilometers per second, and it's 186,000

54:18.240 --> 54:24.800
or miles per second. It's 186,000 miles per second. But if we use different units,

54:25.520 --> 54:34.320
then we could make it one. But you can make dimensionless ratios. So you could say,

54:34.320 --> 54:42.000
why is the time scale set by the expansion of the universe so large compared to the time scale of

54:42.000 --> 54:47.280
a human life or so large compared to the time scale for a neutron to decay?

54:48.560 --> 54:53.120
I mean, ultimately, the temporal reference frame here is a human life.

54:53.120 --> 54:53.440
Maybe.

54:53.920 --> 54:57.840
Isn't that the important thing for us, descendants of apes? Isn't that a really

54:57.840 --> 55:05.200
important aspect of physics? Because we kind of experience the world, we intuit the world

55:05.200 --> 55:13.360
through the eyes of these biological organisms. I mean, I guess mathematics helps you escape that

55:13.360 --> 55:17.120
for a time, but ultimately, isn't that how you wander about the world?

55:18.160 --> 55:19.120
Absolutely.

55:19.360 --> 55:22.720
Like a human life, time is only 100 years. Because if you think of everything,

55:24.240 --> 55:27.440
if you're able to think in, I don't know, in billions of years,

55:29.840 --> 55:37.520
then maybe everything looks way different. Maybe universes are born and die, and maybe

55:37.520 --> 55:42.560
all of these physical phenomena become much more intuitive that we see at the grand scale

55:42.560 --> 55:47.680
of general relativity. Well, that is a little off the track here,

55:47.680 --> 55:52.400
but that certainly is one of the nice things about being a physicist. You spend a lot of

55:52.400 --> 55:59.040
time thinking about insides of black holes and billions of years in the future, and it sort of

56:00.880 --> 56:07.280
gets you away from the day to day into another fantastic realm.

56:10.000 --> 56:15.600
But I was answering your question about how there could be information in a black hole.

56:15.760 --> 56:22.480
Yes. So Einstein only gave us an approximate description,

56:22.480 --> 56:31.600
and we now have a theory that corrects it, string theory. And now sort of was the moment of truth.

56:31.600 --> 56:36.400
Well, when we first discovered string theory, we knew from the get-go that string theory would

56:36.400 --> 56:43.840
correct what Einstein said, just like Einstein corrected what Newton said. But we didn't

56:43.840 --> 56:51.360
understand it well enough to actually compute the correction, to compute how many gigabytes there

56:51.360 --> 57:02.960
were. And sometime in the early 90s, we began to understand the mathematics of string theory

57:02.960 --> 57:10.240
better and better. And it came to the point where it was clear that this was something

57:10.240 --> 57:16.480
we might be able to compute. And it was a kind of moment of truth for string theory, because

57:17.360 --> 57:28.000
if it hadn't given the answer that Bekenstein and Hawking said it had to give for consistency,

57:29.280 --> 57:34.480
string theory itself would have been inconsistent, and we wouldn't be doing this interview.

57:35.120 --> 57:38.080
Wow. That's a very dramatic statement.

57:41.440 --> 57:42.960
That's not the most dramatic thing.

57:45.040 --> 57:51.200
I mean, okay, that's very life and death. You mean that because string theory was

57:51.200 --> 57:54.400
central to your work at that time. Is that what you mean?

57:54.400 --> 57:56.400
Well, string theory would have been inconsistent.

57:58.240 --> 57:59.760
String theory would have been inconsistent.

57:59.760 --> 58:03.040
But those inconsistencies can give birth to other theories, like you said.

58:03.120 --> 58:06.960
The inconsistency, right. Something else could have happened. It would have been a major

58:10.080 --> 58:17.680
change in the way we think about string theory. And it was a good thing that one supposition that

58:17.680 --> 58:24.320
the world is made of strings solves two problems, not one. It solves the infinity problem and it

58:24.960 --> 58:33.200
solved the Hawking's problem. And also the way that it did it was very beautiful.

58:35.040 --> 58:43.120
It gave an alternate description. So alternate description of things are

58:43.360 --> 58:52.000
very common. I mean, to take a simple example, this bottle of water here is

58:52.880 --> 59:00.400
90% full. I could say it's 90% full. I could also say it's 10% empty. Those are obviously

59:00.400 --> 59:07.120
the same statement. And it's trivial to see that they're the same, but there are many statements

59:07.760 --> 59:15.440
that can be made in mathematics and mathematical physics that are equivalent but might take years

59:15.440 --> 59:21.040
to understand that they're equivalent and might take the invention or discovery of whole new

59:21.040 --> 59:25.840
fields of mathematics to prove they're equivalent. And this was one of those.

59:26.720 --> 59:33.840
We found an alternate description of certain black holes in string theory,

59:34.480 --> 59:41.600
which we could prove was equivalent. And it was a description of the black hole as a hologram

59:42.800 --> 59:50.240
that can be thought of a holographic plate that could be thought of as sitting on the surface

59:50.240 --> 59:57.040
of the black hole. And the interior of the black hole itself sort of arises as a projection,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:05.040
or the near horizon region of the black hole arises as a projection of that holographic plate.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:12.000
So the two descriptions were the hologram, the three-dimensional image, and the holographic

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:19.840
plate. And the hologram is what Einstein discovered and the holographic plate is what we discovered.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:29.200
And this idea that you could describe things very, very concretely in string theory in these two

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:39.520
different languages, of course, took off and was applied to many different contexts within string

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:45.360
theory. So you mentioned the infinity problem and the Hawking problem. Which Hawking problem?

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:51.680
The black hole destroys information or which Hawking problem are we talking about?

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:56.240
Well, there's really two Hawking problems. They're very closely related.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:08.640
One is, how does the black hole store the information? And that is the one that we

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:20.480
solved in some cases. So it's sort of like your smartphone. How does it store its 64 gigabytes?

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:25.760
Well, you rip the cover off and you count the chips and there's 64 of them, each with a gigabyte,

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:33.440
and you know there's 64 gigabytes. But that does not solve the problem of how you get information

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:40.240
in and out of your smartphone. You have to understand a lot more about the Wi-Fi and the

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:47.200
internet and the cellular. And that's where Hawking radiation, this prediction starts.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:54.000
That's where Hawking radiation comes in. And that problem of how the information gets in and out,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.320
you can't, you couldn't have explained how information gets in and out of an iPhone without

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:06.480
first explaining how it's stored in the first place. So just to clarify, the storage

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:13.280
is on the plate, on the holographic plate, and then it projects somehow inside the...

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.920
The bulk, the space time is the hologram.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:23.760
The hologram. But man, I mean, do you have an intuitive, when you sit late at night and you

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:28.320
stare at the stars, do you have an intuitive understanding of what a holographic plate is?

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.280
Like that there's two dimensions, projections that store information?

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:44.080
How a black hole could store information on a holographic plate,

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:53.040
I think we do understand in great mathematical detail and also intuitively. And it's very much

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:59.520
like an ordinary hologram where you have a holographic plate and it contains all the

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:05.680
information. You shine a light through it and you get an image which looks three-dimensional.

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.920
Yeah, but why should there be a holographic plate?

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.240
Why should there be?

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.040
Yeah, why?

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:23.120
That is the great thing about being a theoretical physicist is anybody can very quickly stump you

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.680
with going to the next level of why's.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.880
Yeah, why's is kind of blue, I can just keep asking.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:32.080
Yeah, you could just keep asking and it won't take you very long to.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:41.280
So the trick in being a theoretical physics is finding the questions that you can answer.

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:50.160
So the questions that we think we might be able to answer now and we've partially answered is that

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:59.040
there is a holographic explanation for certain kinds of things in string theory.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:04.640
We've answered that. Now we'd like to take what we've learned and that's

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:11.200
what I've mostly been doing for the last 15, 20 years. I haven't really been working so much

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:18.400
on string theory proper. I've been sort of taking the lessons that we learned in string theory

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:27.600
and trying to apply them to the real world, assuming only what we know for sure about the

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:33.920
real world. So on this topic, you co-wrote, co-authored a paper with Stephen Hawking called

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:39.040
Soft Hair on Black Holes that makes the argument against Hawking's original prediction that black

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:43.760
holes destroy information. Can you explain this paper and the title?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:56.960
Yeah. Okay. So first of all, the hair on black holes is a word that was coined by the greatest

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:02.400
phrase master in the history of physics, John Wheeler, invented the word black hole.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:11.040
And he also said that he made the statement that black holes have no hair.

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:20.640
That is, every black hole in the universe is described just by its mass and spin.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:32.960
They can also rotate, as was later shown by Kerr. And this is very much unlike a star.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:42.400
Right? Every star of the same mass is different in a multitude of different ways,

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:51.280
different chemical compositions, different motions of the individual molecules. Every star in the

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:59.440
universe, even of the same mass, is different in many, many different ways. Black holes are all

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:04.720
the same. And that means when you throw something in Einstein's description of them,

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:13.360
which we think must be corrected. And if you throw something into a black hole,

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:23.680
it gets sucked in. And if you throw in a red book or a blue book, the black hole gets a little

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:30.320
bigger, but there's no way within Einstein's theory of telling how they're different.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:41.600
And that was one of the assumptions that Hawking made in his 1974-75

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:50.720
papers in which he concluded that black holes destroy information. You can throw encyclopedias,

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:57.200
thesis defenses, the Library of Congress. It doesn't matter. It's going to behave exactly

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:04.640
the same uniform way. Yeah. So what Hawking and I showed, and also Malcolm Perry,

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:16.960
is that one has to be very careful about what happens at the boundary of the black hole.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:24.400
And this gets back to something I mentioned earlier about when two things which are related

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:36.080
by a coordinate transformation are and are not equivalent. And what we showed is that there are

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:43.280
very subtle imprints when you throw something into a black hole. There are very subtle imprints left

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:50.400
on the horizon of the black hole, which you can read off at least partially what went in.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:08:03.600
So this invalidates Stephen's original argument that the information is destroyed.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:10.240
And that's the soft hair. That's the soft hair. Right. And soft is the word that is used in physics

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:16.320
for things which have very low energy. And these things actually carry no energy.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:19.680
There are things in the universe which carry no energy.

01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:26.960
You said, I think to Sean Carroll, by the way, everyone should go check out Sean Carroll's

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.600
Mindscape podcast. It's incredible. And Sean Carroll is an incredible person. I think you

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:36.400
said there, maybe in a paper, I have a quote. You said that a soft particle is a particle

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:42.000
that has zero energy, just like you said now. And when the energy goes to zero, because the

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:48.000
energy is proportionate to the wavelength, it's also spread over an infinitely large distance.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.920
If you like, it's spread over the whole universe. It somehow runs off to the boundary. What we

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:59.520
learned from that is that if you add a zero energy particle to the vacuum, you get a new state. And

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:07.520
so there are infinitely many vacua, plural for vacuum, which can be thought of as

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:13.360
being different from one another by the addition of soft photons or soft gravitons.

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:21.120
Right. Can you elaborate on this wild idea? If you like, it spreads over the whole universe.

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.280
When the energy goes to zero, because the energy is proportionate to the wavelength,

01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.520
it also spreads over an infinitely large distance. If you like, it's spread over the

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:35.760
whole universe. It's spread over the whole universe. Can you explain these soft gravitons

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:47.040
and photons? Yeah. So the soft gravitons and photons have been known about since the 60s,

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:53.280
but exactly what we're supposed to do with them or how we're supposed to think about them

01:09:55.280 --> 01:10:06.080
I think has been well understood only recently. And in quantum mechanics, the energy of a particle

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.640
is proportional to Planck's constant times its wavelength.

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:19.840
So when the energy goes to zero, the wavelength goes to infinity. Now, if something has

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:28.240
zero energy and it's spread all over the universe, in what sense is it actually there?

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:38.800
That's been the confusing thing to make a precise statement about when something is and isn't there.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:46.800
Now, the simplest way of seeing, so people might have taken the point of view

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:55.360
that if it has zero energy and is spread all over the universe, it's not there. We can ignore it.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:05.520
But if you do this, you'll get into trouble. And one of the ways that you'll get into trouble

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:10.560
is that even though it has zero energy, it doesn't have zero angular momentum.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:19.120
If it's a photon, it always has angular momentum 1. If it's a graviton, it's angular momentum 2.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:31.280
So you can't say that the state of the system with the zero energy photon should be identified

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:37.040
with the one without the zero energy photon, that we can just ignore them because then you will

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:44.800
conclude that angular momentum is not conserved. And if angular momentum is not conserved, things

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:53.200
won't be consistent. And of course, you can have a lot of these things and typically you do get a

01:11:53.200 --> 01:12:01.760
lot of them. And you can actually do a calculation that shows that every time you scatter two

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:07.840
particles, you create an infinite number of them. Infinite number of the zero energy ones.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:15.360
And they're somehow everywhere, but they also contain information or they're able to store

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:20.560
information. And they're able to store information. They're able to store an arbitrary large amount

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:29.360
of information. So what these things really do, one way of thinking of them is they rush off to

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:34.560
the edges of the universe, spreading out all over the space. It's like saying they rush off

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:41.760
to the edge of the universe. And that includes, if the interior of the black hole is not considered

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:48.560
part of the universe, that includes the edge of the black hole. So we need to set up our

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:57.280
description of physics so that all the things that are conserved are still conserved in the

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:01.920
way that we're describing them. And that will not be true if we ignore these things. We have

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:08.640
to keep careful track of these things. And people had been sloppy about that. And we learned how to

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:15.840
be very precise and careful about it. And once you're being precise, you can actually answer

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:21.040
this kind of very problematic thing that Hawking suggested, that black holes destroy information.

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:29.920
Well, what we showed is that there's an error in the argument that all black holes are the same

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:38.560
because they hadn't kept track of these very subtle things. And whether or not

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:47.440
this is the key error in the argument remains to be seen, or whether this is a technical point.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.280
Yes. But it is an error.

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.160
It is an error.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.840
And Hawking obviously agreed with it.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:14:02.480
Hawking agreed with it. And he was sure that this was the critical error and that understanding

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:08.800
this would get us the whole story. And that could well be.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.160
What was it like working with Stephen Hawking on this particular

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.920
problem? Because it's kind of a whole journey, right?

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:33.440
Well, I love the guy. He's so passionate about physics. His oneness with the problem.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.560
So his mind is all occupied by the world.

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:44.960
Yeah. And let me tell you, there's a lot of other things with his illness and with his celebrity.

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.440
A lot of other things.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:53.920
A lot of distractions pulling at his mind. He's still there.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:15:01.520
That's right. I remember him turning down tea with Lady Gaga so we could spend another hour on paper.

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:12.160
That, my friends, is dedication. What did you learn about physics? What did you learn about life

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.200
from having worked with Stephen Hawking?

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:20.080
Well, he was one of my great teachers. Of course, he's older than me and I was reading his

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:35.040
textbooks in graduate school. And I learned a lot about relativity from him. I learned about

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.720
passion for a problem. I learned about

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:50.480
not caring what other people think. Physics is an interesting culture. Even if you make a

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:59.440
great discovery like Hawking did, people don't believe everything you say. In fact,

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:11.440
people love to disagree. It's a culture that cherishes disagreement. He kept ahead with

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:14.960
what he believed in. Sometimes he was right and sometimes he was wrong.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.640
Do you feel pressure from the community? For example, with string theory,

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:25.920
it was very popular for a time. There's a bit of criticism or it's less popular now. Do you feel

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:32.240
the forces of the community as it moves in and out of different fields? How difficult is it to

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:36.480
stay intellectually and mathematically independent from the community?

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:54.320
Personally, I'm lucky. I'm well equipped for that. When I started out in graduate school,

01:16:54.320 --> 01:17:00.160
the problem of quantum gravity was not considered interesting.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.320
You still did it anyway.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:07.600
I still did it anyway. I'm a little bit of a contrarian, I guess, and I think that has

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:19.760
served me well. People are always sort of disagreeing with me. They're usually right,

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.440
but I'm right enough.

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.240
Like you said, the contradiction ultimately paves the path of discovery.

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:31.360
Let me ask you just on this tension. We've been dancing between physics and mathematics.

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:38.240
What to you is an interesting line you can draw between the two? You have done some very

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:43.200
complicated mathematics in your life to explore the laws of nature. What's the difference between

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:46.080
physics and mathematics to you?

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:54.400
Well, I love math. I think my first love is physics, and the math that I've done,

01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:58.320
because it was needed.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.040
In service of physics.

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:08.240
In service of physics, but then, of course, in the heat of it, it has its own appeal.

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:12.000
In the heat of it. I like it. Sure.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:18.960
It has its own appeal, and I certainly enjoyed it. Ultimately, I would like to think,

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:25.680
I wouldn't say I believe, but I would like to think that there's no difference between

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:34.000
physics and mathematics, that all mathematics is realized in the physical world, and

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:39.600
all physics has a firm mathematical basis, that they're really the same thing.

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:49.120
Why would there be math that had no physical manifestation? It seems a little odd, right?

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:54.000
You have two kinds of math, some that are relevant to the real world.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.560
Well, they don't have to be contradictory, but can't you not have mathematical objects

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:03.120
that are not at all connected to the physical world? This is to the question of is math

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:11.360
discovered or invented? To you, math is discovered, and there's a deep linkage between the two.

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:19.360
Do you find it all compelling, these ideas, something like Max Tegmark, where our universe

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:25.600
is actually a fundamentally mathematical object, that our universe is mathematical,

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.440
fundamentally mathematical in nature?

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:35.440
My expertise is that a physicist doesn't add anything to that.

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:53.920
I was once very interested in philosophy. I like questions that can be answered.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:20:01.120
That it's not obvious what the answer is, and that you can find an answer to the question,

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:08.720
and everybody will agree what the answer is, and that there's an algorithm for getting there.

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:16.080
Not that these other questions aren't interesting, and they don't somehow have a way of

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:26.640
presenting themselves, but to me, the interesting thing is motion in what we know, learning more,

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:32.640
and understanding things that we didn't understand before, things that seemed

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:39.360
totally confusing, having them seem obvious. That's wonderful. I think those questions are

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:47.280
there. I would even go further, the whole multiverse. I don't think there's too much

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:51.520
concrete we're ever going to be able to say about it.

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:58.080
This is fascinating because you spent so much time in string theory, which is devoid from a

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:04.480
connection to the physical world for a long time. Not devoid, but it travels in a mathematical world

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:12.400
that seems to be beautiful and consistent, and seems to indicate that it could be a good model

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:17.840
of the laws of nature. It's still traveling independently because it's very difficult to

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:22.800
experimentally verify, but there's a promise laden in it in the same way multiverse, or

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:30.320
you can have a lot of very far out there questions, where your gut instinct intuition says that maybe

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:35.920
in 50, 100, 200 years, you'll be able to actually have strong experimental validation.

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:45.680
I think that with string theory, I don't think it's likely that we could measure it,

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:54.400
but we could get lucky. In other words, just to take an example, about 10 or 20 years ago,

01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:01.280
it was thought that they had seen a string in the sky and that it was seen by

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:11.040
doubled stars that were gravitationally lensed around the gravitational field produced by some

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:14.400
long string. There was a line of double lensed, now the signal went away.

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:21.440
People were hoping that they'd seen a string, and it could be a fundamental string that

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:27.760
somehow gotten stretched, and that would be some evidence for string theory. There was also bicep

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:39.200
two, which the experiment was wrong, but it could have happened. It could have happened that we got

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:44.320
lucky, and this experiment was able to make direct measurements, certainly would have been

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:50.800
measurements of quantum gravity, if not string theory. It's a very logical possibility

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:54.960
that we could get experimental evidence from string.

01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:01.920
That is a very different thing than saying, do this experiment, here's a billion dollars,

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:04.560
and after you do it, we'll know whether or not strings are real.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:12.720
But I think it's a crucial difference. It's measurable in principle, and we don't see

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:23.120
how to get from here to there. If we see how to get from here to there, in my eyes, it's boring.

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:29.200
When I was a graduate student, they knew how to measure the Higgs boson.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:39.200
It took 40 years, but they did it. Not to say that stuff is boring, I don't want to say that stuff

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:46.240
is boring. But when Magellan set out, he didn't know we could get around the world.

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:51.280
There was no map. I don't know how we're going to

01:23:54.640 --> 01:24:01.120
connect in a concrete way all these ideas of string theory to the real world.

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:08.240
When I started out in graduate school, I said, what is the most interesting problem

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:15.600
that there might be progress on in 60 years?

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:30.000
I think it could be that in another 30 years, that maybe we'll learn that we have understood

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:37.760
how black holes store information. That doesn't seem wild that we're able to abstract what we

01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:52.000
learned from string theory and show that it's operative. When Bose and Einstein predicted it,

01:24:52.960 --> 01:25:00.560
when was that, the 30s maybe, early 30s, there were 20 orders of magnitude that were needed

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:07.440
in order to improvement, in order to measure it. They did 50 years later.

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:13.680
I think you couldn't have guessed how that had happened, how they could have gotten that.

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:21.840
It could happen that I don't think we're going to see the heterotic string spectrum at an accelerator,

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:33.120
but it could be that things come around in an interesting way and somehow it comes together.

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:41.760
The fact that we can't see to the end isn't a reason not to do it. What did they do when

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:48.160
they were trying to find the Pacific? They took every route. They just tried everything. That's

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:57.040
what we're doing. I'm taking the one that my nose tells me is the best. Other people are taking

01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:05.360
other ones and that's good because we need every person taking every route. If somebody on another

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:12.640
route finds something that looks really promising, I'm going to make a portage over the mountain and

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:22.400
get on their stream. The fact that you don't see the experiment now isn't to me a reason to

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:33.280
give up on what I view as the most fundamental paradox in present physics, 2021st century physics.

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:38.000
Absolutely. You can see that it's possible. You just don't know the way. That's what I mean

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.400
where some of the philosophical questions could be formulated in a way that's explorable

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:50.400
scientifically. Some of the stuff we've talked about, but for example, this topic that's become

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:54.000
more okay to talk about, which is the topic of consciousness.

01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:59.680
To me as an artificial intelligence person, that's a very practically interesting topic,

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:05.600
but there's also philosophers. Sean Carroll loves to argue against them,

01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:09.120
but there's some philosophers that are panpsychists. I'm not against philosophers.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:17.760
It's just not as fun. It's not as fun. They start a little flame of a fire going

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:25.120
that some of those flames, I think, eventually become physics, so eventually become something

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:31.120
that we can really ... Having them around is really important because you'll discover something by

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:36.960
modeling and exploring black holes that's really weird, and having these ideas around,

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:42.320
like the ideas of panpsychists that consciousness could be a fundamental force of nature.

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:46.480
Just even having that crazy idea swimming around in the background

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:51.440
could really spark something where you're missing something completely.

01:27:53.360 --> 01:28:00.400
That's where the philosophy done right, I think, is very useful. That's where even these thought

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:05.680
experiments, which is very fun in the tech sci-fi world that we live in a simulation,

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:14.560
taking a perspective of the universe as a computer, as a computational system,

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:18.640
the process of information, which is a pretty intuitive notion, but you can,

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:24.960
just even reframing it that way for yourself, could really open up some different way of thinking.

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.880
Could be. Then you have,

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:32.720
I don't know if you're familiar with Stephen Wolfram's work of cellular automata and complexity.

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.880
Yeah, I did a podcast with Stephen.

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:43.360
Stephen, that's awesome. To me, forget physics, forget all that, cellular automata make no sense.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:50.400
They're so beautiful. From simple rules, you can create complexity. He wrote a book,

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:57.520
A New Kind of Science, basically hinting at, which a lot of people have hinted at,

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:02.560
we don't have a good way to talk about these objects. We can't figure out what is happening

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:06.800
here. These simple, these trivial rules can create incredible complexity.

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.160
He's totally right about that.

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:08.560
Yeah.

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:15.280
Physicists, I guess, don't know what to do with that. Don't know what to do with cellular

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:19.520
automata because you can describe the simple rules that govern the system,

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:24.720
but how complexity can emerge, incredible complexity.

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:31.120
Yeah. Of course, Wolfram's version of that is that physicists will never be able to describe it.

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:35.840
Right. Yeah, exactly. He tries to prove that it's impossible. What do you make of that?

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:43.200
What do you make about the tension of being a physicist and potentially not being able to,

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:49.040
it's like Freud or somebody that maybe, Sigmund Freud, maybe you'll never be able to actually

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:55.200
describe the human psyche. Is that a possibility for you, that you will never be able to get to

01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:58.400
the core fundamental description of the laws of nature?

01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:04.320
Sure. Yeah. So I had this conversation with Weinberg.

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:08.480
Yeah. How'd it go?

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:14.640
So Weinberg has this book called Dreams of a Final Theory.

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:22.640
And I had this conversation with him. I said, why do you think there's ever going to be a

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:26.480
final theory? Why should there ever be a final theory? I mean, what does that mean?

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.360
Do physics departments shut down? We've solved everything.

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:37.760
Doesn't it seem that every time we answer some old questions, we'll

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:42.240
just find new ones and that it will just keep going on forever and ever?

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:47.920
He said, well, that's what they used to say about the Nile. They were never going to find the end.

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:53.760
Then one day they found it. Yeah.

01:30:53.760 --> 01:31:04.880
So I don't know. String theory doesn't look like a candidate to me for a final theory.

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:11.200
As it stands now. It doesn't get to the bottom of the well, into the sides, into the whole thing.

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:16.960
Yeah. It seems to me that even if we kind of solved it and we did experiments,

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:21.760
there still would be more questions like, why are there four dimensions instead of six? It

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:28.000
doesn't seem to have anything in it that would explain that. You can always hope

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:31.680
that there's something that we don't know about string theory that will explain it.

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:40.960
But it still doesn't look like it's going to answer every question. Why is there one time,

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:49.360
not two? I don't even know what it would mean to answer every question.

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:54.560
To answer every question, obviously. When you refer to the theory of everything,

01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:05.280
if it exists, it would be a theory that allows you to predict precisely the behavior of objects in

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:10.640
the universe and their movement. What about them, their movement?

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:17.120
Precisely no matter the object. Right. That's true. That would be a really

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:26.000
interesting state of affairs if we could predict everything but not necessarily understand everything.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:33.200
For example, let's just forget about gravity. We're not too far from that situation.

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:41.040
If we forget about gravity, the standard model in principle, given a big enough computer,

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:48.480
predicts almost everything. But if you look at the standard model,

01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:54.160
it's kind of a laundry list with neutrino masses and all that stuff. There are hundreds of free

01:32:54.160 --> 01:33:01.360
parameters. Where do they come from? Is there an organizing principle? Is there some further

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:10.080
unification? Being able to predict everything is not the only goal that physicists have.

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:14.640
On the way to trying to predict, you're trying to understand. That's actually

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:20.000
probably the goal is to understand. Yeah. Right. We're more interested in

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:26.160
understanding than actually doing the predictions. But the predictions are more

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:33.920
focusing on how to make predictions is a good way to improve your understanding because you

01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:37.520
know you've understood it if you can do the predictions. One of the interesting

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:45.200
things that might come to a head with is artificial intelligence. There's an increasing use of AI

01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:52.400
in physics. We might live in a world where AI would be able to predict perfectly what's happening.

01:33:53.360 --> 01:34:00.640
And so as physicists, you'll have to come to the fact that you're actually not that interested in

01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:05.760
prediction. I mean, it's very useful, but you're interested in really understanding the deep laws

01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:10.400
of nature versus a perfect predictor. Like you want to play chess. But even within AI,

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:18.160
AI people are trying to understand what it is that the AI bots have learned in order to

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:23.280
produce whatever they produce. For sure. But you still don't understand deeply, especially

01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:29.680
because they're getting, especially language models. If you're paying attention, the systems

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:33.360
that are able to generate text, they're able to have conversations. Chad GPT is the recent

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:38.880
manifestation of that. They just seem to know everything. They're trained on the internet.

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:46.320
They seem to be very, very good at something that looks like reasoning. They're able to generate,

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:50.240
they're able to generate, you can ask them questions. They can answer questions. It just

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:56.480
feels like this thing is intelligent, right? And I could just see that being possible with physics.

01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:01.280
You ask any kind of physical question and it'll be able to very precise about a particular star

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:06.240
system or a particular black hole. It'll say, well, these are the numbers. It'll perfectly predict.

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:13.760
And then sure, you can understand how the neural network is, the architecture is structured.

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:17.840
Actually, for most of them now, they're very simple. You can understand what data is trained

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:21.760
on. Huge amount of data. You're getting a huge amount of data from a very nice telescope or

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:29.360
something. But it seems to predict everything perfectly. How a banana falls when you throw it.

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:34.640
Everything is perfectly predicted. You still don't have a deep understanding of what governs

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:40.080
the whole thing. And maybe you can ask it a question. It'll be some kind of Hitchhiker's Guide

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:47.600
to the Galaxy type answer. It's a funny world we live in. Of course, it's also possible that

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:55.680
there's no such deep, simple governing laws of nature behind the whole thing. There's something

01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:05.040
in us humans that wants it there to be, but doesn't have to be, right? Again, you already

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:10.080
bet the farm, but if you were to have a second farm, do you think there is a theory of everything

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:22.640
that we might get at simple laws that govern the whole thing? Honestly, I don't know, but I'm pretty

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:29.520
confident that if there is, we won't get to it in my lifetime. I don't think we're near it.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:35.360
But doesn't it feel like the fact that we have the laws we do that are relatively simple already,

01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:41.920
that's kind of incredible. There seems to be simple laws that govern things, right?

01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:51.600
By a theory of everything, you mean a theory of everything, an algorithm to predict everything.

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:53.360
But a simple algorithm.

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:59.920
A relatively simple algorithm to predict everything. For me, it would be a sad day

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:05.680
if we arrived at that without answering some deeper questions.

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:14.960
Sure, of course. But one of the questions before we arrived there, we can ask,

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:22.880
does such a destination even exist? Because asking the question and the possible answers

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:29.440
in the process of trying to answer that question is in itself super interesting. Is it even

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:34.480
possible to get there where there's an E equals MC squared type of, there's a function. Okay,

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:40.880
you can have many parameters, but a finite number of parameter function that can predict a lot of

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:48.160
things about our universe. Well, okay, but just to sort of throw one thing in, in order to answer

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:56.720
every question, we would need a theory of the origin of the universe. And that is a huge

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:06.800
task, right? And the fact that the universe seems to have a beginning defies everything

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:16.000
we know and love. Because one of the basic principles of physics is determinism,

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:24.640
that the past follows from, the present follows from the past, the future follows from the present,

01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:30.800
so on. But if you have the origin of the universe, if you have a big bang, that means before that,

01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:35.520
there was nothing. You can't have a theory in which something follows from nothing.

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:39.920
So somehow- Sounds like you don't like singularities.

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:45.680
Well- I thought for somebody that works with black holes, you would get used to them by now.

01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:51.440
No, no, I like this because it's so hard to understand. I like it because it's hard to

01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:57.360
understand, but it's really challenging us. I don't think we're close to solving that problem.

01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:02.240
So even- And string theory has basically had nothing,

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:08.880
there's been almost nothing interesting said about that in the last many decades.

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:13.920
So string theory hasn't really looked at the big bang. It hasn't really tried to get to the origin.

01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:19.920
Not successfully. There aren't compelling papers that lots of people have read that

01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:27.120
people have taken it up and tried to go at it, but there aren't compelling.

01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:34.960
String theory doesn't seem to have a trick that helps us with that puzzle.

01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:38.240
Do you think we'll be able to sneak up to the origin of the universe,

01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:46.720
reverse engineer it from experimental, from theoretical perspective? If we can, what would

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:49.520
be the trajectory? You've already gotten yourself in trouble,

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:56.320
because you used the word reverse engineer. So if you're going to reverse engineer, that means

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:04.080
forward engineering means that you take the present and determine the future. Reverse engineering

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:06.960
means that you take the present and determine the past.

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:13.520
Estimate the past, but yes, sure. But if the past was nothing,

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:18.640
how are you ever going to reverse engineer to nothing? That's hard to do.

01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:23.600
Run up against the nothing, right? Until you have mathematical models that break down nicely

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.440
to where you can actually start to infer things.

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:32.800
Let's work on it. No, but do you think that-

01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:42.880
Maybe, but people have tried to do things like that, but it's not something that we're getting

01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:47.120
A pluses in. Sure. Let's pretend we live in a world

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:52.960
where in a hundred years, we have an answer to that. What would that answer look like?

01:40:54.240 --> 01:41:02.880
What department is that from? What fields led us there? Not what fields, what set of ideas

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:10.160
in theoretical physics? Is it experimental? Is it theoretical? What can you imagine could

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:14.240
possibly lead us there? Is it through gravitational waves and some kind of observations there?

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:19.040
Is it investigation of black holes? Is it simulation of universes? Is it

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:26.000
maybe we start creating black holes somehow? I don't know. Maybe some kind of high energy

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:33.600
physics type of experiments? Well, I have some late night ideas about

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:38.480
that that aren't really ready for prime time. Okay, sure. But you have some ideas.

01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:47.040
And many people do. It could be that some of the advances in quantum information theory are

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:54.480
important in that they kind of go beyond taking quantum systems and

01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:58.560
just replicating themselves, but combining them with others.

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:05.840
Do you think since you highlighted the issue with time and the origin of the universe,

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:12.320
do you think time is fundamental or emergent? I think ultimately it has to be emergent.

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:15.520
Yeah, what does it mean for time to be emergent?

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:27.040
Well, let's review what it means for space to be emergent. What it means for space to be emergent

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:37.600
is that you have a holographic plate and you shine some light that's moving in space

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:45.760
and it produces an image which contains an extra spatial dimension and time just goes along for

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:56.880
the ride. So what we'd like to do, and indeed there is some rather concrete work in this direction,

01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:03.200
though again, I would say even within our stringing community, we're not getting A pluses on these

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:16.240
efforts. What we'd like to do is to see examples in which the extra space-time dimension

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:24.400
is time. In other words, usually what we understand very well mathematically is

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:36.640
how to take systems in some number of space-time dimensions and rewrite them as a plate

01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:44.000
in fewer space dimensions. What we'd like to do is to take systems with one time in some number

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:50.480
of space dimensions and to rewrite them as a system that had only space dimensions in it,

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:57.120
had no time evolution. And there are some fairly concrete ideas about how to do that,

01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:03.840
but they're not universally accepted even within the stringy community.

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:13.120
But isn't it wild to you for it to be emergent? How do we intuit these kinds of ideas as human

01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:17.760
beings for whom space and time seems as fundamental as apples and oranges?

01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:22.800
They're both illusions. They're both illusions, even time.

01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:29.840
You co-authored a paper titled, Photon Rings Around Warped Black Holes. First of all,

01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:39.600
whoever writes your paper titles, you like the soft hair and the term black hole and the big bang,

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:43.280
you're very good at coming up with titles yourself. Anyway, you co-authored a paper

01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:48.560
titled, Photon Rings Around Warped Black Holes. In it, you write, quote, recent work has identified

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:53.040
a number of emergent symmetries related to the intricate self-similar structure of the photon

01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:57.680
ring. So what are photon rings? What are some interesting characteristics of a photon ring?

01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:08.640
So that was a paper with Dan Kapitz and Alex Lipsaska that just came out. And this paper is

01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:17.680
kind of a wonderful example of what happens when you start to talk to people who are

01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:26.320
way out of your comfort zone of no different stuff and look at the world a different way.

01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:36.480
Some two or three years ago, I'm part of the Black Hole Initiative and I'm also part of this

01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:43.200
event horizon telescope collaboration that took the famous, though I had nothing to do

01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:54.320
with the experiment, but that took the famous picture of the donut of M87 and through conversations

01:45:54.320 --> 01:46:03.520
with them, which started out in an effort to understand the image that they'd seen.

01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:08.960
So it's a great thing for somebody like me, a theoretical physicist,

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:19.840
seemingly lost in string land to be presented with an actual picture of a black hole.

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:20.480
And ask what?

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:33.040
And to be asked, what can we learn from this? So with some help from Michael Johnson and Alex

01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:37.920
Lipsaska and a bunch of other people at the Venturize and Collaboration,

01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:49.840
we came up with a fantastic, beautiful answer using Einstein's theory that is both shaping

01:46:49.840 --> 01:47:00.720
the future of now, it is shaping the future of improved black hole photographs. What do you

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:05.680
want to concentrate on in the photograph? You just point at the sky and click? No,

01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:14.880
you don't do that. You optimize for various features. And it's both shaping that and

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:23.200
in the process of talking to them and thinking about how light behaves around a black hole,

01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:30.160
the black holes just have so many magic tricks and they do so many weird things.

01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:37.600
And the photon ring is among the weirdest of them. We understood this photon ring,

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:47.280
and in the process of this, we said, hey, this photon ring has got to be telling us something

01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:52.960
about the puzzle of where the holographic plate is

01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:02.160
outside of an ordinary astrophysical black hole. And we nailed it for the stringy black holes,

01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:06.800
but they have a somewhat different character.

01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:10.320
What's a stringy black hole? The black holes that describe a string?

01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:15.760
The black holes that are contained in string theory and they have different structure in them.

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:20.480
Well, but actually, can we step back? So what was the light in the image taken in 2019?

01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:24.800
Not taken in 2019, presented in 2019.

01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:34.080
Here's the puzzle. What they really saw, so the black holes tend to gather stuff

01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:42.000
that swirls around it. And they don't know what that stuff is made of. They don't know

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.120
what its temperature is. They don't know what kind of magnetic fields there are around there.

01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:55.280
So the form of the image has a lot of unknowns in it that it's dependent on

01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:58.800
many other things other than the geometry of the black hole.

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:09.680
So most of what you're learning is about the stuff. Now the stuff, the swirling stuff,

01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:17.120
the hot swirling stuff is interesting as hell, but it's not as interesting as the black hole,

01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:23.520
which are the most, in my view, the most interesting things in the universe.

01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:28.000
So you don't want to just learn about the stuff. You want to learn about

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:30.880
the black hole that is swirling around.

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:38.400
At the very first step, at the very primitive level, this is just a big leap for human

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:45.040
civilization to be able to see a black hole. And the way you can see it is because there's

01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:51.120
stuff around it. You don't get to learn much about the black hole. You get to learn more

01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:55.680
about the stuff just from the image. Yeah. But you're not going to learn

01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:59.360
about the details before you've even seen it. Because there's too many parameters,

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:06.080
there's too many variables that govern the stuff. Yeah. So then we found a very wonderful way

01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:13.360
to learn about the black hole. And here's how it works. A black hole is a mirror.

01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:23.520
And the way it's a mirror is if light, a photon bounces off your face towards the black hole,

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:27.520
and it goes straight to the black hole, just falls in, you never see it again.

01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:35.920
But if it just misses the black hole, it'll swing around the back and come back to you.

01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:42.320
And you see yourself from the photon that went around the back of the black hole.

01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:49.360
But not only can that happen, the photon can swing around twice

01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:56.640
and come back. So you actually see an infinite number of copies of yourself.

01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:00.640
Like with a little bit of a delay. With a little bit of a delay, right.

01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:05.760
This is awesome. Yeah. And in fact,

01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:10.320
I mean, we're not used to an object that bends light like that, right? Yeah.

01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:16.160
So you're going to get some trippier effects. And in fact, one of my students has made a really

01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:22.320
awesome computer animation of this, which I'm going to show at a public lecture in a couple

01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:28.480
weeks where the audience will see infinitely many copies of themselves swirling around the black

01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:37.760
hole. So a black hole is like a hall of mirrors, you know, like in a department store where you go

01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:42.080
and there's the three mirrors and you see infinitely many copies of yourself. Yeah.

01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:49.760
Think of the black hole as the mirror, you know, and you go in there with your clothes.

01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:53.200
If you want to know about your clothes, you just look at the direct image. You're not learning

01:51:53.200 --> 01:52:04.480
anything about the configuration of mirrors. But the relation of the image you see in front of you

01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:11.600
to the one you see at the side and the next one and then so on, depends only on the mirrors.

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:17.520
It doesn't matter what clothes you're wearing. So you can go there a thousand times wearing

01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:23.360
different clothes, but each time there will be the same relation between the subsequent images.

01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:32.160
And that is how we're going to learn about the black holes. We're going to take the stuff

01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:39.760
that is swirling around and we're going to tease out the subsequent images and look at their

01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:47.120
relation. And there's some very beautiful, really beautiful mathematics, which we were surprised

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:55.120
to realize with the volumes and volumes of papers on black holes and their properties,

01:52:55.120 --> 01:53:00.720
this particular, because it was a physical question that had never been asked in exactly

01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:05.520
this way. So basically you're looking at the relationship between the subsequent images.

01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:09.760
But those are ultimately formed by photons that are swirling around.

01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:15.040
Photons that are orbiting. So the photon ring are the photons that orbit around.

01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:24.240
And beyond. So like orbit and lose orbit. Wow. And that starts to give you, what can you possibly

01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:27.680
figure out mathematically about the black hole? The geometry of it?

01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:37.200
The geometry, the spin. And you can verify things behaving. We have never seen

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:46.720
a region of space-time with such high curvature. I mean, the region around a black hole is crazy.

01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:50.000
It's not like in this room. The curvature is everything.

01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:54.480
You spend probably enough time with the math and the photons. Can you

01:53:55.440 --> 01:54:00.400
put yourself in that space? So we're having a conversation in a pretty peaceful, comfortable

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:05.200
flat space. Are you able to put yourself in a place around a black hole?

01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:10.080
Yeah. I'm able to imagine that kind of thing. Yeah. So for example, and actually there's a

01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:22.880
wonderful movie, Interstellar. And in that movie, Kip Thorne, of course, is a great theoretical

01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:32.800
physicist, experimental, who later won the Nobel Prize for LEGO. And that movie is very accurate

01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:43.120
scientifically. And there's some funny statements in there that of the 100 million people

01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:51.200
who saw that movie, there can't be more than 10 or 20 understood about why Matthew McConaughey is

01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:59.200
ejecting the trash in a certain direction in order to... But for example, if I were a spinning

01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:04.080
black hole right here, if I was spinning fast enough, you wouldn't be able to stay still there.

01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:10.240
You'd have to be orbiting around like that. You'd have to have your microphone on a...

01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:16.320
But I wonder what the actual experience is because space itself is curved.

01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:18.720
Well, if space gets very curved, you get crushed.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.600
Body gets ripped apart because the forces are different on different parts of your body.

01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:26.880
Sure. Okay. So that would be...

01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:32.560
But it can be less curved so that the curvature is very noticeable, but you're not ripped apart.

01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:43.200
The fact that this was just nonchalantly stated is just beautiful. Like two biological systems

01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:50.320
discussing which level of curvature is required to rip apart said biological system. Very well.

01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:54.960
So you propose in the paper that a photon ring of a warped black hole

01:55:54.960 --> 01:56:02.800
is indeed part of the black hole hologram. A photon ring of a warped black hole is indeed

01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:10.240
part of the black hole hologram. So what can you intuit about the hologram

01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:17.840
and the holographic plate from looking at the photon rings?

01:56:18.400 --> 01:56:30.560
Okay. Well, this paper is exploring a new idea. It's not making a new

01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:41.760
discovery, so to speak. It's exploring an idea and the ins and outs of it and what might work

01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:49.360
and what might not. This photon ring, somehow everybody always thought that the holographic

01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:56.640
plate sat at the horizon of the black hole and that the quantum system that describes

01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:10.880
the black hole is inside the horizon. In fact, we think it's plausible and we give some evidence

01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:16.560
in some soluble examples. In this case, in an example in one lower dimension,

01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:23.280
where we can handle the equations better, that the quantum system that describes the black hole

01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:32.320
should correspond to a region of space-time which includes the photon ring. So it's bigger.

01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:36.960
So that would be the holographic plate.

01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:38.240
That would be the holographic plate.

01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:38.960
All of that.

01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:49.200
I mean, we didn't prove this. We put it out there, which hadn't really been considered

01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:56.800
previously. We put it out there and it does seem more plausible than the idea that it

01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:06.240
sits literally at the horizon. And it is a big outstanding problem of how you have a holographic

01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:10.000
reconstruction of black holes like M87.

01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:17.760
Do you think there could be further experimental data that helps explore some of these ideas that

01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:24.480
you have for photon rings and holographic plates through imaging and through high resolution images

01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:25.680
and also just more and more data?

01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:33.600
I wish so, but I don't think so. But what I think already has happened and will continue to happen

01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:45.200
is that there are many different ways that theorists and observers can interact.

01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:55.040
The gold standard is the theorist makes a prediction, the observer measures it and confirms

01:58:55.200 --> 01:59:04.720
it or the observer makes a discovery and the theorist explains it. But there's a lot less

01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:11.920
than that, which is really kind of the bread and butter. Those are dramatic moments when that

01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:17.840
happens. Those are once in a lifetime moments when that happens. But the bread and butter is more

01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:24.960
when it has already happened. They came to us and said, what is the interesting theoretical

01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:34.240
things we can understand in this swirl around the black hole? And we gave an answer and then

01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:42.880
that in turn jogged us to think about the holographic principle in the context of

01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:51.680
M87 a little bit differently. In the same vein, it's useful to talk to the philosophers and it's

01:59:51.680 --> 02:00:05.360
useful to talk to the mathematicians. We don't know where we're going. We just got to do everything.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:10.320
Let me ask you another sort of philosophical type question, but not really actually.

02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:14.960
It seems that thought experiments are used, so it's not just mathematics that makes progress

02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:19.920
in theoretical physics, but thought experiments do. They did for Einstein as well. They did for

02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:25.600
a lot of great physicists throughout history over the years. How's your ability to generate

02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:30.960
thought experiments or just your intuition about some of these weird things like quantum mechanics

02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:39.760
or string theory or quantum gravity or even general relativity? How's your ability to

02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:43.920
house your intuition improved over the years? Have you been able to make progress?

02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:49.840
The hard part in physics is most problems are

02:00:54.320 --> 02:01:00.800
either doable. Most problems are theoretical calculation that a theoretical physicist would

02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:10.320
do. There's no end of problems whose answer is uninteresting. It can be solved, but the answer is

02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:17.280
uninteresting. There's also no end of problems that are very interesting,

02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:23.520
some of which you've asked me, but we don't have a clue how to solve them.

02:01:23.680 --> 02:01:28.880
When first presented with a problem, almost every problem is one or the other.

02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:33.680
It's the jackpot when you find one that isn't one or the other.

02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:39.920
It seems like there's a gray area between the two, right? That's where you should be looking.

02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:44.560
Well, I wouldn't describe it as a gray area. I would describe it as a knife edge.

02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:48.160
It's a very small area.

02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:51.040
It's a very small area.

02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:57.280
There isn't a huge area with a sign. Here lie problems that are doable,

02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:58.720
and people want to know the answer.

02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:03.440
In some deep sense, that's where timing is everything with physics, with science,

02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:04.080
with discovery.

02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:12.560
Timing. I think earlier in my career, I erred more on the side of problems that were

02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:15.440
not solvable.

02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:17.520
The ambition of youth.

02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:27.040
What made you fall in love with physics at first, if we can go back to the early days?

02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:29.680
You said black holes were there in the beginning.

02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:33.200
Do you remember what really made you fall in love?

02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:38.400
I wanted to reach nirvana, and I sort of realized that wasn't going to happen.

02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:41.760
Then after that, I wanted to know the meaning of life.

02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:49.440
I realized I probably wasn't going to figure that out. Then I wanted to understand

02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:59.600
justice and socialism and world things. I couldn't figure those out either.

02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:04.800
Smaller and smaller problems.

02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:06.240
Smaller and smaller problems.

02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:13.360
And most of this, I'm talking about adolescence. But it was the biggest problem

02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:19.440
that I thought that there was a prospect of, but not 100%.

02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:31.360
I was definitely ready to spend my life in the wilderness knocking my head against the wall, but

02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:39.520
I haven't had to. I haven't solved them, but I've said enough interesting things that you're

02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:44.000
interviewing me. So I'm not in the wilderness.

02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:51.440
Do you remember the early days? Do you feel nostalgic when you think back to the ideas,

02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:59.200
the circumstances that led you down the path towards black holes, towards theoretical physics,

02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:03.200
towards the tools of physics, towards this really fascinating world of theoretical physics?

02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:09.680
Well, I wouldn't add nostalgia to it because

02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:29.680
it's not like a summer in Italy or something. There's results that are there.

02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:30.960
Sure.

02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:42.080
That's what's so gratifying. Of course, one's name disappears from these things.

02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:50.400
Unless you're Einstein or Newton or something, people are not going to remember my name in

02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:51.040
50 years.

02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:55.440
Basically, every name will be forgotten in hundreds of years.

02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:58.160
Yeah. Are you able to, by the way,

02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:04.960
love the exploration of ideas themselves without the names, the recognition?

02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:09.840
That's what I'm saying. I have not. I hope someday, but I have not.

02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:20.560
There are some experiments now to verify some of my predictions about properties of gravity and

02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:32.240
so on, but I have not. Most of what I've done, it could happen still. It's still a logical

02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:39.920
possibility that everything having to do with string theory and as we mentioned, I'm betting

02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:46.720
the farm that it's not, but it is indeed a logical possibility that people would say,

02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:54.800
can you believe Lex Friedman interviewed Elon Musk and Kenya West and then he interviewed

02:05:54.800 --> 02:06:03.440
Strominger who was working on this theory that just completely went into the toilet.

02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:09.600
With a wife I don't have, I'm going to make a public statement. She'll be on stage. I'll say,

02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:16.640
I'm really sorry I made this giant mistake of platforming this wild-eyed physicist

02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:21.040
that believed for decades in the power of theoretical physics. Yes. No.

02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:27.920
So that could happen. It could happen. It could happen. Of course, if that couldn't happen,

02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:30.640
it wouldn't be real exploration, right?

02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:31.140
Absolutely.

02:06:32.020 --> 02:06:41.380
And so, but I do take a lot of satisfaction that some of the things I discovered are,

02:06:42.340 --> 02:06:49.860
at the minimum, mathematical truths and they're still, so you don't have that sort of nostalgic

02:06:49.860 --> 02:07:00.260
feeling of it being something that was gone and I'm still making discoveries now that I'm

02:07:00.260 --> 02:07:08.340
as excited about. We'll see if they hold the test of time that stand the test of time that

02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:16.100
these other ones did, but that I'm as excited about as I was about those when I made them.

02:07:16.100 --> 02:07:18.740
I am easily excitable, as my friends will tell you.

02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:20.500
Well, one interesting thing about you is-

02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:23.540
And I have been very excited about things which turned out to be completely wrong.

02:07:24.100 --> 02:07:30.980
Well, the excitement is a precondition for breakthroughs. But you're also somebody like,

02:07:30.980 --> 02:07:35.380
just like you said, you don't have a cynical view of the modern state of physics.

02:07:36.740 --> 02:07:40.740
So there's a lot of people that glorify the early days of string theory and that all the

02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:48.420
things that we made in the 20s and so on. But you're saying this to you might be one of,

02:07:48.420 --> 02:07:55.300
if not the most exciting times to be a theoretical physicist. When the alien civilizations 500 years

02:07:55.300 --> 02:08:00.260
from now that visit Earth will look back, I think the 21st century, some of the biggest

02:08:00.260 --> 02:08:04.500
discoveries ever were made in the 21st century. Yeah, when they have a measurement of string

02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:10.260
theory, the fun's over. Then we have to go on to something new, you know?

02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:16.660
No, there's deep, there's going to be deep, the fun is over. Oh man, but there is an end to the

02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:28.020
Nile, right? Is there? Who told you? Some white bird guy. Let me ask you another trippy

02:08:28.020 --> 02:08:33.780
out there question now. So again, perhaps unanswerable from a physics perspective,

02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:42.340
but do you wonder about alien civilizations? Do you wonder about other intelligent beings out there

02:08:42.340 --> 02:08:46.340
making up their own math and physics trying to figure out the world? Do you think they're

02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:56.420
out there? It is hard to understand why there would, given that there's so many planets and,

02:08:56.420 --> 02:09:04.020
of course, there's Drake's formula and we don't exactly know what the, but I mean, I think Fermi's

02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:15.220
paradox that, you know, is a real paradox and I think there probably are and I think it's

02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:25.300
very exciting that, you know, we might, you know, find some, it's a logical possibility that we

02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:29.860
could learn about it. I mean, to me, it's super interesting to think about aliens from a perspective

02:09:29.860 --> 02:09:36.500
of physics because, so, any intelligent civilization is going to be contending with the ideas and just

02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:43.860
trying to understand the world around it. So, I think that the universe is filled with alien

02:09:43.860 --> 02:09:49.860
civilizations. So, they all have their physicists, right? They're all trying to understand the world

02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:54.020
around them and it's just interesting to me to imagine all these different perspectives,

02:09:54.020 --> 02:09:57.460
all these different Einsteins, like trying to make sense of like-

02:09:57.460 --> 02:10:02.740
Though they might be more different than we think. They might be different in a way that we

02:10:02.740 --> 02:10:05.860
haven't even thought of. Like smarter or different?

02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:12.660
Just different, something that we're not even able to describe now. We just haven't thought of

02:10:12.660 --> 02:10:19.060
that, you know? Yeah, this is a really frustrating thing when we think from me as an AI person,

02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:24.900
you start to think about what is intelligence, what is consciousness and you start to sometimes,

02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:33.380
again, evening thoughts is how little we understand, how narrow our thinking is about

02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:42.340
these concepts. That it could be intelligence, could be, something could be intelligent and be

02:10:43.140 --> 02:10:48.180
very different, intelligent in a very different way that we won't be able to detect because we're

02:10:48.180 --> 02:10:55.460
not keeping an open mind, open enough mind. And that's kind of sad because to me, there's also

02:10:55.460 --> 02:11:00.100
just a strong possibility that aliens or something like alien intelligence or some

02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:09.060
fascinating, beautiful physical phenomena are all around us and we're too dumb to see it

02:11:09.860 --> 02:11:16.420
for now or too close-minded to see it. There's something we're just deeply missing,

02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:21.300
whether it's like fundamental limitations of our cognitive abilities or just because our tools are

02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:29.060
too primitive right now. Or like the way we- it's like you said, the ideas seem trivial once you

02:11:29.060 --> 02:11:32.180
figure it all out looking back. Yeah.

02:11:32.900 --> 02:11:38.980
But that kind of makes me sad because there could be so much beauty in the world we're not seeing.

02:11:39.860 --> 02:11:43.300
Because we're too dumb. There surely is.

02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:46.340
And that's, I guess the process of science and physics is to keep exploring,

02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:52.660
to keep exploring, to find the thing that will in a century seem obvious.

02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:57.380
Well, it's something we know for sure. I mean, the brain we don't

02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:04.900
really understand and that's got to be some fabulously beautiful story that-

02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:10.820
I'm hoping some of that story will be written through the process of trying to build a brain,

02:12:10.820 --> 02:12:16.180
so the process of engineering intelligence, not just the neuroscience perspective of just looking

02:12:16.180 --> 02:12:24.340
at the brain, but trying to create it. But yeah, that story hasn't been written almost at all,

02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:29.300
or just the early days of figuring that one out. But see, like you said that math is discovered, so

02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:33.460
aliens should at least have the same math as us.

02:12:34.900 --> 02:12:35.380
Right?

02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:36.660
I think so.

02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:37.780
Maybe different symbols?

02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:48.740
They might have discovered it differently. And they might have had a different idea of what a proof is.

02:12:52.020 --> 02:12:57.300
Sure. Yeah, we're very like black and white with the proof thing.

02:12:57.300 --> 02:12:57.860
Yeah.

02:12:57.860 --> 02:12:58.740
Maybe they're looser.

02:13:00.340 --> 02:13:07.940
Right. Well, so you can know something is true. First of all, you never know something is true

02:13:07.940 --> 02:13:17.780
with 100% uncertainty. I mean, you might have had a blackout. It's never 100%, right? You might have

02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:24.260
had a momentary lapse of consciousness, the key step in the proof and nobody read it and whatever.

02:13:24.260 --> 02:13:32.980
Okay, so you never know for sure. But you can have a preponderance of evidence, which makes it...

02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:43.940
And preponderance of evidence is not accepted very much in mathematics. And that was sort of

02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:52.100
how the famous Ramanujan worked. He had formulas which he guessed at, and then he

02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:56.900
gathered a preponderance of evidence that he was sure they were true.

02:13:57.780 --> 02:14:02.900
So there might be something completely different. They might function in a very different way.

02:14:04.260 --> 02:14:09.780
Let me ask you kind of a heavy question for physicists, but one on nuclear weapons.

02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:15.620
Just in general, what do you think about nuclear weapons where, like philosophical level,

02:14:16.580 --> 02:14:21.140
where brilliant physicists and brilliant engineering leads to things that can destroy

02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:32.100
human civilization? So some of the ideas that you're working on have power when engineered

02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:35.940
into machines, into systems. Is there some aspect of you that worries about that?

02:14:35.940 --> 02:14:39.060
Well, first of all, I don't know what the brilliant had to do with it because, of course,

02:14:40.500 --> 02:14:45.380
Oppenheimer and all that, okay, they did it really fast. But if you didn't have Oppenheimer,

02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:53.460
you know, I mean, it would all have happened anyway. It had a reality of its own. The

02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:58.340
possibility of making a nuclear, it didn't depend on the fact that the physicists who built it were

02:14:58.340 --> 02:15:04.900
brilliant. Maybe that sped it up by a year or two years, but by now we'd have nuclear weapons.

02:15:06.580 --> 02:15:10.180
So the ideas have momentum and that they're unstoppable.

02:15:10.980 --> 02:15:18.660
Right. The possibility of making nuclear weapons was discovered. It was there before,

02:15:20.660 --> 02:15:29.220
it's not like somebody made it. Without Picasso, there would never have been a

02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:36.020
Guernica, but without Oppenheimer, there would surely have still been an atom bomb.

02:15:36.740 --> 02:15:45.540
But timing matters, right? Timing is very important. Of course, the timing mattered there.

02:15:52.740 --> 02:15:57.540
I mean, you could try to make a case for stopping.

02:15:58.340 --> 02:16:03.460
No, no, no, no. It's the case of carrying the burden of the responsibility of the power of

02:16:03.460 --> 02:16:11.540
ideas when manifested into systems. So it's not a game. It's not just a game of fun mathematics.

02:16:11.540 --> 02:16:21.300
Just same with artificial intelligence. A lot of people in the AI community, it's a fascinating

02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:26.100
fun puzzle, how to make systems more and more intelligent. You have a bunch of benchmarks,

02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:28.580
you're trying to make them perform better and better and better, and all of a sudden

02:16:29.220 --> 02:16:35.780
you have a system that's able to outsmart people. It's now able to be used in geopolitics.

02:16:35.780 --> 02:16:41.860
It's able to create super intelligent bots that are able to at scale control the belief of a

02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:46.980
population of people. And now you can have world wars. You can have a lot of really risky

02:16:46.980 --> 02:16:49.380
instabilities. They're incredible. They really are incredible.

02:16:49.380 --> 02:17:00.420
And so there is some responsibility. It's a beauty and a terror to these ideas.

02:17:04.580 --> 02:17:10.020
At that moment, it was certainly a question for Oppenheimer and everybody who participated

02:17:10.020 --> 02:17:16.980
in that. What is the responsible way to serve society when you're

02:17:18.980 --> 02:17:22.900
accidentally in this position of being at the forefront of

02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:32.740
a development that has a huge impact on society? I don't see my work a likelihood of having a

02:17:33.380 --> 02:17:37.700
huge impact on the development of society itself. But if I were you,

02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:47.700
working on AI, I think that there is a possibility there. And that it is, as a responsible

02:17:48.340 --> 02:17:54.180
scientist, that it's really not a good thing to say, I'm just the scientist here and I'm

02:17:54.180 --> 02:18:04.260
figuring out what's possible. Because you're in a role where you have more of a

02:18:06.420 --> 02:18:14.660
podium to influence things than other people. And it's your responsibility as a citizen

02:18:15.220 --> 02:18:24.180
of the planet, or let me phrase it a little less shoddy, you have an opportunity

02:18:25.380 --> 02:18:34.340
as a citizen of the planet to make the world a better place, which it would be sad to bypass.

02:18:34.980 --> 02:18:38.900
Yeah, it's a nice world without going. It'd be nice to keep it going for a little bit longer.

02:18:39.140 --> 02:18:45.380
Andrew, I'm really honored that you sat down with me. Thank you for your work.

02:18:45.380 --> 02:18:52.180
Well, it was a really great conversation. I really enjoyed it. You really covered a lot. I can't

02:18:52.180 --> 02:19:00.340
believe you're able to discuss at this level on so many different topics. So it's a pleasure.

02:19:00.340 --> 02:19:01.860
It was super fun. Thank you.

02:19:09.860 --> 02:19:13.700
And now let me leave you with some words from Werner Heisenberg.

02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:21.060
Not only is the universe stranger than we think, it is stranger than we can think.

02:19:22.180 --> 02:19:25.220
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
