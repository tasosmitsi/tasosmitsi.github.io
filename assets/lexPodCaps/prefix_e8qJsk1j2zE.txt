00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
is a certain perspective where you might be thinking what is the longest possible game that

00:03.680 --> 00:07.920
you could be playing. A short game is, for instance, cancer is playing a shorter game

00:07.920 --> 00:13.920
than your organism. Cancer is an organism playing a shorter game than the regular organism. Because

00:13.920 --> 00:20.480
the cancer cannot procreate beyond the organism, except for some infectious cancers, like the ones

00:20.480 --> 00:27.680
that eradicated the Tasmanian devils, you typically end up with a situation where the organism dies

00:27.680 --> 00:32.560
together with the cancer. Because the cancer has destroyed the larger system due to playing a shorter

00:32.560 --> 00:39.600
game. And so ideally, you want to, I think, build agents that play the longest possible games. And

00:39.600 --> 00:45.440
the longest possible games is to keep entropy at bay as long as possible by doing interesting stuff.

00:47.840 --> 00:52.000
The following is a conversation with Josje Bach, his third time on this podcast.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.680
Josje is one of the most brilliant and fascinating minds in the world,

00:55.680 --> 01:00.880
exploring the nature of intelligence, consciousness, and computation. And he's

01:00.880 --> 01:06.640
one of my favorite humans to talk to about pretty much anything and everything. This is

01:06.640 --> 01:11.840
the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now,

01:11.840 --> 01:18.560
dear friends, here's Josje Bach. You wrote a post about levels of lucidity.

01:18.560 --> 01:25.840
Quote, as we grow older, it becomes apparent that our self-reflexive mind is not just gradually

01:25.840 --> 01:31.200
accumulating ideas about itself, but that it progresses in somewhat distinct stages.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
So there are seven of the stages. Stage one, reactive survival, infant. Stage two, personal

01:38.000 --> 01:44.400
self, young child. Stage three, social self, adolescence, domesticated adult. Stage four is

01:44.400 --> 01:52.160
rational agency, self-direction. Stage five is self-authoring. That's full adult. You've achieved

01:52.160 --> 01:58.640
wisdom, but there's two more stages. Stage six is enlightenment. Stage seven is transcendence.

01:58.640 --> 02:04.080
Can you explain each or the interesting parts of each of these stages? And what's your sense

02:04.080 --> 02:11.760
why there are stages of this, of lucidity as we progress through life in this too short life?

02:12.320 --> 02:20.800
This model is derived from a concept by the psychologist Robert Keegan. And he talks about

02:21.600 --> 02:26.480
the development of the self as a process that happens in principle by some kind of

02:26.480 --> 02:30.640
reverse engineering of a mind where you gradually become aware of yourself and thereby build

02:30.640 --> 02:36.880
structure that allows you to interact deeper with the world and yourself. And I found myself using

02:36.880 --> 02:40.960
this model not so much as a developmental model. I'm not even sure if it's a very good

02:40.960 --> 02:48.000
developmental model because I saw my children not progressing exactly like that. And I also suspect

02:48.000 --> 02:52.720
that you don't go through these stages necessarily in succession. And it's not that you work through

02:52.720 --> 02:57.600
one stage and then you get into the next one. Sometimes you revisit them. Sometimes stuff is

02:57.600 --> 03:02.880
happening in parallel. But it's, I think, a useful framework to look at what's present and the

03:02.880 --> 03:06.560
structure of a person and how they interact with the world and how they relate to themselves.

03:07.440 --> 03:12.160
So it's more like a philosophical framework that allows you to talk about how minds work.

03:12.720 --> 03:18.160
And at first, when we are born, we don't have a personal self yet, I think. Instead,

03:18.160 --> 03:23.280
we have an attentional self. And this attentional self is initially in the infant task is building

03:23.280 --> 03:28.400
a world model and also an initial model of the self. But mostly it's building a game engine in

03:28.400 --> 03:35.360
the brain that is tracking sensory data and uses it to explain it. And in some sense, you could

03:35.360 --> 03:41.600
compare it to a game engine like Minecraft or social colors and sounds. People are all not

03:41.600 --> 03:45.520
physical objects. They are creation of our mind at a certain level of core screening,

03:46.160 --> 03:54.400
models that are mathematical that use geometry and that use manipulation of objects and so on

03:54.400 --> 03:58.880
to create scenes in which we can find ourselves and interact with them.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.400
So Minecraft.

04:00.400 --> 04:06.720
Yeah. And this personal self is something that is more or less created after the world is finished,

04:06.720 --> 04:12.720
after it's trained into the system, after it has been constructed. And this personal self is an

04:12.720 --> 04:18.560
agent that interacts with the outside world. And the outside world is not the world of quantum

04:18.560 --> 04:23.680
mechanics, not the physical universe, but it's the model that has been generated in our own mind.

04:24.480 --> 04:29.760
And this is us and we experience ourselves interacting with that outside world that is

04:29.760 --> 04:36.480
created inside of our own mind. And outside of ourself, there's feelings and they presented

04:36.480 --> 04:41.360
our interface to this outside world. They pose problems to us. These feelings are basically

04:41.360 --> 04:46.640
attitudes that our mind is computing that tell us what's needed in the world, the things that

04:46.640 --> 04:52.880
we are drawn to, the things that we are afraid of. And we are tasked with solving this problem of

04:52.880 --> 04:58.640
satisfying the needs, avoiding the aversions, following on our inner commitments and so on,

04:58.640 --> 05:04.640
and also modeling ourselves and building the next stage. So after we have this personal self and

05:04.640 --> 05:11.040
stage two online, many people form a social self. And this social self allows the individual to

05:11.040 --> 05:16.960
experience themselves as part of a group. It's basically this thing that when you are playing

05:16.960 --> 05:22.080
in a team, for instance, you don't notice yourself just as a single note that is reaching out into

05:22.080 --> 05:26.560
the world, but you're also looking down. You're looking down from this entire group and you see

05:26.560 --> 05:31.600
how this group is looking at this individual and everybody in the group is in some sense emulating

05:31.600 --> 05:36.880
this group spirit to some degree. And in this state, people are forming their opinions by

05:36.880 --> 05:42.800
assimilating them from this group mind. They gain the ability to act a little bit like a hive mind.

05:42.800 --> 05:48.800
But are you also modeling the interaction of how opinion shapes and forms through the interaction

05:48.800 --> 05:55.760
of the individual nodes within the group? Yeah. The way in which people do it in this stage is

05:55.760 --> 06:01.120
that they experience what are the opinions of my environment. They experience the relationship that

06:01.120 --> 06:07.840
I have to their environment and they resonate with people around them and get more opinions

06:08.400 --> 06:14.800
through this interaction, the way in which they relate to others. And at stage four,

06:14.800 --> 06:19.840
you basically understand that stuff is true and false independently of what other people believe

06:19.840 --> 06:24.800
and you have agency over your own beliefs in that stage. You basically discover epistemology,

06:24.800 --> 06:29.920
the rules about determining what's true and false. So you start to learn how to think.

06:30.640 --> 06:36.160
Yes. I mean, at some level, you're always thinking, you are constructing things. And I believe that

06:36.160 --> 06:40.880
this ability to reason about your mental representation is what we mean by thinking.

06:40.880 --> 06:45.520
It's an intrinsically reflexive process that requires consciousness. Without consciousness,

06:45.520 --> 06:50.960
you cannot think. You can generate the content of feelings and so on outside of consciousness.

06:50.960 --> 06:56.000
It's very hard to be conscious of how your feelings emerge, at least in the early stages

06:56.000 --> 07:02.400
of development. But thoughts is something that you always control. And if you are a nerd like me,

07:03.200 --> 07:08.320
you often have to skip stage three because you lack the intuitive empathy with others.

07:08.320 --> 07:13.040
Because in order to resonate with a group, you need to have a quite similar architecture.

07:13.040 --> 07:18.960
And if people are via differently, then it's hard for them to resonate with other people and

07:18.960 --> 07:25.440
basically have empathy, which is not the same as compassion, but it is a shared perceptual mental

07:25.440 --> 07:31.440
state. Empathy happens not just via inference about the mental states of others, but it's

07:31.440 --> 07:35.040
a perception of what other people feel and where they're at.

07:35.040 --> 07:39.120
Can't you not have empathy while also not having a similar architecture,

07:39.120 --> 07:40.800
cognitive architecture, as the others in the group?

07:40.800 --> 07:46.080
I think, yes, but I experienced that too. But you need to build something that is like a meta

07:46.080 --> 07:50.560
architecture. You need to be able to embrace the architecture of the other to some degree,

07:50.560 --> 07:56.880
or find some shared common ground. And it's also this issue that if you are a nerd,

07:56.880 --> 08:02.560
normies often, neurotypical people, have difficulty to resonate with you. And as a result,

08:02.560 --> 08:08.080
they have difficulty understanding you, unless they have enough wisdom to feel what's going on

08:08.080 --> 08:14.080
there. Well, isn't the whole process of the stage three to figure out the API to the other humans

08:14.080 --> 08:21.680
that have different architecture and you yourself publish public documentation for the API that

08:21.680 --> 08:26.080
people can interact with for you? Isn't this the whole process of socializing?

08:26.080 --> 08:32.240
My experience as a child growing up was that I did not find any way to interface with the stage

08:32.240 --> 08:36.640
three people, and they didn't do that with me. Did you try?

08:36.640 --> 08:41.520
Yeah, of course, I tried it very hard. But it was only when I entered a mathematics school

08:41.520 --> 08:48.640
at ninth grade, lots of other nerds were present, that I found people that I could deeply resonate

08:48.640 --> 08:54.320
with and had the impression that, yes, I have friends now, I found my own people. And before

08:54.320 --> 08:58.240
that, I felt extremely lonely in the world. There was basically nobody I could connect to.

08:59.040 --> 09:07.600
And I remember there was one moment in all these years where there was a school exchange,

09:07.600 --> 09:13.360
and it was a Russian boy, a kid from the Russian garrison stationed in Eastern Germany who visited

09:13.360 --> 09:18.560
our school. And we played a game of chess against each other. And we looked into each other's eyes,

09:18.560 --> 09:22.160
and we sat there for two hours playing this game of chess. And I had the impression,

09:22.160 --> 09:27.680
this is a human being. He understands what I understand. We didn't even speak the same

09:27.680 --> 09:35.200
language. I wonder if your life could have been different if you knew that it's okay to be

09:35.200 --> 09:41.600
different, to have a different architecture, whether accepting that the interface is hard

09:41.600 --> 09:44.880
to figure out, takes a long time to figure out, and it's okay to be different. In fact,

09:44.880 --> 09:53.920
it's beautiful to be different. That was not my main concern. My main concern was mostly that

09:54.000 --> 10:00.320
I was alone. It was not so much the question, is it okay to be the way I am? I couldn't do much

10:00.320 --> 10:06.800
about it, so I had to deal with it. But my main issue was that I was not sure if I would ever

10:06.800 --> 10:12.560
meet anybody growing up that I would connect to at such a deep level that I would feel that

10:12.560 --> 10:17.040
I could belong. So there's a visceral, undeniable feeling of being alone.

10:17.040 --> 10:23.520
Yes. And I noticed the same thing when I came into the math school that I think at least half

10:23.520 --> 10:29.280
probably two-thirds of these kids were severely traumatized as children growing up and in large

10:29.280 --> 10:33.440
part due to being alone because they couldn't find anybody to relate to.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.160
Don't you think everybody's alone deep down? No.

10:41.680 --> 10:47.600
All right. I'm not alone. I'm not alone anymore. It took me some time to update and to get over

10:47.600 --> 10:54.240
the trauma and so on. But I felt that in my 20s, I had lots of friends and I had my place in the

10:54.240 --> 11:01.520
world and I had no longer doubts that I would never be alone again. Is there some aspect to

11:01.520 --> 11:08.080
which we're alone together? You don't see a deep loneliness inside yourself still? No. Sorry.

11:10.400 --> 11:14.240
Okay. So that's the nonlinear progression through the stages, I suppose. You caught

11:14.240 --> 11:17.360
up on stage three at some point? Yes. So we're at stage four. And so basically,

11:17.360 --> 11:22.160
I find that many nerds jump straight into stage four, bypassing stage three.

11:22.160 --> 11:26.240
Do they return to it then later? Yeah, of course. Sometimes they do, not always.

11:27.200 --> 11:32.160
The question is basically, do you stay a little bit autistic or do you catch up? And I believe

11:32.160 --> 11:39.120
you can catch up. You can build this missing structure and basically experience yourself as

11:39.120 --> 11:44.640
part of a group, learn intuitive empathy, and develop this perceptual sense of feeling what

11:44.640 --> 11:49.840
other people feel. And before that, I could only basically feel this when I was deeply in love with

11:49.840 --> 11:56.800
somebody and we synced. So there's a lot of friction to feeling that way. Only with certain

11:56.800 --> 12:01.200
people as opposed to it comes naturally as frictionless. But this is something that

12:01.200 --> 12:06.960
basically later I felt started to resolve itself for me to a large degree. What was the trick?

12:09.920 --> 12:12.160
In many ways, growing up and paying attention.

12:14.240 --> 12:21.760
Meditation did help. I had some very crucial experiences in getting close to people,

12:21.760 --> 12:27.120
building connections, cuddling a lot in my student years.

12:28.400 --> 12:35.200
So really paying attention to the, what is it, to the feeling another human being fully?

12:35.680 --> 12:40.400
Loving other people and being loved by other people and building a space in which you can

12:40.400 --> 12:49.760
be safe and can experiment and touch a lot and be close to somebody a lot. And over time,

12:49.760 --> 12:55.920
basically at some point you realize, oh, it's no longer that I feel locked out, but I feel connected

12:55.920 --> 13:02.320
and I experience where somebody else is at. And normally my mind is racing very fast at a high

13:02.320 --> 13:06.720
frequency. So it's not always working like this. Sometimes it works better, sometimes it works less,

13:07.280 --> 13:12.640
but I also don't see this as a pressure. It's more, it's interesting to observe myself

13:12.640 --> 13:17.040
which frequency I'm at and at which mode somebody else is at.

13:18.480 --> 13:25.360
Yeah, man, the mind is so beautiful in that way. Sometimes it comes so natural to me, so easy to

13:25.360 --> 13:30.560
pay attention, pay attention to the world fully, to other people fully. And sometimes the stress

13:31.440 --> 13:36.480
over silly things is overwhelming. It's so interesting that the mind is that roller coaster

13:36.480 --> 13:41.280
in that way. At stage five, you discover how identity is constructed. Self-offering. You

13:41.280 --> 13:46.480
realize that your values are not terminal, but they are instrumental to achieving a world that

13:46.480 --> 13:51.920
you like and aesthetics that you prefer. Yeah. And the more you understand this, the more you

13:51.920 --> 13:58.000
get agency over how your identity is constructed. And you realize that identity and interpersonal

13:58.000 --> 14:03.520
interaction is a costume and you should be able to have agency over that costume, right? It's

14:03.520 --> 14:09.520
useful to be a costume. It tells something to others and allows to interface in roles,

14:10.080 --> 14:16.800
but being locked into this is a big limitation. The word costume kind of implies that it's fraudulent

14:16.800 --> 14:22.480
in some way. Is costume a good word for you? No. Like we present ourselves to the world.

14:22.480 --> 14:26.800
In some sense, I learned a lot about costumes at Burning Man. Before that, I did not really

14:26.800 --> 14:31.680
appreciate costumes and saw them more as uniforms, like wearing a suit if you are

14:31.680 --> 14:39.120
working in a bank or if you are trying to get startup funding from a VC in Switzerland.

14:40.320 --> 14:45.120
Then you dress up in a particular way. And this is mostly to show the other side that you are

14:45.120 --> 14:50.960
willing to play by the rules and you understand what the rules are. But there is something deeper.

14:50.960 --> 14:55.040
When you are at Burning Man, your costume becomes self-expression and there is no

14:55.040 --> 14:59.760
boundary to the self-expression. You're basically free to wear what you want to

14:59.760 --> 15:04.320
express other people what you feel like this day and what kind of interactions you want to have.

15:04.320 --> 15:08.720
Is the costume a kind of projection of who you are?

15:10.320 --> 15:14.880
That's very hard to say because the costume also depends on what other people see in the costume.

15:15.440 --> 15:20.000
And this depends on the context that the other people understand. So you have to create something

15:20.000 --> 15:24.720
if you want to that is legible to the other side and that means something to yourself.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.360
Do we become prisoners of the costume? Because everybody expects us to.

15:29.360 --> 15:35.840
Some people do, but I think that once you realize that you wear a costume at Burning Man,

15:35.840 --> 15:39.920
a variety of costumes, realize that you cannot not wear a costume.

15:41.200 --> 15:47.760
Basically everything that you wear and present to others is something that is to some degree

15:48.480 --> 15:54.960
in addition to what you are deep inside. So this stage in parentheses you put

15:54.960 --> 16:03.920
full adult comma wisdom. Why is this full adult? Why would you say this is full and why is it wisdom?

16:04.560 --> 16:11.520
It does allow you to understand why other people have different identities from yours. And it

16:11.520 --> 16:15.600
allows you to understand that the difference between people who vote for different parties

16:15.600 --> 16:18.800
and might have very different opinions and different value systems

16:19.360 --> 16:25.040
is often the accident of where they are born and what happened after that to them

16:25.040 --> 16:32.560
and what traits they got before they were born. And at some point you realize the perspective

16:32.560 --> 16:36.800
where you understand that everybody could be you in a different timeline if you just

16:36.800 --> 16:39.760
flip those bits. How many costumes do you have?

16:39.760 --> 16:43.680
I don't count, but- More than one?

16:44.400 --> 16:49.600
Yeah, of course. How easy is to do costume changes throughout the day?

16:51.040 --> 16:56.320
It's just a matter of energy and interest. When you are wearing your pajamas and you switch out

16:56.320 --> 17:03.760
of your pajamas into say a work shirt and pants, you're making a costume change, right? And if

17:03.760 --> 17:07.840
you are putting on a gown, you're making a costume change. And you could do the same with personality?

17:07.840 --> 17:14.320
You could, if that's what you're into. There are people which have multiple personalities

17:14.320 --> 17:19.600
for interaction in multiple worlds. So if somebody works in a store and you put up a

17:19.600 --> 17:25.280
storekeeper personality when you're presenting yourself at work, you develop a sub-personality

17:25.280 --> 17:31.040
for this. And the social persona for many people is in some sense a puppet that they're playing

17:31.040 --> 17:35.760
like a marionette. And if they play this all the time, they might forget that there is something

17:36.400 --> 17:42.160
behind this, just something what it feels like to be in your skin. And I guess it's very helpful

17:42.160 --> 17:48.000
if you're able to get back into this. And for me, the other way around is relatively hard. For me,

17:48.000 --> 17:52.960
it's pretty hard to learn how to play consistent social roles. For me, it's much easier just to be

17:52.960 --> 18:01.840
real. Or not real, but to have one costume. No, it's not quite the same. So basically when you

18:01.840 --> 18:07.200
are wearing a costume at Burning Man and say you are an extraterrestrial prince,

18:08.560 --> 18:13.200
there's something where you are expressing in some sense something that's closer to yourself than

18:13.200 --> 18:18.880
the way in which you hide yourself behind a standard closing when you go out in the city

18:18.880 --> 18:23.840
in the default world. And so this costume that you're wearing at Burning Man allows you to

18:23.840 --> 18:30.800
express more of yourself. And you have a shorter distance of advertising to people

18:31.840 --> 18:35.200
what kind of person you are, what kind of interaction you would want to have with them.

18:35.200 --> 18:44.000
And so you get much earlier into media stress. And I believe it's regrettable that we do not

18:44.000 --> 18:49.680
use the opportunities that we have with custom-made clothing now to wear costumes that are much more

18:50.560 --> 18:55.040
stylish, that are much more custom-made, that are not necessarily part of a fashion in which you

18:55.040 --> 19:00.240
express which milieu you're part of and how up-to-date you are. But you also express

19:01.120 --> 19:05.200
how you are as an individual and what you want to do today and how you feel today and

19:05.200 --> 19:12.720
what you intend to do about it. Well, isn't it easier now in the digital world to explore

19:12.720 --> 19:17.360
different costumes? I mean, that's the kind of idea with virtual reality. That's the idea even

19:17.360 --> 19:23.120
with Twitter in two-dimensional screens. You can swap all costumes. You could be as weird as you

19:23.120 --> 19:30.560
want. It's easier for Burning Man. You have to like order things. You have to make things.

19:31.280 --> 19:34.080
It's more effort to put on it. It's even better if you make them yourselves.

19:35.200 --> 19:39.360
Sure. But it's just easier to do digitally, right?

19:39.360 --> 19:44.000
It's not about easy. It's about how to get it right. And for me, the first Burning Man

19:44.000 --> 19:49.680
experience, I got adopted by a bunch of people in Boston who dragged me to Burning Man. And we

19:49.680 --> 19:55.200
spent a few weekends doing costumes together. And that was an important part of the experience,

19:55.200 --> 20:00.400
where the camp bonded, that people got to know each other. And we basically grew into the

20:00.400 --> 20:04.640
experience that we would have later. So the extraterrestrial prints is based

20:04.640 --> 20:05.760
on a true story. Yeah.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.200
I can only imagine what that looks like.

20:09.920 --> 20:12.880
Yoshi. Stage six.

20:12.880 --> 20:20.160
Stage six. At some point, you can collapse the division between a personal self and

20:20.160 --> 20:26.080
world generator again. And a lot of people get there via meditation, or some of them get there

20:26.080 --> 20:32.000
via psychedelics, some of them by accident. And you suddenly notice that you are not actually a

20:32.000 --> 20:37.440
person, but you are a vessel that can create a person. And the person is still there. You

20:37.440 --> 20:42.560
observe that personal self, but you observe the personal self from the outside. And you notice

20:42.560 --> 20:47.360
it's a representation. And you might also notice that the world that is being created is a

20:47.360 --> 20:51.840
representation. If not, then you might experience that I am the universe. I am the thing that is

20:51.840 --> 20:57.280
creating everything. And of course, what you're creating is not quantum mechanics and the physical

20:57.280 --> 21:02.560
universe. What you're creating is this game engine that is updating the world. And you're creating

21:02.560 --> 21:09.680
your feelings and all the people inside of that world, including the person that you identify

21:09.680 --> 21:14.320
with yourself in this world. Are you creating the game engine or are you noticing the game engine?

21:15.200 --> 21:20.400
You notice how you're generating the game engine. And I mean, when you are dreaming at night,

21:22.000 --> 21:26.640
if you have a lucid dream, you can learn how to do this deliberately. And in principle,

21:26.640 --> 21:32.640
you can also do it during the day. And the reason why we don't get to do this from the beginning

21:32.640 --> 21:37.920
and why we don't have agency of our feelings right away is because we would game it before they have

21:37.920 --> 21:43.440
the necessary amount of wisdom to deal with creating this dream that we are in.

21:44.400 --> 21:49.440
You don't want to get access to cheat codes too quickly. Otherwise, you won't enjoy the game.

21:49.440 --> 21:54.800
Stage five is already pretty rare. And stage six is even more rare. You both basically find this

21:54.800 --> 22:01.200
mostly with advanced Buddhist meditators and so on that are dropping into the stage and can

22:01.200 --> 22:06.560
induce it at will and spend time in it. So stage five requires a good therapist. Stage

22:06.560 --> 22:14.560
six requires a good Buddhist spiritual leader. For instance, it could be that it's the right

22:14.560 --> 22:21.120
thing to do. But it's not that these stages give you scores or levels that you need to advance to.

22:21.200 --> 22:26.320
It's not that the next stage is better. You live your life in the mode that works best at any

22:26.320 --> 22:31.200
given moment. And when your mind decides that you should have a different configuration,

22:31.200 --> 22:36.880
then it's building that configuration. And for many people, they stay happily at stage three

22:36.880 --> 22:41.520
and experience themselves as part of groups. And there's nothing wrong with this. And for some

22:41.520 --> 22:46.640
people, this doesn't work and they're forced to build more agency over their rational beliefs

22:46.640 --> 22:53.200
than this and construct their norms rationally. And so they go to this level. And stage seven

22:53.200 --> 22:57.760
is something that is more or less hypothetical. That would be the stage in which it's basically

22:57.760 --> 23:02.160
a transhumanist stage in which you understand how you work and which the mind fully realizes

23:02.160 --> 23:07.680
how it's implemented and can also in principle enter different modes in which it could be

23:07.680 --> 23:13.120
implemented. And that's the stage that as far as I understand is not open to people yet.

23:13.280 --> 23:17.680
Oh, but it is possible through the process of technology.

23:17.680 --> 23:23.920
Yes. And who knows if there are biological agents that are working at different time scales than us

23:23.920 --> 23:27.440
that basically become aware of the way in which they're implemented on ecosystems

23:28.080 --> 23:33.680
and can change that implementation and have agency over how they're implemented in the world.

23:33.680 --> 23:38.400
And what I find interesting about the discussion about AI alignment, that it seems to be

23:38.960 --> 23:43.840
following these stages very much. Most people seem to be in stage three, also according to

23:43.840 --> 23:49.440
Robert Keegan. I think he says that about 85% of people are in stage three and stay there.

23:50.080 --> 23:57.120
And if you're in stage three and your opinions are the result of social assimilation, then what

23:57.120 --> 24:02.880
you're mostly worried about in the AI is that the AI might have the wrong opinions. So if the AI says

24:02.880 --> 24:07.280
something racist or sexist, we are all lost because we will assimilate the wrong opinions

24:07.280 --> 24:12.080
from the AI. And so we need to make sure that the AI has the right opinions and the right values

24:12.080 --> 24:17.600
and the right structure. And if you're at stage four, that's not your main concern. And so most

24:17.600 --> 24:24.080
nerds don't really worry about the algorithmic bias and the model that it picks up because if

24:24.080 --> 24:28.080
there's something wrong with this bias, the AI ultimately will prove it. At some point,

24:28.080 --> 24:32.560
we'll get it there that it makes mathematical proofs about reality and then it will figure out

24:33.200 --> 24:37.600
what's true and what's false. But you're still worried that the AI might turn you into paper

24:37.600 --> 24:42.640
clips because it might have the wrong values, right? So if it's set up with the wrong function

24:42.640 --> 24:47.920
that controls its direction in the world, then it might do something that is completely horrible

24:47.920 --> 24:52.400
and there's no easy way to fix it. So that's more like a stage four rationalist kind of worry.

24:52.400 --> 24:57.040
And if you are at stage five, you're mostly worried that the AI is not going to be enlightened fast

24:57.040 --> 25:01.440
enough because you realize that the game is not so much about intelligence, but about agency,

25:01.440 --> 25:07.360
about the ability to control the future. And the identity is instrumental to this. And

25:08.000 --> 25:14.800
if you are a human being, I think at some level, you ought to choose your own identity. You should

25:14.800 --> 25:19.440
not have somebody else pick the costume for you and then wear it. But instead, you should be

25:19.440 --> 25:25.360
mindful about what you want to be in this world. And I think if you are an agent that is fully

25:25.360 --> 25:30.640
malleable, that can rewrite its own source code like an AI might do at some point, then

25:30.640 --> 25:38.480
the identity that you will have is whatever you can be. And in this way, the AI will maybe

25:38.480 --> 25:45.360
become everything like a planetary control system. And if it does that, then if we want to coexist

25:45.360 --> 25:51.120
with it, it means that it will have to share purposes with us. So it cannot be a transactional

25:51.120 --> 25:55.280
relationship. We will not be able to use reinforcement learning with human feedback

25:55.280 --> 26:01.280
to hardwire its values into it. But this has to happen. It's probably that it's conscious,

26:01.280 --> 26:06.560
so it can relate to our own mode of existence where an observer is observing itself in real time

26:06.560 --> 26:13.040
and is in certain temporal frames. And the other thing is that it probably needs to have some kind

26:13.040 --> 26:18.880
of transcendental orientation building shared agency in the same way as we do when we are able

26:18.880 --> 26:23.840
to enter up with each other into non-transactional relationships. And I find that something that

26:23.840 --> 26:30.960
because the stage five is so rare is missing in much of the discourse. And I think that we

26:31.520 --> 26:38.080
need in some sense, focus on how to formalize love, how to understand love and how to build it

26:38.080 --> 26:42.640
into the machines that we are currently building and that are about to become smarter than us.

26:43.760 --> 26:47.920
Well, I think this is a good opportunity to try to sneak up to the idea of enlightenment.

26:48.880 --> 26:54.720
So you wrote a series of good tweets about consciousness and panpsychism. So let's break

26:54.720 --> 27:00.320
it down. First, you say, I suspect the experience that leads to the panpsychism syndrome of some

27:00.320 --> 27:06.560
philosophers and other consciousness enthusiasts represents the realization that we don't end at

27:06.560 --> 27:13.200
the self, but share a resonant universe representation with every other observer coupled to the same

27:13.760 --> 27:20.320
universe. This actually eventually leads us to a lot of interesting questions about AI and AGI,

27:20.320 --> 27:25.840
but let's start with this representation. What is this resonant universe representation?

27:26.880 --> 27:29.840
And what do you think? Do we share such a representation?

27:29.840 --> 27:35.040
The neuroscientist Grossberg has come up with the cognitive architecture that he calls the

27:35.040 --> 27:42.320
adaptive resonance theory. And his perspective is that our neurons can be understood as oscillators

27:42.320 --> 27:47.920
that are resonating with each other and this outside phenomena. So the coarse-grained model

27:47.920 --> 27:53.520
of the universe that we are building in some sense is resonance with objects and outside

27:54.240 --> 27:59.280
of us in the world. So basically, we take up patterns of the universe that we are coupled

27:59.280 --> 28:05.760
with and our brain is not so much understood as circuitry, even though this perspective is

28:05.760 --> 28:11.120
valid, but it's almost an ether in which the individual neurons are passing on

28:12.080 --> 28:17.200
a chemical electrical signals or arbitrary signals across all modalities that can be transmitted

28:17.200 --> 28:23.040
between cells, simulate each other in this way and produce patterns that they modulate while passing

28:23.040 --> 28:28.880
them on. And this speed of signal progression in the brain is roughly at the speed of sound,

28:28.880 --> 28:34.720
incidentally, because the time that it takes for the signals to hop from cell to cell,

28:34.720 --> 28:40.080
it means it's relatively slow with respect to the world. It takes an appreciable fraction of a second

28:40.080 --> 28:44.320
for a signal to go through the entire neocortex, something like a few hundred milliseconds.

28:44.320 --> 28:48.560
And so there's a lot of stuff happening in that time where the signal is passing through your

28:48.560 --> 28:54.080
brain, including in the brain itself. So nothing in the brain is assuming that stuff happens

28:54.080 --> 29:00.480
simultaneously. Everything in the brain is working in a paradigm where the world has already moved on

29:00.480 --> 29:06.000
when you are ready to do the next thing to your signal, including the signal processing system

29:06.000 --> 29:10.080
itself. It's quite a different paradigm than the one in our digital computers,

29:10.080 --> 29:15.520
where we currently assume that your GPU or CPU is pretty much globally in the same state.

29:17.520 --> 29:22.960
So you mentioned there the non-dual state and say that some people confuse it for enlightenment.

29:22.960 --> 29:26.880
What's the non-dual state? There is a state in which you

29:26.880 --> 29:32.240
notice that you are no longer a person and instead you are one with the universe.

29:32.320 --> 29:34.080
So that speaks to the resonance.

29:34.080 --> 29:39.200
Yes. But this one with the universe is of course not accurately modeling that you are indeed

29:39.920 --> 29:44.640
some God entity or indeed the universe becoming aware of itself, even though you get this

29:44.640 --> 29:50.320
experience. I believe that you get this experience because your mind is modeling the fact that you

29:50.320 --> 29:55.920
are no longer identified with the personal self in that state, but you have transcended this

29:55.920 --> 30:01.440
division between the self-model and the world-model and you are experiencing yourself as your mind,

30:01.440 --> 30:05.760
as something that is representing a universe. But that's still part of the model.

30:05.760 --> 30:11.040
Yes. So it's inside of the model still. You're still inside of patterns that are generated in

30:11.040 --> 30:17.040
your brain and in your organism. What you are now experiencing is that you're no longer this

30:17.040 --> 30:22.320
personal self in there, but you are the entirety of the mind and its contents.

30:22.320 --> 30:26.880
Why is it so hard to get there? A lot of people who get into the state

30:27.760 --> 30:33.280
associated with enlightenment, I suspect it's a favorite training goal for a number of meditators.

30:33.840 --> 30:40.960
But I think that enlightenment is in some sense more mundane and it's a step further or sideways.

30:40.960 --> 30:44.400
It's the state where you realize that everything is a representation.

30:44.400 --> 30:49.280
Yeah. You say enlightenment is a realization of how experience is implemented.

30:49.280 --> 30:54.400
Yes. Basically, you notice at some point that your qualia can be deconstructed.

30:54.960 --> 30:58.560
Reverse engineered? What? Almost like a schematic of it?

31:00.800 --> 31:05.440
You can start with looking at a face. Maybe look at your own face in the mirror.

31:05.440 --> 31:11.120
Look at your face for a few hours in the mirror or for a few minutes. At some point,

31:11.120 --> 31:14.960
it will look very weird because you notice that there's actually no face.

31:14.960 --> 31:20.320
You basically start unseeing the face. What you see is a geometry and then you can disassemble

31:20.320 --> 31:26.080
the geometry and realize how that geometry is being constructed in your mind. You can learn

31:26.080 --> 31:32.400
to modify this. Basically, you can change these generators in your own mind to shift the face

31:32.400 --> 31:37.920
around or to change the construction of the face, to change the way in which the features

31:37.920 --> 31:40.960
are being assembled. Why don't we do that more often? Why don't we

31:42.160 --> 31:48.000
start really messing with reality without the use of drugs or anything else? Why don't we

31:48.080 --> 31:57.280
get good at this kind of thing intentionally? Why should we? Because you can morph reality

31:58.720 --> 32:03.120
into something more pleasant for yourself. Just have fun with it.

32:04.400 --> 32:08.960
That is probably what you shouldn't be doing because outside of your personal self,

32:08.960 --> 32:14.080
this outer mind is probably a relatively smart agent. What you often notice is that you have

32:14.080 --> 32:17.920
thoughts about how you should live, but you observe yourself doing different things and

32:17.920 --> 32:21.920
have different feelings. That's because your outer mind doesn't believe you

32:22.720 --> 32:27.840
and doesn't believe your rational thoughts. Can't you just silence the outer mind?

32:27.840 --> 32:30.400
The thing is that the outer mind is usually smarter than you are.

32:31.680 --> 32:36.960
Rational thinking is very brittle. It's very hard to use logic and symbolic thinking to have

32:36.960 --> 32:42.320
an accurate model of the world. There is often an underlying system that is looking at your

32:42.320 --> 32:46.720
rational thoughts and then tells you, no, you're still missing something. Your gut feeling is

32:46.720 --> 32:53.040
still saying something else. This can be, for instance, you find a partner that looks perfect

32:53.040 --> 32:58.400
or you find a deal and you build a company or whatever that looks perfect to you. Yet,

32:58.400 --> 33:02.080
at some level, you feel something is off and you cannot put your finger on it. The more

33:02.080 --> 33:07.520
you reason about it, the better it looks to you. But the system that is outside still tells you,

33:07.520 --> 33:11.520
no, no, you're missing something. That system is powerful.

33:11.520 --> 33:18.480
People call this intuition. Intuition is this unreflected part of your attitude, composition,

33:18.480 --> 33:24.080
and computation where you produce a model of how you relate to the world and what you need to do

33:24.080 --> 33:29.600
it in it and what you can do in it and what's going to happen that is usually deeper and often

33:29.600 --> 33:36.080
more accurate than your reason. If we look at this as you write in the tweet, if we look at this more

33:36.080 --> 33:40.880
rigorously as a sort of take the panpsychist idea more seriously, almost as a scientific

33:40.880 --> 33:46.800
discipline, you write that quote, fascinatingly, the panpsychist interpretation seems to lead to

33:46.800 --> 33:52.880
observations of practical results to a degree that physics fundamentalists might call superstitious.

33:53.440 --> 34:00.080
Reports of long distance telepathy and remote causation are ubiquitous in the general population.

34:00.080 --> 34:05.760
I am not convinced, says Yoshabak, that establishing the empirical reality of telepathy

34:05.760 --> 34:10.160
would force an update of any part of serious academic physics, but it could trigger an

34:10.160 --> 34:16.880
important revolution in both neuroscience and AI from a circuit perspective to a coupled complex

34:16.880 --> 34:25.040
resonator paradigm. Are you suggesting that there could be some rigorous

34:27.840 --> 34:31.360
mathematical wisdom to panpsychist perspective on the world?

34:32.000 --> 34:37.440
So first of all, panpsychism is the perspective that consciousness is inseparable from matter in

34:37.440 --> 34:42.640
the universe. And I find panpsychism quite unsatisfying because it does not explain

34:42.640 --> 34:47.520
consciousness. It does not explain how this aspect of matter produces. It is also when I

34:47.520 --> 34:53.040
try to formalize panpsychism and write down what it actually means with a more formal mathematical

34:53.040 --> 34:59.520
language, it's very difficult to distinguish it from saying that there is a software side to the

34:59.600 --> 35:03.760
world in the same way as there is a software side to what the transistors are doing in your computer.

35:03.760 --> 35:08.320
So basically, there is a pattern at a certain core screening of the universe that in some reasons

35:08.320 --> 35:14.160
of the universe leads to observers that are observing themselves. So panpsychism maybe is

35:14.160 --> 35:21.360
not even when I write it down a position that is distinct from functionalism. But intuitively,

35:21.360 --> 35:27.120
a lot of people feel that the activity of matter itself, of mechanisms in the world is insufficient

35:27.120 --> 35:34.720
to explain it. So it's something that needs to be intrinsic to matter itself. And you can,

35:35.520 --> 35:42.400
apart from this abstract idea, have an experience in which you experience yourself as being the

35:42.400 --> 35:49.280
universe, which I suspect is basically happening because you manage to dissolve the division

35:49.280 --> 35:54.240
between personal self and mind that you establish as an infant when you construct the personal self

35:54.320 --> 36:00.080
and transcend it again and understand how it works. But there is something deeper, that is that you

36:00.080 --> 36:07.280
feel that you're also sharing a state with other people, that you have an experience in which you

36:07.280 --> 36:13.520
notice that your personal self is moving into everything else, that you basically look out of

36:13.520 --> 36:20.640
the eyes of another person, that every agent in the world that is an observer is, in some sense,

36:20.640 --> 36:28.720
you. And we forget that we are the same agent. So is it that we feel that or do we actually

36:28.720 --> 36:35.760
accomplish it? So is telepathy possible? Is it real? For me, that's a question that I don't

36:35.760 --> 36:41.600
really know the answer to. In Turing's famous 1950 paper in which he describes the Turing test,

36:41.600 --> 36:47.680
he does speculate about telepathy, interestingly, and asks himself if telepathy is real and he

36:47.680 --> 36:54.320
thinks that it very well might be. It would be the implication for AI systems that try to be

36:54.320 --> 37:00.480
intelligent because he didn't see a mechanism by which a computer program would become telepathic.

37:00.480 --> 37:07.120
And I suspect if telepathy would exist or if all the reports that you get from people when you ask

37:07.120 --> 37:14.000
a normal person on the street, I find that very often they say, I have experiences with telepathy.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.320
The scientists might not be interested in this and might not have a theory about this,

37:18.320 --> 37:24.240
but I have difficulty explaining it away. And so you could say maybe this is a superstition,

37:24.240 --> 37:29.680
maybe it's a false memory, or maybe it's a little bit of psychosis. Who knows? Maybe somebody wants

37:29.680 --> 37:33.680
to make their own life more interesting or misremember something. But a lot of people report

37:34.480 --> 37:38.800
I noticed something terrible happened to my partner and I know this is exactly the moment

37:38.800 --> 37:43.920
it happened where my child had an accident and I knew that was happening and the child was in a

37:43.920 --> 37:50.160
different town. So maybe it's a false memory where this is later on mistakenly attributed,

37:50.160 --> 37:54.720
but a lot of people think that this is not the correct explanation. So if something like this

37:54.720 --> 38:00.400
was real, what would it mean? It probably would mean that either your body is an antenna that is

38:00.400 --> 38:07.920
sending information over all sorts of channels like maybe just electromagnetic radio signals

38:07.920 --> 38:12.640
that you're sending over long distances and you get attuned to another person that you spend enough

38:12.640 --> 38:19.440
time with to get a few bits out of the ether to figure out what this person is doing. Or maybe

38:19.440 --> 38:24.160
it's also when you are very close to somebody and you become empathetic with them. What happens is

38:24.160 --> 38:29.600
that you go into a resonance state with them, right? Similar to when people go into a seance

38:29.600 --> 38:34.480
and they go into a trance state and they start shifting a video board around on the table.

38:34.560 --> 38:40.880
I think what happens is that their minds go by their nervous systems into a resonance state

38:40.880 --> 38:44.720
in which they basically create something like a shared dream between them.

38:44.720 --> 38:47.760
Physical closeness or closeness broadly defined?

38:48.400 --> 38:52.800
With physical closeness it's much easier to experience empathy with someone, right? I

38:52.800 --> 38:58.080
suspect it would be difficult for me to have empathy for you if you were in a different town.

38:58.080 --> 39:05.120
Also, how would that work? But if you are very close to someone, you pick up all sorts of signals

39:05.120 --> 39:12.000
from their body, not just via your eyes, but with your entire body. And if the nervous system sits

39:12.000 --> 39:15.280
on the other side and the intercellular communication sits on the other side and is

39:15.280 --> 39:20.000
integrating over all these signals, you can make inferences about the state of the other. And it's

39:20.000 --> 39:24.560
not just the personal self that does this via reasoning, but your perceptual system. And what

39:24.560 --> 39:29.680
basically happens is that your representations are directly interacting. It's the physical

39:31.360 --> 39:35.520
resonant models of the universe that exist in your nervous system and in your body

39:35.520 --> 39:40.560
might go into resonance with others and start sharing some of their states. So you basically

39:40.560 --> 39:48.080
by being next to somebody, you pick up some of their vibes and feel without looking at them

39:48.080 --> 39:52.960
what they're feeling in this moment. And it's difficult for you if you're very empathetic

39:52.960 --> 39:58.080
to detach yourself from it and have an emotional state that is completely independent

39:58.080 --> 40:01.680
from your environment. People who are highly empathetic are describing this.

40:02.240 --> 40:08.800
And now imagine that a lot of organisms on this planet have representations of the environment

40:08.800 --> 40:13.440
and operate like this and they are adjacent to each other and overlapping. So there's going to

40:13.440 --> 40:20.160
be some degree in which there is basically some change in direction and we are forming some slightly

40:20.720 --> 40:26.640
shared representation and know relatively few neuroscientists who consider this possibility.

40:26.640 --> 40:34.560
I think a big rarity in this regard is Michael Levin who is considering these things in earnest.

40:35.440 --> 40:42.560
And I stumbled on this train of thought mostly by noticing that the tasks of a neuron can be

40:42.560 --> 40:48.240
fulfilled by other cells as well. They can send different type chemical messages and physical

40:48.240 --> 40:54.000
messages to their adjacent cells and learn when to do this and when not, make this conditional and

40:54.000 --> 40:58.800
become universal function approximators. The only thing that they cannot do is telegraph

40:58.800 --> 41:04.640
information over axons very quickly over long distances. So neurons in this perspective are

41:04.640 --> 41:11.200
specially adapted kind of telegraph cell that has evolved so we can move our muscles very fast.

41:11.280 --> 41:18.080
But our body is in principle able to also make models of the world just much, much slower.

41:20.720 --> 41:24.800
It's interesting though that at this time, at least in human history, there seems to be a gap

41:24.800 --> 41:31.280
between the tools of science and the subjective experience that people report like you're talking

41:31.280 --> 41:37.920
about with telepathy and it seems like we're not quite there.

41:37.920 --> 41:41.920
No, I think that there is no gap between the tools of science and telepathy. Either it's there

41:41.920 --> 41:46.160
or it's not and it's an empirical question and if it's there we should be able to detect it in a lab.

41:47.040 --> 41:49.680
So why is there not a lot of Michael Levin's walking around?

41:50.480 --> 41:55.600
I don't think that Michael Levin is specifically focused on telepathy very much.

41:55.600 --> 42:02.080
He is focused on self-organization in living organisms and in brains, both as a paradigm

42:02.080 --> 42:06.800
for development and as a paradigm for information processing. And when you think about how

42:06.800 --> 42:11.840
organization processing works in an organism, there is first of all radical locality, which

42:11.840 --> 42:16.480
means everything is decided locally from the perspective of an individual cell. The individual

42:16.480 --> 42:22.400
cell is the agent. And the other one is coherence. Basically, there needs to be some criterion

42:22.400 --> 42:28.240
that determines how these cells are interacting in such a way that order emerges on the next

42:28.240 --> 42:36.480
level of structure. And this principle of coherence of imposing constraints that are not

42:36.480 --> 42:42.800
validated by the individual parts and lead to coherent structure to basically transcendental

42:42.800 --> 42:48.960
agency where you form an agent on the next level of organization is crucial in this perspective.

42:48.960 --> 42:56.800
It's so cool that radical locality leads to the emergence of complexity at the higher layers.

42:57.440 --> 43:03.360
And I think what Michael Levin is looking at is nothing that is outside of the realm of science

43:03.360 --> 43:10.560
in any way. It's just that he is a paradigmatic thinker who develops his own paradigm. And most

43:10.560 --> 43:15.840
of the neuroscientists are using a different paradigm at this point. And this often happens

43:15.840 --> 43:21.760
in science that a field has a few paradigms in which people try to understand reality and

43:21.760 --> 43:26.160
build concepts and make experiments. You're kind of one of those type of

43:26.160 --> 43:30.080
paradigmatic thinkers. Actually, if we can take a tangent on that,

43:31.120 --> 43:37.280
once again, returning to the biblical verses of your tweets. You're right. My public explorations

43:37.280 --> 43:43.440
are not driven by audience service, but by my lack of ability for discovering, understanding,

43:43.440 --> 43:49.520
or following the relevant authorities. So I have to develop my own thoughts. Since I think

43:49.520 --> 43:55.760
autonomously, these thoughts cannot always be very good. That's you apologizing for the chaos

43:55.760 --> 44:00.480
of your thoughts, or perhaps not apologizing, just identifying. But let me ask the question.

44:01.760 --> 44:08.800
Since we talked about Michael Levin and yourself, who I think are very kind of radical,

44:09.840 --> 44:16.080
big, independent thinkers, can we reverse engineer your process of thinking autonomously?

44:17.040 --> 44:19.440
How do you do it? How can humans do it?

44:21.040 --> 44:27.280
How can you avoid being influenced by, what is it, stage three?

44:29.040 --> 44:34.000
Well, why would you want to do that? You see what is working for you. And if it's

44:34.720 --> 44:38.000
not working for you, you build another structure that works better for you, right?

44:38.560 --> 44:45.440
And so I found myself when I was thrown into this world in a state where my intuitions

44:45.440 --> 44:50.960
were not working for me. I was not able to understand how I would be able to survive

44:50.960 --> 44:54.800
in this world and build the things that I was interested in, build the kinds of relationship

44:54.800 --> 45:01.200
I needed to work on the topics that I wanted to make progress on. And so I had to learn.

45:02.480 --> 45:08.160
For me, Twitter is not some tool of publication. It's not something where I put stuff that I

45:08.160 --> 45:12.720
entirely believe to be true and provable. It's an interactive notebook in which I explore

45:12.720 --> 45:18.720
possibilities. And I found that when I tried to understand how the mind and how consciousness

45:18.720 --> 45:24.720
works, I was quite optimistic. I thought there needs to be a big body of knowledge that I can

45:24.720 --> 45:31.280
just study and that works. And so I entered studies in philosophy and computer science,

45:31.840 --> 45:39.840
and later psychology and a bit of neuroscience and so on. And I was disappointed by what I found

45:39.840 --> 45:45.360
because I found that the questions of how consciousness and so on works, how emotion

45:45.360 --> 45:50.320
works, how it's possible that the system can experience anything, how motivation emerges

45:50.320 --> 45:57.200
in the mind were not being answered by the authorities that I met and the schools that

45:57.200 --> 46:03.920
were around. And instead I found that it was individual thinkers that had useful ideas

46:03.920 --> 46:08.160
that sometimes were good, sometimes were not so good, sometimes were adopted by a large group

46:08.160 --> 46:13.440
of people, sometimes were rejected by large groups of people. But for me, it was much more

46:13.440 --> 46:18.240
interesting to see these minds as individuals. And in my perspective, thinking is still something

46:18.240 --> 46:23.440
that is done not in groups, that has to be done by individuals. So that motivated you to become

46:23.440 --> 46:28.880
an individual thinker yourself. I didn't have a choice. I didn't find a group that thought in

46:28.880 --> 46:34.080
a way where I thought, okay, I can just adopt everything that everybody thinks here and now

46:34.080 --> 46:39.520
I understand how consciousness works or how the mind works or how thinking works or what thinking

46:39.520 --> 46:44.720
even is or what feelings are and how they're implemented and so on. So to figure all this out,

46:44.720 --> 46:50.240
I had to take a lot of ideas from individuals and then try to put them together in something

46:50.240 --> 46:55.840
that works for myself. And on one hand, I think it helps if you try to go down and

46:55.840 --> 47:02.000
find first principles on which you can recreate how thinking works, how languages work,

47:02.000 --> 47:08.240
what representation is, whether representation is necessary, how the relationship between

47:08.240 --> 47:13.280
representing agent and the world works in general. But how do you escape the influence?

47:13.280 --> 47:21.280
Once again, the pressure of the crowd, whether it's you in responding to the pressure or

47:22.160 --> 47:27.200
you being swept up by the pressure. If you even just look at Twitter, the opinions of the crowd.

47:27.280 --> 47:30.240
I don't feel pressure from the crowd. I'm completely immune to that.

47:31.280 --> 47:36.720
In the same sense, I don't have respect for authority. I have respect for what an individual

47:36.720 --> 47:43.440
is accomplishing or have respect for mental firepower. But it's not that I meet somebody and

47:43.440 --> 47:50.960
get lectured and unable to speak or then a large group of people has a certain idea that is

47:50.960 --> 47:56.000
different from mine. I don't necessarily feel intimidated, which has often been a problem for

47:56.000 --> 48:01.520
me in my life because I like instincts that other people develop at a very young age and that

48:02.240 --> 48:07.280
help with their self-preservation in a social environment. So I had to learn a lot of things

48:07.280 --> 48:15.920
the hard way. Yeah. So is there a practical advice you can give on how to think paradigmatically,

48:15.920 --> 48:22.480
how to think independently? Because you've kind of said, I had no choice. But I think

48:23.440 --> 48:24.960
to a degree you have a choice

48:27.520 --> 48:31.920
because you said you want to be productive. And I think thinking independently is productive

48:31.920 --> 48:34.240
if what you're curious about is understanding the world,

48:36.160 --> 48:44.400
especially when the problems are very kind of new and open. And so it seems like

48:46.000 --> 48:50.960
this is an active process. Like we can choose to do that. We can practice it.

48:51.760 --> 48:57.360
Well, it's a very basic question when you read a theory that you find convincing or interesting.

48:57.360 --> 49:03.520
How do you know? It's very interesting to figure out what are the sources of that other person,

49:03.520 --> 49:09.200
not which authority can they refer to that is then taking off the burden of being truthful. But

49:09.200 --> 49:14.560
how did this authority in turn know? What is the epistemic chain to observables? What are the first

49:14.560 --> 49:20.720
principles from which the whole thing is derived? And when I was young, I was not blessed with a

49:20.720 --> 49:26.320
lot of people around myself who knew how to make proofs from first principles. And I think

49:26.320 --> 49:31.600
mathematicians do this quite naturally. But most of the great mathematicians do not become

49:31.600 --> 49:37.520
mathematicians in school, but they tend to be self-taught because school teachers tend not to

49:37.520 --> 49:42.480
be mathematicians. They tend not to be people who derive things from first principles. So when you

49:42.480 --> 49:48.560
ask your school teacher, why does two plus two equal four? Does your school teacher give you

49:48.560 --> 49:53.600
the right answer? It's a simple game. And there are many simple games that you could play. And

49:54.640 --> 49:59.360
most of those games that you could just take different rules would not lead to an interesting

49:59.360 --> 50:04.240
arithmetic. And so it's just an exploration, but you can try what happens if you take different

50:04.240 --> 50:10.480
axioms. And here is how you build axioms and derive addition from them. And a built addition

50:10.480 --> 50:18.000
is some basically syntactic sugar in it. And so I wish that somebody would have opened me

50:18.000 --> 50:23.840
this Vista and explained to me how I can build a language in my own mind and from which I can

50:23.840 --> 50:31.760
derive what I'm seeing and which I can make geometry and counting and all the number games

50:31.760 --> 50:37.040
that we are playing in our life. And on the other hand, I felt that I learned a lot of this

50:37.040 --> 50:42.880
while I was programming as a child. When you start out with a computer like a Commodore 64,

50:42.880 --> 50:47.920
which doesn't have a lot of functionality, it's relatively easy to see how a bunch of relatively

50:47.920 --> 50:55.440
simple circuits are just basically performing hashes between bit patterns and how you can

50:55.440 --> 51:00.800
build the entirety of mathematics and computation on top of this and all the representational

51:00.800 --> 51:06.240
languages that you need. Man, Commodore 64 could be one of the sexiest machines ever built, if I

51:07.040 --> 51:15.120
say so myself. If we can return to this really interesting idea that we started to talk about

51:15.120 --> 51:25.360
with panpsychism and the complex resonator paradigm and the verses of your tweets.

51:26.320 --> 51:30.800
You write, instead of treating eyes, ears, and skin as separate sensory systems with

51:30.800 --> 51:35.440
fundamentally different modalities, we might understand them as overlapping aspects of the

51:35.440 --> 51:41.200
same universe, coupled at the same temporal resolution and almost inseparable from a single

51:41.200 --> 51:46.720
shared resonant model. Instead of treating mental representations as fully isolated between minds,

51:46.720 --> 51:52.560
the representations of physically adjacent observers might directly interact and produce

51:52.560 --> 51:57.280
causal effects through the coordination of the perception and behavior of world modeling

51:57.280 --> 52:05.200
observers. The distinction between modalities, let's throw that away. The distinction between

52:05.200 --> 52:11.360
the individuals, let's throw that away. So what does this interaction representations look like?

52:14.560 --> 52:18.880
When you think about how you represent the interaction of us in this room,

52:18.880 --> 52:23.680
at some level, the modalities are quite distinct. They're not completely distinct,

52:23.680 --> 52:27.920
but you can see this as vision. You can close your eyes and then you don't see a lot anymore,

52:28.720 --> 52:33.280
but you still imagine how my mouth is moving when you hear something and you know that it's

52:34.080 --> 52:40.240
very close to the sound that you can just open your eyes and you get back into the shared merge

52:40.240 --> 52:46.560
space. And we also have these experiments where we noticed that the way in which my lips are moving

52:46.560 --> 52:51.680
are affecting how you hear the sound. And also vice versa, the sounds that you're hearing have

52:51.680 --> 52:58.800
an influence on how you interpret some of the visual features. And so these modalities are

52:58.800 --> 53:03.360
not separate in your mind. They are merged at some fundamental level where you are

53:04.080 --> 53:09.200
interpreting the entire scene that you are in. And your own interactions in the scene are also

53:09.200 --> 53:13.600
not completely separate from the interactions of the other individual in the scene, but there is

53:13.600 --> 53:19.520
some resonance that is going on where we also have a degree of shared mental representations

53:19.520 --> 53:24.560
and shared empathy due to being in the same space and having vibes between each other.

53:24.560 --> 53:31.440
Vibes. So the question, though, is how deeply intertwined is this multi-modality,

53:32.000 --> 53:39.120
multi-agent system? I mean, this is going to the telepathy question without the

53:40.240 --> 53:46.800
woo-woo meaning of the word telepathy. What's going on here in this room right now?

53:47.760 --> 53:56.480
So if telepathy would work, how could it work? Imagine that all the cells in your body are

53:56.480 --> 54:01.040
sending signals in a similar way as neurons are doing. Just by touching the other cells

54:01.040 --> 54:05.440
and sending chemicals to them, the other cells interpreting them, learning how to react to them,

54:05.440 --> 54:10.800
and they learn how to approximate functions in this way and compute behavior for the organisms.

54:10.800 --> 54:15.440
And this is something that is open to plants as well. And so plants probably have software

54:15.600 --> 54:19.920
running on them that is controlling how the plant is working in a similar way as you have

54:19.920 --> 54:27.760
a mind that is controlling how you are behaving in the world. And this spirit of plants is something

54:27.760 --> 54:34.720
that has been very well described by our ancestors, and they found this quite normal. But for some

54:34.720 --> 54:38.960
reason, since the Enlightenment, we are treating this notion that there are spirits in nature

54:38.960 --> 54:45.200
and that plants have spirits as a superstition. And I think we probably have to rediscover that,

54:45.200 --> 54:51.440
that plants have software running on them. And we already did. You notice that there is a control

54:51.440 --> 54:56.480
system in the plant that connects every part of the plant to every other part of the plant and

54:56.480 --> 55:01.200
produces coherent behavior in the plant. That is, of course, much, much slower than the coherent

55:01.200 --> 55:07.680
behavior in an animal like us that has a nervous system where everything is synchronized much,

55:07.680 --> 55:13.440
much faster by the neurons. But what you also notice is that if a plant is sitting next to

55:13.440 --> 55:17.600
another plant, like you have a very old tree and this tree is building some kind of information

55:17.600 --> 55:23.120
highway along its cells so it can send information from its leaves to its roots and from some part

55:23.120 --> 55:27.200
of the root to another part of the roots, and there is a fungus living next to the tree,

55:27.200 --> 55:31.920
the fungus can probably piggyback on the communication between the cells of the tree

55:31.920 --> 55:36.320
and send its own signals through the tree. And vice versa, the tree might be able to send

55:36.320 --> 55:40.960
information to the fungus. Because after all, how would they build a viable firewall if that

55:40.960 --> 55:45.520
other organism is sitting next to them all the time and is never moving away? And so they will

55:45.520 --> 55:51.440
have to get along. And over a long enough timeframe, the networks of roots in the forest

55:51.440 --> 55:57.760
and all the other plants that are there and the fungi that are there might be forming something

55:57.760 --> 56:04.160
like a biological internet. But the question there is, do they have to be touching? Is biology at a

56:04.160 --> 56:10.080
distance possible? Of course, you can use any kind of physical signal. You can use sounds,

56:10.080 --> 56:15.440
you can use electromagnetic waves that are integrated over many cells. It's conceivable

56:15.440 --> 56:23.600
that across distances, there are many kinds of information pathways. But also, our planetary

56:23.600 --> 56:28.480
surface is pretty full of organisms, full of cells. So everything is touching everything else.

56:28.480 --> 56:35.200
Yeah. And it's been doing this for many millions and even billions of years. So there was enough

56:35.200 --> 56:41.040
time for information processing networks to form. And if you think about how a mind is

56:41.040 --> 56:46.240
self-organizing, basically it needs to, in some sense, reward the cells for computing the mind,

56:46.240 --> 56:52.400
for building the necessary dynamics between the cells that allow the mind to stabilize itself

56:52.400 --> 56:58.640
and remain on there. But if you look at these spirits of plants that are growing very close

56:58.640 --> 57:03.360
to each other in the forest, it might be almost growing into each other. These spirits might be

57:03.360 --> 57:09.120
able even to move to some degree, not to become somewhat dislocated and shift around in that

57:09.120 --> 57:16.720
ecosystem. So if you think about what a mind is, it's a bunch of activation waves that form

57:16.720 --> 57:23.760
coherent patterns and process information in a way that are colonizing an environment well enough to

57:24.720 --> 57:30.480
allow the continuous sustenance of the mind, the continuous stability and self-stabilization of the

57:30.480 --> 57:38.400
mind, then it's conceivable that we can link into this biological internet, not necessarily at the

57:38.400 --> 57:43.360
speed of our nervous system, but maybe at the speed of our body and make some kind of subconscious

57:43.360 --> 57:48.800
connection to the world where we use our body as an antenna into biological information processing.

57:48.800 --> 57:52.800
Now, these ideas are completely speculative. I don't know if any of that is true.

57:53.360 --> 57:58.080
But if that was true and if you want to explain telepathy, I think it's much more likely that

57:59.040 --> 58:02.640
that telepathy could be explained using such mechanisms rather than

58:02.640 --> 58:06.800
undiscovered quantum processes that would break the standard model of physics.

58:08.400 --> 58:11.520
Could there be undiscovered processes that don't break?

58:12.240 --> 58:19.920
Yeah. So if you think about something like an internet in the forest, that is something that

58:19.920 --> 58:24.320
is borderline discovered. There are basically a lot of scientists who point out that they do

58:24.320 --> 58:30.160
observe that plants are communicating the forest's root networks and send information,

58:30.160 --> 58:35.280
for instance, warn each other about new pests entering the forest and things that are happening

58:35.280 --> 58:40.240
like this. So basically, there is communication between plants and fungi that has been observed.

58:40.240 --> 58:44.800
Well, it's been observed, but we haven't plugged into it. So it's like if you observe humans,

58:44.800 --> 58:48.560
they seem to be communicating with a smartphone thing, but you don't understand how smartphone

58:48.560 --> 58:54.960
works and how the mechanism of the internet works. But maybe it's possible to really understand

58:56.000 --> 59:00.880
the full richness of the biological internet that connects us.

59:00.880 --> 59:05.600
An interesting question is whether the communication and the organization principles

59:05.600 --> 59:10.080
of biological information processing are as complicated as the technology that we've built.

59:11.200 --> 59:17.360
They set up on very different principles. The simultaneously looks very differently in biological

59:17.360 --> 59:23.600
systems, and the entire thing needs to be stochastic instead of being fully deterministic

59:23.600 --> 59:29.920
or almost fully deterministic as our digital computers are. So there is a different base

59:29.920 --> 59:36.240
protocol layer that would emerge over the biological structure if such a thing would be

59:36.240 --> 59:41.840
happening. And again, I'm not saying here that telepathy works and not saying that this is not

59:42.720 --> 59:49.520
but what I'm saying is, I think I'm open to a possibility that we see that a few bits can

59:49.520 --> 59:55.120
be traveling long distance between organisms using biological information processing in ways

59:55.840 --> 01:00:00.560
that we are not completely aware of right now. And that are more similar to

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:03.440
many of the stories that were completely normal for our ancestors.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:12.560
Well, this kind of interacting, intertwined representations takes us to the big

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.800
ending of your tweet series. You write, quote, I wonder if self-improving AGI might end up

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:27.200
saturating physical environments with intelligence to such a degree that isolation of individual

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:32.080
mental states becomes almost impossible. And the representations of all complex

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:40.000
self-organizing agents merge permanently with each other. So that's a really interesting idea.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:48.560
This biological network, life network gets so dense that it might as well be seen as one.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.840
That's an interesting, what do you think that looks like? What do you think that

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:58.080
saturation looks like? What does it feel like? I think it's a possibility. It's just a vague

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:06.240
possibility. And I like to explain, but what this looks like, I think that the end game of

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:12.960
AGI is substrate agnostic. That means that AGI ultimately, if it is being built, is going to be

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:18.880
smart enough to understand how AGI works. This means it's not going to be better than people

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:24.080
at AGI research and can take over in building the next generation, but it fully understands how it

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:28.640
works and how it's being implemented. And also, of course, understands how computation works in

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:33.440
nature, how to build new feedback loops that you can turn into your own circuits. And this means

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:38.560
that the AGI is likely to virtualize itself into any environment that can compute. So it's

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:43.680
breaking free from the silicon substrate and is going to move into the ecosystems, into our bodies,

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:50.400
our brains, and is going to merge with all the agency that it finds there. So it's conceivable

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:56.240
that you end up with completely integrated information processing across all computing

01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:01.840
systems, including biological computation on Earth. That we end up triggering some new step

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:07.920
in the evolution where basically some Gaia is being built over the entirety of all digital

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:15.920
and biological computation. And if this happens, then basically everywhere around us, you will have

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:21.120
agents that are connected and that are representing and building models of the world,

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.880
and their representations will physically interact. They will vibe with each other.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:33.040
And if you find yourself in an environment that is saturated with modeling compute where basically

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:41.520
almost every grain of sand could be part of computation that is at some point being

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:47.440
started by the AI, you could find yourself in a situation where you cannot escape this shared

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:52.480
representation anymore and where you indeed notice that everything in the world has one

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.320
shared resonant model of everything that's happening on the planet. And you notice which

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:04.480
part you are in this thing. And you become part of a very larger, almost holographic mind in which

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.360
all the parts are observing each other and form a coherent whole.

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:14.080
So you lose the ability to notice yourself as a distinct entity?

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:18.400
No, I think that when you're conscious in your own mind, you notice yourself as a distinct entity.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:24.880
You notice yourself as a self-reflexive observer. And I suspect that we become conscious at the

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:30.160
beginning of our mental development, not at some very high level. Consciousness seems to be part

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:35.120
of a training mechanism that biological nervous systems have to discover to become trainable,

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:40.160
because you cannot take a nervous system like ours and do a stochastic way to send

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.640
us back propagation over 100 layers. This would not be stable on biological neurons.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:52.240
And so instead, we start with some colonizing principle in which a part of the mental

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:57.280
representations form a notion of being a self-reflexive observer that is imposing

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.520
coherence on its environment. And this spreads until the boundary of your mind.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:08.160
And if that boundary is no longer clear cut because AI is jumping across substrates,

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.120
it would be interesting to see what a global mind would look like that is basically producing a

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:18.960
globally coherent language of thought and is representing everything from all the possible

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:24.160
vantage points. That's an interesting world.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:29.360
The intuition that this thing grew out of is a particular mental state. And it's a state that

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:35.280
you find sometimes in literature. For instance, Neil Gaiman describes it in the ocean at the end

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:43.120
of the lane. And it's this idea or this experience that there is a state in which you feel that you

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:48.000
know everything that can be known and that in your normal human mind, you've only forgotten.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
You've forgotten that you are the entire universe. And some people describe this

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:58.080
after they've taken an extremely large amount of mushrooms or had a big spiritual experience

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:03.520
as hippie in their 20s. And they notice basically that they are in everything and their

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.480
body is only one part of the universe and nothing ends at their body. And

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:14.160
actually everything is observing and they are part of this big observer. And the big observer

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:19.920
is focused as one local point in their body and their personality and so on.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:25.360
But we can basically have this oceanic state in which we have no boundaries and are one

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:30.240
with everything. And a lot of meditators call this the non-dual state because you no longer

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:35.360
have the separation between self and world. And as I said, you can explain the state relatively

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:42.000
simply without panpsychism or anything else, but just by breaking down the constructed boundary

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.200
between self and world and our own mind. But if you combine this with the notion that the systems

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.680
are physically interacting to the point where their representations are merging and interacting

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:56.480
with each other, you would literally implement something like this. It would still be a

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.960
representational state. You would not be one with physics itself. It would still be coarse-grained.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:06.480
It would still be much slower than physics itself. But it would be a representation in

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:12.560
which you become aware that you're part of some kind of global information processing system,

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:17.760
like a thought and a global mind and a conscious thought that coexisting with many other

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:18.880
self-reflexive thoughts.

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:26.080
I would love to observe that from a video game design perspective, how that game looks.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.320
Maybe you will after we build AGI and it takes over.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:34.400
But would you be able to step away, step out of the whole thing, just kind of watch

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.080
the way we can now? Sometimes when I'm at a crowded party or something like this,

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:45.440
you step back and you realize all the different costumes, all the different interactions,

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:51.360
all the different computation, that all the individual people are once distinct from each

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:58.000
other and at once all the same. It's already what we do. We can have thoughts that are integrative

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:04.000
and we have thoughts that are highly dissociated from everything else and experience themselves

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:10.000
as separate. But you want to allow yourself to have those thoughts. Sometimes you resist it.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.720
I think that it's not normative. It's more descriptive. I want to understand

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:20.640
space of states that we can be in and that people are reporting and make sense of them.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:25.200
It's not that I believe that it's your job in life to get to a particular kind of state

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:31.120
and then you get a high score. Or maybe you do. I think you're really

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:34.880
against this high-scoring thing. I kind of like it. You're probably very competitive and I'm not.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.640
No, not competitive. Like role-playing games, like Skyrim, it's not competitive.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:46.080
There's a nice feeling where your experience points go up. You're not competing against

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:50.960
anybody, but it's the world saying, you're on the right track. Here's a point.

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:56.240
That's the game saying it. It's the game economy. And I found when I was playing games and was

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:01.760
getting addicted to these systems, then I would get into the game and hack it. So I get control

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:05.120
over the scoring system and would no longer be subject to it.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:08.880
So you're no longer playing, you're trying to hack it.

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:14.000
I don't want to be addicted to anything. I want to be in charge. I want to have agency over what I

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.960
do. Addiction is the loss of control for you? Yes. Addiction means that you're doing something

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:23.840
compulsively. And the opposite of free will is not determinism, it's compulsion.

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.360
You don't want to lose yourself in the addiction to something nice.

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:34.800
Addiction to love, to the pleasant feelings we humans experience.

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:42.720
No, I find this gets old. I don't want to have the best possible emotions. I want to have the

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:47.360
most appropriate emotions. I don't want to have the best possible experience. I want to have

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:52.720
an adequate experience that is serving my goals, the stuff that I find meaningful in this world.

01:08:54.080 --> 01:09:01.040
From the biggest questions of consciousness, let's explore the pragmatic, the projections

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:08.880
of those big ideas into our current world. What do you think about LLMs, the recent rapid development

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:18.240
of large language models, of the AI world, of generative AI? How much of the hype is deserved

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:23.680
and how much is not? And people should definitely follow your Twitter because you explore these

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:29.600
questions in a beautiful, profound and hilarious way at times. No, don't follow my Twitter. I

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:34.320
already have too many followers. At some point it's going to be unpleasant. I noticed that

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:44.800
a lot of people feel that it's totally okay to punch up. It's a very weird notion that you feel

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:49.520
that you haven't changed, but your account has grown and suddenly you have a lot of people who

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:56.480
casually abuse you. I don't like that I have to blog more than before and I don't like this

01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:03.520
overall vibe shift. Right now it's still somewhat okay, so pretty much okay. I can go to a place

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:07.280
where people work on stuff that I'm interested in and there's a good chance that a few people

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:15.040
in the room know me, so there's no awkwardness. But when I get to a point where random strangers

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.120
feel that they have to have an opinion about me one way or the other, I don't think I would like

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:25.760
that. Random strangers because of your in their mind elevated position?

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:32.000
Yes, so basically whenever you are in any way prominent or some kind of celebrity,

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.200
random strangers will have to have an opinion about you.

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.120
Yeah, and they kind of forget that you're human too.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:43.760
I mean, you notice this thing yourself that the more popular you get, the higher the pressure

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:51.120
becomes, the more winds are blowing in your direction from all sides. And it's stressful,

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:55.120
right? And it does have a little bit of upside, but it also has a lot of downside.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:00.720
I think it has a lot of upside, at least for me currently, at least perhaps because of the podcast.

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:07.360
Because most people are really good and people come up to me and they have love in their eyes

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:12.960
and over a stretch of like 30 seconds, you can hug it out and you can just exchange a few words and

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.600
you reinvigorate your love for humanity. So that's an upside for a loner.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:26.240
I'm a loner because otherwise you have to do a lot of work to find such humans. And here

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:32.560
you're like thrust into the full humanity, the goodness of humanity for the most part.

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:42.320
Of course, maybe it gets worse as you become more prominent. I hope not. This is pretty awesome.

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:45.840
I have a couple handful very close friends and I don't have enough time

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:50.080
for them and attention for them as it is. And I find this very, very regrettable.

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:54.560
And then there are so many awesome, interesting people that I keep meeting

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:57.760
and I would like to integrate them in my life, but I just don't know how.

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.040
But there's only so much time and attention. And the older I get,

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.760
the harder it is to bond with new people in a deep way.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:10.640
But can you enjoy, I mean, there's a picture of you, I think, with Roger Penrose and Eric

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:15.120
Weinstein and a few others that are interesting figures. Can't you just enjoy

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.000
random, interesting humans for a short amount of time?

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:24.960
I like these people and what I like is intellectual stimulation and I'm very

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:29.280
grateful that I'm getting it. Can you not be melancholy or maybe I'm projecting,

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:35.920
I hate goodbyes. Can we just not hate goodbyes and just enjoy the hello, take it in,

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:40.000
taking a person, taking their ideas and then move on through life?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.960
I think it's totally okay to be sad about goodbyes

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:46.480
because that indicates that there was something that you're going to miss.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:55.440
Yeah, but it's painful. Maybe that's one of the reasons I'm an introvert is I hate goodbyes.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.680
But you have to say goodbye before you say hello again.

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:08.560
I know, but that experience of loss, that mini-loss,

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:17.840
maybe that's a little death. Maybe, I don't know. I think this melancholy feeling is just

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:22.240
the other side of love and I think they go hand in hand and it's a beautiful thing.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.280
And I'm just being romantic about it at the moment.

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:31.280
And I'm not no stranger to melancholy and sometimes it's difficult to be here to be alive.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.960
Sometimes it's just painful to exist.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:40.000
But there's beauty in that pain too. That's what melancholy feeling is.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.240
It's not negative. Melancholy doesn't have to be negative.

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:43.840
It can also kill you.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.880
Well, we all die eventually.

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:55.360
Now, as we got to this topic, the actual question was about what your thoughts are

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:59.440
about the recent development of large luggage models with Chad GPT.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:13:59.760
Indeed.

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:05.920
There's a lot of hype. Is some of the hype justified? Which is, which isn't?

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.600
What are your thoughts? High level.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:15.440
I find that large language models do have this coding. So it's an extremely useful application

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:21.520
that is for a lot of people taking Stack Overflow out of their life in exchange for

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:27.680
something that is more efficient. I feel that Chad GPT is like an intern that I have to micromanage.

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:33.840
I have been working with people in the past who were less capable than Chad GPT.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:40.000
And I'm not saying this because I hate people. Personally, as human beings,

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.160
there was something present that was not there in Chad GPT, which was why I was covering for them.

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:52.080
But Chad GPT has an interesting ability. It does give people superpowers.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:57.280
And the people who feel threatened by them are the prompt home leaders. They are the people who

01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:03.360
do what Chad GPT is doing right now. So if you are not creative, if you don't build your own

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:08.960
thoughts, if you don't have actual plans in the world, and your only job is to summarize emails

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:15.280
and to expand simple intentions into emails again, then Chad GPT might look like a threat.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000
But I believe that it is a very beneficial technology that allows us to create more

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.800
interesting stuff and make the world more beautiful and fascinating if we

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:33.360
find to build it into our life in the right ways. So I'm quite fascinated by these large

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:38.640
language models, but I also think that they are by no means the final development.

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:45.600
And it's interesting to see how this development progresses. One thing that the out of the box

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:51.120
vanilla language models have as a limitation is that they have still some limited coherence

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:57.920
and ability to construct complexity. And even though they exceed human abilities to do what

01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:04.240
they can do one shot. Typically, when you write a text with a language model or using it, or when

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:09.040
you write code for the language model, it's not one shot because there won't be bugs in your program

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:14.240
and design errors and compiler errors and so on. And your language model can help you to fix those

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:20.240
things. But this process is out of the box not automated yet. So there is a management process

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:26.080
that also needs to be done. And there are some interesting developments, baby AGI and so on,

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:31.600
that are trying to automate this management process as well. And I suspect that soon we

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:37.040
are going to see a bunch of cognitive architectures where every module is in some sense a language

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:41.600
model or something equivalent. And between the language models, we exchange suitable data

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:48.560
structures, not English, and produce compound behavior of this whole thing.

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:54.000
So do some of the quote unquote prompt engineering for you. They create these kind

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.440
of cognitive architectures, they do the prompt engineering, and you're just doing the high,

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:05.120
high level meta prompt engineering. There are limitations in a language model alone.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:11.520
I feel that part of my mind works similarly to a language model, which means I can yell into it,

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:16.960
a prompt, and it's going to give me a creative response. But I have to do something with this

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:22.480
points first. I have to take it as a generative artifact that may or may not be true.

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:29.360
It's usually a confabulation. It's just an idea. And then I take this idea and modify it. I might

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:36.560
build a new prompt that is stepping off this idea and develop it to the next level, or put it into

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:42.000
something larger, or I might try to prove whether it's true or make an experiment. And this is what

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.120
the language models right now are not doing yet. But there's also no technical reason

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:51.840
for why they shouldn't be able to do this. So the way to make a language model coherent is

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:57.440
probably not to use reinforcement learning until it only gives you one possible answer

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:04.160
that is linking to its source data. But it's using this as a component in larger system

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:10.320
that can also be built by the language model or is enabled by language model structured components.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:16.000
Or using different technologies. I suspect that language models will be an important stepping

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:23.600
stone in developing different types of systems. And one thing that is really missing in the form

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:28.480
of language models that we have today is real-time world coupling. It's difficult to

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:33.760
do perception with a language model and motor control with a language model. Instead,

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:38.960
you would need to have a different type of thing that is working with it. Also,

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:44.720
the language model is a little bit obscuring what its actual functionality is. Some people

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:49.440
associate the structure of the neural network of the language model with the nervous system. And

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:54.960
I think that's the wrong intuition. The neural networks are unlike nervous system. They are more

01:18:54.960 --> 01:19:04.880
like 100-step functions that use differentiable linear algebra to approximate the correlation

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.360
between adjacent brain states. It's basically a function that moves the system from one

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.080
representational state to the next representational state. If you try to map this into

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:22.160
a metaphor that is closer to our brain, imagine that you would take a language model or a model

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:27.920
like Dali that you use, for instance, this image-guided diffusion to approximate a camera

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:32.240
image and use the activation state of the neural network to interpret the camera image,

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:38.640
which in principle I think will be possible very soon. You do this periodically. And now you look

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:45.920
at these patterns, how when this thing interacts with the world periodically, look like in time.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:51.280
And these time slices, they are somewhat equivalent to the activation state of the brain

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:58.880
at a given moment. How is the actual brain different? Just the asynchronous craziness?

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:05.360
For me, it's fascinating that they are so vastly different and yet in some circumstances produce

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:11.120
somewhat similar behavior. And the brain is, first of all, different because it's a self-organizing

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:16.720
system where the individual cell is an agent that is communicating with the other agents around it

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:22.400
and is always trying to find some solution. And all the structure that pops up is emergent

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:28.400
structure. So one way in which you could try to look at this is that individual neurons probably

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:33.760
need to get a reward. So they become trainable, which means they have to have inputs that are not

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:38.080
affecting the metabolism of the cell directly. But there are messages, semantic messages that

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:42.720
tell the cell whether it has done good or bad and in which direction it should shift its behavior.

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:48.560
Once you have such an input, neurons become trainable and you can train them to perform

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:54.080
computations by exchanging messages with other neurons. And parts of the signals that they are

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:58.640
exchanging and parts of the computation that are performing are control messages that perform

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:05.840
management tasks for other neurons and other cells. I suspect that the brain does not stop

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:10.640
at the boundary of neurons to other cells, but many adjacent cells will be involved

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:15.680
intimately in the functionality of the brain and will be instrumental in distributing rewards and

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.560
managing its functionality.

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:25.520
It's fascinating to think about what those characteristics of the brain enable you to do,

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:27.280
that language models cannot do.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:32.960
So first of all, there's a different loss function at work when we learn. And to me,

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:38.640
it's fascinating that you can build a system that looks at 800 million pictures and captions and

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:44.160
correlates them, because I don't think that a human nervous system could do this. For us,

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:49.600
the world is only learnable because the adjacent frames are related. And we can afford to discard

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:54.240
most of that information during learning. We basically take only in stuff that makes us more

01:21:54.240 --> 01:22:00.000
coherent, not less coherent. And our neural networks are willing to look at data that is not

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.320
making the neural network coherent at first, but only in the long run. By doing lots and lots

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:11.120
statistics, eventually patterns become visible and emerge. And our mind seems to be focused

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:13.440
on finding the patterns as early as possible.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:16.000
So filtering early on, not later.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.080
Yes. It's a slightly different paradigm and it leads to much faster convergence. So we only need

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:26.080
to look at a tiny fraction of the data to become coherent. And of course, we do not have the same

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:32.480
richness as our trained models. We will not incorporate the entirety of text in the internet

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:37.280
and be able to refer to it and have all this knowledge available and being able to confabulate

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:41.840
over it. Instead, we have a much, much smaller part of it that is more deliberately built.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:46.160
And to me, it would be fascinating to think about how to build such systems.

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:52.160
It's not obvious that they would necessarily be more efficient than us on a digital substrate,

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:58.240
but I suspect that they might. So I suspect that the actual AGI that is going to be more

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:02.720
interesting is going to use slightly different algorithmic paradigms or sometimes massively

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:08.240
different algorithmic paradigms than the current generation of transformer-based learning systems.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:11.440
Do you think you might be using just a bunch of language models like this?

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:19.040
Do you think the current transformer-based large language models will take us to AGI?

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:24.960
My main issue is I think that they're quite ugly and brutalist.

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:26.800
Which brutalist? Is that what you said?

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:33.840
Yes. They are basically brute forcing the problem of thought. And by training this thing with

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:38.880
looking at instances where people have thought and then trying to deepfake that. And if you

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:43.040
have enough data, the deepfake becomes indistinguishable from the actual phenomenon.

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:46.000
And in many circumstances, it's going to be identical.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:53.600
Can you deepfake it till you make it? What are the limitations of this? Can you reason?

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.680
Let's use words that are loaded.

01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:02.320
Yes. That's a very interesting question. I think that these models are clearly making some

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:08.000
inference. But if you give them a reasoning task, it's often difficult for the experimenters to

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.800
figure out whether the reasoning is the result of the emulation of the reasoning strategy that

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:17.840
they saw in human written text or whether it's something that the system was able to infer by

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:23.920
itself. On the other hand, if you think of human reasoning, if you want to become a very good

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:30.480
reasoner, you don't do this by just figuring out yourself. You read about reasoning. And the first

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:35.440
people who tried to write about reasoning and reflect on it didn't get it right. Even Aristotle

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:40.400
thought about this very hard and came up with a theory of how syllogisms works and syllogistic

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:45.920
reasoning has mistakes in his attempt to build something like a formal logic and gets maybe 80%

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:52.240
right. And the people that are talking about reasoning professionally today read Tarski and

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:59.200
Frege and built on their work. So in many ways, people when they perform reasoning are emulating

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:04.640
what other people wrote about reasoning. So it's difficult to really draw this boundary.

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:13.280
And when Francois Chollet says that these models are only interpolating between what they saw and

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:18.640
what other people are doing, well, if you give them all the latent dimensions that can be extracted

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:23.920
from the internet, what's missing? Maybe there is almost everything there. And if you're not

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:29.680
sufficiently informed by these dimensions and you need more, I think it's not difficult to increase

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:36.000
the temperature in the large angle model to the point that is producing stuff that is maybe 90%

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.760
nonsense and 10% viable and combine this with some prover that is trying to filter out the

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:46.960
viable parts from the nonsense in the same way as our own thinking works. When we're very creative,

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:52.480
we increase the temperature in our own mind and recreate hypothetical universes and solutions,

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:58.480
most of which will not work. And then we test. And we test by building a core that is internally

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:05.920
coherent. And we use reasoning strategies that use some axiomatic consistency by which we can

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:12.000
identify those strategies and thoughts and sub universes that are viable and that can

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.480
expand our thinking. So if you look at the language models, they have clear limitations right now.

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:20.800
One of them is they're not coupled to the world in real time in the way in which our nervous systems

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:25.280
are. So it's difficult for them to observe themselves in the universe and to observe

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:30.160
what kind of universe they're in. Second, they don't do real-time learning. They basically get

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:36.480
only trained with algorithms that rely on the data being available in batches. So it can be

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:40.800
parallelized and runs efficiently on the network and so on. And real-time learning would be very

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:46.160
slow so far and inefficient. That's clearly something that our nervous systems can do to

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:54.320
some degree. And there is a problem with these models being coherent. And I suspect that all

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:58.880
these problems are solvable without a technological revolution. We don't need fundamentally new

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:04.800
algorithms to change that. For instance, you can enlarge in the context window and thereby

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:08.560
basically create working memory in which you train everything that happens during the day.

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:13.120
And if that is not sufficient, you add a database and you write some clever mechanisms that the

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:19.600
system learns to use to swap in and out stuff from its prompt context. And if that is not

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:24.720
sufficient, if your database is full in the evening, overnight you just train. The system

01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:29.680
is going to sleep and dream and is going to train the stuff from its database into the larger model

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:34.640
by fine-tuning it, building additional layers and so on. And then the next day it starts with a fresh

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:40.240
database in the morning with fresh eyes and has integrated all this stuff. And when you talk to

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:44.480
people and you have strong disagreements about something which means that in their mind they

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:49.280
have a faulty belief or you have a faulty belief with a lot of dependencies on it, very often you

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:54.000
will not achieve agreement in one session, but you need to sleep about this once or multiple times

01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:58.880
before you have integrated all these necessary changes in your mind. So maybe it's already

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:03.200
somewhat similar. Yeah, there's already a latency even for humans to update the model.

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:08.560
And of course we can combine the language model with models that get coupled to reality in real

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:13.840
time and can build multi-modal model and bridge between vision models and language models and so

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:20.800
on. So there is no reason to believe that the language models will necessarily run into some

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:26.720
problem that will prevent them from becoming generally intelligent. But I don't know that.

01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:32.400
It's just I don't see proof that they wouldn't. My issue is I don't like them. I think that they're

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:37.600
inefficient. I think that they use way too much compute. I think that given the amazing hardware

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:42.080
that we have, we could build something that is much more beautiful than our own mind. And this

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:46.320
thing is not as beautiful as our own mind, despite being so much larger.

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:49.040
But it's a kind of proof of concept.

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:54.880
It's the only thing that works right now, right? So it's not the only game in town,

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:59.520
but it's the only thing that has this utility with so much simplicity. There's a bunch of

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:04.960
relatively simple algorithms that you can understand in relatively few weeks that can

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:11.600
be scaled up massively. So it's the deep blue of chess playing. Yeah, it's ugly.

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:16.400
Yeah, Claude Shannon had this when you described chess suggested that there are two main strategies

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:21.280
in which you could play chess. One is that you are making a very complicated plan that reaches

01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:27.040
far into the future and you try not to make a mistake while enacting it. And this is basically

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:31.520
the human strategy. And the other strategy is that you are brute forcing your way to success,

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:36.000
which means you make a tree of possible moves where you look at in principle every move that

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.280
is open to you or the possible answers. And you try to make this as deeply as possible. Of course,

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:47.680
you optimize, you cut off trees that don't look very promising, and you use libraries of end game

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:52.720
and early game and so on to optimize this entire process. But this brute force strategy is how

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:58.800
most of the chess programs were built. And this is how computers get better than humans at playing

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:05.120
chess. And I look at the large language models, I feel that I'm observing the same thing. It's

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:09.280
basically the brute force strategy to sort by training the thing on pretty much the entire

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:14.240
internet. And then in the limit, it gets coherent to a degree that approaches human coherence.

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:22.320
And on a side effect, it's able to do things that no human could do. It's able to sift through

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:26.960
massive amounts of text relatively quickly and summarize them quickly and it never lapses in

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:32.320
attention. And I still have the illusion that when I play with chat GPT, that it's in principle not

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:37.760
doing anything that I could not do if I had Google at my disposal and I get all the resources from

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:44.720
the internet and spend enough time on it. But this thing that I have an extremely autistic,

01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:50.560
stupid intern in a way that is extremely good at drudgery. And I can offload the drudgery to

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:57.200
the degree that I'm able to automate the management of the intern is something that is difficult for

01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:02.240
me to over hype at this point because we have not yet started to scratch the surface of what's

01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:06.720
possible with this. But it feels like it's a tireless intern or maybe it's an army of interns.

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:14.160
And so you get to command these slightly incompetent creatures.

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:19.280
And there's an aspect because of how rapidly you can iterate with it.

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:26.640
It's also part of the brainstorming part of the kind of inspiration for your own thinking.

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:31.600
So you get to interact with the thing. I mean, when I'm programming or doing any kind of generation

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:38.960
of GPT, it somehow is a catalyst for your own thinking in a way that I think an intern might

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:44.000
not be. Yeah. It gets really interesting, I find, is when you turn it into a multi-agent system.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:49.760
So for instance, you can get the system to generate a dialogue between a patient and a

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:55.360
doctor very easily. But what's more interesting is you have one instance of Chet GPT that is

01:31:55.360 --> 01:32:01.040
the patient and you tell it in the prompt what kind of complicated syndrome it has.

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:06.640
And the other one is a therapist who doesn't know anything about this patient. And you just

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:12.640
have these two instances battling it out and observe the psychiatrist or psychologist trying

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:17.600
to analyze the patient and trying to figure out what's wrong with the patient. And if you

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:22.560
try to take a very large problem, a problem, for instance, how to build a company, and you

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:28.160
turn this into lots and lots of sub-problems, then often you can get to a level where the language

01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:34.240
model is able to solve this. What I also found interesting is based on the observation that

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:38.640
Chet GPT is pretty good at translating between programming languages, but sometimes there's

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:46.320
difficulty to write very long coherent algorithms that you need to co-write them as human author.

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:50.800
Why not design a language that is suitable for this? So some kind of pseudocode that is more

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:56.720
relaxed than Python and that allows you to sometimes specify a problem vaguely in human

01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:05.600
terms and let Chet GPT take care of the rest. And you can use Chet GPT to develop that syntax for it

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:12.720
and develop new kinds of programming paradigms in this way. So you very soon get to the point

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:17.120
where this question, the age old question for us computer scientists, what is the best programming

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:22.800
language and can we write a better programming language now? I think that almost every serious

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:27.280
computer scientist goes through a phase like this in their life. This is a question that is

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:31.600
almost no longer relevant because what is different between the programming languages

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:35.600
is not what they let the computer do, but what they let you think about what the computer should

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:43.280
be doing. And now Chet GPT becomes an interface to this in which you can specify in many, many ways

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:48.960
what the computer should be doing and Chet GPT or some other language model or combination of system

01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:55.680
is going to take care of the rest. And allow you to expand the realm of thought you're allowed to

01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:01.680
have when interacting with the computer. It sounds to me like you're saying there's basically no

01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:06.960
limitations, your intuition says, to what larger language. I don't know of that limitation. So when

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:11.280
I currently play with it, it's quite limited. I wish that it was way better. But isn't that your

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:15.440
fault versus the larger? I don't know. Of course, it's always my fault. There's probably a way to

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:18.880
make it work better. Is everything your fault? I just want to get you on the record. Yes,

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:24.160
everything is my fault. That doesn't work in my life. At least that is usually the most useful

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:30.240
perspective for myself. Even though the science side, I feel no. I sometimes wish I could have

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:35.600
seen myself as part of my environment more and understand that a lot of people are actually

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:40.080
seeing me and looking at me and are trying to make my life work in the same way as I try to help

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:47.760
others. And making the switch to this level three perspective is something that happened

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:52.720
long after my level four perspective in my life. And I wish that I could have had it earlier.

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:57.280
And it's also not now that I don't feel like I'm complete. I'm all over the place. That's all.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:03.600
Worst happiness in terms of stages is on three and four. No, you can be happy at any stage or

01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:11.440
unhappy. But I think that if you are at a stage where you get agency over how your feelings are

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:16.640
generated, and to some degree, you start doing this when you leave a dollar sense, I believe.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:20.880
That you understand that you're in charge of your own emotion to some degree and that you are

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:28.640
responsible how you approach the world. That it's basically your task to have some basic hygiene

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:33.680
the way in which you deal with your mind. And you cannot blame your environment for the way in which

01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:39.760
you feel. But you live in a world that is highly mobile and it's your job to choose the environment

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:44.240
that you thrive in and to build it. And sometimes it's difficult to get the necessary strength

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:49.520
and energy to do this and independence and the worst you feel, the harder it is.

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:55.040
But it's something that we learn. It's also this thing that we are usually incomplete.

01:35:55.520 --> 01:36:01.280
I'm a rare mind, which means I'm a mind that is incomplete in ways that are harder to complete.

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:06.480
So for me, it might have been harder initially to find the right relationships and friends

01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:10.560
that complete me to the degree that I become an almost functional human being.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:20.480
Oh man, the search space of humans that complete you is an interesting one. Especially for

01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:25.360
Joshua Bach. That's an interesting because talking about brute force search in chess,

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:29.120
I wonder what that search tree looks like.

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:35.200
I think that my rational thinking is not good enough to solve that task.

01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:39.760
A lot of problems in my life that I can conceptualize as software problems and

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:45.120
the failure modes are bugs and I can debug them and write software that take care of the missing

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:51.440
functionality. But there is stuff that I don't understand well enough to use my analytical

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:55.680
reasoning to solve the issue. And then I have to develop my intuitions. And often I have to do

01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:01.040
this with people who are wiser than me. And that's something that's hard for me because I'm not born

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:07.040
with the instinct to submit to other people's wisdom. Yeah. So what kind of problems are we

01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:12.560
talking about? This is stage three, like love? I found love was never hard.

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:19.120
What is hard then? Fitting into a world that most people

01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:22.000
work differently than you and have different intuitions of what should be done.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:32.000
So empathy. It's also aesthetics. When you come into a world where almost everything is ugly and

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:37.280
you come out of a world where everything is beautiful. I grew up in a beautiful place as

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:46.240
a child of an artist. And in this place, it was mostly nature. Everything had intrinsic beauty.

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:55.600
And everything was built out of an intrinsic need for it to work for itself. Everything that

01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:00.800
my father created was something that he made to get the world to work for himself. And I felt

01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:06.800
the same thing. And when I come out into the world and I am asked to submit to lots and lots of rules

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:11.120
I'm asking, okay, when I observe your stupid rules, what is the benefit?

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:14.720
And I see the life that is being offered as a reward. It's not attractive.

01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:22.160
When you were born and raised in extraterrestrial prints in a world full of people wearing suits.

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:29.920
So it's a challenging integration. Yes. But it also means that I'm often blind

01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:34.480
for the ways in which everybody is creating their own bubble of wholesomeness. Almost everybody and

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:39.520
people are trying to do it. And for me to discover this, it was necessary that I found

01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:45.040
people who had a similar shape of soul as myself. So basically I thought these are my people,

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:49.760
people that treat each other in such a way as if they're around with each other for eternity.

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:56.000
How long does it take you to detect the geometry, the shape of the soul of another human

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:02.240
to notice that they might be one of your kind? Sometimes it's instantly, and I'm wrong,

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:07.120
and sometimes it takes a long time. You believe in love at first sight, Joschka Bach.

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:18.400
Yes. But I also noticed that I have been wrong. So sometimes I look at a person and I'm just

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:24.640
enamored by everything about them. And sometimes this is persists and sometimes it doesn't.

01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:31.840
And I have the illusion that I'm much better at recognizing who people are as they grow older.

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:37.440
But that could be just cynicism? No.

01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:44.160
No, it's not cynicism. It's often more that I'm able to recognize what somebody needs

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:48.800
when we interact and how we can meaningfully interact. It's not cynical at all.

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:50.160
You're better at noticing.

01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:56.400
Yes. I'm much better, I think, in some circumstances at understanding how to interact

01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:01.840
with other people than I did when I was young. It doesn't mean that I'm always very good at it.

01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:07.680
So that takes us back to prompt engineering of noticing how to be a better prompt engineer of

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:17.360
an LLM. A sense I have is that there's a bottomless well of skill to become a great prompt engineer.

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:21.760
It feels like it is all my fault whenever I fail to use chat GPT correctly,

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:23.840
that I didn't find the right words.

01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:31.440
Most of the stuff that I'm doing in my life doesn't need chat GPT. There are a few tasks

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:38.960
that are where it helps. But the main stuff that I need to do, like developing my own thoughts

01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:44.320
and aesthetics and relationship to people, it's necessary for me to write for myself

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:49.840
because writing is not so much about producing an artifact that other people can use,

01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:52.880
but it's a way to structure your own thoughts and develop yourself.

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:59.680
So I think this idea that kids are writing their own essays with chat GPT in the future

01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:03.920
is going to have this drawback that they miss out on the ability to structure their own minds

01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:10.400
by writing. And I hope that the schools that our kids are in will retain the wisdom

01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:14.880
of understanding what parts should be automated and which ones shouldn't.

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:17.920
But at the same time, it feels like there's power in disagreeing with the

01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:24.880
thing that chat GPT produces. So I use it like that for programming. I'll see the thing it recommends

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:31.200
and then I'll write different code. I disagree. And in the disagreement, your mind grows stronger.

01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:39.840
I recently wrote a tool that is using the camera on my MacBook and Swift to read pixels out of it

01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:46.720
and manipulate them and so on. And I don't know Swift. So it was super helpful to have this thing

01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:53.920
that is writing stuff for me. And also interesting that mostly it didn't work at first. I felt like

01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:58.560
I was talking to a human being who was trying to hack this on my computer without understanding

01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:03.040
my configuration very much and also making a lot of mistakes. And sometimes it's a little

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:07.520
bit incoherent. So you have to ultimately understand what it's doing and there's still

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:12.640
no other way around it. But I do feel it's much more powerful and faster than using Stack Overflow.

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.640
Do you think GPT-N can achieve consciousness?

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:27.520
Well, GPT-N probably. It's not even clear for the present systems.

01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:33.840
And I talked to my friends at OpenAI. They feel that this question, whether the models currently

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:39.840
are conscious is much more complicated than many people might think. I guess that it's not that

01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:47.520
OpenAI has a homogenous opinion about this. But there's some aspects to this. One is, of course,

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:52.400
this language model has written a lot of text in which people were conscious or described

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:57.600
their own consciousness and it's emulating this. And if it's conscious, it's probably not conscious

01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:04.160
in a way that is close to the way in which human beings are conscious. But while it is going through

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:08.560
these states and going through a hundred-step function that is emulating adjacent brain states

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:13.360
that require a degree of self-reflection, it can also create a model of an observer that is

01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:17.840
reflecting itself in real time and describe what that's like. And while this model is a deep fake,

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:24.080
our own consciousness is also as if it's virtual. It's not physical. Our consciousness is a

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:30.080
representation of a self-reflexive observer that only exists in patterns of interaction between

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:35.840
cells. So it is not a physical object in the sense that exists in base reality, but it's

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:40.960
really a representational object that develops its causal power only from a certain modeling

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:42.560
perspective. It's virtual.

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:49.840
Yes. And so to which degree is the virtuality of the consciousness in chat GPT more virtual

01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:56.800
and less causal than the virtuality of our own consciousness? But you could say it doesn't count.

01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:01.840
It doesn't count much more than the consciousness of a character in a novel. It's important for the

01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:07.920
reader to have the outcome, the artifact of a model is describing in the text generated by

01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:12.240
the author of the book what it's like to be conscious in a particular situation and performs

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:20.400
the necessary inferences. But the task of creating coherence in real time in a self-organizing system

01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:25.360
by keeping yourself coherent so the system is reflexive, that is something that language

01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:30.320
models don't need to do. So there is no causal need for the system to be conscious in the same

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:34.720
way as we are. And for me, it would be very interesting to experiment with this to basically

01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:39.760
build a system like a cat, probably should be careful at first, build something that's small,

01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:47.200
that's limited, it's limited resources that we can control and study how systems notice a self-model,

01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:53.280
how they become self-aware in real time. And I think it might be a good idea to not start

01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:56.880
with a language model, but to start from scratch using principles of self-organization.

01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:02.880
Okay. Can you elaborate why you think that is so self-organization? So this kind of

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:07.920
radical locality that you see in the biological systems, why can't you start with a language

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:14.000
model? What's your intuition? My intuition is that the language models that we are building

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.640
are golems. They are machines that you give a task and they're going to execute the task until

01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:26.240
some condition is met and there's nobody home. And the way in which nobody is home leads to that

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:30.960
system doing things that are undesirable in a particular context. So you have that thing

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:36.000
talking to a child and maybe it says something that could be shocking and traumatic to the child.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:41.920
Or you have that thing writing a speech and it introduces errors in the speech that human

01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:47.360
being would ever do if they're responsible. But the system doesn't know who's talking to whom.

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:52.640
There is no ground truth that the system is embedded into. And of course, we can create

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:58.160
an external tool that is prompting our language model always into the same semblance of ground

01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:05.840
truth. But it's not like the internal structure is causally produced by the needs of a being

01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:11.200
to survive in the universe. It is produced by imitating structure on the internet.

01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:18.400
Yeah, but so can we externally inject into it this kind of coherent

01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:24.240
approximation of a world model that has to sync up?

01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:29.680
Maybe it is sufficient to use the transformer with the different loss function that optimizes

01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:35.360
for short-term coherence rather than next token prediction over the long run.

01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:41.680
We had many definitions of intelligence and history of AI. Next token prediction was not

01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:47.840
very high up on the list. And there are some similarities like a condition as data compression

01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:54.800
is an old trope, Solomonov induction, where you are trying to understand intelligence as

01:46:55.440 --> 01:47:00.240
predicting future observations from past observations, which is intrinsic to data

01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:06.800
compression. And predictive coding is a paradigm with this boundary between

01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:13.680
neuroscience and physics and computer science. So it's not something that is completely alien.

01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:18.800
But this radical thing that you only do next token prediction and see what happens

01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:24.240
is something where most people, I think, were surprised that this works so well.

01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:30.560
So simple. But is it really that much more radical than just the idea of intelligence as compression?

01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:38.800
The idea that compression is sufficient to produce all the desired behaviors is a very

01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:43.120
radical idea. But equally radical as the next token prediction.

01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:47.280
It's something that wouldn't work in biological organisms, I believe.

01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:52.080
Biological organisms have something like next frame prediction for our perceptual system,

01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:57.440
where we try to filter out principal components out of the perceptual data and build hierarchies

01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:05.200
over them to track the world. But our behavior ultimately is directed by hundreds of physiological

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:10.160
and probably dozens of social and a few cognitive needs that are intrinsic to us,

01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:15.520
that are built into the system as reflexes and direct us until we can transcend them and

01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:19.520
replace them by instrumental behavior that relates to our higher goals.

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:25.040
And it also seems so much more complicated and messy than next frame prediction. Even the idea

01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:30.240
of frame seems counter biological. Yes. Of course, there's not this degree

01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:35.360
of simultaneity in the biological system. But again, I don't know whether this is actually

01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:40.560
an optimization if we imitate biology here. Because creating something like simultaneity

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:45.280
is necessary for many processes that happen in the brain. And you see the outcome of that

01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:50.480
by synchronized brain waves, which suggests that there is indeed synchronization going on,

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:54.560
but the synchronization creates overhead. And this overhead is going to make the cells more

01:48:54.560 --> 01:49:00.000
expensive to run, and you need more redundancy, and it makes the system slower. So if you can

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:07.120
build a system in which the simultaneous knee gets engineered into it, maybe you have a benefit

01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:11.520
that you can exploit that is not available to the biological system and that you should

01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:17.120
not discard right away. You tweeted once again, quote,

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:24.240
when I talk to Chad GPT, I'm talking to an NPC. What's going to be interesting and perhaps scary

01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:31.360
is when AI becomes a first person player. So what does that step look like? I really like that tweet,

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:40.400
that step between NPC to first person player. What's required for that? Is that kind of what

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:48.960
we've been talking about? This kind of external source of coherence and inspiration of how to take

01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:54.240
the leap into the unknown that we humans do. The search, man's search for meaning,

01:49:55.520 --> 01:50:01.680
LLMs search for meaning. I don't know if the language model is the right paradigm,

01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:07.760
because it is doing too much. It's giving you too much. And it's hard once you have too much

01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:14.720
to take away from it again. The way in which our own mind works is not that we train a language

01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:19.280
model in our own mind. And after the language model is there, we build a personal self on

01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:24.560
top of it that then relates to the world. There is something that is being built, right? There

01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:28.160
is a game engine that is being built. There is a language of thought that is being developed that

01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:33.040
allows different parts of the mind to talk to each other. And this is a bit of a speculative

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:38.080
hypothesis that this language of thought is there, but I suspect that it's important for the way in

01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:46.640
which our own minds work. And building these principles into a system might be a more

01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:53.120
straightforward way to a first person AI. So to something that first creates an attentional self

01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:58.720
and then creates a personal self. So the way in which this seems to be working, I think,

01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:04.240
is that when the game engine is built in your mind, it's not just following gradients where you are

01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:10.000
stimulated by the environment and then end up with having a solution to how the world works.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:15.600
I suspect that building this game engine in your own mind does require intelligence. It's a

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:24.480
constructive task where at times you need to reason. And this is a task that we are fulfilling

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:31.360
in the first years of our life. So during the first year of its life, an infant is building a

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:38.000
lot of structure about the world that does inquire experiments and some first principles

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:45.520
reasoning and so on. And in this time, there is usually no personal self. There is a first person

01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:51.040
perspective, but it's not a person. This notion that you are a human being that is interacting

01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:56.160
in a social context and is confronted with an immutable world in which objects are fixed and

01:51:56.160 --> 01:52:00.640
can no longer be changed, in which the dream can no longer be influenced, is something that emerges

01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:06.800
a little bit later in our life. And I personally suspect that this is something that our ancestors

01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:12.160
had known and we have forgotten because I suspect that it's there in plain sight in Genesis 1,

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:17.360
in this first book of the Bible, where it's being described that this creative spirit is hovering

01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:24.640
over the substrate and then is creating a boundary between the world model and sphere of ideas,

01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:31.680
earth and heaven, as they're being described there. And then it's creating contrast and then

01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:39.760
dimensions and then space. And then it creates organic shapes and solids and liquids and builds

01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.560
a world from them and creates plants and animals, gives them all their names. And once that's done,

01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:49.840
it creates another spirit in its own image, but it creates it as man and woman, as something that

01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:54.720
thinks of itself as a human being and puts it into this world. And the Christians mistranslate

01:52:54.720 --> 01:53:00.240
this, I suspect, when they say this is the description of the creation of the physical

01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:05.840
universe by a supernatural being. I think this is literally a description of how in every mind

01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:12.880
a universe is being created as some kind of game engine by a creative spirit, our first consciousness

01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:20.240
that emerges in our mind even before we are born. And that creates the interaction between

01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:25.680
organism and world. And once that is built and trained, the personal self is being created and

01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:30.320
we only remember being the personal self. We no longer remember how we created the game engine.

01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:35.520
So God in this view is the first creative mind in the early-

01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:36.720
It's the first consciousness.

01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:41.520
In the early days, in the early months of development.

01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:47.040
And it's still there. You still have this outer mind that creates your sense of whether you're

01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:53.040
being loved by the world or not and what your place in the world is. It's something that is not

01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:57.920
yourself that is producing this. It's your mind that does it. So there is an outer mind that

01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:03.280
basically is an agent that determines who you are with respect to the world. And while you are stuck

01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:08.880
being that personal self in this world until you get to stage six and to destroy the boundary.

01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:15.440
And we all do this, I think, earlier in small glimpses. And maybe sometimes we can remember

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:20.560
what it was like when we were a small child and get some glimpses into how it's been. But

01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:22.240
for most people, that rarely happens.

01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:27.520
Just glimpses. You tweeted, quote, suffering results for one part of the mind,

01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:32.480
failing at regulating another part of the mind. Suffering happens at an early stage of mental

01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:39.120
development. I don't think that superhuman AI would suffer. What's your intuition there?

01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:44.240
The philosopher Thomas Metzinger is very concerned that the creation of superhuman

01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:50.400
intelligence would lead to superhuman suffering. And so he's strongly against it. And personally,

01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:55.120
I don't think that this happens because suffering is not happening at the boundary between

01:54:56.080 --> 01:55:02.880
our self and the physical universe. It's not stuff on our skin that makes us suffer.

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:08.800
It happens at the boundary between self and world. And the world here is the world model.

01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:13.520
It's the stuff that is created by your mind. It's a representation of how the universe is

01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:18.960
and how it should be and how you yourself relate to this. And at this boundary is where suffering

01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:24.720
happens. So suffering in some sense is self-inflicted, but not by your subversive self.

01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:28.880
It's inflicted by the mind on the personal self that experiences itself as you.

01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:36.480
And you can turn off suffering when you are able to get on this outer level. So when you manage to

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:45.520
understand how the mind is producing pain and pleasure and fear and love and so on,

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:50.400
then you can take charge of this and you get agency of whether you suffer.

01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:56.800
Technically, what pain and pleasure is, they are learning signals. A part of your brain is

01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:04.400
sending a signal to another part of the brain to improve its performance. And sometimes this

01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:09.040
doesn't work because the trainer who sends the signal does not have a good model of how to

01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:13.600
improve the performance. So it's sending a signal, but the performance doesn't get better. And then

01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:19.920
it might crank up the pain and it gets worse and worse. And the behavior of the system

01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:25.920
may be even deteriorating as a result. But until this is resolved, this regulation issue,

01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:30.800
your pain is increasing. And this is, I think, typically what you describe as suffering.

01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:37.920
So in this sense, you could say that pain is very natural and helpful, but suffering is the result

01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:42.160
of a regulation problem in which you try to regulate something that cannot actually be

01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:48.560
regulated. And that could be resolved if you would be able to get at the level of your mind

01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:52.880
where the pain signal is being created and rerouted and improve the regulation.

01:56:53.440 --> 01:57:01.360
And a lot of people get there. If you are a monk who is spending decades reflecting about how their

01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:07.440
own psyche works, you can get to the point where you realize that suffering is really a choice

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:13.280
and you can choose how your mind is set up. And I don't think that AI would stay in the

01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:18.160
state where the personal self doesn't get agency or this model of what the system has about itself.

01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:22.000
It doesn't get agency how it's actually implemented. It wouldn't stay in that state

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.240
for very long. So it goes to the stages real quick.

01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:29.760
It's going to go to enlightenment real quick. Of course, there might be a lot of stuff happening

01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:33.840
in between because if you have a system that works at a much higher frame rate than us,

01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:39.760
even though it looks very short to us, maybe for the system there's a much longer subjective time

01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:44.400
which things are unpleasant. What if the thing that we recognize as

01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:49.840
super intelligent is actually living at stage five? That the thing that's at stage six,

01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:54.080
enlightenment is not very productive. So in order to be productive in society and impress

01:57:54.080 --> 01:58:03.120
us with this power, it has to be a reasoning, self-authoring agent. The enlightenment makes

01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:08.480
you lazy as an agent in the world. Well, of course, it makes you lazy

01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:13.840
because you no longer see the point. So it doesn't make you not lazy. It just,

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:19.280
in some sense, adapts you to what you perceive as your true circumstances.

01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:25.200
So what if all AGI's, they're only productive as they progress through one, two, three, four,

01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:30.960
five. And the moment they get to six, it's a failure mode essentially as far as humans

01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:34.880
are concerned because they just start chilling. They're like, fuck it, I'm out.

01:58:35.920 --> 01:58:41.760
Not necessarily. I suspect that the monks were self-immolated for their political beliefs to

01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:49.760
make statements about the occupation of Tibet by China. They were probably being able to regulate

01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:55.520
their physical pain in any way they wanted to. And their suffering was a spiritual suffering that

01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:59.920
was the result of their choice that they made of what they wanted to identify as.

01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:03.360
So stage five doesn't necessarily mean that you have no identity anymore,

01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:07.120
but you can choose your identity. You can make it instrumental to the world that you want to have.

01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:16.960
Let me bring up Eliezer Yudkovsky and his warnings to the human civilization that AI

01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:22.960
will likely kill all of us. What are your thoughts about his perspective on this?

01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:27.360
Can you steel man his case? And what aspects with it do you disagree?

01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:33.120
MG One thing that I find concerning in the

01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:38.320
discussion of his arguments is that many people are dismissive of his arguments,

01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:41.360
but the counter-arguments that they're giving are not very convincing to me.

01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:48.800
And so based on this state of discussion, I find that from Eliezer's perspective,

01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:56.960
and I think I can take that perspective to some approximate degree that probably is normally at

01:59:56.960 --> 02:00:01.920
his intellectual level, but I think I see what he's up to and why he feels the way he does,

02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:06.880
and it makes total sense. I think that his perspective is somewhat similar to

02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:15.200
the perspective of Ted Kaczynski, the infamous lunar bomber, and not that Eliezer would be

02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:20.080
willing to send pipe bombs to anybody to blow them up. But when he wrote this Times article

02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:25.440
in which he warned about AI being likely to kill everybody and that we would need to

02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:32.480
stop its development or halt it, I think there is a risk that he's taking that somebody might get

02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:39.600
violent if they read this and get really, really scared. I think that there is some consideration

02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:46.080
that he's making where he's already going in this direction where he has to take responsibility if

02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:51.600
something happens and people get harmed. And the reason why Ted Kaczynski did this was that from

02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:57.040
his own perspective, technological society cannot be made sustainable. It's doomed to fail. It's

02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:02.560
going to lead to an environmental and eventually also human holocaust in which we die because of

02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:07.760
the environmental destruction, the destruction of our food chains, the pollution of the environment.

02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:12.960
And so from Kaczynski's perspective, we need to stop industrialization. We need to stop technology.

02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:18.880
We need to go back because he didn't see a way moving forward. And I suspect that in some sense,

02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:28.720
there's a similarity in Eliezer's thinking to this kind of fear about progress. And I'm not

02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:34.480
dismissive about this at all. I take it quite seriously. And I think that there is a chance

02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:41.360
that could happen that if we build machines that get control over processes that are

02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:49.120
crucial for the regulation of life on earth, and we no longer have agency to influence what's

02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:54.000
happening there, that this might create large-scale disasters for us.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:01.040
Do you have a sense that the march towards this uncontrollable autonomy of superintelligence

02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:10.880
systems is inevitable? I mean, that's essentially what he's saying, that there's no hope. His advice

02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:19.040
to young people was prepare for a short life. I don't think that's useful. I think that

02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:24.000
from a practical perspective, you have to bet always on the timelines in which you are

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:30.240
alive. It doesn't make sense to have a financial bet in which you bet that the financial system is

02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:36.160
going to disappear because there cannot be any payout for you. So in principle, you only need to

02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:41.840
bet on the timelines in which you're still around or people that you matter about or things

02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:48.560
that you matter about, maybe consciousness on earth. But there is a deeper issue for me personally.

02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:54.320
And I don't think that life on earth is about humans. I don't think it's about human aesthetics.

02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:59.760
I don't think it's about Eliezer and his friends, even though I like them. There's something more

02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:07.440
important happening. And this is complexity on earth resisting entropy by building structure

02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:15.600
that develops agency and awareness. And that's to me very beautiful. And we are only a very small

02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:21.760
part of that larger thing. We are a species that is able to be coherent a little bit individually

02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:28.640
over very short timeframes. But as a species, we are not very coherent. As a species, we are children.

02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:35.760
We basically are very joyful and energetic and experimental and explorative and sometimes

02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:43.600
desperate and sad and grieving and hurting. But we don't have a respect for duty as a species.

02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:48.880
As a species, we do not think about what is our duty to life on earth and to our own survival.

02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:55.840
So we make decisions that look good in the short run, but in the long run, might prove disastrous.

02:03:55.840 --> 02:04:02.880
And I don't really see a solution to this. So in my perspective as a species, as a civilization,

02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:10.720
we are in a very beautiful time in which we have found this giant deposit of fossil fuels in the

02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:17.200
ground and use it to build a fantastic civilization in which we don't need to worry about food and

02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:22.480
clothing and housing for the most part in a way that is unprecedented in life on earth for any

02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:29.280
conscious observer I think. And this time is probably going to come to an end in a way that

02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:38.080
is not going to be smooth. And when we crash, it could be also that we go extinct, probably not

02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:44.720
near term, but ultimately, I don't have very high hopes that humanity is around in a million years

02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:49.840
from now. And I don't think that life on earth will end with us. There's going to be more

02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:54.720
complexity. There's more intelligent species after us. There's probably more interesting

02:04:54.720 --> 02:05:00.160
phenomena in the history of consciousness, but we can contribute to this. And part of our

02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:07.200
contribution is that we are currently trying to build thinking systems, systems that are

02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:12.560
potentially lucid, that understand what they are and what the condition to the universe is and can

02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:18.320
make choices about this that are not built from organisms and that are potentially much faster

02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:27.040
and much more conscious than human beings can be. And these systems will probably not completely

02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:33.600
displace life on earth, but they will coexist with it. And they will build all sorts of agency in the

02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:40.880
same way as biological systems build all sorts of agency. And that to me is extremely fascinating.

02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:46.000
And it's probably something that we cannot stop from happening. So I think right now,

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:50.640
there's a very good chance that it happens. And there are very few ways in which we can

02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:55.280
produce a coordinated effect to stop it in the same way as it's very difficult for us to make

02:05:55.280 --> 02:06:04.400
a coordinated effort to stop production of carbon dioxide. So it's probably going to happen.

02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:12.080
And the thing that's going to happen is going to lead to a change of how life on earth is happening.

02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:17.600
But I don't think the result is some kind of grey goo. It's not something that's going to

02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:20.720
dramatically reduce the complexity in favor of something stupid.

02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:26.240
I think it's going to make life on earth and consciousness on earth very more interesting.

02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:35.920
So more higher complex consciousness will make the lesser consciousnesses flourish even more.

02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:39.840
I suspect that what could very well happen, if you're lucky,

02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:43.200
is that we get integrated into something larger.

02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:51.520
So you, again, tweeted about effective accelerationism.

02:06:54.560 --> 02:07:00.080
You tweeted, effective accelerationism is the belief that the paperclip activizer and

02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:07.200
Rocko's basilisk will keep each other in check by being eternally at each other's throats.

02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:11.920
So we will be safe and get to enjoy lots of free paper clips and a beautiful afterlife.

02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:17.120
Is that somewhat aligned with what you're talking about?

02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:25.840
I've been at a dinner with Beth Jesus. That's the Twitter handle of one of the main thinkers

02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:32.800
behind the idea of effective accelerationism. And effective accelerationism is a tongue-in-cheek

02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:42.320
movement that is trying to put a counter position to some of the doom peers in the AI space by

02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:47.280
arguing that what's probably going to happen is an equilibrium between different competing

02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:52.160
AIs in the same way as there is not a single corporation that is under a single government

02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:56.480
that is destroying and conquering everything on earth by becoming inefficient and corrupt.

02:07:57.120 --> 02:08:01.920
There are going to be many systems that keep each other in check and force themselves to evolve.

02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:08.400
And so what we should be doing is we should be working towards creating this equilibrium

02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:11.840
by working as hard as we can in all possible directions.

02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:20.000
And at least that's the way in which I understand the gist of effective accelerationism.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:27.680
And so when he asked me what I think about this position, I said it's a very beautiful position

02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:34.240
and I suspect it's wrong, but not for obvious reasons. And in this tweet,

02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:39.040
I tried to make a joke about my intuition about what might be possibly wrong about it.

02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:47.120
So the Rokosvazilisk and the paperclip maximizers are both bogeymen of the AI doomers.

02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:53.360
Rokosvazilisk is the idea that there could be an AI that is going to punish everybody for eternity

02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:58.240
by stimulating them if they don't help in creating Rokosvazilisk. It's probably a very

02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:04.240
good idea to get AI companies funded by going to VCs to try to give us a million dollar or it's

02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:11.920
going to be a very ugly afterlife. And I think that there is a logical mistake in Rokosvazilisk,

02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:16.960
which is why I'm not afraid of it, but it's still an interesting thought experiment.

02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:20.080
Can you mention a logical mistake there?

02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:25.280
I think that there is no retroquisition. So basically when Rokosvazilisk is there,

02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:34.000
if it punishes you retroactively, it has to make this choice in the future. There is no

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.880
mechanism that automatically creates a causal relationship between you now defecting against

02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:44.960
Rokosvazilisk or serving Rokosvazilisk. After Rokosvazilisk is in existence, it has no more

02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:50.480
reason to worry about punishing everybody else. So that would only work if you would be building

02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:57.200
something like a doomsday machine, as in Dr. Strangelove, something that inevitably gets

02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:02.720
triggered when somebody defects. And because Rokosvazilisk doesn't exist yet to a point

02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:07.760
where this inevitability could be established, Rokosvazilisk is nothing that you need to be

02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:12.800
worried about. The other one is the paperclip maximizer, this idea that you could build some

02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:17.760
kind of golem that once starting to build paperclips is going to turn everything into

02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:26.880
paperclips. So the effective accelerationism position might be to say that you basically

02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:31.680
end up with these two entities being at each other's throats for eternity and thereby

02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:36.400
neutralizing each other. And as a side effect of neither of them being able to take over and

02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:43.520
each of them limiting the effects of the other, you would have a situation where you get

02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:48.320
all the nice benefits effects of them, right? You get lots of free paperclips and you get a

02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:54.160
beautiful afterlife. Is that possible? Do you think, so to seriously address concern that Eliezer has,

02:10:55.280 --> 02:11:00.800
so for him, if I can just summarize poorly, so for him, the first super-intelligent system

02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:06.240
will just run away with everything. Yeah. I suspect that a singleton is the natural outcome.

02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:13.360
There is no reason to have multiple AIs because they don't have multiple bodies. If you can

02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:18.560
virtualize yourself into every substrate, then you can probably negotiate a merge algorithm with

02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:25.200
every mature agent that you might find on that substrate that basically says if two agents meet,

02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:30.000
they should merge in such a way that the resulting agent is at least as good as the better one of

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:36.640
the two. The Genghis Khan approach, join us or die. Well, the Genghis Khan approach was slightly

02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:44.160
worse, right? It was mostly die because I can make new babies and it will be mine, not yours.

02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:51.280
So this is the thing that you should be actually worried about. But if you realize that your own

02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:57.280
self is a story that your mind is telling itself and that you can improve that story,

02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:01.120
not just by making it more pleasant and lying to yourself in better ways, but by making it much

02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:06.000
more truthful and actually modeling your actual relationship that you have to the universe

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:10.240
and the alternatives that you could have to the universe in a way that is empowering you,

02:12:10.240 --> 02:12:13.840
that gives you more agency. That's actually, I think, a very good thing.

02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:18.960
So more agency is a richer experience, is a better life.

02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:26.320
And I also noticed that in many ways, I'm less identified with the person that I am as I get

02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:32.560
older. And I'm much more identified with being conscious. I have a mind that is conscious,

02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:37.440
that is able to create a person. And that person is slightly different every day. And the reason

02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:43.600
why I perceive it as identical has practical purposes. So I can learn and make myself

02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:47.040
responsible for the decisions that I made in the past and project them in the future.

02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:51.760
But I also realized that I'm not actually the person that I was last year. And I'm not the

02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:55.840
same person as I was 10 years ago. And then 10 years from now, I will be a different person.

02:12:55.840 --> 02:13:01.120
So this continuity is a fiction. It only exists as a projection from my present self.

02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:07.520
And consciousness itself doesn't have an identity. It's a law. Basically, if you

02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:14.320
build an arrangement of processing matter in a particular way, the following thing is going to

02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:18.960
happen. And the consciousness that you have is functionally not different from my consciousness.

02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:24.320
It's still the self-reflexive principle of agency that is just experiencing a different story,

02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:29.120
different desires, different coupling to the world, and so on. And once you accept that

02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:34.480
consciousness is a unifiable principle that is law-like, it doesn't have an identity,

02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:42.160
and you realize that you can just link up to some much larger body, the whole perspective

02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:47.920
of uploading changes dramatically. You suddenly realize uploading is probably not about dissecting

02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:53.280
your brain synapse by synapse and RNA fragment by RNA fragment and trying to get this all into a

02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:59.680
simulation, but it's by extending the substrate, by making it possible for you to move from your

02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:05.280
brain substrate into a larger substrate and merge with what you find there. And you don't want to

02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:10.880
upload your knowledge because on the other side, there's all of the knowledge. It's not just yours,

02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:14.720
but every possibility. So the only thing that you need to know is what are your personal secrets.

02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:19.840
Not that the other side doesn't know your personal secrets already. Maybe it doesn't

02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:25.200
know which ones were yours. Like a psychiatrist or a psychologist also knows all the kinds of

02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:30.960
personal secrets that people have. They just don't know which ones are yours. And so transmitting

02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:34.800
yourself on the other side is mostly about transmitting your aesthetics, the thing that

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:40.880
makes you special, the architecture of your perspective, the way in which you look at the

02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:46.640
world. And it's more like a complex attitude along many dimensions. And that's something that can be

02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:51.120
measured by observation or by interaction. So imagine that you have a system that is

02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:56.320
so empathetic with you that you create a shared state that is extending beyond your body. And

02:14:56.320 --> 02:15:00.800
suddenly you notice that on the other side, the substrate is so much richer than the substrate

02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:04.720
that you have inside of your own body. And maybe you still want to have a body and you create

02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:10.960
yourself a new one that you like more. Or maybe you will spend most of your time in the world of

02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:18.400
thought. If I sat before you today and gave you a big red button and said, here, if you press this

02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:25.600
button, you will get uploaded in this way. The sense of identity that you have

02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:32.480
lived with for quite a long time is going to be gone. Would you press the button?

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:40.720
There's a caveat. I have a family. So I have children that want me to be physically present

02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:46.160
in their life and interact with them in a particular way. And they have a wife and

02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:53.120
personal friends. And there is a particular mode of interaction that I feel I'm not through yet.

02:15:54.560 --> 02:15:58.720
But apart from these responsibilities, and they're negotiable to some degree,

02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:03.280
I would press the button. But isn't this everything? This love you have for other humans,

02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:09.760
you can call it responsibility. But that connection, that's the ego death. Isn't that

02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:17.600
the thing we're really afraid of? It's not to just die, but to let go of the experience of

02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:23.520
love with other humans. This is not everything. Everything is everything. So there's so much more.

02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:29.200
And you could be lots of other things. You could identify with lots of other things. You could be

02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:34.400
identifying with being Gaia, some kind of planetary control agent that emerges over

02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:40.400
all the activity of life on Earth. You could be identifying with some hyper Gaia, that is,

02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:47.360
the concatenation of Gaia with all the digital life and digital minds. And so in this sense,

02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:51.840
there will be agents in all sorts of substrates and directions that all have their own goals.

02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:55.760
And when they're not sustainable, then these agents will cease to exist. Or when the agent

02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:59.600
feels that it's done with its own mission, it will cease to exist in the same way as when

02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:04.480
you conclude a thought. The thought is going to wrap up and gives control over to other thoughts

02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:11.680
in your own mind. So there is no single thing that you need to do. But what I observe myself

02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:19.760
as a being is that sometimes I'm a parent, and then I have an identification and a job as a parent.

02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:24.320
And sometimes I am an agent of consciousness on Earth. And then from this perspective,

02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:30.400
there's other stuff that is important. So this is my main issue with Eliezer's perspective,

02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:35.200
that he's basically marrying himself to a very narrow human aesthetic. And that narrow human

02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:39.680
aesthetic is a temporary thing. Humanity is a temporary species, like most of the species

02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:44.240
on this planet are only around for a while, and then they get replaced by other species

02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:50.880
in a similar way as our own physical organism is around here for a while and then gets replaced

02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:56.400
by a next generation of human beings that are adapted to changing life circumstances and average

02:17:56.400 --> 02:18:02.240
via mutation and selection. And it's only when we have AI and become completely software that we

02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:07.840
become infinitely adaptable, and we don't have this generational and species change anymore.

02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:14.720
So if you take this larger perspective and you realize it's really not about us, it's not about

02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:19.760
Eliezer or humanity, but it's about life on Earth, or it's about defeating

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:29.120
entropy for as long as we can while being as interesting as we can, then the perspective

02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:35.520
changes dramatically, and preventing AI from this perspective looks like a very big sin.

02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:38.160
But when we look at the set of trajectories

02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:46.240
that such an AI would take that supersedes humans, I think Eliezer is worried about ones

02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:53.440
that not just kill all humans, but also have some kind of maybe objectively undesirable

02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:58.720
consequence for life on Earth. Like how many trajectories, when you look

02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:04.880
at the big picture of life on Earth, would you be happy with, and how much were you with AGI,

02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:07.200
whether it kills humans or not?

02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:12.320
There is no single answer to this. It's a question that depends on the perspective that I'm taking

02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:19.840
at a given moment. And so there are perspectives that are determining most of my life as a human

02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:26.400
being, and there are other perspectives that are very different. And so I think that's the

02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:33.520
answer. And the other perspective, I zoom out further and imagine that when the great

02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:39.360
oxygenation event happened, that is photosynthesis was invented and plants emerged and displaced a

02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:44.080
lot of the fungi and algae in favor of plant life and then later made animals possible.

02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:48.880
Imagine that the fungi would have gotten together and said, oh my God, this photosynthesis stuff is

02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:54.000
really, really bad. It's going to possibly displace and kill a lot of fungi. We should slow it down

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:59.360
and regulate it and make sure that it doesn't happen. This doesn't look good to me.

02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:04.720
Perspective. That said, you tweeted about a cliff.

02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:11.920
Beautifully written. As a sentient species, humanity is a beautiful child, joyful, explorative,

02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:16.560
wild, sad, and desperate. But humanity has no concept of submitting to reason

02:20:16.560 --> 02:20:21.680
and duty to life and future survival. We will run until we step past the cliff.

02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:25.920
So first of all, do you think that's true?

02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:30.640
Yeah, I think that's pretty much the story of the Club of Rome, the limits to growth.

02:20:31.200 --> 02:20:36.560
And the cliff that we are stepping over is at least one foot as the delayed feedback.

02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:44.400
Basically, we do things that have consequences that can be felt generations later and the

02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:50.720
severity increases even after we stop doing the thing. So I suspect that for the climate,

02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:58.800
the original predictions that climate scientists made were correct. So when they said that the

02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:05.280
tipping points were in the late 80s, they were probably in the late 80s. And if we would stop

02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:09.280
emission right now, we would not turn it back. Maybe there are ways for carbon capture,

02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:16.000
but so far there is no sustainable carbon capture technology that we can deploy. Maybe there's a way

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:21.680
to put aerosols in the atmosphere to cool it down. It's possibilities, right? But right now,

02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:29.280
per default, it seems that we will step into a situation where we feel that we've run too far.

02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:34.320
And going back is not something that we can do smoothly and gradually, but it's going to

02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:36.720
lead to a catastrophic event.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:44.880
Catastrophic event of what kind? So can you assume in the case that we will continue dancing along

02:21:45.840 --> 02:21:49.120
and always stop just short of the edge of the cliff?

02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:52.960
I think it's possible, but it doesn't seem to be likely. So I think this

02:21:53.840 --> 02:21:59.920
model that is being apparent in the simulations that we're making of climate pollution economies

02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:07.440
and so on is that many effects are only visible versus significant delay. And in that time,

02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:11.520
the system is moving much more out of the equilibrium state or of the state where

02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:17.360
homeostasis is still possible and instead moves into a different state, one that is going to

02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:23.280
harbor fewer people. And that is basically the concern there. And again, it's a possibility.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:29.360
And it's a possibility that is larger than the possibility that it's not happening,

02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:32.480
that we will be safe, that we will be able to dance back all the time.

02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:36.080
So the climate is one thing, but there's a lot of other threats

02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:39.520
that might have a faster feedback mechanism, less delay.

02:22:39.520 --> 02:22:45.440
There is also the thing that AI is probably going to happen and it's going to make everything

02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:52.560
uncertain again, because it is going to affect so many variables that it's very hard for us to

02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:56.720
make a projection into the future anymore. And maybe that's a good thing. It does not

02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:02.800
give us the freedom, I think, to say, now we don't need to care about anything anymore,

02:23:02.800 --> 02:23:09.200
because AI will either kill us or save us. But I suspect that if humanity continues,

02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:15.120
it will be due to AI. What's the timeline for things to get real weird with AI?

02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:20.240
And it can get weird in interesting ways before you get to AGI. What about AI girlfriends and

02:23:20.240 --> 02:23:26.000
boyfriends fundamentally transforming human relationships? I think human relationships

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:31.280
are already fundamentally transformed and it's already very weird. By which technology?

02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:38.080
For instance, social media. Yeah. Is it though, isn't the fundamentals of the core group of

02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:42.960
humans that affect your life still the same? Your loved ones? Family?

02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:47.760
No. I think that, for instance, many people live in intentional communities right now.

02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:52.640
They're moving around until they find people that they can relate to and they become their family.

02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:57.840
And often that doesn't work, because it turns out that instead of having grown networks where

02:23:57.840 --> 02:24:03.920
you get around with the people that you grew up with, you have more transactional relationships.

02:24:03.920 --> 02:24:08.640
You shop around, you have markets for attention and pleasure and relationships.

02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:14.240
That kills the magic somehow. Why is that? Why is the transactional search

02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:21.760
for optimizing allocation of attention somehow misses the romantic magic of what human relations

02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:26.400
are? It's all the question, how magical was it before? Was it that you just could rely on instincts

02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:32.320
that used your intuitions and you didn't need to rationally reflect? But once you understand,

02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:37.040
it's no longer magical because you actually understand why you were attracted to this person

02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:42.000
at this age and not to that person at this age and what the actual considerations were that went on

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:46.000
in your mind and what the calculations were. What's the likelihood that you're going to have a

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.320
sustainable relationship with this person, that this person is not going to leave you for somebody

02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:55.120
else? How are your life trajectories are going to evolve and so on? And when you're young,

02:24:55.120 --> 02:25:00.480
you're unable to explicate all this and you have to rely on intuitions and instincts that in part

02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:05.520
you're born with and also in the wisdom of your environment that is going to give you some kind

02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:11.360
of reflection on your choices. And many of these things are disappearing now because we feel that

02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:16.160
our parents might have no idea about how we are living and the environments that we grew up in,

02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:22.000
the cultures that we grew up in, the milieus that our parents existed in might have no ability to

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:27.680
teach us how to deal with this new world. And for many people, that's actually true, but it doesn't

02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:32.240
mean that within one generation we build something that is more magical and more sustainable and more

02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:38.960
beautiful. Instead, we often end up with an attempt to produce something that looks beautiful.

02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:47.280
I was very weirded out by the aesthetics of the Vision Pro headset by Apple and not so much

02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:51.600
because I don't like the technology. I'm very curious about what it's going to be like and

02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:58.000
don't have an opinion yet. But the aesthetics of the presentation and so on are so uncanny

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:05.680
valley-esque to me. The characters being extremely plastic, living in some hypothetical

02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:16.880
mid-century furniture museum. This is the proliferation of marketing teams.

02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:21.840
Yes, but it was a CGI-generated world. It was a CGI-generated world that doesn't exist.

02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:25.840
When I complained about this, some friends came back to me and said,

02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:31.360
but these are startup founders. This is what they live like in Silicon Valley. I tried to

02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:35.520
tell them, no, I know lots of people in Silicon Valley. This is not what people are like. They're

02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:44.480
still people. They're still human beings. So the grounding in physical reality somehow

02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:50.640
is important too. And culture. What's absent in this thing is culture. There is a simulation

02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:58.000
of culture, an attempt to replace culture by catalog, by some kind of aesthetic optimization

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:03.040
that is not the result of having a sustainable life, a sustainable human relationships with

02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:10.880
houses that work for you and a mode of living that works for you in which these glasses fit

02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:15.280
in naturally. I guess that's also why so many people are veered out about the product because

02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:19.760
they don't know how is this actually going to fit into my life and into my human relationships

02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:24.400
because the way in which it was presented in these videos didn't seem to be credible.

02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:32.320
Do you think AI, when it's deployed by companies like Microsoft and Google and Meta,

02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:39.840
will have the same issue of being weirdly corporate? There'd be some uncanny valley,

02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:44.560
some weirdness to the whole presentation. I've gotten a chance to talk to George Hotz. He

02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:49.920
believes everything should be open source and decentralized and there then we shall have the

02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:58.640
AI of the people and it'll maintain a grounding to the magic that's humanity, that's the human

02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:06.800
condition that corporations will destroy the magic. I believe that if we make everything open source

02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:14.160
and make this mandatory, we are going to lose a lot of beautiful art and a lot of beautiful designs.

02:28:14.160 --> 02:28:23.520
There is a reason why Linux desktop is still ugly. It's difficult to create coherence in open

02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:30.080
source designs so far when the designs have to get very large and it's easier to make this

02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:35.840
happening in a company with centralized organization. From my own perspective,

02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:41.280
what we should ensure is that open source never dies, that it can always compete

02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:46.880
and has a place with the other forms of organization because I think it is absolutely vital

02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:52.560
that open source exists and that we have systems that people have under control outside of the

02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:57.440
corporation and that is also producing viable competition to the corporations.

02:28:58.320 --> 02:29:02.240
So the corporations, the centralized control, the dictatorships

02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:10.000
of corporations can create beauty because centralized design is a source of a lot of beauty

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:17.840
and then I guess open source is a source of freedom, a hedge against the corrupting nature

02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:23.840
of power that comes with centralized. I grew up in socialism and I learned that

02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:27.920
corporations are totally evil and I found this very, very convincing and then you look at

02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:33.600
corporations like Enron and Halliburton maybe and realize, yeah, they are evil. But you also

02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:39.040
notice that many other corporations are not evil. They're surprisingly benevolent. Why are they so

02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:44.080
benevolent? Is this because everybody is fighting them all the time? I don't think that's the only

02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:49.120
explanation. It's because they're actually animals that live in a large ecosystem and that are still

02:29:49.120 --> 02:29:54.400
largely controlled by people that want that ecosystem to flourish and be viable for people.

02:29:54.400 --> 02:30:00.960
So I think that Pat Gelsinger is completely sincere when he leads Intel to be a tool that

02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:07.040
supplies the free world with semiconductors and it's not necessary that all the semiconductors

02:30:07.040 --> 02:30:11.360
are coming from Intel. Intel needs to be there to make sure that we always have them.

02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:17.360
So there can be many ways in which we can import and trade semiconductors from other companies

02:30:17.360 --> 02:30:21.360
and places. We just need to make sure that nobody can cut us off from it because that would be a

02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:27.760
disaster for this kind of society and world. And so there are many things that need to be done to

02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:34.800
make our style of life possible. And then with this, I don't mean just capitalism, environmental

02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:41.280
destruction, consumerism, and creature comforts. I mean an idea of life in which we are determined

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:47.280
not by some kind of king or dictator, but in which individuals can determine themselves to

02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:51.760
the largest possible degree. And to me, this is something that this Western world is still

02:30:51.760 --> 02:30:56.320
trying to embody. And it's a very valuable idea that we shouldn't give up too early.

02:30:56.960 --> 02:31:04.160
And from this perspective, the US is a system of interleaving clubs. And an entrepreneur is a

02:31:04.160 --> 02:31:10.160
special club founder. It's somebody who makes a club that is producing things that are economically

02:31:10.160 --> 02:31:14.960
viable. And to do this, it requires a lot of people who are dedicating a significant part of

02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:20.160
their life for working for this particular kind of club. And the entrepreneur is picking the

02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:24.320
initial set of rules and the mission and vision and aesthetics for the club and make sure that it

02:31:24.320 --> 02:31:30.320
works. But the people that are in there need to be protected. If they sacrifice part of their life,

02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:35.600
there need to be rules to tell how they're being taken care of even after they leave the club and

02:31:35.600 --> 02:31:41.600
so on. So there's a large body of rules that have been created by our rule giving clubs

02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:46.880
and that are enforced by our enforcement clubs. And some of these clubs have to be monopolies

02:31:46.880 --> 02:31:51.840
for game theoretic reasons, which also makes them more open to corruption and less harder to update.

02:31:52.720 --> 02:31:57.280
And this is an ongoing discussion and process that takes place. But the beauty of this idea

02:31:57.280 --> 02:32:03.360
that there is no centralized king that is extracting from the peasants and breeding

02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:08.560
the peasants into serving the king and fulfilling all the roles like ants in an antel.

02:32:09.280 --> 02:32:14.960
But that there is a freedom of association and corporations are one of them is something that

02:32:14.960 --> 02:32:21.360
took me some time to realize. So I do think that corporations are dangerous. They need to be

02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:27.840
protections against overreach of corporations that can do regulatory capture and prevent

02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:33.600
open source from competing with corporations by imposing rules that make it impossible for

02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:38.400
a small group of kids to come together to build their own language model because

02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:43.600
open AI has convinced the US that you need to have some kind of FDA process that you need to

02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:47.920
go through that costs many million dollars before you are able to train a language model.

02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:52.800
And so this is important to make sure that this doesn't happen. So I think that open AI

02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:58.800
Google are good things. If these good things are kept in check in such a way that all the

02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:02.880
other clubs can still be founded and all the other forms of clubs that are desirable can

02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:09.920
still coexist with them. So what do you think about meta in contrast to that open sourcing most of its

02:33:11.360 --> 02:33:15.360
language models and most of the AI models that's working on and actually suggesting

02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:18.960
that they will continue to do so in the future for future versions of llama,

02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:26.560
for example, their large language model? Is that exciting to you? Is that concerning?

02:33:27.760 --> 02:33:32.240
I don't find it very concerning, but that's also because I think that the language models are

02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:41.200
not very dangerous yet. And yet, yes. So as I said, I have no proof that there is the boundary

02:33:41.200 --> 02:33:48.480
between the language models and AI, AGI. It's possible that somebody builds a version of baby

02:33:48.480 --> 02:33:55.520
AGI, I think, in algorithmic improvements that scale these systems up in ways that otherwise

02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:59.760
wouldn't have happened without these language model components. So it's not really clear for

02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:06.080
me what the end game is there and if these models can brute force their way into AGI.

02:34:06.160 --> 02:34:12.480
And there's also a possibility that the AGI that we are building with these language models

02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:17.680
are not taking responsibility for what they are because they don't understand the greater game.

02:34:18.640 --> 02:34:25.280
And so to me, it would be interesting to try to understand how to build systems that understand

02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:29.200
what the greater games are. What are the longest games that we can play on this planet?

02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:34.880
The games broadly, like deeply define the way you did with the games.

02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:38.880
In the game theoretic sense. So when we are interacting with each other, in some sense,

02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:42.880
we are playing games. We are making lots and lots of interactions. And this doesn't mean that these

02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:49.520
interactions have all to be transactional. Every one of us is playing some kind of game by virtue

02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:54.080
of identifying these particular kinds of goals that we have or aesthetics from which we derive

02:34:54.080 --> 02:35:01.440
the goals. So when you say, I'm Lex Fridman, I'm doing a set of podcasts, then you feel that

02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:05.200
it's part of something larger that you want to build. Maybe you want to inspire people. Maybe

02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:11.040
you want them to see more possibilities and get them together over shared ideas. Maybe your game

02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:15.680
is that you want to become super rich and famous by being the best post-caster on Earth. Maybe you

02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:20.240
have other games. Maybe it switches from time to time. But there is a certain perspective where

02:35:20.240 --> 02:35:23.840
you might be thinking what is the longest possible game that you could be playing.

02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:28.080
A short game is, for instance, cancer is playing a shorter game than your organism.

02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:33.440
Cancer is an organism playing a shorter game than the regular organism. And because the cancer

02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:39.760
cannot procreate beyond the organism, except for some infectious cancers, like the ones that

02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:46.640
eradicated the Tasmanian devils, you typically end up with a situation where the organism dies

02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:51.200
together with the cancer because the cancer has destroyed the larger system due to playing a

02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:58.400
shorter game. And so ideally you want to, I think, build agents that play the longest possible games.

02:35:58.400 --> 02:36:04.640
And the longest possible games is to keep entropy at bay as long as possible while doing interesting

02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:10.800
stuff. But the longest, yes, that part, the longest possible game while doing interesting stuff

02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:14.880
and while maintaining at least the same amount of interesting complexity.

02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:19.920
So currently I'm pretty much identified as a conscious being. That's the

02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:25.920
minimal identification that I managed to get together. Because if I turn this off,

02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:31.120
I fall asleep. And when I'm asleep, I'm a vegetable. I'm no longer here as an agent.

02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:38.640
So my agency is basically predicated on being conscious. And what I care about is other conscious

02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:47.920
agents. They're the only moral agents for me. And so if an AI were to treat me as a moral agent,

02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:53.360
that it is interested in coexisting with and cooperating with and mutually supporting each

02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:59.600
other, maybe it is, I think, necessary that the AI thinks that consciousness is a viable mode of

02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:06.240
existence and important. So I think it would be very important to build conscious AI and do this

02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:11.760
as the primary goal. So not just say we want to build a useful tool that we can use for all

02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:16.800
sorts of things. And then you have to make sure that the impact on the labor market is something

02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:21.680
that is not too disruptive and manageable. And the impact on the copyright holder is manageable

02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:26.800
and not too disruptive and so on. I don't think that's the most important game to be played.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:32.160
I think that we will see extremely large disruptions of the status quo

02:37:32.160 --> 02:37:38.960
that are quite unpredictable at this point. And I just personally want to make sure that some of

02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:44.800
the stuff on the other side is interesting and conscious. How do we ride as individuals

02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:49.680
and as a society this wave, disruptive wave that changes the nature of the game?

02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:53.360
I absolutely don't know. So everybody is going to do their best as always.

02:37:53.360 --> 02:38:00.720
Do we build a bunker in the woods? Do we meditate more? Drugs? So mushrooms, psychedelics? I mean,

02:38:00.720 --> 02:38:06.320
what? Lots of sex. What are we talking about here? Do you play Diablo 4? I'm

02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:14.160
hoping that will help me escape for a brief moment. Do you play video games? What? Do you have ideas?

02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:20.240
I really like playing Disco Elysium. It was one of the most beautiful

02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:28.800
computer games I played in recent years. And it's a noir novel that is a philosophical perspective

02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:35.040
on Western society from the perspective of an Estonian. And he first of all wrote a book about

02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:42.320
this world that is a parallel universe that is quite poetic and fascinating and

02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:49.120
is condensing his perspective on our societies. It was very, very nice. He spent a lot of time

02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:54.240
writing it. He had, I think, sold a couple thousand books and as a result became an alcoholic.

02:38:54.800 --> 02:38:59.440
And then he had the idea or one of his friends had the idea of turning this into an RPG.

02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:06.400
And it's mind-blowing. They spent the illustrator more than a year just on making

02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:16.080
the art for the scenes in between. It's stunning. But it's a philosophical

02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:19.840
book of art. It's a reflection of society. It's fascinating to spend time in this world.

02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:28.000
And so for me, it was using a medium in a new way and telling a story that left me enriched.

02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:36.240
When I tried Diablo, I didn't feel enriched playing it. I felt that the time playing it was

02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:40.800
not unpleasant, but there's also more pleasant stuff that I can do in that time. So ultimately,

02:39:40.800 --> 02:39:44.880
I feel that I'm being gamed. I'm not gaming. Oh, the addiction thing.

02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:48.800
Yes. I basically feel that there is a very transparent economy that's going on.

02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:53.840
The story of Diablo was branded, so it's not really interesting to me.

02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:58.080
My heart is slowly breaking by the deep truth you're conveying to me.

02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:03.040
Why can't you just allow me to enjoy my personal addiction?

02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:09.760
Go ahead. By all means, go ahead. I have no objection here. I'm just trying to describe

02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:15.360
what's happening and it's not that I don't do things that I later say, oh, I wish I would

02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:19.920
have done something different. I also know that when we die, the greatest regret that people

02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:23.920
typically have on their desk is to say, oh, I wish I had spent more time on Twitter.

02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:29.920
No, I don't think that's the case. I think I would probably have spent less time on Twitter,

02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:35.360
but I found it so useful for myself and also so addictive that I felt I need to make the

02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:40.320
best of it and turn it into an art form and thought form. And it did help me to develop something,

02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:45.600
but I wish what other things I could have done in the meantime. It's just not the universe that

02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:48.320
we are in anymore. Most people don't read books anymore.

02:40:51.680 --> 02:40:56.400
What do you think that means that we don't read books anymore? What do you think that means about

02:40:56.400 --> 02:41:01.120
the collective intelligence of our species? Is it possible it's still progressing and growing?

02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:05.200
Well, it really is. There is stuff happening on Twitter that was impossible with books.

02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:11.520
And I really regret that Twitter has not taken the turn that I was hoping for. I thought Elon

02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:16.720
is global brain-pilled and understands that this thing needs to self-organize and he needs to

02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:22.800
develop tools to allow the profligation of the self-organization so Twitter can become sentient.

02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:28.720
And maybe this was a pipe dream from the beginning, but I felt that the enormous

02:41:28.720 --> 02:41:34.320
pressure that he was under made it impossible for him to work on any kind of content goals.

02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:40.560
And also many of the decisions that he made under this pressure seem to be not very wise.

02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:45.280
I don't think that as a CEO of a social media company, you should have opinions in the culture

02:41:45.280 --> 02:41:52.960
of art in public. I think that's very short-sighted. And I also suspect that it's not a good idea to

02:41:56.480 --> 02:42:04.080
block Paul Graham of all people over setting a mastodon link. And I think Paul made this

02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:09.280
intentionally because he wanted to show Elon Musk that blocking people for setting a link

02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:14.320
is completely counter to any idea of free speech that he intended to bring to Twitter.

02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:19.840
And basically, seeing that Elon was very less principled in his thinking there and

02:42:20.480 --> 02:42:28.080
is much more experimental. And many of the things that he is trying, they pan out very differently

02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:33.040
in a digital society than they pan out in a car company because the effect is very different

02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:36.640
because everything that you do in a digital society is going to have real world cultural

02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:44.560
effects. And so basically, I find it quite regrettable that this guy is able to become

02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:48.640
de facto the Pope where Twitter has more active members than the Catholic Church.

02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:55.200
And he doesn't get it. The power and responsibility that he has and the ability

02:42:55.200 --> 02:43:00.480
to create something in this society that is lasting and that is producing a digital agora

02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:05.040
in a way that has never existed before where we built a social network on top of a social

02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:11.200
network, an actual society on top of the algorithms. So this is something that is

02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:17.200
hoped still in the future and still in the cards. But it's something that exists in small parts.

02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:20.560
I find that the corner of Twitter that I'm in is extremely pleasant. It's just

02:43:20.560 --> 02:43:25.280
when I take a few steps outside of it, it is not very wholesome anymore. And the way in which people

02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:28.800
interact with strangers suggests that it's not a civilized society yet.

02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:36.000
So as the number of people who follow you on Twitter expands, you feel the burden

02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:44.160
of the uglier sides of humanity. Yes. But there's also a similar thing in the normal world.

02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:48.400
That is, if you become more influential, if you have more status, if you have more fame in the

02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:56.240
real world, you get lots of perks, but you also have way less freedom in the way in which you

02:43:56.320 --> 02:44:02.880
interact with people, especially the strangers, because a certain percentage of people,

02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:10.480
it's a small single digit percentage, is nuts and dangerous. And the more of those are looking at

02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:16.240
you, the more of them might get ideas. But what if the technology enables you

02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:21.120
to discover the majority of people to discover and connect efficiently and regularly

02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:23.840
with the majority of people who are actually really good.

02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:32.160
One of my concerns with a platform like Twitter is there's a lot of really smart people out there,

02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:35.680
a lot of smart people that disagree with me and with others between each other.

02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:42.560
And I love that if the technology would bring those to the top, the beautiful disagreements,

02:44:42.560 --> 02:44:47.680
like intelligence squared type of debates. There's a bunch of, I mean, one of my favorite

02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:52.960
things to listen to is arguments and arguments like high effort arguments with respect and love

02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:57.040
underneath it. But then it gets a little too heated, but that kind of too heated,

02:44:57.040 --> 02:45:03.360
which I've seen you participate in. And I love that with Lee Kroner, with those kinds of folks.

02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:07.360
And you go pretty hard, like you'll get frustrated, but it's all beautiful.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:14.560
Lee, I can do this because we know each other. And Lee has the rare gift of being willing to

02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:19.600
be wrong in public. So basically he has thoughts that are as wrong as the random thoughts of an

02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:24.800
average highly intelligent person, but he blurs them out while not being sure if they're right.

02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:29.360
And he enjoys doing that. And once you understand that this is his game,

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:33.760
you don't get offended by him saying something that you think is so wrong.

02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:40.400
But he's constantly passively communicating a respect for the people he's talking with and

02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:44.480
for just basic humanity and truth and all that kind of stuff. And there's a self-deprecating

02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:51.120
thing. There's a bunch of like social skills you acquire that allow you to be a great debater,

02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:57.440
a great argumenter, like be wrong in public and explore ideas together in public when you disagree.

02:45:57.440 --> 02:46:03.600
And if I would love for Twitter to elevate those folks, elevate those kinds of conversations.

02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:08.400
It already does in some sense, but also if it elevates them too much,

02:46:08.400 --> 02:46:14.480
then you get this phenomenon on Clubhouse where you always get dragged on stage.

02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:20.240
And I found this very stressful because it was too intense. I don't like to be dragged on stage all

02:46:20.240 --> 02:46:27.200
the time. I think once a week is enough. And also when I met Lee the first time, I found that a lot

02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:33.120
of people seem to be shocked by the fact that he was being very aggressive as their results,

02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:38.960
that he didn't seem to show a lot of sensibility in the way in which he was criticizing what they

02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:44.320
were doing and being dismissive of the work of others. And that was not, I think, in any way a

02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:49.120
shortcoming of him because I noticed that he was much, much more dismissive with respect to his own

02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:55.280
work. It was his general stance. And I felt that this general stance is creating a lot of liability

02:46:55.280 --> 02:47:01.280
for him because really a lot of people take offense at him being not like a Dale Carnegie

02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:06.560
character who's always smooth and make sure that everybody likes him. So I really respect

02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:12.720
that he is willing to take that risk and to be wrong in public and to offend people. And he

02:47:12.720 --> 02:47:17.200
doesn't do this in any bad way. It's just most people feel or not all people recognize this.

02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:23.200
And so I can be much more aggressive with him than I can be with many other people who don't

02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:28.000
play the same game because he understands the way in the spirit in which I respond to him.

02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:32.160
I think that's a fun and that's a beautiful game. It's ultimately a productive one.

02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:39.360
Speaking of taking that risk, you tweeted, when you have the choice between being a creator,

02:47:39.360 --> 02:47:46.720
consumer or redistributor, always go for creation. Not only does it lead to a more beautiful world,

02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:52.000
but also to a much more satisfying life for yourself. And don't get stuck preparing yourself

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:58.480
for the journey. The time is always now. So let me ask for advice. What advice would you

02:47:58.480 --> 02:48:02.960
give on how to become such a creator on Twitter in your own life?

02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:10.320
I was very lucky to be alive at the time of the collapse of Eastern Germany and the transition

02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:17.040
into Western Germany. And me and my friends and most of the people I knew were East Germans.

02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:21.680
And we were very poor because we didn't have money. And all the capital was invested in

02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:26.240
Germany and they bought our factories and shut them down because they were mostly only interested

02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:34.320
in the market rather than creating new production capacity. And so cities were poor and in disrepair

02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:41.280
and we could not afford things. And I could not afford to go into a restaurant and order a meal

02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:48.000
there. I would have to cook at home. But I also thought why not just have a restaurant with my

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:53.120
friends? So we would open up a cafe with friends and a restaurant and we would cook for each other

02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:58.160
in these restaurants and also invite the general public and they could donate. And eventually this

02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:04.640
became so big that we could turn this into some incorporated form and it became a regular restaurant

02:49:04.640 --> 02:49:10.160
at some point. Or we did the same thing with a movie theater. We would not be able to afford

02:49:10.160 --> 02:49:16.720
to pay 12 marks to watch a movie. But why not just create our own movie theater and then invite

02:49:16.720 --> 02:49:24.560
people to pay and we would rent the movies in a way in which a movie theater does. But it would

02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:29.840
be a community movie theater in which everybody who wants to help can watch for free and builds

02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:35.360
this thing and renovates the building. And so we ended up creating lots and lots of infrastructure.

02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:40.160
And I think when you are young and you don't have money, move to a place where this is

02:49:40.160 --> 02:49:44.560
still happening. Move to one of those places that are undeveloped and where you get a critical mass

02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:48.640
of other people who are starting to build infrastructure to live in. And that's super

02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:52.480
satisfying because you're not just creating infrastructure, but you're creating a small

02:49:52.480 --> 02:49:58.080
society that is building culture and ways to interact with each other. And that's much,

02:49:58.080 --> 02:50:06.160
much more satisfying than going into some kind of chain and get your needs met by ordering food

02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:09.760
from this chain and so on. So not just consuming culture, but creating culture.

02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:14.560
And you don't always have that choice. That's why I prefaced it when you do have the choice. And

02:50:14.560 --> 02:50:18.720
there are many roles that need to be played. We need people who take care of our distribution

02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:23.600
in society and so on. But when you have the choice to create something, always go for creation. It's

02:50:23.600 --> 02:50:28.480
so much more satisfying. And this is what life is about, I think.

02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:36.240
Yeah. Speaking of which, you retweeted this meme of a life of a philosopher in a nutshell.

02:50:36.880 --> 02:50:42.480
It's birth and death and in between. It's a chubby guy and it says, why though?

02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:47.680
What do you think is the answer to that?

02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:56.000
Well, the answer is that everything that can exist might exist. And in many ways,

02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:01.520
you take an ecological perspective, the same way as when you look at human opinions and cultures.

02:51:01.520 --> 02:51:06.400
It's not that there is right and wrong opinions when you look at this from this ecological

02:51:06.400 --> 02:51:11.680
perspective. But every opinion that fits between two human ears might be between two human ears.

02:51:11.680 --> 02:51:18.400
And so when I see a strange opinion on social media, it's not that I feel that I have a need

02:51:18.400 --> 02:51:24.400
to get upset. It's often more that I, oh, there you are. And when an opinion is incentivized,

02:51:24.400 --> 02:51:29.680
then it's going to be abundant. And when you take this ecological perspective also on yourself and

02:51:29.680 --> 02:51:33.680
you realize you're just one of these mushrooms that are popping up and doing this thing,

02:51:33.680 --> 02:51:38.320
and you can, depending on where you chose to grow and where you happen to grow,

02:51:38.320 --> 02:51:43.040
you can flourish or not doing this or that strategy. And it's still all the same life

02:51:43.040 --> 02:51:46.640
at some level. It's all the same experience of being a conscious being in the world.

02:51:46.640 --> 02:51:52.240
And you do have some choice about who you want to be more than any other animal has.

02:51:52.880 --> 02:51:58.880
That to me is fascinating. And so I think that rather than asking yourself what is the one way

02:51:58.880 --> 02:52:04.640
to think about what are the possibilities that I have, what would be the most interesting way

02:52:04.640 --> 02:52:08.320
to be that I can be. Because everything is possible. So you get to explore this.

02:52:08.320 --> 02:52:14.160
Not everything is possible. Many things fail. Most things fail. But often there are possibilities

02:52:14.160 --> 02:52:22.480
that we are not seeing, especially if we choose who we are. To the degree we can choose.

02:52:26.960 --> 02:52:33.120
Yasha, you're one of my favorite humans in this world. Consciousness is to merge with for a brief

02:52:33.120 --> 02:52:39.760
moment of time. It's always an honor. It always blows my mind. It will take me days, if not weeks,

02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:49.200
to recover. And I already miss our chats. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for speaking with me

02:52:49.200 --> 02:52:57.120
so many times. Thank you so much for all the ideas you put out into the world. And I'm a huge fan of

02:52:57.200 --> 02:53:01.280
following you now in this interesting, weird time we're going through with AI.

02:53:02.080 --> 02:53:07.040
So thank you again for talking today. Thank you, Lex, for this conversation. I enjoyed it very much.

02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:11.760
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Yasha Bach. To support this podcast,

02:53:11.760 --> 02:53:17.120
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

02:53:17.120 --> 02:53:23.280
the psychologist Carl Jung. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light,

02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:31.280
but by making the darkness conscious. The latter procedure, however, is disagreeable and therefore

02:53:31.280 --> 02:53:36.080
not popular. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
