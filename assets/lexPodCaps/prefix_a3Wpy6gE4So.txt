00:00.000 --> 00:02.620
The following is a conversation with Steve Vasalli,

00:02.620 --> 00:06.000
formerly a truck driver and now a sociologist

00:06.000 --> 00:07.940
at the University of Pennsylvania,

00:07.940 --> 00:10.740
who studies freight transportation.

00:10.740 --> 00:12.860
His first book, The Big Rig,

00:12.860 --> 00:15.260
Trucking and the Decline of the American Dream,

00:15.260 --> 00:18.140
explains how long haul trucking went from being

00:18.140 --> 00:22.100
one of the best blue collar jobs to one of the toughest.

00:22.100 --> 00:24.020
His current ongoing book project,

00:24.020 --> 00:26.660
Driverless, Autonomous Trucks and the Future

00:26.660 --> 00:28.060
of the American Trucker,

00:28.080 --> 00:30.080
explores self-driving trucks

00:30.080 --> 00:33.220
and their potential impacts on labor and on society.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.440
This is the Lex Freedman podcast.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.640
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:38.640 --> 00:39.840
in the description.

00:39.840 --> 00:43.760
And now, here's my conversation with Steve Vasalli.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.360
You wrote a book about trucking called

00:47.360 --> 00:51.120
The Big Rig, Trucking and the Decline of the American Dream

00:51.120 --> 00:53.760
and you're currently working on a book

00:53.760 --> 00:56.920
about autonomous trucking called Driverless,

00:56.940 --> 01:00.660
Autonomous Trucks and the Future of the American Trucker.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.220
I have to bring up some Johnny Cash to you

01:02.220 --> 01:03.580
because I was just listening to this song.

01:03.580 --> 01:06.100
He has a ton of songs about trucking,

01:06.100 --> 01:08.580
but one of them I was just listening to,

01:08.580 --> 01:10.740
it's called All I Do is Drive,

01:11.620 --> 01:13.540
where he's talking to an old truck driver.

01:13.540 --> 01:17.260
It goes, I asked them if those trucking songs

01:17.260 --> 01:19.260
tell about a life like his.

01:19.260 --> 01:22.340
He said, if you want to know the truth about it,

01:22.340 --> 01:24.180
here's the way it is.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.200
All I do is drive, drive, drive.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.480
Try to stay alive, that's the chorus.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.280
And keep my mind on my load, keep my eye up on the road.

01:32.280 --> 01:34.800
I got nothing in common with any man

01:34.800 --> 01:36.400
who's home every day at five.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.400
All I do is drive, drive, drive.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.000
Drive, drive, drive, drive.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.800
So I gotta ask you, same thing that he asked the trucker.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.080
You worked as a trucker for six months

01:48.080 --> 01:50.360
and while working on the previous book,

01:51.180 --> 01:55.020
what's it like to be a truck driver?

01:55.020 --> 01:56.300
I think that captures it.

01:56.300 --> 01:59.700
It really does.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.660
Can you take me through the whole experience,

02:01.660 --> 02:03.980
what it takes to become a trucker,

02:03.980 --> 02:07.380
what actual day-to-day life was on day one, week one,

02:07.380 --> 02:09.380
and then over time how that changed?

02:09.380 --> 02:10.700
Yeah.

02:10.700 --> 02:14.920
Well, the book is really about how that changed over time.

02:14.920 --> 02:18.020
So my experience, and I'm an ethnographer, right?

02:18.040 --> 02:22.480
So I go in, I live with people, I work with people,

02:22.480 --> 02:26.920
I talk to them, try to understand their world.

02:26.920 --> 02:29.480
Ethnographer, by the way, what is that?

02:29.480 --> 02:34.480
The science and art of capturing the spirit of a people?

02:35.200 --> 02:36.680
Yeah, life ways.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.640
I think that would be a good way to capture it.

02:38.640 --> 02:43.640
Try to understand what makes them unique as a society,

02:44.340 --> 02:47.660
maybe as a subculture, right?

02:47.660 --> 02:50.500
What kind of makes them tick that might be different

02:50.500 --> 02:54.460
than the way you and I are sort of wired.

02:54.460 --> 02:57.020
And to really sort of thickly describe it

02:57.020 --> 02:59.140
would be at least one component of it.

02:59.140 --> 03:01.100
That's sort of the basic essential.

03:01.100 --> 03:05.540
And then for me, I want to exercise

03:05.540 --> 03:09.500
what C. Wright Mill's called the sociological imagination,

03:09.500 --> 03:13.300
which is to put that individual biography

03:13.300 --> 03:17.600
into the long historical sweep of humanity,

03:17.600 --> 03:19.560
if at all possible.

03:19.560 --> 03:23.000
My goals are typically more modest than C. Wright Mill's'

03:23.000 --> 03:26.260
and to then put that biography

03:26.260 --> 03:29.080
in the larger social structure, right?

03:29.080 --> 03:31.560
To try to understand that person's life

03:31.560 --> 03:34.120
and the way they see the world,

03:34.120 --> 03:36.400
their decisions in light of their interests

03:36.400 --> 03:38.760
relative to others and conflict and power

03:38.760 --> 03:40.800
and all these things that I find interesting.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.560
In the context of society and in the context of history,

03:44.560 --> 03:47.980
and the small tangent, what does it take to do that,

03:47.980 --> 03:52.980
to capture this particular group, the spirit, the music,

03:54.540 --> 03:57.920
the full landscape of experiences that a particular group

03:57.920 --> 04:00.800
goes through in the context of everything else?

04:00.800 --> 04:02.520
You only have a limited amount of time

04:02.520 --> 04:06.080
and you come to the table probably with preconceived notions

04:06.080 --> 04:08.880
that are then quickly destroyed, all that whole process.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.480
I don't know if it's more art or science,

04:11.480 --> 04:13.640
but what does it take to be great at this?

04:14.500 --> 04:19.500
I do think my first book was a success relative to my goals

04:20.240 --> 04:22.720
of trying to really get at the heart

04:22.720 --> 04:27.720
of the central issues and the lives being led by people.

04:28.100 --> 04:32.560
If I have a resource, a talent,

04:32.560 --> 04:34.200
it's that I'm a good listener.

04:35.200 --> 04:39.600
I can talk with anybody.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.880
My wife loves to remark on this,

04:41.880 --> 04:44.560
that I can sort of sit down with anyone.

04:45.480 --> 04:46.960
I think I learned that from my dad,

04:46.960 --> 04:50.760
who worked at a factory and actually had a lot of truckers

04:50.760 --> 04:53.760
go through the gate that he operated.

04:53.760 --> 04:57.120
And he always had a story, a joke for everybody,

04:57.120 --> 04:59.440
kind of got to know everyone individually.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.480
And he just taught me that essentially

05:02.520 --> 05:04.800
everyone has something to teach you.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.760
And I try to embody that.

05:06.760 --> 05:11.760
That's the rule for me is every single person

05:11.760 --> 05:14.800
I interact with can teach me something.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.840
I gotta ask you, I'm sorry to interrupt,

05:16.840 --> 05:19.840
because I'm clearly, of the two of us, the poorer listener.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.640
I think you're a great listener.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.000
I've been listening to the podcast.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.360
I think you're a great listener.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.480
I really appreciate that.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.120
You've done a large number of interviews, like you said,

05:31.160 --> 05:32.760
of truckers for this book.

05:33.920 --> 05:38.520
I'm just curious, what are some lessons you've learned

05:38.520 --> 05:43.280
about what it takes to listen to a person enough,

05:43.280 --> 05:47.600
maybe guide the conversation enough to get to the core

05:47.600 --> 05:51.760
of the person, the idea, again, the ethnographer goal,

05:51.760 --> 05:54.080
to get to the core?

05:54.080 --> 05:58.600
Yeah, I think it doesn't happen in the moment, right?

05:58.600 --> 06:02.000
So I'm a ruminator.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.840
I just sit with the data for years.

06:05.840 --> 06:10.400
I sat with the trucking data for almost 10 full years

06:10.400 --> 06:13.960
and just thought about the problems and the questions

06:13.960 --> 06:17.000
using everything that I possibly could.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.400
And so in the moment, my ideal interview is,

06:21.560 --> 06:24.880
I open up and I say, tell me about your life as a trucker.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.600
And they never shut up and they keep telling me

06:28.600 --> 06:29.840
the things that I'm interested in.

06:29.840 --> 06:33.160
Now, it never works out that way because they don't know

06:33.160 --> 06:34.560
what you're interested in, right?

06:34.560 --> 06:38.320
And so a lot of it is the, as you know,

06:38.320 --> 06:41.720
as I think you're a great interviewer, prep, right?

06:41.720 --> 06:45.160
So you try to get to know a little bit about the person

06:45.160 --> 06:48.680
and sort of understand the central questions

06:48.680 --> 06:51.720
you're interested in that they can help you explore.

06:52.280 --> 06:55.680
And so I've done hundreds of interviews

06:55.680 --> 06:57.600
with truck drivers at this point.

06:57.600 --> 07:01.240
And I should really go back and read the original ones.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.520
They were probably terrible.

07:02.520 --> 07:03.400
What's the process like?

07:03.400 --> 07:05.480
You're sitting down, do you have an audio recorder

07:05.480 --> 07:07.920
and also taking notes or do you do no audio recorder?

07:07.920 --> 07:08.920
Just notes or?

07:08.920 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, audio recorder and social scientists

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
always have to struggle with sampling, right?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.200
Like who do you interview?

07:15.200 --> 07:16.040
Where do you find them?

07:16.040 --> 07:17.560
How do you recruit them?

07:17.560 --> 07:21.080
I just happened to have a sort of natural place to go

07:21.080 --> 07:23.160
that gave me essentially the population

07:23.160 --> 07:24.960
that I was interested in.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.600
So all these long haul truck drivers that I was interested

07:27.600 --> 07:29.440
in, they have to stop and get fuel

07:29.440 --> 07:31.960
and get services at truck stops.

07:31.960 --> 07:35.160
So I picked a truck stop at the juncture

07:35.160 --> 07:38.360
of a couple major interstates, went into the lounge

07:38.360 --> 07:42.040
that drivers have to walk through with my clipboard

07:42.040 --> 07:44.480
and everybody who came through and I said,

07:44.480 --> 07:46.720
hey, are you on break?

07:46.720 --> 07:49.600
And that was sort of the first criteria was,

07:49.600 --> 07:50.800
do you have time, right?

07:51.800 --> 07:54.040
And if they said yes, I said, I'd say,

07:54.040 --> 07:57.600
I'm a graduate student at Indiana University,

07:57.600 --> 08:00.160
I'm doing a study, I'm trying to understand more

08:00.160 --> 08:02.480
about truck drivers, will you sit down with me?

08:02.480 --> 08:06.880
And I think the first, I think I probably asked like 104,

08:06.880 --> 08:09.880
103 people to get the first 100 interviews.

08:10.840 --> 08:11.880
That's pretty good odds.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.200
It's amazing, right?

08:13.200 --> 08:14.520
Wow, okay.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.560
Any response rate like that for interview,

08:16.560 --> 08:17.920
I mean, these are people who sat down

08:17.920 --> 08:21.600
and gave me an hour, sometimes more of their time,

08:21.600 --> 08:23.160
just randomly at a truck stop.

08:23.160 --> 08:26.360
And it just tells you something about like,

08:26.360 --> 08:28.200
truckers have something to say.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.240
They're alone a lot.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.080
And so I had to figure out how to kind of

08:33.080 --> 08:35.280
turn the spigot on, you know?

08:35.280 --> 08:38.600
And I got pretty good at it, I think, yeah.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.240
So they have good stories to tell

08:40.240 --> 08:41.880
and they have an active life in the mind

08:41.880 --> 08:43.720
because they spend so much time on the road,

08:43.720 --> 08:45.360
just basically thinking.

08:45.360 --> 08:48.000
Yeah, there's a lot of reflection,

08:49.240 --> 08:50.640
a lot of struggles, you know?

08:50.640 --> 08:53.920
And it's, they take different forms, you know?

08:53.920 --> 08:55.160
One of the things that they talk about

08:55.160 --> 08:56.920
is the impact on their families.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.280
They say truckers have the same rate of divorce

08:59.280 --> 09:00.440
as everybody else.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.120
And that's because trucking saves so many marriages

09:03.120 --> 09:05.280
because you're not around and ruins so many.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.000
And so it ends up being a wash.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.880
So, you know, I had this experience.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.880
I met another person and he recognized me

09:14.880 --> 09:16.480
from a podcast.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.040
And he said, you know, I'm a fan of yours

09:19.040 --> 09:22.680
and a fan of Joe Rogan, but you guys never talk.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.000
You always talk to people with Nobel prizes.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.200
You always talk to these kinds of people.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.240
You never talk to us regular folk.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.560
And that guy really stuck with me.

09:33.560 --> 09:36.640
First of all, the idea of regular folk is a silly notion.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.320
I think people that win Nobel prizes

09:39.320 --> 09:41.200
are often more boring than the people,

09:41.200 --> 09:43.200
these regular folks, in terms of stories,

09:43.200 --> 09:45.840
in terms of richness of experience,

09:45.840 --> 09:48.080
in terms of the ups and downs of life.

09:48.080 --> 09:51.480
And, you know, that really stuck with me

09:51.480 --> 09:53.720
because I set that as a goal for myself

09:53.720 --> 09:56.680
to make sure I talk to regular folk.

09:57.920 --> 10:02.920
And you did just this, talking, again, regular folk,

10:03.160 --> 10:07.560
it's human beings, all of them have experiences.

10:08.520 --> 10:13.520
If you were to recommend to talk to some of these folks

10:14.160 --> 10:16.720
with stories, how would you find them?

10:16.720 --> 10:19.440
Yeah, so I do do this sometimes for journalists

10:19.440 --> 10:21.440
who will come and they wanna write about

10:21.440 --> 10:24.840
sort of what's happening right now in trucking, you know.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.360
And I send them to truck stops.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.640
You know, I say, you know.

10:27.640 --> 10:31.280
Yeah, there's a town called Effingham, Illinois.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.840
And it's just this place where, you know,

10:33.840 --> 10:36.240
bunch of huge truck stops, tons of trucks

10:36.480 --> 10:38.760
and really nothing else out there.

10:38.760 --> 10:41.760
You know, it's in the middle of corn country.

10:41.760 --> 10:45.400
And, you know, again, truckers in this, you know, sadly,

10:45.400 --> 10:48.160
I think, you know, the politics of the day,

10:48.160 --> 10:50.320
it's changing a little bit.

10:50.320 --> 10:54.080
I think there's a little, the polarization is getting

10:54.080 --> 10:57.680
to the trucking industry in ways that, you know,

10:57.680 --> 11:02.480
maybe we're seeing in other parts of our social world.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.600
But truckers are generally, you know, real open

11:05.760 --> 11:07.720
sort of friendly folks.

11:07.720 --> 11:11.400
Some of them ultimately like to work alone and be alone.

11:11.400 --> 11:15.440
That's a relatively small subset, I think.

11:15.440 --> 11:18.680
But all of them are generally, you know, kind of open,

11:18.680 --> 11:21.520
you know, trusting, willing to have a conversation.

11:21.520 --> 11:25.480
And so you go to the truck stop and you go in the lounge

11:25.480 --> 11:27.520
and there's usually a booth down there

11:27.520 --> 11:30.560
and somebody sitting at their laptop or on their phone

11:30.560 --> 11:32.200
and willing to strike up a conversation.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.040
You should try that.

11:33.040 --> 11:33.880
You should, you know.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.040
100% we'll try this.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.680
Just again, we're just going from tangent to tangent.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.720
We'll return to the main question,

11:40.720 --> 11:43.240
but what do they listen to?

11:43.240 --> 11:45.720
Do they listen to talk radio?

11:45.720 --> 11:47.720
Do they listen to podcasts, audio books?

11:47.720 --> 11:48.840
Do they listen to music?

11:48.840 --> 11:50.920
Do they listen to silence?

11:50.920 --> 11:51.760
Everything.

11:51.760 --> 11:52.600
Everything.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.440
Everything, some, I mean, and some still listen to the CB,

11:55.440 --> 11:59.440
which, you know, it's a ever dwindling group.

11:59.440 --> 12:02.200
They'll call it the original internet citizens band.

12:03.040 --> 12:03.880
Back in the 70s,

12:03.880 --> 12:07.280
they thought it was going to be the medium of democracy.

12:07.280 --> 12:10.160
And they love to just get on there and, you know,

12:10.160 --> 12:13.720
cruise along one truck after the other and chat away.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.560
Usually, you know, it's guys who know each other

12:15.560 --> 12:18.600
from the same company or happen to run into each other.

12:18.600 --> 12:22.200
But other than that, it's everything under the sun, you know.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.640
And that's, it's probably one of the stereotypes.

12:24.640 --> 12:28.160
And it's, I think it was more true in the past, you know,

12:28.160 --> 12:32.320
about the sort of heterogeneity of truck drivers.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.920
They're a really diverse group now.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.120
You know, there's definitely a large,

12:37.120 --> 12:40.200
still a large component of rural white guys

12:40.200 --> 12:42.480
who work in the industry.

12:42.480 --> 12:45.640
But there's a huge growing chunk of the industry

12:45.640 --> 12:50.160
that's immigrants, people of color, and even some women.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.720
Still huge barriers to women entering it,

12:52.720 --> 12:55.960
but it's a much more diverse place than most people think.

12:56.960 --> 13:00.080
So let's return to your journey as a truck driver.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.400
What did it take to become a truck driver?

13:03.400 --> 13:05.000
What were the early days like?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.040
Yeah, so this is, I mean, this is a central part

13:07.040 --> 13:09.800
of the story, right, that I uncovered.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.880
And the good part was that I went in

13:11.880 --> 13:14.200
without knowing what was going to happen.

13:14.200 --> 13:19.000
So I was able to experience it as a new truck driver would.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.800
It's one of the important stories in the book

13:20.800 --> 13:24.520
is how that experience is constructed by employers

13:24.600 --> 13:28.040
to sort of, you know, help you think the way

13:28.040 --> 13:29.880
that they would like you to think about the job

13:29.880 --> 13:32.960
and about the industry and about the social relations of it.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.600
It's super intimidating.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.080
I say in the book, you know, pretty handy guy,

13:40.080 --> 13:41.840
you know, familiar with tools, machines,

13:41.840 --> 13:43.960
like, you know, comfortable operating stuff,

13:43.960 --> 13:46.760
like from time I was a kid,

13:46.760 --> 13:50.560
the truck was just like a whole nother experience.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.840
I mean, as I think most people think about it,

13:52.840 --> 13:55.360
it's this big, huge vehicle, right?

13:55.360 --> 13:58.160
It's really long, it's 70 feet long,

13:58.160 --> 14:00.560
it can weigh 80,000 pounds.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.680
You know, it does not stop like a car,

14:02.680 --> 14:04.360
it does not turn like a car.

14:05.880 --> 14:10.480
But at least when I started, and this has changed

14:10.480 --> 14:13.080
and it's part of the technology story of trucking,

14:13.080 --> 14:15.800
the first thing you had to do was learn how to shift it.

14:15.800 --> 14:19.360
And it doesn't shift like a manual car,

14:19.360 --> 14:21.080
the clutch isn't synchronized.

14:21.080 --> 14:24.000
So you have to do what's called double clutch.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.880
And it's basically the foundational skill

14:26.880 --> 14:29.520
that a truck driver used to have to learn.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.040
So you would, you know, accelerate,

14:32.040 --> 14:34.960
say you're in first gear, you push in the clutch,

14:34.960 --> 14:37.560
you pull the shifter out of first gear,

14:37.560 --> 14:39.000
you let the clutch out,

14:39.000 --> 14:42.960
and then you let the RPMs of the engine drop

14:42.960 --> 14:46.560
an exact amount, then you push the clutch back in

14:46.560 --> 14:48.280
and you put it in second gear.

14:48.280 --> 14:50.320
If your timing is off,

14:50.320 --> 14:52.520
those gears aren't gonna go together.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.720
So if you're in an intersection,

14:54.720 --> 14:57.200
you're just gonna get this horrible grinding sound

14:57.200 --> 15:00.680
as you coast, you know, to a dead stop in the,

15:00.680 --> 15:03.160
you know, underneath the stoplight or whatever it is.

15:03.160 --> 15:06.200
So the first thing you have to do is learn to shift it.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.560
And so at least for me and a lot of drivers

15:09.560 --> 15:12.240
who are going to private company CDL schools,

15:12.240 --> 15:14.600
what happens is it's kind of like a boot camp.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.560
They ship me three states away from home,

15:17.560 --> 15:19.280
send you a bus ticket and say,

15:19.280 --> 15:21.520
hey, we'll put you up for two weeks.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.000
You sit in a classroom, you sort of learn the theory

15:24.000 --> 15:26.880
of shifting the, you know, theory of kind of

15:26.880 --> 15:31.080
how you fill out your log book, rules of the road.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.680
You know, you do that maybe half the day,

15:32.680 --> 15:35.480
and then the other half you're in this giant parking lot

15:35.480 --> 15:38.200
with one of these old trucks and just like, you know,

15:38.200 --> 15:41.120
destroying what's left of the thing, you know,

15:41.120 --> 15:43.400
and it's lurching and belching smoke

15:43.400 --> 15:45.960
and just making horrible noises and like rattling.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.320
I mean, in these things, like there's a lot of torque.

15:48.320 --> 15:51.040
And so if you do manage to get it into gear,

15:51.040 --> 15:52.280
but the engine's lugging,

15:52.280 --> 15:54.560
I mean, it can throw you right out of the seat, right?

15:54.560 --> 15:57.960
So it's like, you know, this bull you're trying to ride

15:57.960 --> 15:59.600
and it's super intimidating.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.080
And the thing about it is that for everybody there,

16:04.080 --> 16:07.680
it's almost everybody there, it's super high stakes.

16:07.680 --> 16:11.080
So trucking has become a job of last resort

16:11.080 --> 16:12.840
for a lot of people.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.840
And so they, you know, they lose a job in manufacturing.

16:16.840 --> 16:20.520
They get too old to do construction any longer, right?

16:20.520 --> 16:22.320
The knees can no longer handle it.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.480
They get replaced by a machine, their job gets, you know,

16:26.480 --> 16:28.640
offshored and they end up going to trucking

16:28.640 --> 16:31.640
because it's a place where they can maintain their income.

16:31.640 --> 16:34.600
And so it's super high stress.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.400
Like they've left their family behind,

16:36.400 --> 16:38.240
maybe they quit another job.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.200
They're typically being charged a lot of money.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.960
So that first couple of weeks,

16:41.960 --> 16:45.080
like you might get charged $8,000 by the company

16:45.080 --> 16:47.760
that you have to pay back if you don't get hired.

16:47.760 --> 16:50.560
And so the stakes are high and this machine is huge

16:50.560 --> 16:52.480
and it's intimidating.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.840
And so it's super stressful.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.720
I mean, I watched, you know, men, grown men,

16:56.720 --> 16:59.080
break down crying about like how they couldn't go home

16:59.080 --> 17:01.360
and tell their son that they had been telling

17:01.360 --> 17:04.280
they were gonna, you know, go become a long haul truck driver

17:04.280 --> 17:05.200
that they'd failed.

17:05.200 --> 17:08.240
And it's kind of this super high stress system

17:08.240 --> 17:09.560
and it's designed that way partly

17:09.560 --> 17:12.000
because as one of my trainers later told me,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.480
it's basically a two week job interview.

17:14.480 --> 17:15.480
Like they're testing you.

17:15.480 --> 17:16.560
They're seeing like, you know,

17:16.560 --> 17:20.000
how's this person gonna respond when it's tough, you know,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.760
when they have to do the right thing and it's slow

17:22.760 --> 17:24.600
and, you know, they need to learn something.

17:24.600 --> 17:26.680
Are they gonna rush, you know,

17:26.680 --> 17:29.760
or are they gonna kind of stay calm, figure it out,

17:29.760 --> 17:31.600
you know, nose to the grindstone?

17:31.600 --> 17:32.960
Because when you're in your truck driver,

17:32.960 --> 17:34.400
you're unsupervised, you know,

17:34.400 --> 17:35.800
and that's what they're really looking for

17:35.800 --> 17:39.640
is that kind of quality of conscientious work

17:39.640 --> 17:41.160
that's gonna carry through to the job.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.720
Well, so the truck is such an imposing part

17:43.720 --> 17:45.880
of a traffic scenario.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.760
So you said like turning,

17:47.760 --> 17:50.040
it stresses me out every time I look at a truck

17:50.040 --> 17:54.000
because the geometry of the problem is so tricky.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.320
And so if you combine the fact that they have to,

17:56.320 --> 17:58.280
like everybody, basically all the cars in the scene

17:58.280 --> 18:00.000
are staring at the truck and they're waiting,

18:00.000 --> 18:02.120
often in frustration.

18:02.120 --> 18:06.960
And in that mode, you have to then shift gears perfectly

18:06.960 --> 18:08.440
and move perfectly.

18:08.440 --> 18:11.120
And if when you're new, especially,

18:11.120 --> 18:12.720
like you'll probably, for somebody like me,

18:12.720 --> 18:14.600
it feels like it would take years

18:14.600 --> 18:17.400
to become calm and comfortable in that situation

18:17.400 --> 18:18.960
as opposed to be exceptionally stressed

18:18.960 --> 18:22.440
under the eyes of the road,

18:22.440 --> 18:24.400
everybody looking at you, waiting for you.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.320
Is that the psychological pressure of that?

18:27.320 --> 18:29.000
Is that something that was really difficult?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.080
Yeah, absolutely.

18:30.080 --> 18:34.280
Again, I saw people freeze up in that intersection

18:34.280 --> 18:38.840
as horns are blaring and the truck's grinding gears

18:38.840 --> 18:40.760
and you just can't, and they just shut down.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.040
They're like, this isn't for me, I can't do it.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.200
You're right, it takes years.

18:45.200 --> 18:49.920
If trucking is not considered a skilled occupation,

18:49.920 --> 18:54.280
but my six months there, and I was a pretty good rookie,

18:54.280 --> 18:56.560
but when I finished, I was still a rookie,

18:56.560 --> 18:59.840
even shifting, definitely backing,

18:59.840 --> 19:02.160
tight corners and situations.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.000
I could drive competently,

19:04.000 --> 19:07.080
but the difference between me and someone who had

19:07.080 --> 19:10.200
two, three years of experience was,

19:11.360 --> 19:13.480
it was a giant gulf between us.

19:13.480 --> 19:16.840
And between that and the really skilled drivers

19:16.840 --> 19:19.600
who've been doing it for 20 years,

19:19.600 --> 19:21.240
is still another step beyond that.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.720
So it is highly skilled.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.200
Would it be fair to break trucking

19:24.240 --> 19:28.440
into the task of driving a truck into two categories?

19:28.440 --> 19:31.360
One is the local stuff, getting out of the parking lot,

19:31.360 --> 19:35.080
getting into driving down local streets

19:35.080 --> 19:38.800
and then highway driving, those two tasks.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.680
What are the challenges associated with each task?

19:41.680 --> 19:43.920
You kind of emphasized the first one.

19:43.920 --> 19:48.080
What about the actual long haul highway driving?

19:48.080 --> 19:51.560
Yeah, so I mean, and they are very different, right?

19:51.920 --> 19:55.240
And the key with the long haul driving

19:55.240 --> 20:00.160
is really a set of, the way I came to understand it

20:00.160 --> 20:03.320
was a set of habits, right?

20:03.320 --> 20:07.120
We have a sense of driving, particularly men, I think,

20:07.120 --> 20:10.240
have a sense of driving as like being really skilled

20:10.240 --> 20:13.280
is like the goal, and you can kind of maneuver yourself

20:13.280 --> 20:16.560
out of in and out of tight spaces with great speed

20:16.560 --> 20:18.840
and braking and acceleration, you know,

20:19.840 --> 20:22.000
for a really good truck driver,

20:22.000 --> 20:26.600
it's about understanding traffic and traffic patterns

20:26.600 --> 20:27.840
and making good decisions

20:27.840 --> 20:30.160
so you never have to use those skills.

20:30.160 --> 20:34.960
And the really good drivers, you know, the mantra

20:34.960 --> 20:37.360
is always leave yourself in out, right?

20:37.360 --> 20:40.720
So always have that safe place that you can put that truck

20:40.720 --> 20:43.520
in case that four-wheeler in front of you

20:43.520 --> 20:46.680
who's texting loses control, you know,

20:46.920 --> 20:50.160
what are you gonna do in that situation?

20:50.160 --> 20:54.760
And what really good truck drivers do on the highway

20:54.760 --> 20:56.800
is they just keep themselves

20:56.800 --> 20:59.520
out of those situations entirely.

20:59.520 --> 21:03.480
They see it, they slow down, they avoid it.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.920
And then the local driving is really something

21:06.920 --> 21:10.560
that takes just practice and routine to learn.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.280
You know, this quarter turn,

21:12.280 --> 21:15.880
it feels like the back of the truck sometimes is on delay

21:15.880 --> 21:16.720
when you're backing it up.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.480
So it's like, all right, I'm gonna do a quarter turn

21:18.480 --> 21:22.080
of the wheel now to get the effect that I want,

21:22.080 --> 21:24.040
like five seconds from now

21:24.040 --> 21:26.800
in where that tail of that trailer is gonna be.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.440
And there's just no, I mean,

21:28.440 --> 21:30.800
some people have a natural talent for that, you know,

21:30.800 --> 21:34.040
spatial visualization and kind of calculating those angles

21:34.040 --> 21:37.920
and everything, but there's really no escaping the fact

21:37.920 --> 21:40.520
that you've gotta just do it over and over again

21:40.520 --> 21:42.920
before you're gonna learn how to do it well.

21:42.920 --> 21:46.520
Do you mind sharing how much you were getting paid,

21:46.520 --> 21:48.760
how much you were making as a truck driver

21:48.760 --> 21:50.600
in your time as a truck driver?

21:50.600 --> 21:54.160
Yeah, I started out at 25 cents a mile

21:54.160 --> 21:56.800
and then I got bumped up to 26 cents a mile.

21:56.800 --> 22:01.320
So we had a minimum pay,

22:01.320 --> 22:03.600
which was sort of a new pay scheme

22:03.600 --> 22:07.040
that the industry had started to introduce to, you know,

22:07.040 --> 22:10.200
because there's lots of unpaid work and time.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.680
And so we had a minimum pay of $500 a week

22:13.440 --> 22:15.400
that you would get if you didn't drive enough miles

22:15.400 --> 22:16.360
to exceed that.

22:17.360 --> 22:19.560
You get paid in sort of,

22:19.560 --> 22:21.760
so you get paid when you turn the bills in,

22:21.760 --> 22:24.360
which is the paperwork that goes with the load.

22:24.360 --> 22:28.520
So, you know, you have to get that back to your company

22:28.520 --> 22:30.360
and then that's how they bill the customer.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.480
And so you might get a bunch of those bills

22:32.480 --> 22:34.480
that kind of bunch up in one week.

22:34.480 --> 22:38.360
So, you know, I might get a paycheck for, you know, $1,200.

22:38.360 --> 22:41.040
And I mean, I was a poor graduate student,

22:41.040 --> 22:44.120
so this was real money to me.

22:44.120 --> 22:48.120
And so I had this sort of natural incentive to, you know,

22:48.120 --> 22:51.480
earn a lot or to maximize my pay.

22:51.480 --> 22:54.680
Some weeks were that minimum, 500, very few.

22:54.680 --> 22:57.400
And then some I'd get 1,200, 1,300 bucks.

22:58.240 --> 23:00.680
Pay has gone up, you know,

23:00.680 --> 23:03.440
typical drivers now starting in the 30s, you know,

23:03.440 --> 23:05.480
in the kind of job that I was in,

23:05.480 --> 23:09.040
30s, you know, cents per mile, 30 to 35.

23:09.040 --> 23:12.080
So can we try to reverse engineer that math,

23:12.080 --> 23:14.560
how that maps to the actual hours?

23:14.560 --> 23:17.040
So there's the hours connected to driving

23:17.040 --> 23:19.040
are so widely dispersed.

23:19.040 --> 23:21.600
As you said, some of them don't count as actual work.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.840
Some of it does.

23:22.840 --> 23:24.280
That's a very interesting discussion

23:24.280 --> 23:25.720
that we'll then continue

23:25.720 --> 23:28.080
when we start talking about autonomous trucking.

23:28.080 --> 23:31.160
But, you know, you're saying all these cents per mile

23:31.160 --> 23:32.000
kind of thing.

23:33.720 --> 23:38.120
How does that map to like our average hourly wage?

23:38.120 --> 23:38.960
Yeah.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.120
So, I mean, and this is kind of the,

23:41.120 --> 23:44.040
this is also an interesting technology story in the end.

23:44.040 --> 23:47.000
And it's the technology story that didn't happen.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.720
So pay per mile was, you know, invented by companies

23:50.720 --> 23:52.520
when you couldn't surveil drivers.

23:52.520 --> 23:53.680
You didn't know what they were doing, right?

23:53.680 --> 23:56.040
And you wanted them to have some skin in the game.

23:56.040 --> 23:58.480
And so you'd say, you know, here's the load.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.840
It's going from, you know, for me,

24:00.840 --> 24:03.400
I might start in, you know, the Northeast,

24:03.400 --> 24:05.760
maybe in upstate New York with a load of beer.

24:05.760 --> 24:07.600
You'd say, here's this load of beer.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.480
Bring it to this address in Michigan.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.480
We're gonna pay you by the mile, right?

24:11.480 --> 24:12.960
If I was being paid by the hour,

24:12.960 --> 24:16.480
I might just pull over at the diner and have breakfast.

24:16.480 --> 24:19.120
So you're paid by the mile,

24:19.120 --> 24:22.560
but increasingly over time,

24:22.560 --> 24:26.960
the typical driver is spending more and more time

24:26.960 --> 24:28.320
doing non-driving tasks.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.360
There's lots of reasons for that.

24:30.360 --> 24:33.040
One of which is railroads captured a lot of freight

24:33.040 --> 24:34.600
that goes long distances now.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.440
Another one is traffic congestion.

24:38.280 --> 24:40.400
And the other one is that drivers are pretty cheap

24:40.400 --> 24:42.640
and they're almost always the low people

24:42.640 --> 24:45.120
on the totem pole in some segments.

24:45.120 --> 24:48.480
And so their time is used really inefficiently.

24:49.360 --> 24:52.080
So I might go to that brewery

24:52.080 --> 24:55.480
to pick up that load of Bud Light.

24:55.480 --> 24:59.520
And, you know, their dock staff may be busy

24:59.520 --> 25:01.720
loading up five other trucks.

25:01.720 --> 25:04.240
And they'll say, you know, go over there and sit and wait.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.600
We'll call you on the CB when the dock's ready.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.880
And they'll give you a couple hours.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.200
They bring you in, you know,

25:09.200 --> 25:11.520
you never know what's happening in the truck sometimes.

25:11.520 --> 25:12.680
They're loading it with a forklift.

25:12.680 --> 25:16.280
Maybe they're throwing 14 pallets on there full of kegs.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.440
But sometimes it'll take them hours, you know,

25:18.440 --> 25:20.080
and you're sitting in that truck

25:20.080 --> 25:22.720
and you're essentially unpaid.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.920
You know, then you pull out,

25:24.920 --> 25:27.800
you've got control over what you're gonna get paid

25:27.800 --> 25:29.480
based on how you drive that load.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.480
And then on the other end,

25:31.480 --> 25:33.720
you got a similar situation of kind of waiting.

25:34.280 --> 25:37.280
So if that's the way truck drivers are paid,

25:37.280 --> 25:38.760
then there's a low incentive

25:38.760 --> 25:41.800
for the optimization of the supply chain

25:41.800 --> 25:43.400
to make them more efficient, right?

25:43.400 --> 25:47.040
To utilize truck labor more efficiently.

25:47.040 --> 25:48.480
Absolutely.

25:48.480 --> 25:51.680
So that's a technology problem that,

25:51.680 --> 25:55.200
one of several technology problems that could be addressed.

25:57.360 --> 26:02.000
I mean, so what did, if we just linger on it,

26:02.000 --> 26:06.600
what are we talking about in terms of dollars per hour?

26:06.600 --> 26:08.280
Is it close to minimum wage?

26:08.280 --> 26:10.680
Is it, you know, there's something you talk about.

26:10.680 --> 26:15.680
There was a conception or a misconception

26:16.040 --> 26:19.800
that truckers get paid a lot for their work.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.800
Do they get paid a lot for their work?

26:21.800 --> 26:23.320
Some do.

26:23.320 --> 26:26.040
And I think that's part of the complexity.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.840
So, you know, what interested me

26:27.840 --> 26:30.120
as an ethnographer about this was, you know,

26:30.120 --> 26:32.800
I'm interested in the kind of economic conceptions

26:32.800 --> 26:34.320
that people have in their heads

26:34.320 --> 26:38.480
and how they lead to certain decisions in labor markets.

26:38.480 --> 26:40.560
You know, why some people become an entrepreneur

26:40.560 --> 26:43.160
and other people become a wage laborer

26:43.160 --> 26:45.760
or, you know, why some people wanna be doctors

26:45.760 --> 26:47.600
and other people wanna be truck drivers.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.680
That conception, right, is getting shaped

26:50.680 --> 26:53.880
in these labor markets is the argument of the book.

26:53.880 --> 26:57.480
And the fact that drivers can hear,

26:57.480 --> 26:59.840
or potential drivers can hear about these, you know,

26:59.840 --> 27:02.000
workers who make $100,000 plus,

27:02.000 --> 27:04.480
which happens regularly in the trucking industry.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.240
There are many truck drivers

27:06.240 --> 27:09.800
who make more than $100,000 a year, you know,

27:09.800 --> 27:13.840
is an attraction, but the industry is highly segmented.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.440
And so the entry-level segment,

27:16.440 --> 27:18.560
and we can probably get into this,

27:18.560 --> 27:22.600
but, you know, the industry is dominated by, you know,

27:22.600 --> 27:26.560
few dozen really large companies that are self-insured

27:26.720 --> 27:28.680
and can train new drivers.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.280
So if you want those good jobs,

27:30.280 --> 27:33.600
you've gotta have several years, up until recently,

27:33.600 --> 27:35.120
now the labor market's becoming tighter,

27:35.120 --> 27:38.160
but you had to have several years of accident-free,

27:38.160 --> 27:41.840
you know, perfectly clean record driving to get into them.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.560
The other part of the segment, you know,

27:44.560 --> 27:46.800
those drivers often don't make minimum wage.

27:47.920 --> 27:50.440
But this leads to one of the sort of central issues

27:50.440 --> 27:54.360
that has been in the courts and in the legislature

27:54.640 --> 27:56.880
in some states is, you know,

27:56.880 --> 27:59.600
what should truck drivers get paid for, right?

27:59.600 --> 28:03.080
The industry, you know, for the last 30 years or so

28:03.080 --> 28:05.800
has said, essentially, it's the hours that they log

28:05.800 --> 28:09.920
for safety reasons for the Department of Transportation,

28:09.920 --> 28:11.240
right?

28:11.240 --> 28:14.520
Now, since the drivers are paid by the mile,

28:14.520 --> 28:15.960
they try to minimize those

28:15.960 --> 28:19.080
because those hours are limited by the federal government.

28:19.080 --> 28:19.960
So the federal government says,

28:19.960 --> 28:22.640
you can't drive more than 60 hours in a week

28:22.640 --> 28:24.280
as a long-haul truck driver.

28:24.280 --> 28:26.560
And so you wanna drive as many miles as you can

28:26.560 --> 28:31.520
in those 60 hours, and so you under-report them, right?

28:31.520 --> 28:34.480
And so what happens is the companies say,

28:34.480 --> 28:35.560
well, that guy, you know,

28:35.560 --> 28:39.240
he only said he logged 45 hours of work that week

28:39.240 --> 28:40.640
or 50 hours of work.

28:40.640 --> 28:43.640
That's all we have to pay him minimum wage for.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.440
When, in fact, a typical truck driver in these jobs

28:46.440 --> 28:49.240
will work according to most people would sort of define it

28:49.240 --> 28:50.880
as like, okay, I'm at the customer location,

28:50.920 --> 28:52.800
I'm waiting to load and doing some paperwork,

28:52.800 --> 28:55.840
you know, I'm inspecting the truck, I'm fueling it,

28:55.840 --> 28:58.200
just waiting to, you know, get put in the dock,

28:58.200 --> 29:02.040
80 to 90 hours would be sort of a typical work week

29:02.040 --> 29:04.680
for one of these drivers.

29:04.680 --> 29:05.920
And just when you look at that,

29:05.920 --> 29:07.360
they don't make minimum wage oftentimes.

29:07.360 --> 29:10.440
Right, just to be clear, what we're dancing around here

29:10.440 --> 29:13.280
is that a little bit over, a little bit under,

29:13.280 --> 29:14.920
minimum wage is nevertheless,

29:14.920 --> 29:19.400
most truck drivers seem to be making close to minimum wage.

29:19.440 --> 29:24.000
Like this is the, so like we maybe haven't made that clear.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.200
There's a few that make quite a bit of money,

29:27.200 --> 29:31.240
but like you're, as an entry, and for years,

29:31.240 --> 29:35.520
you're operating essentially minimum wage

29:35.520 --> 29:37.840
and potentially far less than minimum wage

29:37.840 --> 29:40.000
if you actually count the number of hours

29:40.920 --> 29:42.800
that are taken out of your life

29:42.800 --> 29:44.720
due to your dedication to trucking.

29:45.720 --> 29:49.360
Well, if you count like the hours taken out of your life,

29:49.360 --> 29:52.720
then you gotta go, you know, maybe a full 24.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.280
That's right, yeah, from family,

29:54.280 --> 29:59.280
from the high quality of life parts of your life.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.960
Yeah, and there's a whole nother set of rules

30:01.960 --> 30:03.800
that the Department of Labor has,

30:03.800 --> 30:06.480
which basically say that a truck driver

30:06.480 --> 30:09.760
who's dispatched away from home for more than a day

30:09.760 --> 30:13.280
should get minimum wage 24 hours a day.

30:13.320 --> 30:16.520
And that could be a state minimum wage,

30:16.520 --> 30:19.680
but typically what it would work out to for most drivers

30:19.680 --> 30:23.000
is that, you know, the minimum wage for a truck driver

30:23.000 --> 30:26.920
should be 50s of thousands, you know, 55, $60,000

30:26.920 --> 30:28.880
should be the minimum wage of a truck driver.

30:28.880 --> 30:31.520
And you've probably heard about the truck driver shortage.

30:31.520 --> 30:34.720
If, you know, which I hope we can talk about,

30:35.760 --> 30:37.680
if the minimum wage for truck drivers

30:37.680 --> 30:40.280
is as it should be on the books at, you know,

30:40.280 --> 30:41.720
around $60,000,

30:41.760 --> 30:44.280
we wouldn't have a shortage of truck drivers.

30:44.280 --> 30:45.520
Oh, wow.

30:46.400 --> 30:51.400
And to me, 60,000 is not a lot of money for this kind of job

30:51.400 --> 30:56.400
because you're, this isn't, this is essentially two jobs

30:56.600 --> 30:59.960
and two jobs where you don't get to sleep with your wife

30:59.960 --> 31:03.480
or see your kids at night.

31:03.480 --> 31:06.560
That 60,000 is a very little money for that,

31:06.560 --> 31:09.600
but you're saying if it was 60,000,

31:09.600 --> 31:11.400
you wouldn't even have the shortage.

31:11.400 --> 31:12.640
If that was the minimum.

31:12.640 --> 31:13.560
If that was the minimum.

31:13.560 --> 31:14.880
And I think that's what,

31:14.880 --> 31:17.240
now we have drivers who start in the thirties.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.800
But yeah, and I mean, so we're talking two, three jobs,

31:21.800 --> 31:23.440
really, when you look at the total hours

31:23.440 --> 31:25.640
that people are working at, you know,

31:25.640 --> 31:27.960
they can work over a hundred, if they're a trainer,

31:27.960 --> 31:29.800
you know, training other truck drivers,

31:29.800 --> 31:31.880
well over a hundred hours a week.

31:31.880 --> 31:34.360
So a job of last resort,

31:34.360 --> 31:37.640
maybe you can jump around from tangent to tangent.

31:37.640 --> 31:41.640
This is such a fascinating and difficult topic.

31:41.640 --> 31:46.520
I heard that there is a shortage of truck drivers.

31:46.520 --> 31:48.360
So there's more jobs than truck drivers

31:48.360 --> 31:49.840
willing to take on the job.

31:49.840 --> 31:53.320
Is that the state of affairs currently?

31:53.320 --> 31:56.520
I mean, I think the way that you just put that is right.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.880
We don't have a shortage of people

31:59.880 --> 32:02.920
who are currently licensed to do the jobs.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.280
So I'm working on a project for the state of California

32:05.280 --> 32:07.160
to look at the shortage of agricultural drivers.

32:07.680 --> 32:11.480
And the first thing that the DMV commissioner of the state

32:11.480 --> 32:13.760
wanted to look at was, you know,

32:13.760 --> 32:15.760
is there actually a shortage of licensed drivers?

32:15.760 --> 32:17.800
He's like, I've got a database here

32:17.800 --> 32:20.080
of all the people who have a commercial driver's license

32:20.080 --> 32:22.760
who could potentially have the credential to do this.

32:24.240 --> 32:28.440
There are about 145,000 jobs in California

32:28.440 --> 32:31.520
that require of a class A CDL,

32:31.520 --> 32:33.640
which would be that commercial driver's license

32:33.640 --> 32:35.280
that you need for the big trucks.

32:36.280 --> 32:41.280
About 145,000 jobs, the industry in their regular promotion

32:42.000 --> 32:43.800
of the idea that there's a shortage

32:43.800 --> 32:45.840
is always projecting forward and says,

32:45.840 --> 32:48.520
you know, we're gonna need 165,000 or so

32:48.520 --> 32:50.480
in the next 10 years.

32:50.480 --> 32:53.800
There are currently like 435,000 people licensed

32:53.800 --> 32:57.240
in the state of California to drive one of these big trucks.

32:57.240 --> 33:01.760
So it is not at all an absence of people who,

33:01.760 --> 33:03.920
I mean, and again, going back to what we were talking

33:03.920 --> 33:07.200
about before, getting that license is not something

33:07.200 --> 33:10.480
that you just walk down to the DMV and take the test.

33:10.480 --> 33:13.960
Like, this is somebody who probably quit another job,

33:13.960 --> 33:18.960
was unemployed and took months to go to a training school,

33:19.360 --> 33:22.080
right, paid for that training school oftentimes,

33:22.080 --> 33:24.160
left their family for months, right,

33:24.160 --> 33:26.560
invested in what they thought was gonna be

33:26.560 --> 33:29.280
a long-term career and then said, you know what,

33:29.280 --> 33:32.240
forget it, I can't do it, you know.

33:33.240 --> 33:35.480
So yeah, so it's not just skill,

33:35.480 --> 33:37.560
it's like they were psychologically invested

33:37.560 --> 33:39.360
potentially for months if not years

33:39.360 --> 33:42.640
into this kinds of position as perhaps a position

33:42.640 --> 33:46.240
that if they lose their current job, they could fall too.

33:46.240 --> 33:47.920
Okay, so that's an indication

33:47.920 --> 33:50.400
that there's something deeply wrong with the job

33:50.400 --> 33:53.280
if so many licensed people are not willing to take it.

33:53.280 --> 33:55.280
What are the biggest problems

33:55.280 --> 33:59.200
of the job of truck driver currently?

33:59.200 --> 34:01.560
Yeah, the job, the problems with the job

34:01.560 --> 34:04.840
and the labor market, right, but let's start with the job,

34:04.840 --> 34:08.720
which is, you know, again, just so much time

34:08.720 --> 34:12.960
that's not compensated directly for the amount of time.

34:12.960 --> 34:15.160
And that's just psychologically,

34:15.160 --> 34:16.840
and this was a big part of what I, you know,

34:16.840 --> 34:20.400
sort of I studied for the first book was, you know,

34:20.400 --> 34:24.480
that conception of like, what's my time worth, right?

34:24.480 --> 34:28.720
And like, what truck drivers love is oftentimes

34:28.760 --> 34:33.040
is that tangible outcome-based compensation.

34:33.040 --> 34:37.080
So they say, you know what, you know, honest days work,

34:37.080 --> 34:38.880
I work hard, I get paid for what I do,

34:38.880 --> 34:40.600
I drive 500 miles today,

34:40.600 --> 34:42.640
that's what I'm gonna get paid for.

34:42.640 --> 34:44.800
And then you get to that dock and they tell you,

34:44.800 --> 34:49.800
sorry, the load's not ready, go sit over there and you stew.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.640
And that weight can break you psychologically

34:51.640 --> 34:56.640
because your time every second becomes more worthless.

34:56.640 --> 34:57.880
More worthless.

34:57.880 --> 34:58.720
Yeah.

34:58.720 --> 35:00.080
More worthless.

35:00.080 --> 35:04.520
Yeah, and again, the industry's gonna say, for instance,

35:04.520 --> 35:06.320
okay, well, you know, they've got skin in the game, right,

35:06.320 --> 35:08.080
that argument about sort of compensation

35:08.080 --> 35:10.720
based on sort of output, right?

35:10.720 --> 35:11.640
But that's a holdover

35:11.640 --> 35:13.000
from when you couldn't observe truckers.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.760
Now they all have, you know, satellite-linked computers

35:15.760 --> 35:18.600
in the trucks that tell these large companies,

35:18.600 --> 35:21.160
this driver was, you know, at this GPS location

35:21.160 --> 35:22.800
for four and a half hours, right?

35:22.800 --> 35:25.960
So if you wanted to compensate them for that time directly,

35:26.000 --> 35:27.480
the trucker can't control

35:27.480 --> 35:29.360
what's happening on that customer location.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.280
You know, they're waiting for that, you know,

35:31.280 --> 35:33.960
firm that customer to tell them, hey, pull in there.

35:35.080 --> 35:38.280
And so what it becomes is just a way to shift

35:38.280 --> 35:43.280
the inefficiencies and the cost of that onto that driver.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.560
Now, it's competitive for customers.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.600
So, you know, if you're Walmart,

35:47.600 --> 35:49.880
you might have your choice of a dozen different

35:49.880 --> 35:52.120
trucking companies that could move your stuff.

35:52.120 --> 35:53.760
And if one of them tells you,

35:53.800 --> 35:55.600
hey, you're not moving our trucks

35:55.600 --> 35:57.680
in and out of your docks fast enough,

35:57.680 --> 35:59.240
we're gonna charge you for how long

35:59.240 --> 36:01.240
our truck is sitting on your lot.

36:01.240 --> 36:02.280
If you're Walmart, you're gonna say,

36:02.280 --> 36:05.040
I'll go see what the other guy says, right?

36:05.040 --> 36:08.200
And so companies are gonna allow that customer

36:08.200 --> 36:11.560
to essentially waste that driver's time, you know,

36:11.560 --> 36:13.480
in order to keep that business.

36:14.720 --> 36:16.840
Can you try to describe the economics,

36:16.840 --> 36:18.480
the labor market of the situation?

36:18.480 --> 36:21.000
You mentioned freight and railroad.

36:21.040 --> 36:26.040
What is the sort of the dynamic financials,

36:27.240 --> 36:32.240
the economics of this that allow for such low salaries

36:34.400 --> 36:35.560
to be paid to truckers?

36:35.560 --> 36:37.360
Like what's the competition?

36:37.360 --> 36:41.800
What's the alternative to transporting goods via trucks?

36:41.800 --> 36:43.360
Like what seems to be broken here

36:43.360 --> 36:44.880
from an economics perspective?

36:44.880 --> 36:47.320
Yeah, so it's, well, nothing.

36:47.320 --> 36:50.600
It's a perfect market, right?

36:50.800 --> 36:53.440
So for economists, this is how it should work, right?

36:53.440 --> 36:55.920
But the inefficiencies, like you said, sorry to interrupt,

36:55.920 --> 36:59.240
are pushed to the truck driver.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.960
Doesn't that like spiral,

37:00.960 --> 37:03.400
doesn't that lead to a poor performance

37:03.400 --> 37:04.520
on the part of the truck driver

37:04.520 --> 37:06.200
and just like make the whole thing

37:06.200 --> 37:08.040
more and more inefficient

37:08.040 --> 37:10.880
and it results in lower payment

37:10.880 --> 37:12.800
to the truck driver and so on?

37:12.800 --> 37:17.040
It just feels like in capitalism,

37:17.040 --> 37:19.760
you should have a competing solution

37:19.800 --> 37:21.720
in terms of truck drivers.

37:21.720 --> 37:24.440
Like another company that provides transportation

37:24.440 --> 37:27.560
via trucks that creates a much better experience

37:27.560 --> 37:30.480
for truck drivers, making them more efficient,

37:30.480 --> 37:32.360
all those kinds of things.

37:32.360 --> 37:34.840
How is the competition being suppressed here?

37:34.840 --> 37:39.360
Yeah, so the competition is based on who's cheaper

37:39.360 --> 37:42.080
and this is the cheapest way to move the freight.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.800
Now, there are externalities, right?

37:44.800 --> 37:46.840
So this is the explanation

37:46.840 --> 37:49.640
that I think is obvious for this, right?

37:50.480 --> 37:53.800
There are lots of costs that,

37:53.800 --> 37:55.000
whether it's that driver's time,

37:55.000 --> 37:57.880
whether it's the time without their family,

37:57.880 --> 38:02.640
whether it's the fact that they drive through congestion

38:02.640 --> 38:06.920
and spew lots of diesel particulates into cities

38:06.920 --> 38:09.760
where kids have asthma and make our commutes longer

38:09.760 --> 38:11.960
rather than more efficiently use their time

38:11.960 --> 38:14.800
by sort of routing them around congestion

38:14.800 --> 38:17.320
and rush hour and things like that.

38:17.320 --> 38:21.120
This is the cheapest way to move freight

38:21.120 --> 38:23.640
and so it's the most competitive.

38:23.640 --> 38:26.760
A big part of this is public subsidy of training.

38:26.760 --> 38:31.280
So when those workers are not paying for the training,

38:31.280 --> 38:32.880
you and I often are.

38:32.880 --> 38:37.880
So if you lose your job because of foreign trade

38:38.520 --> 38:43.520
or you're a veteran using your GI benefits,

38:44.200 --> 38:48.360
you may very well be offered training,

38:48.360 --> 38:50.640
publicly subsidized training to become a truck driver.

38:50.640 --> 38:53.200
And so all of these are externalities

38:53.200 --> 38:55.920
that the companies don't have to pay for

38:55.920 --> 38:58.680
and so this makes it the most profitable way to move freight.

38:58.680 --> 39:02.960
So trucks is way cheaper than trains?

39:02.960 --> 39:03.920
Well, over the long,

39:03.920 --> 39:07.720
so one of the big stories for these companies

39:07.720 --> 39:10.040
is that the average length of haul,

39:10.040 --> 39:12.960
which becomes very important for self-driving trucks,

39:12.960 --> 39:16.040
the average length of haul has been steadily declining.

39:17.200 --> 39:19.200
Over the last 15 years or so,

39:19.200 --> 39:21.080
you know, this industry collected data

39:21.080 --> 39:23.200
from sort of the big firms that report it,

39:23.200 --> 39:25.640
but roughly been cut in half

39:25.640 --> 39:30.560
from typically about a thousand miles to under 500.

39:30.560 --> 39:35.560
And under 500 is what a driver can move in a day, right?

39:36.200 --> 39:40.200
So you can get loaded, drive and unload,

39:40.200 --> 39:43.120
you know, around 400 miles or something like that.

39:44.520 --> 39:46.280
I wanna steal a good question

39:46.280 --> 39:49.160
from the Penn Gazette interview you did,

39:49.160 --> 39:51.480
which people should read, it's a great interview.

39:51.480 --> 39:55.320
Was there a golden age for long haul truckers in America?

39:55.320 --> 39:58.320
And if so, this is such a journalistic question,

39:58.320 --> 40:02.560
and if so, what enabled it and what brought it to an end?

40:02.560 --> 40:05.320
Wow, I might have to have you read my answer to that.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.600
That was a few years ago,

40:07.600 --> 40:10.000
it'd be interesting to compare what I'll say,

40:10.840 --> 40:12.920
I mean, one bigger question to ask, I guess,

40:12.920 --> 40:17.000
is like, you know, Johnny Cash wrote a lot of songs

40:17.000 --> 40:19.880
about truckers, there used to be a time

40:19.880 --> 40:23.720
when perhaps falsely, perhaps it's part of the kind

40:23.720 --> 40:25.760
of perception that you study with the labor markets

40:25.760 --> 40:29.000
and so on, there was a perception of truckers being,

40:29.000 --> 40:30.360
first of all, a lucrative job,

40:30.360 --> 40:34.480
and second of all, a job to be desired.

40:34.480 --> 40:37.600
Yeah, so, I mean, this is a,

40:37.800 --> 40:40.320
the trucking industry to me is fascinating,

40:40.320 --> 40:43.640
but I think it should be fascinating to a lot of people.

40:43.640 --> 40:47.840
So the golden age was really two different kinds

40:47.840 --> 40:51.120
of markets as well, right?

40:51.120 --> 40:54.560
Today we have really good jobs and some really bad jobs.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.640
We had the Teamsters Union that controlled

40:57.640 --> 41:01.040
the vast majority of employee jobs,

41:01.040 --> 41:03.400
and even where they had something called

41:03.400 --> 41:05.440
the National Master Freight Agreement,

41:05.520 --> 41:10.400
and this was, you know, Jimmy Hoffa who led the union

41:10.400 --> 41:15.400
through its sort of critical period by the mid 60s

41:15.520 --> 41:19.160
had unified essentially the entire nation's

41:19.160 --> 41:22.240
trucking labor force under one contract.

41:22.240 --> 41:26.160
Now you were either, you know, covered by that contract

41:26.160 --> 41:29.200
or your employer paid a lot of attention to it.

41:29.200 --> 41:33.080
And so by the end of the 1970s,

41:33.120 --> 41:35.480
the typical truck driver was making well more

41:35.480 --> 41:37.960
than $100,000, typical truck driver was making

41:37.960 --> 41:40.800
more than $100,000 in today's dollars

41:40.800 --> 41:42.880
and was home every night.

41:42.880 --> 41:45.440
That was without a doubt,

41:45.440 --> 41:47.960
and even more than unionized auto workers,

41:47.960 --> 41:52.960
steel workers, 10, 20% more than those workers made.

41:53.840 --> 41:56.400
That was the golden age force of job quality,

41:56.400 --> 41:58.760
wages, Teamster power, they were without a doubt

41:58.760 --> 42:02.640
the most powerful union in the United States at that time.

42:03.160 --> 42:05.240
At the same time in the 1970s,

42:05.240 --> 42:09.160
you had the mythic long haul trucker.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.880
And these were the guys who were, you know,

42:11.880 --> 42:15.000
kind of on the margins of the regulated market,

42:15.000 --> 42:16.720
which is what the Teamsters controlled.

42:16.720 --> 42:17.960
A lot of them were in agriculture,

42:17.960 --> 42:19.560
which was never regulated.

42:19.560 --> 42:22.360
So in the new deal, when they decided to regulate trucking,

42:22.360 --> 42:23.760
they didn't regulate agriculture

42:23.760 --> 42:25.960
because they didn't want to drive up food prices,

42:25.960 --> 42:28.240
which would hurt workers in urban areas.

42:28.240 --> 42:32.280
So they essentially left agricultural truckers out of it.

42:32.280 --> 42:34.720
And that's where a lot of the kind of outlaw,

42:34.720 --> 42:39.720
you know, asphalt cowboy, you know, imagery that we get.

42:40.720 --> 42:42.800
And, you know, I grew up,

42:42.800 --> 42:44.560
I know you didn't grow up in the US

42:44.560 --> 42:47.480
that this sort of, you know, as a young child when,

42:47.480 --> 42:49.360
and I'm a bit older than you, but, you know,

42:49.360 --> 42:51.400
in the late seventies, you know,

42:51.400 --> 42:55.160
there were movies and TV shows and CBs were craze.

42:55.160 --> 42:57.880
And it was all these kind of outlaw truckers

42:57.880 --> 43:00.640
who were out there hauling some unregulated freight.

43:00.640 --> 43:01.760
They weren't supposed to be trying

43:02.040 --> 43:04.040
to avoid the bears, you know, who are the cops.

43:04.040 --> 43:07.320
And, you know, with all this salty language

43:07.320 --> 43:10.800
and these like, you know, terms that only they understood.

43:10.800 --> 43:13.720
And, you know, the party and at diners and popping pills,

43:13.720 --> 43:15.840
you know, the California turnarounds.

43:15.840 --> 43:18.200
So asphalt cowboys, truly.

43:18.200 --> 43:21.200
So it's like another form of cowboy movies.

43:21.200 --> 43:22.760
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.

43:22.760 --> 43:27.760
And I think that sort of masculine ethos of like,

43:28.160 --> 43:30.320
you got 40,000 pounds of something you care about,

43:30.320 --> 43:31.520
I'm your guy, you know,

43:32.280 --> 43:33.600
you need it to go from New York to California,

43:33.600 --> 43:35.120
don't worry about it, I got it.

43:35.120 --> 43:37.200
That's appealing and it's tangible, right?

43:37.200 --> 43:39.000
And you think about people who don't wanna be

43:39.000 --> 43:42.200
paper pusher and deal with office politics, like,

43:42.200 --> 43:43.720
just give me what you care about and I'll take care of it.

43:43.720 --> 43:46.960
You know, just pay me fair, you know, and that appeals.

43:46.960 --> 43:49.800
You mentioned unions, Teamsters, Jimmy Hoffa.

43:51.240 --> 43:53.520
Big question, maybe difficult question.

43:53.520 --> 43:55.720
What are some pros and cons of unions,

43:55.720 --> 43:58.800
historically and today, in the trucking space?

43:58.840 --> 44:03.640
Yeah, well, if you're a worker, there are a lot of pros.

44:03.640 --> 44:05.880
And I don't, you know, and this was one of the things

44:05.880 --> 44:07.600
I talked to truckers about a lot.

44:07.600 --> 44:09.640
Yeah, what's their perception of Jimmy Hoffa,

44:09.640 --> 44:11.840
for example, of unions?

44:11.840 --> 44:15.440
Yeah, so, and this was probably one of the central

44:15.440 --> 44:17.080
hypotheses that I had going in there.

44:17.080 --> 44:18.680
And it may sound, you know,

44:19.520 --> 44:21.280
someone who does hard science, right?

44:21.280 --> 44:23.880
You may hear a social scientist, you know,

44:23.880 --> 44:25.080
sort of use that terminology,

44:25.080 --> 44:26.240
even other social scientists.

44:26.240 --> 44:27.080
Hypothesis?

44:27.080 --> 44:28.600
Yeah, you know, they don't like it,

44:29.440 --> 44:31.280
but I do like to think that way.

44:31.280 --> 44:33.960
And my initial hypothesis was that, you know,

44:33.960 --> 44:36.600
and it's very simple, that, you know,

44:36.600 --> 44:39.640
the tenure of the driver in the industry

44:39.640 --> 44:43.280
would have a strong effect on how they viewed unions.

44:43.280 --> 44:46.160
That, you know, somebody who had experienced unions

44:46.160 --> 44:48.240
would be more favorable,

44:48.240 --> 44:51.080
and someone who had not, would not be, right?

44:52.080 --> 44:55.640
And that turned out to be the case, without a doubt.

44:55.640 --> 44:57.880
But in an interesting way,

44:57.880 --> 44:59.840
which was that even the drivers

44:59.840 --> 45:01.840
who were not part of the union,

45:02.920 --> 45:07.920
who in the kind of public debate of deregulation

45:09.800 --> 45:12.760
were portrayed as these kind of small business truckers

45:12.760 --> 45:16.280
who were getting shut out by the big regulated monopolies

45:16.280 --> 45:17.680
and the Teamsters Union, you know,

45:17.680 --> 45:19.520
the corrupt Teamsters Union,

45:19.520 --> 45:22.880
even those drivers longed for the days of the Teamsters.

45:23.840 --> 45:27.800
Because they recognized the overall market impact

45:27.800 --> 45:31.680
that they had, that trucking just naturally

45:31.680 --> 45:34.360
tended toward excessive competition

45:34.360 --> 45:37.480
that meant that there was no profit to be made,

45:37.480 --> 45:39.880
and oftentimes you'd be operating at a loss.

45:39.880 --> 45:42.160
And so even these, you know,

45:42.160 --> 45:45.120
the asphalt cowboy owner operators from back in the day

45:45.120 --> 45:48.320
would tell me when the Teamsters were in power,

45:48.320 --> 45:49.600
I made a lot more money.

45:50.600 --> 45:53.680
And, you know, this is, you know, unions,

45:53.680 --> 45:57.240
at least those kinds of unions like the Teamsters,

45:57.240 --> 46:00.440
you know, there's, I think a lot of misconceptions today

46:00.440 --> 46:03.800
sort of popularly about what unions did back then.

46:03.800 --> 46:06.040
They tied wages to productivity.

46:06.040 --> 46:10.640
Like that was the central thing that the Teamsters Union did.

46:10.640 --> 46:13.120
And, you know, there were great accounts

46:13.120 --> 46:15.840
of sort of Jimmy Hoffa's perspective

46:15.840 --> 46:19.520
for all his portrayal as sort of corrupt and criminal.

46:20.440 --> 46:23.080
I'm not disputing that he broke a lot of laws.

46:24.440 --> 46:29.440
He was remarkably open about who he was and what he did.

46:29.440 --> 46:32.200
He actually invited a pair, a husband and wife team

46:32.200 --> 46:35.920
of Harvard economists to follow him around

46:35.920 --> 46:39.080
and like opened up the Teamsters books to them

46:39.080 --> 46:42.120
so that they could see how he was, you know,

46:42.120 --> 46:45.480
thinking about negotiating with the employers.

46:45.480 --> 46:48.920
And the Teamsters, and this goes back well before Hoffa,

46:48.920 --> 46:52.960
back to the, you know, 1800s,

46:52.960 --> 46:56.000
they understood that workers did better

46:56.000 --> 46:57.600
if their employers did better.

46:57.600 --> 46:59.560
And the only way the employers would do better

46:59.560 --> 47:01.960
was if they controlled the market.

47:01.960 --> 47:04.680
And so oftentimes the corruption in trucking

47:04.680 --> 47:07.880
was initiated by employers who wanted to limit competition

47:07.880 --> 47:09.720
and they knew they couldn't limit competition

47:09.720 --> 47:11.040
without the support of labor.

47:11.040 --> 47:13.040
And so you'd get these collusive arrangements

47:13.040 --> 47:15.520
between employers and labor to say,

47:15.520 --> 47:17.400
no new trucking companies.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.160
There are 10 of us, that's enough.

47:19.160 --> 47:22.080
We control Seattle, we're gonna set the price

47:22.080 --> 47:23.800
and we're not gonna be undercut.

47:24.840 --> 47:27.320
When there's a shortage of trucks around, it's great.

47:27.320 --> 47:30.280
Rates go up, but you get too many trucks.

47:30.280 --> 47:33.320
It's very often that you end up operating at a loss

47:33.320 --> 47:35.520
just to keep the doors open.

47:35.520 --> 47:36.640
You know, you don't have any choice.

47:36.640 --> 47:39.640
You can't, it's what economists call derived demand.

47:39.640 --> 47:41.840
You can't like make up a bunch of trucking services

47:41.840 --> 47:43.160
and store it in a warehouse, right?

47:43.160 --> 47:46.160
You gotta keep those trucks moving to pay the bills.

47:47.120 --> 47:50.480
Can we also lay out the kind of jobs that are in trucking?

47:50.480 --> 47:52.280
What are the best jobs in trucking?

47:52.280 --> 47:53.840
What are the worst jobs in trucking?

47:53.840 --> 47:56.960
What are we, how many jobs are we talking about today?

47:56.960 --> 47:57.800
Yeah.

47:57.800 --> 47:59.880
And what kind of jobs are there?

48:00.960 --> 48:04.280
So there are a number of different segments.

48:04.280 --> 48:08.160
And the first part would be, you know, are you offering,

48:08.160 --> 48:09.000
the first question would be,

48:09.000 --> 48:11.360
are you offering services to the public

48:11.360 --> 48:13.200
or are you moving your own freight, right?

48:13.200 --> 48:17.800
So are you a retailer, say Walmart or, you know,

48:17.800 --> 48:19.280
a paper company or something like that,

48:19.280 --> 48:22.160
that's operating your own fleet of trucks?

48:22.160 --> 48:25.880
That's private trucking.

48:25.880 --> 48:28.720
For hire are the folks who, you know,

48:28.720 --> 48:31.160
offer their services out to other customers.

48:31.160 --> 48:33.120
So you have private and for hire.

48:33.120 --> 48:38.040
In general, for hire pays less.

48:38.040 --> 48:39.480
Is that because of the,

48:39.480 --> 48:43.000
something you talk about employee versus contractor

48:43.800 --> 48:47.080
situation or are they all tricked or led

48:47.080 --> 48:48.920
to become contractors?

48:48.920 --> 48:52.120
That can become a part of it as a strategy,

48:52.120 --> 48:54.920
but the fundamental reason is competition.

48:54.920 --> 48:58.880
So those private carriers aren't in competition

48:58.880 --> 49:00.400
with other trucking fleets, right,

49:00.400 --> 49:02.240
for their own in-house services.

49:02.240 --> 49:05.520
So, you know, they tend to, and this, you know,

49:05.520 --> 49:08.000
the question of why private versus for hire,

49:08.000 --> 49:09.920
because for hire is cheaper, right?

49:09.920 --> 49:12.160
And so if you need that,

49:12.160 --> 49:15.640
if that trucking service is central to what you do

49:15.640 --> 49:18.080
and you cannot afford disruptions or volatility

49:18.080 --> 49:19.880
in the price of it, you keep it in-house.

49:19.880 --> 49:21.520
You should be willing to pay more for that

49:21.520 --> 49:22.640
because it's more valuable to you

49:22.640 --> 49:23.920
and you keep it in-house and that.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.560
So that's an interesting distinction.

49:25.560 --> 49:27.240
What about, and this is kind of moving

49:27.240 --> 49:28.240
towards our conversation,

49:28.240 --> 49:30.280
what can and can't be automated.

49:31.920 --> 49:36.240
How else does it divide the different trucking jobs?

49:36.240 --> 49:38.200
So the next big chunk is kind of

49:38.200 --> 49:40.400
how much stuff are you moving, right?

49:40.400 --> 49:43.560
And so we have what's called truckload,

49:43.560 --> 49:46.040
and truckload means, you know, you can fill up a trailer,

49:46.040 --> 49:48.400
either by volume or by weight,

49:48.400 --> 49:50.480
and then less than truckload.

49:50.480 --> 49:52.640
Less than truckload, the official definition

49:52.640 --> 49:54.320
is like less than 10,000 pounds.

49:55.640 --> 49:57.440
You know, this is gonna be a couple pallets of this,

49:57.440 --> 49:58.800
a couple pallets of that.

49:58.800 --> 50:01.040
The process looks really different, right?

50:01.040 --> 50:04.240
So that truckload is, you know, point A to point B,

50:04.240 --> 50:08.560
I'm buying, you know, a truckload of bounty paper towels,

50:08.560 --> 50:11.800
I'm bringing it into, you know, my distribution center,

50:11.800 --> 50:13.960
go pick it up at the at the bounty plant,

50:13.960 --> 50:15.720
bring it to my distribution center, right?

50:15.720 --> 50:18.080
Nowhere in between do you stop,

50:18.080 --> 50:19.600
at least process that freight.

50:19.600 --> 50:22.880
Less than truckload, what you've got is terminal systems,

50:22.880 --> 50:25.760
and this is what you had under regulation too.

50:25.760 --> 50:27.720
And so these terminal systems, what you do is

50:27.720 --> 50:29.680
you do a bunch of local pickup and delivery,

50:29.680 --> 50:31.200
maybe with smaller trucks,

50:32.040 --> 50:33.640
and you pick up two pallets of this here,

50:33.640 --> 50:35.120
four pallets of this there,

50:35.120 --> 50:36.280
you bring it to the terminal,

50:36.280 --> 50:38.400
you combine it based on the destination,

50:38.400 --> 50:43.120
you then create a full truckload, you know, trailer,

50:43.120 --> 50:44.640
and you send it to another terminal

50:44.640 --> 50:46.080
where it gets broken back down,

50:46.080 --> 50:48.040
and then out for local delivery.

50:48.040 --> 50:49.400
That's gonna look a lot like

50:49.400 --> 50:52.600
if you send a package by UPS, right?

50:52.600 --> 50:54.680
They pick all these parcels, right?

50:54.680 --> 50:55.840
Figure out where they're all going,

50:55.840 --> 50:57.680
put them on planes or in trailers

50:57.680 --> 50:58.800
going to the same destination,

50:58.800 --> 51:00.080
then break them out to put them in

51:00.080 --> 51:01.520
what they call package cars.

51:02.520 --> 51:06.000
Before I ask you about autonomous trucks,

51:06.000 --> 51:09.600
let's just pause for your experience as a trucker.

51:10.920 --> 51:12.200
Did it get lonely?

51:12.200 --> 51:14.840
Like, can you talk about some of your experiences

51:14.840 --> 51:16.520
of what it was actually like?

51:16.520 --> 51:17.680
Did it get lonely?

51:17.680 --> 51:18.960
Yeah, no, I mean, it was,

51:20.040 --> 51:21.360
I didn't have kids at the time.

51:21.360 --> 51:23.360
Now I have kids, I can't even imagine it.

51:25.400 --> 51:29.360
You know, I've been married for five years at the time.

51:29.360 --> 51:31.040
My wife hated it, I hated it.

51:32.360 --> 51:37.120
I describe in the book the experience of being stuck,

51:37.120 --> 51:39.360
if I remember correctly, it was like Ohio,

51:40.320 --> 51:42.560
at this truck stop in the middle of nowhere

51:42.560 --> 51:46.360
and sitting on this concrete barrier

51:46.360 --> 51:48.760
and just watching fireworks in the distance

51:48.760 --> 51:51.200
and eating Chinese food on the 4th of July.

51:52.680 --> 51:55.520
My wife calls me from the family barbecue

51:55.520 --> 51:57.480
and our anniversary is July 8th,

51:57.480 --> 51:59.120
and she's like, are you gonna be home?

51:59.120 --> 52:01.800
And I'm like, I don't know, you know.

52:03.240 --> 52:08.240
I have a cousin whose husband drove truck,

52:09.440 --> 52:12.240
as a truck driver would say, drove truck for a while.

52:13.560 --> 52:15.400
And he told me before I went into it,

52:15.400 --> 52:18.640
he was like, the advantage you have is that you know

52:18.640 --> 52:21.040
that you're not gonna be doing this long-term.

52:21.040 --> 52:24.520
Like, and Lex, I can't even, like,

52:24.520 --> 52:27.840
the emotional content of some of these interviews,

52:27.840 --> 52:30.480
I mean, I would sit down at a truck stop with somebody

52:30.480 --> 52:33.960
I had never met before, and you know, you open the spigot.

52:33.960 --> 52:39.000
And the last question I would ask drivers was,

52:39.000 --> 52:41.080
by the time I really sort of figured out how to do it,

52:41.080 --> 52:43.200
the last question I would ask them is,

52:43.200 --> 52:46.120
you know, what advice would you give to somebody,

52:46.120 --> 52:50.240
your nephew, you know, a family friend asks you

52:50.240 --> 52:52.240
about what it's like to be a driver and should they do it?

52:52.240 --> 52:54.160
What advice would you give them?

52:54.160 --> 52:57.160
And this question, some of these, you know,

52:57.160 --> 53:00.840
grizzled old drivers, you know, tough, tough guys,

53:00.840 --> 53:03.080
would, that question would, like,

53:03.080 --> 53:05.200
some of them would break down and they would say,

53:05.200 --> 53:08.720
I would say to them, you better have everything

53:08.720 --> 53:11.720
that you ever wanted in life already,

53:11.720 --> 53:15.320
because I've had a car that I've had for 10 years,

53:15.320 --> 53:17.120
it's got 7,000 miles on it.

53:17.120 --> 53:21.840
I own a boat that hasn't seen the water in five years.

53:21.880 --> 53:24.240
My kids, I didn't raise them.

53:24.240 --> 53:27.400
Like, I'd be out for two weeks at a time,

53:27.400 --> 53:31.520
I'd come home, my wife would give me two kids to punish,

53:31.520 --> 53:34.600
a list of things to do, you know, on Saturday night,

53:34.600 --> 53:37.440
and I might leave out Sunday night or Monday morning,

53:37.440 --> 53:39.520
you know, I come home dead tired,

53:39.520 --> 53:41.880
my kids don't know who I am.

53:41.880 --> 53:43.880
And, you know, it was just like,

53:44.760 --> 53:46.960
it was heartbreaking to hear those stories.

53:46.960 --> 53:49.440
And then before you know it, you know,

53:49.440 --> 53:52.560
life is short and just the years run away.

53:52.560 --> 53:53.400
Yeah.

53:54.880 --> 53:56.640
Hard question to ask in that context,

53:56.640 --> 54:00.760
but what's the best, what was the best part

54:00.760 --> 54:02.240
of being a truck driver?

54:04.160 --> 54:08.160
Was there moments that you truly enjoyed on the road?

54:08.160 --> 54:09.840
Oh, absolutely, there was,

54:10.880 --> 54:13.160
there's definitely a pride and mastery of,

54:13.160 --> 54:15.600
you know, even basic competence of sort of piloting

54:15.600 --> 54:17.080
this thing safely.

54:17.080 --> 54:18.640
There's a lot of responsibility to it.

54:18.640 --> 54:21.360
That thing's dangerous and you know it.

54:21.360 --> 54:23.320
So there's some pride there.

54:23.320 --> 54:26.360
For me personally, and I know for a lot of other drivers,

54:26.360 --> 54:29.360
it's just like seeing these behind the scenes places

54:29.360 --> 54:32.280
that you know exist in our economy.

54:32.280 --> 54:35.880
And I think we're all much more aware of them now

54:35.880 --> 54:39.000
after COVID and supply chain mess that we have.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.400
I don't know if we'll talk about that,

54:40.400 --> 54:42.840
but, you know, you get to see those places,

54:42.840 --> 54:44.360
you know, you get to see those ports,

54:44.360 --> 54:47.880
you get to see the place where they make the cardboard boxes

54:47.880 --> 54:49.600
that the Huggies diapers go in,

54:49.600 --> 54:50.920
Huggies diapers go in,

54:50.920 --> 54:53.600
or the warehouse full of Bud Light.

54:53.600 --> 54:56.680
I moved Bud Light from like upstate New York

54:56.680 --> 54:59.920
and the first load like went to Atlanta, you know,

54:59.920 --> 55:01.520
and then a couple months later,

55:01.520 --> 55:03.760
I circled back through that same brewery

55:03.760 --> 55:08.360
and I brought a load of Bud Light out to Michigan.

55:08.360 --> 55:10.840
And I was like, holy shit, all the Bud Light,

55:10.840 --> 55:13.640
like, you know, for this whole giant swath

55:13.640 --> 55:15.600
of the United States comes from this one plant,

55:15.600 --> 55:17.840
this cavernous plant with like kegs of beer.

55:17.840 --> 55:20.240
And you see that part of the economy

55:20.240 --> 55:24.240
and it's like you're almost like you're an economic tourist.

55:24.240 --> 55:27.040
And I think all everybody kind of appreciates that

55:27.040 --> 55:29.840
like kind of, it's almost like a behind the scenes tour

55:30.680 --> 55:32.600
that wears off after a few months, you know,

55:32.600 --> 55:35.680
you start to see new things less and less frequently.

55:35.680 --> 55:38.560
At first, everything's novel and sort of life on the road.

55:38.560 --> 55:41.920
And then it becomes just endless miles of white lines

55:41.920 --> 55:44.280
and yellow lines and truck stops.

55:44.280 --> 55:47.800
And the days just blur together, you know,

55:47.800 --> 55:49.640
it's one loading dock after another.

55:49.640 --> 55:52.480
So you lose the magic of being on the road.

55:52.480 --> 55:55.120
Yeah, it's very rare the driver that doesn't.

55:58.320 --> 56:00.480
You mentioned COVID and supply chain.

56:01.360 --> 56:04.920
While being this for a brief time,

56:04.920 --> 56:07.000
this member of the supply chain,

56:07.000 --> 56:11.360
what have you come to understand about our supply chain,

56:11.360 --> 56:14.800
United States and global and its resilience

56:14.800 --> 56:18.680
against strategies, catastrophes in the world,

56:18.680 --> 56:20.240
like COVID, for example?

56:20.240 --> 56:24.400
Yeah, I mean, we have built really long,

56:24.400 --> 56:26.840
really lean supply chains.

56:26.840 --> 56:30.400
And just by definition, they're fragile.

56:31.520 --> 56:34.320
You know, the current mess that we have,

56:34.320 --> 56:37.240
it's not gonna clear by Christmas.

56:37.240 --> 56:39.960
It will be lucky if it clears by next Christmas.

56:39.960 --> 56:41.240
Can you describe the current mess

56:41.240 --> 56:43.080
in supply chain that you're referring to?

56:43.080 --> 56:46.960
Yeah, so we've got pileups of ships

56:46.960 --> 56:50.240
off the coast of California, Long Beach,

56:50.240 --> 56:54.120
and LA in particular, in bad shape.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.880
Last I checked, it was around 60 ships,

56:56.880 --> 57:00.560
all of which are holding thousands of containers

57:00.560 --> 57:02.720
full of stuff that retailers were hoping

57:02.720 --> 57:06.160
was gonna be on shelves for the holiday season.

57:07.160 --> 57:10.200
Meanwhile, the port itself has stacks and stacks

57:10.200 --> 57:12.520
of containers that they can't get rid of.

57:12.520 --> 57:15.520
The truckers aren't showing up to pick up

57:15.520 --> 57:17.320
the containers that are there,

57:17.320 --> 57:21.360
so they can't offload the ships that are waiting.

57:22.600 --> 57:26.000
And why aren't the truckers picking it up?

57:26.000 --> 57:28.040
Partly because there's a long history of inefficiency

57:28.040 --> 57:29.360
in making them wait,

57:29.360 --> 57:31.720
but it's because the warehouses are full.

57:32.560 --> 57:36.520
And so we've had all these perverse outcomes

57:36.520 --> 57:38.480
that no one really expected.

57:38.480 --> 57:40.400
In the middle of all these shortages,

57:41.440 --> 57:43.360
people are stockpiling stuff.

57:43.360 --> 57:47.280
So there are suppliers who used to keep two months

57:47.280 --> 57:50.680
of supply of bottled water on hand,

57:50.680 --> 57:53.640
and after going through COVID and not having supply

57:53.640 --> 57:55.560
to send to their customers,

57:55.560 --> 57:58.320
they're like, we need three months.

57:58.320 --> 58:02.560
Well, our system is not designed for major storage of goods

58:02.560 --> 58:04.720
to go up 50% in a category.

58:04.720 --> 58:05.760
It's lean.

58:05.760 --> 58:08.720
If you're a warehouse operator, you wanna be 90% plus.

58:08.720 --> 58:10.760
You don't want a lot of open bays sitting around.

58:10.760 --> 58:15.760
So we don't have 10% extra capacity in warehouses.

58:16.320 --> 58:18.120
We don't have 10% of them.

58:18.120 --> 58:19.800
Trucking capacity can fluctuate a bit,

58:19.800 --> 58:23.640
but you don't have that kind of slack.

58:23.640 --> 58:26.240
And now, I mean, and we saw this

58:26.240 --> 58:28.320
when people shifted consumption,

58:28.320 --> 58:32.840
and I get a little mad when people talk about panic buying

58:32.840 --> 58:36.760
as kind of the reason that we had all these shortages.

58:36.760 --> 58:40.800
It really, it's preventing us from understanding

58:40.800 --> 58:45.000
the real problem there, which is that lean supply chain.

58:45.000 --> 58:48.000
Sure, there was some panic buying, no doubt about it,

58:48.000 --> 58:51.920
but we had an enormous shift in people's behavior.

58:51.920 --> 58:55.400
So with my sister and brother-in-law,

58:55.400 --> 58:58.560
we own a couple of small businesses and we serve food.

58:58.560 --> 59:01.560
So we get food from Cisco.

59:02.800 --> 59:04.760
Cisco couldn't get rid of food,

59:04.760 --> 59:06.000
because nobody's eating out.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.120
So they've got 50-pound sacks of flour

59:10.200 --> 59:11.920
sitting in their warehouse that they can't get rid of.

59:11.920 --> 59:14.240
They've got cases of lettuce and meat

59:14.240 --> 59:17.400
and everything else that's just gonna go bad.

59:17.400 --> 59:20.840
So that panic buying certainly exacerbated some things,

59:20.840 --> 59:22.040
like toilet paper and whatever,

59:22.040 --> 59:25.680
but we saw just a massive change in demand,

59:25.680 --> 59:28.800
and our supply chains are based on historical data, right?

59:28.800 --> 59:32.640
So that stuff leaves Asia months before

59:32.640 --> 59:34.520
you wanna have it on the shelves,

59:34.520 --> 59:37.040
and you're predicting based on last year

59:37.040 --> 59:39.840
what you want on that shelf.

59:39.840 --> 59:43.320
And so it's a, I guess at its best,

59:43.320 --> 59:47.040
it's a beautiful symphony of lots of moving parts,

59:47.040 --> 59:52.040
but now everyone can't get on the same page of music.

59:52.760 --> 59:57.760
But it's not resilient to changes in on-mass human behavior.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:03.480
So even like I read somewhere,

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:06.400
maybe you can tell me if it's true in relation to food,

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.280
it's just the change of human behavior

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:11.880
between going out to restaurants versus eating at home.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:15.520
As a species, we consume a lot less food that way.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.720
Apparently what I read, in restaurants,

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.640
there's a lot of food just thrown out.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.120
It's part of the business model.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:26.240
And so you then have to move a lot more food

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:28.080
through the whole supply chain.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:31.600
And now, because you're consuming,

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.920
there's leftovers at home,

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:37.200
you're consuming much more of the food you're getting

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.680
when you're eating at home.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.040
That's creating these bottleneck situations,

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.560
problems as you're referring to,

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.280
too much in a certain place, not enough in another place.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.880
The supply chain is not robust

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:52.880
to those kind of dynamic shifts in who gets what where.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.440
Yeah, I mean, so I have worked in agriculture a bit

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.120
on sort of the supply side.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.120
And there are product categories, right,

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:07.440
where 30% of the crop raised does not get used, right?

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.960
Just gets plowed under or wasted.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.200
But here's the importance of this

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.440
in sort of getting this right,

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.560
not that like panic buying,

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.960
blame the irrational consumer,

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.240
look at the hard sort of truth

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:24.240
of the way we've set up our economy.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.760
And I'll ask you this, Lex,

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.640
I know you're a hopeful, optimistic person.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.960
100%, yes.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.000
Yeah, I am too.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.840
I mean, I write about problems all the time.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.600
And so people think I'm sort of like a,

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:40.000
just a Debbie Downer, you know, pessimist.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.120
But I'm a glass half full kind of guy.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.440
Like I want to identify problems so we can solve them.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.400
So let me ask you this.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:52.080
We've got these long, lean supply chains.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.400
In the future,

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:59.000
do you see more environmental problems

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.520
that could disrupt them?

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:03.640
More geopolitical problems

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:07.000
that could disrupt trade from Asia?

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.200
You know, other institutional failures?

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.880
Do those things seem, you know,

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:16.320
potentially more likely in the future

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.680
than they have been in, say, the last 20 years?

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.920
Yeah, it almost absolutely seems to be the case.

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.680
So you then have to ask the question

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:28.680
of how do we change our supply chains?

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.080
Whether it's making more resilient

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.200
or make them less densely connected.

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.800
You know, building, it's like, what is it?

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:43.400
You know, the Tesla model for in the automotive sector

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.040
of like trying to build everything,

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.600
like trying to get the factory to do as much as possible

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:53.480
with as little reliance on widely distributed sources

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.000
of the supply chain as possible.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.640
So maybe like rethinking how much we rely

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.840
on the infrastructure of the supply chain.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.760
Yeah, I mean, you know, there are some basic,

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:08.160
and I assume, right, that there are a lot of folks

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.600
in corporate boardrooms looking at risk

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:13.080
and saying that didn't go well,

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.120
and maybe it could have even gone worse.

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:19.720
Maybe we need to think about reshoring, right?

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:22.760
At the very least, one of the things

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.120
that I'm hearing about anecdotally

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.320
is that they're storing stuff up, you know,

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.080
when they can, right?

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:31.360
Which is, that's probably not sustainable, right?

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.080
I mean, at some point, somebody in that corporate boardroom

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.680
is gonna say, you know, guys, inventory's getting

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.600
kind of having the cost of that is like,

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.080
can we really justify that much longer

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.840
to the shareholders, right?

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.880
We can back off and start, you know,

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.560
things are back to normal, let's lean out.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.440
Well, my hope is that there's a technology solution

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.640
to a lot of aspects of this.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.480
So one of them on the supply chain side

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.120
is collecting a lot more data,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.080
like having much more integrated

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.400
and accurate representation of the inventory

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.720
all over the place,

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.440
and the available transportation mechanisms,

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:06.120
the trucks, all kinds of freight,

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:08.680
and how, in the different models

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:13.680
of the possible catastrophes that can happen,

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.000
what, like how will the system respond?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.280
So having a really solid model

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.360
that you're operating under,

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.520
as opposed to just kind of being in emergency response mode

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:26.200
under poor, incomplete information,

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.520
which is what seems like is more commonly the case,

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.160
except for things, like you said, Walmart and Amazon,

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.800
they're trying to internally get their stuff together

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.680
on that front, but that doesn't help

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.280
the rest of the economy.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.960
So another exciting technological development,

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.800
as you write about, as you think about,

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.120
is autonomous trucks.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:52.360
So these are often brought up in different contexts

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:57.360
as the examples of AI and robots taking our jobs.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.760
How true is this?

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.360
Should we be concerned?

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.440
I think they've really come to epitomize

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.360
this anxiety over automation, right?

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:09.240
Just, it's such a simple idea, right?

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.480
Truck that drives itself, you know,

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:16.320
classic blue collar job that pays well, you know?

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.080
Guy maybe with not a lot of other good options, right?

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.360
To sort of make that same income easily, right?

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:27.000
And you build a robot to take his job away, right?

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Right, so I think 2016 or so,

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:35.280
that was the sort of big question out there.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.400
And that's actually how I started studying it, right?

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.080
I just wrapped up the book,

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:43.200
just so happened that somebody was working at Uber,

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.880
Uber had just bought auto, saw the book and was like,

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.880
hey, can you come out and talk to our engineering teams

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.800
about what life is like for truck drivers

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.720
and maybe how our technology could make it better?

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.640
At that time, there were a lot of different ideas

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.200
about how they were gonna play out, right?

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.200
So while the press was saying,

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.280
you know, all truckers are gonna lose their jobs.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:08.120
There were a lot of people in these engineering teams

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.280
who thought, okay, you know,

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:12.200
if we've got an individual owner operator, you know,

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.600
and they can only drive eight or 10 hours a day,

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.920
you know, they hop in the back, they get their rest

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:23.040
and the asset that they own works for them, right?

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.840
It's sort of perfect, right?

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.400
And at that time, you know,

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.400
there were a bunch of reports that came out

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.720
and sort of basically what people did was

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.960
they took the category of truck driver.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.200
You know, some people took a larger category

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.760
from BLS of, you know, sales and delivery workers

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.280
that was about three and a half million workers

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:43.640
and others took the heavy duty truck driver category,

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:46.800
which was at the time about 1.8 million or so.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:49.520
And they, you know, picked the start date and a slope

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.360
and said, you know, let's assume that all these jobs

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.520
are just gonna disappear.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:57.600
And really smart researcher, Annette Bernhardt

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.720
at the Labor Center at UC Berkeley

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.760
was sort of looking around for people

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.640
who were sort of deeply into industries

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:10.280
to complicate those analyses, right?

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.720
And reached out to me and was like,

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.560
what do you think of this?

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.440
And I said, the industry is super diverse.

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.440
You know, this is just, I haven't given a ton of thought,

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.200
but it can't be that, you know, it's not that simple.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.240
You know, it never is.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.840
And so she was like, will you, you know, will you do this?

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:26.160
And I was like, ready to move on to another topic.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.760
You know, I had like been in trucking for 10 years

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:31.040
and that's how I started looking at it.

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.680
And it is, it's a lot more complicated

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:38.600
and the initial impacts and here's the challenge, I think,

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.640
and it's not just a research challenge.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.640
It's the fundamental public policy challenge

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.960
is we look at the existing industry

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:50.080
and the impacts, the potential impacts,

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.120
they're not, you know, nothing.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.280
For some communities and some kinds of drivers,

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.240
they're gonna be hard

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.320
and there are a significant number of them.

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.960
Nowhere near what people thought.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.320
You know, I estimate it's like around 300,000,

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:08.080
but that's a static picture of the existing industry.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:13.080
And here's the key with this is, at least in my conclusion,

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:17.120
is this is a transformative technology.

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:20.880
We are not going to swap in self-driving trucks

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:24.240
for human-driven trucks and all else stays the same.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:27.480
This is gonna reshape our supply chains.

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:29.400
It's gonna reshape landscapes.

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:32.480
It's gonna affect our ability to fight climate change.

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:37.720
This is a really important technology in this space.

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.160
Do you think it's possible to predict the future

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:44.440
of the kind of opportunities it will create,

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.760
how it will change the world?

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.560
So like when you have the internet,

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.160
you can start saying like all the kind of ways

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.440
that office work, all jobs will be lost

01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.080
because it's easy to network

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.320
and then software engineering allows you

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.160
to automate a lot of the tasks

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.360
like Microsoft Excel does, you know.

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:08.080
But it opened up so many opportunities,

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.240
even with things that are difficult to imagine,

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.720
like with the internet, I don't know, Wikipedia,

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.960
which is widely making accessible information.

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:20.960
And that increased the general education globally by a lot,

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:22.560
all those kinds of things.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:25.440
Like, and then the ripple effects of that

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:29.120
in terms of your ability to find other jobs

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.040
is probably immeasurable.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:35.760
So is it just a hopeless pursuit to try to predict

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:40.520
if you talk about these six different trajectories

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:44.400
that we might take in automating trucks,

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:47.680
but like as a result of taking those trajectories,

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.160
is it a hopeless pursuit to predict

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.840
what the future will result in?

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:51.920
Yeah, it is.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:56.920
It absolutely is because it's the wrong question.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:59.280
The question is, what do we want the future to be

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.960
and let's shape it, right?

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.320
And I think this is, you know,

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:07.120
and this is the only point that I really wanna make

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.200
in my work, you know, for the foreseeable future

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:15.320
is that, you know, we have got to get out of this mindset

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:20.440
that we're just gonna let technology kind of go

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.560
and it's a natural process and whatever pops out

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.400
will fix the problems on the backside.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:28.200
And we've got to recognize that one,

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:30.960
that's not what we do, right?

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.360
You know, and self-driving vehicles

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.160
is just such a perfect example, right?

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.240
We would not be sitting here today

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.560
if the Defense Department, right?

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:43.560
If Congress in 2000 had not written into legislation

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:48.080
funding for the DARPA challenges, which followed,

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.120
actually, I think the funding came a couple of years later,

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.920
but the priority that they wrote in 2000 was,

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.600
let's get a third of all ground vehicles

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.520
in our military forces unmanned, right?

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.520
And this was before aerial unmanned vehicles

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.920
had really sort of proven their worth.

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.120
They would come to be incredibly like, you know,

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.960
just blow people out of the, blow people's minds

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.800
in terms of their additional capabilities,

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.640
the lower costs, you know, keeping, you know,

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.720
soldiers out of harm's way.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.520
And of course they raised other problems

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.680
and considerations that I think we're still wrestling with,

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:21.200
but that was even before that they had this priority.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.760
We would not be sitting here today

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.560
if Congress in 2000 had not said, let's bring this about.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.120
So they already had that vision, actually.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.080
I didn't know about that.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.760
So for people who don't know the DARPA challenges

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:36.360
is the events that were just kind of like

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:39.680
these seemingly small scale challenges

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.840
that brought together some of the smartest roboticists

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.680
in the world.

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:45.520
And that somehow created enough of a magic

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:50.520
where ideas flourished, both engineering and scientific,

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.720
that eventually then was the catalyst

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.360
for creating all these different companies

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.240
that took on the challenge.

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.840
Some failed, some succeeded,

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:01.080
some are still fighting the good fight.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.480
And that somehow just that little bit of challenge

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.440
was the essential spark of progress

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.880
that now resulted in this beautiful up and down wave

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:15.200
of hype and profit and all this kind of weird dance

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:18.120
where the B word, billions of dollars,

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:21.160
have been thrown around and we still don't know.

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.400
And the T word, trillions of dollars

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.720
in terms of transformative effects of autonomous vehicles.

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.400
And all that started from DARPA

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:31.360
and that initial vision of, I guess as you're saying,

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:35.360
of automating part of the military supply chain.

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:36.880
I did not know that, that's interesting.

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:39.960
So they had the same kind of vision for the military

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:43.360
as we're not talking about a vision for the civilian,

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.760
whether it's trucking or whether it's autonomous vehicle,

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:48.400
sort of a ride sharing kind of application.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.880
Yeah, I mean, what an incredible spark, right?

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:57.760
And just the story of what it produced, right?

01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:01.280
I mean, your own work on self-driving, right?

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.080
I mean, you've studied it as an academic, right?

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.440
How many great researchers and minds have been harnessed

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.320
by this outcome of that spark, right?

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.160
And I think this is sort of theoretically about technology,

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.000
right?

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.880
This is what makes it so great is that,

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.440
this is what makes us human in my opinion, right?

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:21.320
Is that you conceive of something in your mind

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.560
and then you bring it into reality, right?

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:26.520
I mean, that's what is so great about it.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.840
Sometimes you're too dumb to realize how difficult it is,

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:34.840
so you take it off, and then eventually you're in too deep.

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.760
So you might as well solve the problem.

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:41.360
Well, and maybe we're in that situation right now

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:44.360
with self-driving, and so let me throw this out there.

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.320
I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on it,

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.160
but truck drivers always ask me, like, is this for real?

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:53.480
Like, is this really, it's harder than they think, right?

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:55.760
And they can't really do this.

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:59.320
And at first I was like, look,

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:01.560
this is like the defense department

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:04.320
and like basically the top computer science

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:07.760
and robotics departments in the world.

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:13.760
And now Silicon Valley with billions of dollars in funding

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.440
and just, you know, some of the smartest, hardest working,

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:21.240
most visionary people focused on what is clearly,

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:24.680
you know, a gigantic market, right?

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:26.800
And what I tell them is like,

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:31.240
if self-driving vehicles don't happen,

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:34.680
I think this will be the biggest technology failure story

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.720
in human history.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:39.920
I don't know of anything else that is just galvanized.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.840
I mean, you've had people in garages

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.040
or weird inventors work on things their whole lives

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:45.960
and come really close, and it never happens

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:48.200
and it's a great failure story, right?

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.360
But never have we had like whole,

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.000
I mean, we're talking about GM, right?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.480
And these are not, you know,

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.040
these are not tech companies, right?

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.240
These are industrial giants, right?

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.480
What were in the 20th century,

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:03.280
the pinnacle of industrial production in the world

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.320
in human history, right?

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.320
And they're focused on it now.

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:11.400
So if we don't pull this off, it's like, wow.

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.600
It's fascinating to think about.

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.560
I've never thought of it that way.

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.440
There was a mass hysteria on a level

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.680
in terms of excitement and hype

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.360
on a level that's probably unparalleled

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.680
in technology space.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:25.400
Like I've seen that kind of hysteria

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.440
just studying history

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.800
when you talk about military conflict.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.720
So we often wage war with a dream of making a better world

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:34.840
and then realize it costs trillions of dollars.

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.840
And then we step back and like, and go, wait a minute,

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.160
what do we actually get for this?

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.640
But in the space of technology,

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:44.120
it seems like all these kinds of large efforts

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:45.640
have paid off.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.120
This, you're right.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:51.400
It seems like, it seems like giving GM and Ford

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:54.560
and all these companies now are a little bit like,

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:59.160
hey, or Toyota and even Tesla, like,

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.840
are we sure about this?

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:02.680
Yeah.

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.360
And it's fascinating to think about

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.120
when you tell the story of this,

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:10.200
this could be one of the big first perhaps,

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:14.160
but by far the biggest failures of the dream

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.240
in the space of technology.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:17.920
That's really interesting to think about.

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.880
I was a skeptic for a long time

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.880
because of the human factor,

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.160
because for business to work in the space,

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.320
you have to work with humans

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:29.240
and you have to work with humans at every level.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:30.520
So in the truck driving space,

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.480
you have to work with the truck driver,

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:34.320
but you also have to work with a society

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:37.000
that has a certain conception of what driving means.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.760
And also you have to have work with businesses

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:43.760
that are not used to this extreme level of technology,

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:48.600
you know, in the basic operation of their business.

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.120
So I thought it would be really difficult

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.200
to move to autonomous vehicles in that way.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.240
But then I realized that there's certain companies

01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:00.320
that are just willing to take big risks and really innovate.

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:04.360
I think the first impressive company to me was Waymo

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:07.520
or what used to be the Google self-driving car.

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:11.120
And I saw, okay, here's a company

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.520
that's willing to really think long-term

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.640
and really try to solve this problem,

01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.280
hire great engineers.

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:22.640
Then I saw Tesla with Mobileye when they first had,

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.760
I thought actually Mobileye is the thing that impressed me.

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.160
When I sat down, I thought,

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.400
because I'm a computer vision person,

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:33.400
I thought there's no way a system could keep me in lane

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:36.680
long enough for it to be a pleasant experience for me.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.120
So from a computer vision perspective,

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.520
I thought there'd be too many failures,

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:42.280
it'd be really annoying, it'd be a gimmick, a toy,

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.840
it wouldn't actually create a pleasant experience.

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:47.520
And when I first was gotten to Tesla with Mobileye,

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:49.080
the initial Mobileye system,

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:52.560
it actually held to lane for quite a long time

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.560
to where I could relax a little bit.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.080
And it was a really pleasant experience.

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.600
I couldn't exactly explain why it's pleasant

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:01.080
because it's not like I still have to really pay attention,

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.200
but I can relax my shoulders a little bit.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.000
I can look around a little bit more.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.560
And for some reason, I was really reducing the stress.

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.800
And then over time,

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:15.760
Tesla, with a lot of the revolutionary stuff they're doing

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.440
on the machine learning space,

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:22.000
made me believe that there's opportunities here to innovate,

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.840
to come up with totally new ideas.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.720
Another very sad story that I was really excited about

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.520
is Cadillac's Super Cruise system.

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:32.880
It is a sad story because I think I vaguely read it in the news,

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:36.120
they just said they're discontinuing Super Cruise.

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:39.040
But it's a nice, innovative way

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.320
of doing driver attention monitoring

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.800
and also doing lane keeping.

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:47.400
Just innovation could solve this in ways we don't predict.

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:49.600
And same with in the trucking space,

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.800
it might not be as simple as journalists envisioned

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.760
a few years ago where everything's just automated.

01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:00.360
It might be gradually helping out the truck drivers

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:03.440
some ways that make their life more efficient,

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:06.440
more effective, more pleasant,

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:09.320
make the, remove some of the inefficiencies

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:12.560
that we've been talking about in totally innovative ways.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:14.920
And that, I still have that dream

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:18.760
that I believe to solve the fully autonomous driving problem

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.480
we're still many years away.

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.960
But on the way to solving that problem,

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.080
it feels like there could be,

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:29.440
if there's bold risk takers and innovators in the space,

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.920
there's an opportunity to come up with

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:36.200
like subtle technologies that make all the difference.

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:38.920
That's actually just what I realized

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.960
is sometimes little design decisions make all the difference.

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.160
It's the Blackberry versus the iPhone.

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.840
Why is it that you have a glass

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.920
and you're using your finger for all of the work

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.320
versus the buttons makes all the difference?

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:57.240
This idea that now that you have a giant screen

01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:00.160
so that every part of the experience

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:02.000
is now a digital experience,

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.120
so you can have things like apps that change everything.

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.640
You can't, when you first thinking about

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:10.160
do I want a keyboard or not on a smartphone,

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:13.400
you think it's just the keyboard decision.

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:17.880
But then you later realize by removing the keyboard,

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:21.960
you're enabling a whole ecosystem of technologies

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.160
that are inside the phone.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.520
And now you're making the smartphone into a computer.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:30.520
And that same way, who knows how you can transform trucks.

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.560
By like automating some parts of it,

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:36.520
maybe adding some displays,

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:37.680
maybe allows you to,

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:40.840
maybe giving the truck driver some control

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.200
in the supply chain to make decisions,

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:44.520
all those kinds of things.

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:45.840
Yeah.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.000
So I don't know.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.680
So where are you on the spectrum of hope

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.320
for the role of automation in trucking?

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.600
I think automation is inevitable.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:04.600
And again, I think this is really going to be transformative.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:06.160
And it's going to be,

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:09.640
I've studied the history of trucking technology

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:10.960
as much as I can.

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.920
There's not a lot of great stuff written

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:15.000
and you kind of have to,

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.880
there isn't a lot of data and places to know

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:19.240
sort of volumes of stuff and how they're changing, et cetera.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:24.240
But the big revolutionary changes in trucking

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:27.960
are because of constellations of factors.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.640
It's not just one thing, right?

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.280
So Daimler builds a motorized truck in,

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:35.360
I think it's 1896, right?

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.600
Intercity's trucking.

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.160
So basically what they use that truck for

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.840
is just to swap out horses, right?

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:42.960
They basically do the same thing.

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.680
The service doesn't really change.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.800
And then World War I really spurs the development

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.720
of sort of bigger, larger trucks,

01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:54.640
like spreads air-filled tires.

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:57.880
And then we start paving roads, right?

01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.480
And paved roads, right?

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.960
Air-filled tires.

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:04.440
And the internal combustion engine,

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:05.720
now you got a winning mix.

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:09.360
Now it met with demand for people who wanted to get out

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:12.160
from under the thumb of the railroads, right?

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.720
So there was all of this pent-up demand

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:18.360
to get cheaper freight from the countryside

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.800
into cities and between cities

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.800
that typically had to go by rail.

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:25.840
And so now, you know, 40 years

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:28.320
after that internal combustion engine,

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.960
it becomes this absolutely essential, right?

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:34.320
This necessary, but not sufficient piece of technology

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:38.840
to create the modern trucking industry in the 1930s.

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:41.640
And I think self-driving is gonna be,

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.640
self-driving trucks are gonna be part of that.

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:47.680
And the idea, I guess we credit Jeff Bezos.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:52.280
The idea is, you know, okay, so Sam Walton,

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:54.040
if we can do it like a slight tangent

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:57.040
on sort of the importance of trucking to business strategy

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.560
and sort of how it has transformed our world.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.200
The central insight that Sam Walton had

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.880
that made him the giant that he was

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:10.200
in influencing the way that so many people get stuff

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:12.320
was a trucking insight.

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:17.320
And so if you look at the way that he developed his system,

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:19.360
you build a distribution center

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:22.120
and then you ring it with stores.

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.720
Those stores are never further out

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:25.960
from that distribution center

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:30.080
than a human driven truck can drive back and forth

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:30.920
in one day.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.960
And so rather than the way all of his competitors

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.000
were doing it with sending trucks all over the place

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.560
and having people sleep overnight

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:43.320
and sort of making the trucking service fit

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:45.240
where they had stores,

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:49.400
he designed the layout of the stores, right?

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.440
To fit what trucks could do.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:54.000
And so transportation and logistics, right?

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.400
Become Walmart's edge, right?

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.440
And allows them to dominate the space.

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.720
That's the challenge that Amazon has.

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:05.800
Now they've mastered the digital part of it, right?

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.560
And now they got to figure out like,

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:11.680
how do we dominate the actual physical movement

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:14.320
that complements that?

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.760
Others are obviously gonna follow,

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.880
but the capabilities of these trucks

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:20.520
is completely different

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:22.920
than the capability of a human driven truck.

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:25.600
So if you're Smith packing, right?

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:30.320
And you've got a bunch of meat in a warehouse

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.880
and it's going to grocery distribution centers,

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:37.360
you have that trucker probably come in the night before

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:41.520
and you make him wait so that he has a full 10 hour break,

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.760
which is what the law requires

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:45.760
so that he can get to the furthest reaches

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:48.320
that he can of one of those stores, right?

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.680
So he can drive his full 11 hours and bring that meat

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:53.360
so it doesn't have to sit overnight

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.560
in that refrigerated trailer, right?

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.520
And so their system is based on that.

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:02.240
Now what happens when that truck can now travel

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:04.200
two times as far, right?

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.920
Three times as far.

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:08.880
Now you don't need the warehouses where they were.

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:11.760
Now you can go super lean with your inventory.

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:14.520
Instead of having meat here, meat there, meat there,

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.280
you can put it all right here.

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.200
And if it's cheap enough,

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.440
substitute those transportation costs

01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:22.440
for all that warehousing costs, right?

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.720
So this is going to remake landscapes

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:29.280
in the same way that big box supply chains did, right?

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:32.960
And then of course, the further compliment of that is,

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:37.640
how do you then get it to two people at their door, right?

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.520
And the big box supply chain,

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:44.320
it moves very few items in really large quantities

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.400
to very few locations, pretty slowly, right?

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:52.640
E-commerce aspires to do something

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.640
completely different, right?

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:57.680
Move huge varieties of things in small quantities,

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:01.080
virtually everywhere as fast as possible, right?

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:05.560
And so that is like that intercity trucking

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:10.360
under the, in the era of railroad monopolies, right?

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:14.240
The demand for that is potentially enormous, right?

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.840
And so there's such a,

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:20.440
so right now I think a lot of the business plans

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:22.240
for sort of automated trucks, right?

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:24.400
And sort of the way that the journalistic accounts

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:27.200
portray it is like, okay, if we swap out a human

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.280
for a computer, what are the labor costs per mile?

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.800
And like, oh, here's the profitability

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:34.200
of self-driving trucks, uh-uh.

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.320
Like this is transformative technology.

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:39.040
We're going to change the way we get stuff.

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.920
So we could actually get a lot more trucks, period,

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:43.200
with like, with autonomous trucks,

01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:45.840
because they would enable a very different kind

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:47.520
of transportation networks, you think?

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:50.200
Yeah, here's, and this is where it's like, uh-oh.

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:54.640
Like, yeah, so we really thought

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:56.560
we were going to be electrifying trucks.

01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:59.040
If they're going twice as far,

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.480
if they're moving three times as much,

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:03.320
if they're going three times as far, right?

01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:06.520
What does that mean for how far we are behind on batteries,

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:07.360
right?

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.120
We've got sort of these, you know, ideas about like,

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.360
man, we, you know, here's how far,

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.800
how close we could get to meet this demand.

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:15.040
That demand is going to radically change, right?

01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.320
These trucks are, you know,

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.520
so then we've got to think about, all right,

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:20.760
if it's not batteries, you know,

01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:22.640
how are we, how are we powering these things?

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:25.320
And how many of them are they're going to be?

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:28.480
Like right now we've got 5 million containers

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:33.480
that move from LA and Long Beach to Chicago on rail.

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:38.560
Rail is three or four times at least more efficient

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:42.640
than trucks in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:44.720
And on that lane, it varies a lot,

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.200
depending on demand,

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:49.040
but maybe rail has a 20% advantage in cost,

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:52.120
maybe 25%, but it's a couple of days slower.

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:54.600
So now you cut the cost of that truck,

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:57.480
transportation per mile by 30%.

01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:58.960
Now it's cheaper than rail

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:02.520
and it gets the stuff there five days faster than rail.

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.400
How many millions of containers

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.480
are going to leave LA and Long Beach

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:08.840
on self-driving trucks and go to Chicago?

01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:10.920
And it might look very much like a train

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:14.080
if we go with a platooning solution,

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:18.560
you have these rows of like,

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:20.440
imagine like rows of like 10,

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:23.000
like dozens of trucks or like hundreds of trucks,

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.200
like some absurd situation,

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:28.120
just going from LA to Chicago,

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:31.760
just this train but taking up a highway.

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:34.800
I mean, this is probably a good place

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:38.120
to talk about various scenarios.

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.280
Before we get there,

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.760
can I just make one interesting observation

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.840
that I made as a driver.

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.600
When you're in a truck, you're up higher,

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:50.040
so you can see further and you can see the traffic patterns.

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:54.120
And cars move in packs.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.480
I'm sure there's academic research on this, right?

01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:57.320
But they move in packs.

01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:59.640
They kind of bunch up behind a slower car

01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:01.200
and then a bunch of them break free.

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.880
And this is sort of on almost free flowing highways.

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:05.160
They kind of move in packs

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.520
and you can kind of see them in the truck.

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:09.240
So, rather than platoons,

01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:11.960
we might have like hives of trucks, right?

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:13.960
So you have like 20 trucks moving

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:15.960
in some coordinated fashion, right?

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:18.480
And then maybe the self-driving cars are,

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:20.040
because people don't like to be around them

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:21.400
or whatever it is, right?

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:24.120
You might have a pod of 20 self-driving cars

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:26.560
sort of moving in a packet behind them.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.880
This is what if the aliens came down

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:30.960
or were just observing cars,

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:34.680
which is one of the sort of prevalent characteristics

01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:37.400
of human civilization is there seems to be these cars

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:40.320
like moving around that would do this kind of analysis

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:42.560
of like, huh, what's the interesting clustering

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.760
of situations here?

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:48.720
Especially with autonomous vehicles, I like this.

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:52.920
Okay, so what technologically speaking do you see

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:55.280
are the different scenarios

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:58.200
of increasing automation in trucks?

01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.920
What are some ideas that you think about?

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:04.920
For the most part, I have no influence

01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:06.440
on sort of what these ideas were.

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:11.240
So what the project was that I did was I said,

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:12.520
technology is created by people.

01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:16.160
They solve for X and they have some conception

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.680
of what they wanna do.

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:19.960
And that's where we should start in sort of thinking

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:22.160
about what the impacts might be.

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:25.200
So I went and I talked to everybody I could find

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:28.640
who was thinking about developing a self-driving truck.

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:31.280
And the question was essentially,

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:32.800
what are you trying to build?

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:35.680
Like, what do you envision this thing doing?

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:40.440
It turned out that for a lot of them was an afterthought.

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:43.800
They knew the sort of technological capabilities

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.400
that a self-driving vehicle would have.

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.200
And those were the problems that they were tackling.

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:50.320
They were engineers and computer scientists and-

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:53.560
Oh, robotics people, I love you so much.

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:56.720
This is the, I could talk forever about this,

01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:58.320
but yes, there's a technology problem.

01:30:58.320 --> 01:30:59.680
Let's focus on that and we'll figure out

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:02.400
the actual impact on society,

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:03.800
how it's actually going to be applied,

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:05.600
how it's actually going to be integrated

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:08.280
from a policy and from a human perspective,

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:09.840
from a business perspective later.

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.560
First, let's solve the technology problem.

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:14.400
That's not how life works, friends, but okay, I'm sorry.

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:17.040
Yeah, yeah, so I mean, I'm sure you know

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.000
the division of labor in these companies, right?

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.320
There's sort of a business development side,

01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:22.920
and then there's the engineering side, right?

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:24.440
And the engineers are like, oh my God,

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:26.360
what are these business development people?

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:30.120
Why are they involved in this process?

01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:34.440
So I ended up sort of coming up with a few different ideas

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.800
that people seem to be batting around,

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:39.600
and then really tried to zero in

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:42.720
on a layman's understanding of the limitations, right?

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:47.520
And it turns out that's really obvious and quite simple.

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:49.960
Highway driving's a lot simpler, right?

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:53.560
So the plan is simplify the problem, right?

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:56.200
And focus on highways because city driving

01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:59.840
is so much more complicated.

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:04.280
So from that, I came up with basically six scenarios,

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.640
actually I came up with five

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.640
that the developers were talking about.

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:11.400
And then one that I thought was a good idea

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:16.400
that I had read about, I think in like 2013 or 2014,

01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:18.280
which was actually something

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:20.520
that the US military was looking at.

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:23.120
I actually first heard about the idea

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:27.640
of this kind of automation, at least in sketched out form

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:30.800
in like 2011, I guess it was, with Peloton,

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:33.960
which was this sort of early technology entrant

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.920
into the trucking industry,

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:39.240
which was working on platooning trucks.

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:41.920
And all they were doing was a cooperative,

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.560
adaptive cruise control, as they came to call it.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:48.240
And we ended up on a panel together.

01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:52.000
And it's kind of interesting because I was on that panel

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.680
because I was thinking about how we got the best return

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:58.360
on investment for fuel-efficient technologies.

01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:01.960
And if it's cool, I'll sort of set this up because it does,

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:04.800
it comes into sort of the story of some of these scenarios.

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:09.280
So when I studied the drivers,

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:14.280
you had this like complete difference in the driving tasks,

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:18.880
like we were talking about before with long haul and city.

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:23.120
And you're not paid in the city, you've got congestion,

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:27.920
the turns are tight, there's lots of pedestrians,

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:29.880
all the things that self-driving trucks don't like,

01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:31.920
truckers don't like, right?

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:35.680
And they're not paid, there's lots of waiting time.

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:37.880
And then in the highway, they get to cruise,

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.760
they're getting paid, they have control,

01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:42.000
they go at their own pace, they're making money,

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.160
they're happy.

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:46.000
Well, it turned out, I guess it was around 2010,

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000
this is still when we were thinking about regenerative braking

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.440
and hybrid trucks being sort of like the solution.

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:58.280
The problems with them and the advantages also split

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.960
on what I was thinking of kind of the rural-urban divide

01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:01.800
at that time, right?

01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:05.120
So like you got the regenerative braking, right?

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:08.400
You can make the truck lighter, you can keep it local, right?

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:11.640
You don't get any benefit from that hybrid electric

01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:16.640
in the rural highway, you want aerodynamics, right?

01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:20.440
There, you want low rolling resistance tires

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:23.120
and these super aerodynamic sleek trucks, right?

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:26.200
Where we know with off-the-shelf technology today,

01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:27.760
we could double the fuel economy,

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:30.360
more than double the fuel economy of the typical truck

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:32.280
in that highway segment,

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:34.600
if we segmented the duty cycle, right?

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:36.560
And so in the urban environment,

01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:37.760
you want a clean burning truck,

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:40.280
so you're not giving kids asthma, you want it lighter,

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:45.280
so it's not destroying those less strong pavements, right?

01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:48.360
You can make tighter turns, you don't need a sleeper cab

01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:49.280
because the driver, you know,

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:51.240
hopefully is getting home at night, right?

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:54.160
In the long haul, you want that super aerodynamic stuff.

01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:55.760
Now that doesn't get you anything in the city

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.360
and in fact, it causes all kinds of problems

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:58.520
because you turn too tight,

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.080
you crunch up all the aerodynamics

01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:02.960
that connect the tractor and the trailer.

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:05.360
So the idea that I had was like,

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:08.160
okay, what if we deliberately segmented it?

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:12.520
Like what if we created these drop lots outside cities

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:16.640
where, you know, a local city driver who's paid by the hour

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:18.960
kind of runs these trailers out once they're loaded,

01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:19.800
you know, it doesn't sit there

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:20.840
and wait while it's being loaded,

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:23.120
they drop off a trailer, they go pick up one that's loaded,

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.200
they run it out, when it's loaded, they call them

01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:27.280
and they just run them out there and stage them.

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:30.200
It's like an Uber driver, but for truck loads.

01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:32.040
Yeah, and we have like intermodal.

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:33.680
We have like, we have basically,

01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:35.720
this would be the equivalent of like rail

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:37.160
to truck intermodal, right?

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:38.760
So you put it on the rail and then, you know,

01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:40.520
a trucker picks it up and delivers it, right?

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:42.120
So instead of having the rail,

01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:44.920
you'd have these super aerodynamic, hopefully platoons

01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:48.800
or what was at the time was called long combination vehicles,

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.040
which is basically two trailers connected together, right?

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:54.080
Because this is like a huge productivity gain, right?

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:56.240
And then instead of that driver like me,

01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:57.760
I would pick up something in upstate New York,

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:00.000
drive to Michigan, drive to Alabama, you know,

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.840
drive to Wisconsin, drive to Florida, you know,

01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:03.240
I get home every two weeks.

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:08.040
If I'm just running that, you know, that double trailer,

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:09.560
I might be able to go back and forth

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:11.720
from Chicago to Detroit, right?

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:14.400
Take two trailers there, pick up two trailers going back,

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:16.160
right, and be home every night.

01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:17.640
Now the problem with that at the time,

01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:20.400
or one of them was, you know, bridge weights.

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:23.120
So you can't, not all bridges can handle

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.360
that much weight on them.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:26.640
They can't handle these doubles, right?

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:28.560
And some places can, some places can't.

01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:31.680
And so this platooning idea was happening at the same time

01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:33.200
and we ended up on the same panel

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:36.680
and the founders were like, hey, so what's it like

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:39.040
to follow really close behind another truck,

01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:41.320
which was kind of the stage that they were at was like,

01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:43.400
you know, what's that experience gonna be like?

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.920
And I was like, truckers aren't gonna like it.

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:47.720
You know, I mean, that's just like,

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:49.760
the cardinal rule is following distance.

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:52.960
Like that's the one you really shouldn't violate, right?

01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:54.920
And when you're out on the road, like you have that trucker

01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:58.200
like right on your ass, you know, people remember that.

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:01.280
They don't remember the 99.9% of truckers

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.200
that are not on their ass, you know,

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:05.360
like they're very careful about that.

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:07.560
But when the trucks are really close together,

01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:10.120
there's benefits in terms of aerodynamics.

01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:11.600
So that's the idea.

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:16.520
So like if you want to get some benefits of a platoon,

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:17.800
you want that to be close together,

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:20.240
but you're saying that's very uncomfortable for truckers.

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:22.200
Yeah, so I mean, I think that ended up at the,

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:25.320
I mean, Peloton I think is sort of winding down

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:27.440
their work on this.

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:31.040
And I think that ended up being still an open question.

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:33.480
Like, and I had a chance to interview a couple of drivers

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:36.080
who at least one, maybe two of which

01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:38.800
had actually driven in their platoons.

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:41.320
And I got completely different experiences.

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:43.400
Some of them were like, it's really cool.

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:46.520
You know, I'm like in communication with that other driver.

01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:48.240
You know, I can see on a screen

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:51.440
what's out the front of his truck.

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:53.960
And then some were like, it's too close.

01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:55.480
And it might be one of those things that's just,

01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:58.000
takes an adjustment to sort of get there.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.960
So you get the aerodynamic advantage, which saves fuel.

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:03.400
There's some problems though, right?

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:07.040
So, you're getting that aerodynamic advantage

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:08.400
because there's a low pressure system

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:10.440
in front of that following truck.

01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:14.520
But the engine is designed with higher pressure

01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:16.000
feeding that engine, right?

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.160
So there are sort of adjustments that you need to make.

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:21.840
And, you know, still the benefits are there.

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:22.920
That's one scenario.

01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:24.080
And that's just the automation

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:26.880
of that acceleration and braking.

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:29.600
Starsky, which, you know,

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:32.200
probably a lot of your listeners heard about

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:36.240
was working on another scenario, which was,

01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:38.160
you know, to solve that local problem

01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:40.440
was gonna do teleoperation, right?

01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:41.860
Sort of remote piloting.

01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:44.240
I had the chance to, you know,

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:46.320
sort of watch them do that.

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:49.640
You know, they drove a truck in Florida

01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:53.640
from San Francisco in one of their offices.

01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:54.840
That was really interesting.

01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:55.680
And then-

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:56.520
In case it's not clear,

01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.480
teleoperation means you're controlling the truck remotely

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:00.800
like it's a video game.

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:05.000
So you've gotten a chance to witness it.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.840
Does it actually work?

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.840
Yeah, I mean, so it's-

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:10.200
What are the pros and cons?

01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:12.680
You know, one of the problems with doing research like this,

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:16.520
with all these Silicon Valley folks are the NDAs.

01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:18.280
Oh, right, right.

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:20.600
So, you know, I don't know what I'm able to say

01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:21.960
about sort of watching it,

01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:24.160
but obviously they're public statements

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:25.520
about sort of what the challenges are, right?

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:27.680
And it's about the latency

01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:31.200
and the ability to sort of in real time.

01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:32.120
There's challenges there.

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:33.640
Let me say one thing.

01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:36.400
So I'm talking to the, you know,

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.440
I've talked to the Waymo CTO.

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:39.760
I'm in conversations with them.

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:41.520
I'm talking to the head of trucking,

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:45.600
Boris Softman in next month, actually.

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:48.160
I'm a huge fan of his because he was,

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:49.360
I think the founder of Anki,

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.480
which is a toy robotics company.

01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:55.680
So I love cute, I love human robot interaction.

01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:58.880
And he created one of the most effective

01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:02.160
and beautiful toy robots.

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:07.360
Anyway, I keep complaining to them on email privately

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:12.000
that there's way too much marketing in these conversations

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000
and not enough showing off both the challenge

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.880
and the beauty of the engineering efforts.

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:18.200
And that seems to be the case

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:21.320
for a lot of these Silicon Valley tech companies.

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:24.240
They put up this, you're talking about NDAs.

01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:29.680
For some reason, rightfully wrongfully,

01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:31.040
because there's been so much hype

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:33.160
and so much money being made,

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:38.160
they don't see the upside in being transparent

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:43.320
and educating the public about how difficult the problem is.

01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:45.560
It's much more effective for them to say,

01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:46.760
we have everything solved.

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:47.880
This will change everything.

01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:49.440
This will change society as we know it

01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:51.160
and just kind of wave their hands

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:53.080
as opposed to exploring together

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.400
like these different scenarios.

01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:55.920
What are the pros and cons?

01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:57.720
Why is it really difficult?

01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:00.040
You know, what are the gray areas

01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:01.800
of where it works and doesn't?

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:03.960
What's the role of the human in this picture

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:06.560
of both the sort of the operators

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.080
and the other humans on the road?

01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:11.600
All of that, which are fascinating human problems,

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:13.040
fascinating engineering problems

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:15.400
that I wish we could have a conversation about

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:19.200
as opposed to always feeling like it's just marketing talk.

01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:22.560
Because a lot of what we're talking about now,

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:26.760
even you with having private conversations under NDA,

01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:28.880
you still don't have the full picture

01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:31.320
of how difficult this problem is.

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:35.080
One of the big questions I've had, still have,

01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:37.040
is how difficult is driving?

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:41.080
I disagree with Elon Musk and Jim Keller on this point.

01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:44.480
I have a sense that driving is really difficult.

01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:47.720
You know, the task of driving, just broadly.

01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:49.480
This is like philosophy talk.

01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:54.360
How much intelligence is required to drive a car?

01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:58.080
So from like a Jim Keller,

01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:00.360
who used to be the head of autopilot,

01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:03.120
the idea is that it's just a collision avoidance problem.

01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:04.360
It's like billiard balls.

01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:07.000
It's like you have to convert the drive.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.640
You have to do some basic perception,

01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:13.120
a computer vision to convert driving into a game of pool.

01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:15.920
And then you just have to get everything into a pocket.

01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:19.200
To me, there just seems to be some game theoretic dance,

01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:21.880
combined with the fact that people's life is at stake.

01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:24.520
And then when people die at the hands of a robot,

01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:26.560
the reaction is going to be much more complicated.

01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:28.920
So all of that, but that's still an open question.

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:31.920
And the cool thing is all of these companies

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:34.160
are struggling with this question

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:38.000
of how difficult is it to solve this problem sufficiently,

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.880
such that we can build a business on top of it

01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:41.720
and have a product that's going to make

01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:42.920
a huge amount of money

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:46.680
and compete with the manually driven vehicles.

01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:49.680
And so their teleoperation from Starsky's

01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:50.800
is a really interesting idea.

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:54.840
How much can, I mean, there's a few autonomous vehicle

01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:57.840
companies that tried to integrate teleoperation

01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.000
in the picture.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:02.200
Can we reduce some of the costs

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:04.640
while still having reliability,

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:09.640
like catch when the vehicle fails

01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:11.680
by having teleoperation?

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:12.840
It's an open question.

01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:17.000
So that's for you scenario number two,

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.080
is to use teleoperation as part of the picture.

01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:22.240
Yeah, let me follow up on that question

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:23.360
of how hard driving is,

01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:26.560
because this becomes a big question for researchers

01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:28.520
who are thinking about labor market impacts, right?

01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:31.520
Because we start from a perspective

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:35.040
of what's hard or easy for humans, right?

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:38.800
And so, if you were to look at truck driving

01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:41.280
prior to a lot, and this has been a lot of thinking

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:45.040
and debate in academic research circles

01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:47.760
around sort of how you estimate labor impacts, right?

01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.000
What these models look like.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.160
And a lot of it is about how automatable is a job.

01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.960
Object recognition, really easy for people, right?

01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:56.400
Really hard for computers.

01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:59.040
And so there's a whole bunch of things

01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:04.040
that truck drivers do that we see as super easy,

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:07.400
and as it would have been characterized 10 years ago,

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:10.920
routine, and it's not for a computer, right?

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:14.000
It turns out to be something that we do naturally

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.800
that is sort of cutting edge, right?

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:18.240
Computer science.

01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:20.480
So on the teleoperation question,

01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:24.240
I think this is an more interesting one

01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:28.040
than people would like to sort of let on, I think, publicly.

01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:32.160
There are gonna be problems, right?

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.680
And this is one of the complexities

01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:35.480
of sort of putting these things out in the world.

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:37.880
And if you see the real world of trucking,

01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:40.920
you realize, wow, it's rough.

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:42.480
There are dirt lots, there's gravel,

01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:44.720
there's salt and ice and cold weather,

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:46.720
and there's equipment that just gets left out

01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:47.680
in the middle of nowhere,

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:49.600
and the brakes don't get maintained,

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.560
and somebody was supposed to service something,

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:53.200
and they didn't, you know?

01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:56.040
And so you imagine, okay, we've got this vehicle

01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:57.160
that can drive itself,

01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:59.080
which is gonna require a whole lot of sensors

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:02.160
to tell it that the doors are still closed,

01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:03.640
and the trailer's still hooked up,

01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:05.760
and each of the tires has adequate pressure,

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:09.120
and any number of probably hundreds of sensors

01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:11.920
that are gonna be sort of relaying information.

01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:16.920
And one of them, after 500,000 miles or whatever, goes out.

01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:20.320
Now, do we have some fleet of technicians

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:22.480
sort of continually cruising the highways

01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:25.160
and sort of servicing these things as they do what?

01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:27.280
Pull themselves off to the side of the road

01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:30.160
and say, I've got a sensor fault, I'm pulling over,

01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:33.000
or maybe there's some level of safety-critical faults

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.320
or whatever it might be.

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:40.680
So that suggests that there might be a role

01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:43.800
for teleoperation, even with self-driving.

01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:47.960
And when I push people on it in the conversations,

01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:49.400
they all are like, yeah,

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:52.040
we kind of have that on the bottom of the list.

01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:56.840
Figure out how to rescue a truck on the to-do list

01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:00.160
after solving the self-driving question is like,

01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:02.640
yeah, what do we do with the problems?

01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:04.960
I mean, we can imagine, all right,

01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:08.480
we have some protocol that the truck is not,

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:11.600
realizes the system says not safe for operation,

01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:13.200
pull to the side.

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.280
Good, you have a crash,

01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:17.080
but now you've got a truck stranded on the side of the road.

01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:19.960
You're gonna send out somebody to calibrate things

01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:21.640
and check out what's going on.

01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.200
That sounds like expensive labor.

01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:24.840
It sounds like downtime.

01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:26.880
It sounds like the kind of things that shippers

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:29.240
don't like to happen to their freight

01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:31.000
in a just-in-time world.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.320
And so wouldn't it be great if you could just sort of

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:37.680
loop your way into the controls of that truck and say,

01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:38.960
all right, we've got a sensor out,

01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:40.640
says that the tire's bad,

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:43.320
but I can see visually from the camera, looks fine.

01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:45.800
I'm gonna drive it to our next depot,

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:48.600
maybe the next Ryder or Penske location, right?

01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:50.520
Sort of all these service locations around

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:52.680
and have a technician take a look at it.

01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:57.040
So teleoperation often gets this, you know,

01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:00.120
it's a dismissive, you know,

01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:04.040
commentary from other folks working on other scenarios.

01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:07.000
But I think it's potentially more relevant

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.880
than we hear publicly.

01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:11.760
But it's a hard problem.

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:16.760
And, you know, for me,

01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:18.560
I've gotten a chance to interact with people

01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:20.320
that take on hard problems and solve them

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:21.480
and they're rare.

01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:24.480
What Tesla has done with their data engine.

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:29.440
So I thought autonomous driving cannot be solved

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:31.320
without collecting a huge amount of data

01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:32.280
and organizing it all,

01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:34.800
not just collecting, but organizing it.

01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:37.280
And exactly what Tesla is doing now

01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:38.640
is what I thought it would be,

01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:40.600
like I couldn't see car companies doing that,

01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.200
including Tesla.

01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:44.640
And now that they're doing that, it's like, oh, okay.

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:48.160
So it's possible to take on this huge effort seriously.

01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:51.880
To me, teleoperation is another huge effort like that.

01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:56.880
It's like taking seriously what happens when it fails.

01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:00.840
What's the, in the case of Waymo for the consumer,

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:04.320
like ride sharing, what's the customer experience like?

01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:06.000
There's a bunch of videos online now

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.440
where people are like, the car fails

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:09.920
and it pulls off to the side

01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:11.600
and you call customer service

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.840
and you're basically sitting there for a long time

01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:15.000
and there's confusion.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.720
And then there's a rescue that comes and they start to drive.

01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:19.800
Just the whole experience is a mess

01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:23.400
that has a ripple effect to how you trust

01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:25.440
in the entirety of the experience.

01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:29.480
But actually taking on the problem of that failure case

01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:32.120
and revolutionizing that experience,

01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:34.440
both for trucking and for ride sharing,

01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:35.960
that's an amazing opportunity there

01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:40.120
because that feels like it would change everything.

01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:42.760
If you can reliably know when the failures happen,

01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:45.160
which they will, you have a clear plan

01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:47.800
that doesn't significantly affect the efficiency

01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:51.760
of the whole process, that could be the game changer.

01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:53.240
And if teleoperation is part of that,

01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:54.920
it could be, just like you're saying,

01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:56.480
it could be teleoperation

01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:00.160
or it could be like a fleet of rescuers that can come in,

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.440
which is a similar idea.

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:03.600
But teleoperation, obviously,

01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:07.400
that allows you to just have a network of monitors,

01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:10.720
of people monitoring this giant fleet of trucks

01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:12.800
and taking over when needed.

01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:14.720
And it's a beautiful vision of the future

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:18.160
where there's millions of robots

01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:20.360
and only thousands of humans

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:22.720
monitoring those millions of robots.

01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:27.360
That seems like a perfect dance

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:29.560
of allowing humans to do what they do best

01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:31.960
and allowing robots to do what they do best.

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:34.760
Yeah, yeah, so I mean, I think there are,

01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:36.520
and we just applied for an NSF,

01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:38.760
we didn't get anybody's watching.

01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:43.640
But with some folks from Wisconsin who do teleoperation,

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:46.560
and some of this is used for rovers and,

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:50.520
I mean, really high stakes, difficult problems.

01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:53.200
But one of the things we wanted to study were these mines

01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:55.520
and these Rio Tinto mines in Australia

01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:59.560
where they remotely pilot the trucks.

01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:01.640
And there's some autonomy, I guess,

01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:05.200
but it's overseen by a remote operator.

01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:09.400
And it's near Perth and it's quite remote.

01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:13.440
And they retrained the truck drivers

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:15.840
to be the remote operators, right?

01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:18.320
There's autonomy in the Port of Rotterdam

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:21.080
and places like that where there are jobs there.

01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:24.040
And so I think, and maybe we'll get to this later,

01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:27.160
but there's a real policy question about sort of

01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:28.800
who's gonna lose and what we do about it

01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:31.320
and whether or not there are opportunities there

01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:33.800
that maybe we need to put our thumb on the scale

01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:38.640
a little bit to make sure that there's some give back

01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:41.760
to the community that's taking the hit.

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:45.160
So for instance, if there were teleoperation centers,

01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:46.840
maybe they go in these communities

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:50.520
that we disproportionately source truck drivers from today.

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:52.000
Now, I mean, what does that mean?

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.600
It may not be the cheapest place to do it

01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:55.200
if they don't have great connectivity.

01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:58.520
And it may not be where the upper lever managers wanna be

01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:01.120
and places like that, issues like that, right?

01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:04.920
So I do think it's an interesting question

01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:09.800
both from sort of a practical scenario situation

01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:14.000
of how it's gonna work, but also from a policy perspective.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.000
So there's platoons, there's teleoperation,

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.080
and this is taking care of some of the highway driving

01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:21.200
that we're talking about.

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:22.920
Is there other ideas like,

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.920
is there other ideas, scenarios

01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:28.880
that you have for autonomous trucks?

01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:31.600
Yeah, so I mean, the most obvious one actually

01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:34.800
is just facility to facility, right?

01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:37.640
You know, it can't go everywhere,

01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:40.480
but a lot of logistics facilities

01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:42.120
are very close to interstates,

01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:46.560
and they're on big commercial roads without, you know,

01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:48.880
bikes and parked cars and all that stuff.

01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:51.720
And some of the jobs that I think are really first

01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:54.520
on the chopping block are these LTL,

01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:57.160
that less than truck load, what's called line haul, right?

01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:59.840
So these are the drivers who go from terminal to terminal

01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:01.480
with those full trailers.

01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:05.000
And those facilities are often located strategically

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.080
to avoid congestion, right?

01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:10.080
And to be in big, you know, industrial facilities.

01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:13.520
So you could imagine that being, you know,

01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:17.640
the first place you see a Waymo self-driving truck rollout

01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:21.800
might be, you know, sort of direct facility to facility

01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:25.640
for UPS or FedEx or less than truck load care.

01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:27.320
And the idea there is fully driverless,

01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:30.080
so potentially not even a driver in the truck.

01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:33.320
It's just going from facility to facility empty,

01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:34.880
zero occupancy.

01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:37.600
Yeah, and those, because that labor is expensive,

01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:39.480
you know, they don't keep those drivers out overnight.

01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:42.480
Those drivers do a run back and forth typically,

01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:45.760
or in a team go back and forth in one day.

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:49.800
So from the people you've spoken with so far,

01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:50.640
what's your sense?

01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:53.880
How far are we away from, which scenario is closest,

01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:56.920
and how far away are we from that scenario

01:52:56.920 --> 01:53:01.920
of autonomy being a big part of our trucking fleet?

01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:05.640
Most folks are focused on another scenario,

01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:07.680
which is the exit to exit, right?

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:10.880
Which looks like that urban truck ports thing

01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:12.360
that I laid out earlier.

01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:14.240
You know, so you have a human driven truck

01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:16.920
that comes out to a drop lot.

01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:19.040
It meets up with an autonomous truck.

01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:22.560
That truck then, you know, drives it on the interstate

01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:26.880
to another lot, and then a human driver, you know,

01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:28.720
picks it up.

01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:31.120
There are a couple variations maybe on that.

01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:36.040
So, or let me just run through the last two scenarios.

01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:37.720
Sure.

01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:41.280
The other thing you could do, right, is to say,

01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:43.880
all right, I've got a truck that can drive itself,

01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:46.200
and I refer to this one as autopilot,

01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:49.280
but you know, you have a human drive it out

01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:52.640
to the interstate, but rather than have that transaction

01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:55.920
where the human driven truck detaches the trailer

01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:58.800
and it gets coupled up to a self-driving truck.

01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:01.880
They just, that human driver just hops on the interstate

01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:05.600
with that truck and goes in back and goes off duty

01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:07.240
while the truck drives itself.

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:09.160
And so you have a self-driving truck

01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:11.400
that's not driverless, right?

01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:14.400
And just to clarify, because Tesla uses the term autopilot

01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:16.760
and so do airplanes, and so everybody uses the word

01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:20.640
autopilot, we're referring to essentially full autonomy,

01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:22.120
but because it's exit to exit,

01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:24.680
the truck driver is onboard the truck,

01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:26.840
but they're sleeping in the back or whatever.

01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:29.560
Yeah, and this gets to the really weedy

01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:31.160
policy questions, right?

01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:34.200
So basically for the Department of Transportation

01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:36.400
for you to be off duty for safety reasons,

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:39.400
you have to be completely relieved of all responsibility.

01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:44.400
So that truck has to not encounter a construction site

01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:48.080
or inclement weather or whatever it might be

01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:50.240
and call to you and say, hey, you know,

01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:51.400
or I mean, obviously, right,

01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:53.720
we're imagining connected vehicles as well, right?

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:56.680
So you're in a self-driving truck, you're in the back

01:54:56.680 --> 01:55:01.680
and trucks 20 miles ahead experience some problem, right?

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.600
That may require teleoperation or whatever it is, right?

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:06.640
And it signals to your truck, hey, you know,

01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:10.920
tell the driver 20 miles ahead, he's got to hop in the seat.

01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:13.080
That would mean that they're on duty according to the way

01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:14.440
that the current rules are written.

01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:15.960
They have some responsibility.

01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:18.800
And part of that is, you know, we need them to get rest,

01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:22.760
right, they need to have uninterrupted sleep.

01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:26.000
So that's what I call autopilot.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:30.760
The final scenario is one that I thought was actually

01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:34.760
the one scenario that was good for labor, you know,

01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:38.720
which I proposed is like, well, here's an idea, you know,

01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:41.680
that would be like actually good for workers.

01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:45.680
And just another brief aside here,

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.360
the history of trucking over the last, you know, 40 years,

01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:53.160
there's been a lot of technological change.

01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:55.800
So when I learned to drive the truck,

01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:58.000
I had to learn to manually shift it like I was describing.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.680
You had to read these fairly complicated, you know,

01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:03.040
big sets of laminated maps to figure out

01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:05.000
where the truck can go and where it couldn't,

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.240
which is a big deal, you know?

01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:07.880
I mean, you take these trucks on the wrong road

01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:10.520
and you're destroying a bridge or you're doing a can opener,

01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:12.880
which is where you try to drive it under a bridge too low.

01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:14.520
You've probably seen that on YouTube.

01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:17.600
If not, you know, check it out, you know, truck can opener.

01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:20.720
You know, there's some bridges that are famous for it,

01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:23.560
and there's one I think called the can opener

01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:25.000
that you can find on YouTube.

01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:30.200
And, you know, you had to log those hours like manually

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:34.240
and sort of do the math and plan your work routine.

01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:35.320
And I would do this every day.

01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:37.320
I'd say like, okay, I'm gonna get up at five.

01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:40.040
I've got to think about Buffalo and there's traffic there.

01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:43.440
So I want to be through Buffalo by 6.30, you know?

01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:47.920
And then that'll put me, you know, in Cleveland at, you know,

01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:51.880
9.30, which means I'll miss that rush hour, right?

01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:53.640
Which is gonna put me in Chicago, you know?

01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:54.960
And so you do this.

01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:59.360
And now today, you know, 15 years later,

01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:01.680
truck drivers don't have to do any of that.

01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:03.840
You know, you don't have to shift the truck.

01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:05.640
You don't have to map.

01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:09.520
You know, you can figure out the least congested route

01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:12.720
to go on and your hours of service are recorded

01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:17.120
or a good portion of them are reported automatically.

01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:19.920
All of that has been a substantial de-skilling

01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:23.360
that has, you know, put downward pressure on wages

01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:26.280
and allowed companies to kind of speed up, monitor

01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:29.880
and direct, I mean, the key technology, you know,

01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:32.560
that I did work under is satellite-linked computers.

01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:34.880
So before you could kind of go out and plan your own work

01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:36.920
and the boss really couldn't see what you were doing

01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:39.480
and push you and say, you know, you've been on break

01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:41.280
for 10 hours, why aren't you moving?

01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:43.920
You know, and you might tell them, you know,

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:46.000
cause I'm tired, you know, like I didn't sleep well.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.760
I've got to get a couple more hours.

01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:50.440
You know, they're only going to accept that so many times

01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:52.040
or at least some of those dispatchers are.

01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:56.120
So all this technology has made the job sort of, you know,

01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:58.800
de-skilled the job, you know, hurt drivers

01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:01.800
in the labor market, made the work worse.

01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:06.800
So I think the burden is really on the technologists

01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:10.000
who are like, oh, this will make truck driver jobs better

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.560
and sort of envision ways that it would.

01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:14.440
It's like, the burden is really, a proof is really

01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:16.920
on you to sort of really clearly lay out

01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:18.600
what that is going to look like

01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:22.360
because it's 30 or 40 years of history suggests

01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:25.240
that that technology into labor markets

01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:29.640
where workers are really weak and cheap is what wins

01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:31.720
that new technology doesn't help workers

01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:33.080
or raise their wages.

01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:36.600
So lowers the bar of entry in terms of skill.

01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:37.440
Yeah.

01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:40.280
That's really interesting.

01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:43.880
That's tough.

01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:46.440
That's tough to know what to do with because yeah,

01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:48.960
from a technology perspective, you want to make the life

01:58:48.960 --> 01:58:51.720
of the people doing the job today easier.

01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:52.760
Is it?

01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:54.040
Is that what you want?

01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:58.680
No, but that, like when you think about like what exactly,

01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:02.480
because the reality is you will make their life potentially

01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:06.240
a little bit easier, but that will allow the companies

01:59:06.240 --> 01:59:08.800
to then hire people that are less skilled.

01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:11.640
It'll get those people that were previously working there

01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:13.760
fired or lower wages.

01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:18.760
And so the result of this easier is a lower quality of life.

01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:20.480
Yeah.

01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:21.480
That's dark actually.

01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:23.240
I know, I'm sorry.

01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:27.160
But you were saying that was for you initially the hopeful.

01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:28.920
Oh no, so I'll get to that.

01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:31.280
But one more thing, because this is not stopping, right?

01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:32.960
And this is another interesting question

01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:34.080
about the sort of automation.

01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:38.240
And I think Uber, right, is an interesting example here,

01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:40.960
where it's like, okay, if we had self-driving trucks

01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:42.160
or self-driving cars, right?

01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:46.120
We could automate what used to be taxi service.

01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:47.040
There's a whole bunch of stuff

01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:49.600
that's already been automated, like the dispatching.

01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:53.000
So the dispatchers are already out of work in rideshare

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:54.800
and the payment is already automated, right?

01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:57.480
So you have to automate steps like this.

01:59:57.480 --> 02:00:00.840
So you have to have that initial link to dispatch the truck.

02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:04.160
You have to have the automated mapping.

02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:07.800
So we've sort of done all this incremental automation, right?

02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:11.520
That could make the truck completely driverless.

02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:14.040
There's some important things happening right now

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:15.320
with the remaining good jobs.

02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:17.440
So what you're really paying for

02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:20.040
when you get a good truck driver is, you know,

02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:22.640
like I said, you get those kind of local skills

02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:26.360
of like backing and congested traffic.

02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:28.720
Those, it's really impressive to watch

02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:30.400
and there's some value on it certainly,

02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:33.640
but it's relatively low value

02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:36.000
in the actual driving technique, right?

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:39.160
So you bump something, you know, backing into the dock.

02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:41.360
It's, you know, it might be a couple thousand dollars

02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:43.600
because you ruin a canopy or something over a dock

02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:44.600
or tear up a trailer.

02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:49.080
What you really want those highly skilled,

02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:52.120
conscientious drivers, and that's really what it is.

02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.000
And that's what computers are really good at

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.840
is about being conscientious, right?

02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:59.200
In the sense of like, they pay attention continually, right?

02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:02.280
And how I was describing those long haul segments

02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:06.600
where the driver, you know, just keeps out of the situations

02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:08.840
that could become problematic

02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:10.800
and just, they don't look at their phone.

02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:13.360
I mean, they take the job seriously and they're safe.

02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:16.000
And you can give somebody a skills test, right?

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:19.000
In, you know, as a CDL examiner, you could take them out

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:20.600
and say, all right, I need you to go around these cones

02:01:20.600 --> 02:01:24.200
and like drive safely through this school zone.

02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:27.080
But what really proves that you're a safe driver

02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:29.640
is two years without an accident, right?

02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:31.760
Because that means that day after day,

02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:34.200
hour after hour, mile after mile,

02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:36.600
you did the right thing, right?

02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:39.360
And not when it was like, oh, some situation's emerging,

02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:41.360
but just consistently over time,

02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:43.680
kept yourself out of accident situations.

02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:45.680
And you can see this with drivers who are, you know,

02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:48.000
a million or 2 million safe miles.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.320
The value of those drivers for Walmart

02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:52.760
is they don't run over minivans.

02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:54.760
The company I worked for,

02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:57.160
they ran over minivans on a regular basis.

02:01:57.160 --> 02:01:58.800
So, you know, when I was trained,

02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:00.640
they said, we kill 20 people a year.

02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:04.760
We send someone to the funeral,

02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:08.400
there's a big check involved, don't be that.

02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:10.440
You know, we don't wanna go to your funeral

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:15.240
and you don't wanna be the person who caused that funeral.

02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:18.360
Okay, so they just write that off.

02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:20.760
Okay, that's just part of the business model.

02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:23.680
Now, forward collision avoidance

02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:28.440
can, you know, basically eliminate

02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:30.960
the vast majority of those accidents.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.280
That's what the value of a really expensive

02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:35.080
conscientious driver is based on.

02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:37.120
They don't run over minivans.

02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:40.400
So as soon as you have that forward collision avoidance,

02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:42.840
what's gonna happen to the wages of those drivers?

02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:45.760
By way of a therapy session,

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:50.760
help me understand is collision avoidance,

02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:55.320
automated collision avoidance systems,

02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:57.880
are they good or bad for society?

02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:00.840
Yeah, I mean, you know, this is,

02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:02.680
they're good, right?

02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:03.520
They're good.

02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:07.600
But in, what do we do about the pain

02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:10.320
of a workforce in the short term

02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:14.040
because their wages are gonna go down

02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:17.000
because the job starts requiring less and less skill?

02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:20.640
Is there a hopeful message here

02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:22.960
where other jobs are created?

02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:25.000
So I'm, you know, I'm a sociologist, right?

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.440
So, you know, so I'm gonna think about

02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:30.280
what's the structure behind that that creates that pain,

02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:32.840
and it's ownership, right?

02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:35.600
You know, we don't call it capitalism for nothing.

02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:39.120
You know, what capitalists do is they figure out cheaper,

02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:40.760
more efficient ways to do stuff,

02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:43.320
and they use technology to do that oftentimes, right?

02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:47.680
This is the remarkable history of the last couple centuries

02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:50.680
and all the productivity gains is, you know,

02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:54.480
people who are in a competitive market saying,

02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:56.560
if I have to do it, right?

02:03:56.560 --> 02:03:57.480
I don't have a choice

02:03:57.520 --> 02:03:59.360
because, like, my competitor over there

02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:02.520
is gonna eat my lunch if I'm not on my game.

02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:04.600
I don't have a choice.

02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:06.880
I've gotta invest in this technology

02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:10.960
to, you know, make it more efficient, to make it cheaper.

02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:12.400
And what do you look for?

02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:16.160
You look for, oftentimes, you look for labor costs, right?

02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:17.560
You look for high value labor.

02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:19.840
If I can take 100, you know,

02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:21.200
a lot of these truck drivers make good money,

02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:25.440
$100,000, good benefits, vacation, you know, retirement.

02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:28.520
If I can replace them with a $35,000 worker

02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:32.440
when I'm competing with maybe a low-wage retail employer

02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:34.800
rather than some other more expensive employers

02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:37.600
for, you know, skilled blue collar workers,

02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:39.120
I'm gonna do that.

02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:41.800
And that's just, that's what we do.

02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:45.760
And so I think those are the bigger questions

02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:46.880
around this technology, right?

02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:50.240
It's like, you know, are workers gonna get screwed by this?

02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:51.640
Like, yeah, most likely.

02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:54.160
Like, that's what we do.

02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:55.960
So one of the things you say is, I mean, first of all,

02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:58.920
the numbers of workers that will feel this pain

02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:02.840
is not perhaps as large as the journalists kind of articulate,

02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:05.320
but nevertheless, the pain is real.

02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:10.320
And I guess my question here is,

02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:12.920
do you have an optimistic vision

02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:14.440
about the transformative effects

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:16.560
of autonomous trucks on society?

02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:21.440
Like, if you look 20 years from now

02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:24.560
and perhaps see, maybe 30 years from now,

02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:26.600
perhaps see these autonomous trucks

02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:30.120
doing the various parts of the scenarios you listed,

02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:33.400
and there's just hundreds of thousands of them,

02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:38.400
just like veins, like blood flowing through veins

02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:40.400
on the interstate system,

02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:46.280
what kind of world do you see that's a better world

02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:48.480
than today that involves such trucks?

02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:51.000
Yeah, can I defend myself first?

02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:53.760
I'm reading the comments right now

02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:56.080
of people, you know, of the economists who are telling me.

02:05:56.080 --> 02:05:59.520
Dear commenter, dear PhD in economics.

02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:02.600
Yes, yes, dear PhD in economics,

02:06:02.600 --> 02:06:06.880
I know that higher skilled jobs are created

02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:09.120
by technological advancement, right?

02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:11.600
I mean, there are big questions about how many of them,

02:06:11.600 --> 02:06:14.760
right, so the idea that we would create more

02:06:16.200 --> 02:06:20.520
expensive labor positions, right, with a new technology,

02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:22.600
you better check your business plan

02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:24.240
if your idea is to take, you know,

02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:27.080
a bunch of low wage labor and replace it

02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:28.920
with the same amount of high wage labor, right,

02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:31.800
so there's a question about how many of those jobs,

02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:34.120
and there's the really important social

02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:38.240
and political question of are they the same people, right,

02:06:38.240 --> 02:06:39.760
and do they live in the same places,

02:06:39.760 --> 02:06:42.520
and I think that kind of geography

02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:45.440
is a huge issue here with the impacts, right,

02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:47.600
lots of rural workers.

02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:50.080
Interesting politically, lots of red state workers, right,

02:06:50.120 --> 02:06:52.040
lots of blue state, maybe union folks

02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:54.080
who are gonna try to slow autonomy,

02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:56.000
and lots of red state, you know,

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.640
representatives in the house maybe who wanna, you know,

02:06:58.640 --> 02:07:01.560
stand up for their trucker constituents,

02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:03.320
so just to defend myself.

02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:06.720
Yeah, and to elaborate, I think economics as a field

02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:08.400
is not good at measuring the landscape

02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:10.320
of human pain and suffering,

02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:13.280
so, you know, sometimes you can forget

02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:15.480
in the numbers as real lives that are at stake.

02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:18.560
That's what I suppose sociology is better at doing.

02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:20.760
We try sometimes, sometimes.

02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:22.240
Well, the problem with, I mean,

02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:26.400
I'm somebody who loves psychology and psychiatry

02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:28.920
and a little bit, I guess, of sociology.

02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:33.360
I realize how tragically flawed the field is,

02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:34.840
not because of lack of trying,

02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:37.240
but just how difficult the problems are.

02:07:37.240 --> 02:07:39.840
That to do really thorough studies

02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:42.440
that understand the fundamentals of human behavior

02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:45.840
and this, yes, landscape of human suffering,

02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:48.800
it's just, it's almost an impossible task without the data,

02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:51.360
and we currently don't, you know,

02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:53.640
not everybody's richly integrated

02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:55.000
to where they're fully connected

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.960
and all their information is being, like,

02:07:57.960 --> 02:08:00.680
recorded for sociologists to study,

02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:02.360
so you have to make a lot of inferences.

02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:03.520
You have to talk to people,

02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:05.360
you have to do the interviews as you're doing,

02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:07.960
and through that, like, really difficult work,

02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:11.760
try to understand, like, hear the music

02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:13.520
that nobody else is hearing,

02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:15.920
the music of, like, what people are feeling,

02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:17.640
their hopes, their dreams,

02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:19.840
and the crushing of their dreams

02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:22.360
due to some kind of economic forces.

02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:24.720
Yeah, I mean, we've just lived that

02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:28.680
for four and a half years of probably, you know, elites.

02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:30.880
Let me just go out on a limb and say,

02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:33.800
not understanding the sort of emotional

02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:35.080
and psychological currents

02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:37.840
of a large portion of the population, right,

02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:41.240
and just being stunned by it and confused, right,

02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:46.120
wasn't confusing for me after having talked to truckers,

02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:48.800
again, who, trucking is the job of last resort.

02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:50.480
These are people who've already lost

02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:52.360
that manufacturing job oftentimes,

02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:57.360
already lost that construction job to just aging, right?

02:08:57.360 --> 02:08:59.440
So what, you know, what can we do, right?

02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:01.040
What's sort of the positive vision?

02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:04.080
Because, like, we've got tons of highway deaths,

02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:09.080
we've got, and just to, you know, the big picture is,

02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:10.640
and this is the opportunity, I guess,

02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:15.680
for investors, it's a hugely inefficient system.

02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:17.360
So we buy this truck,

02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:19.680
there's this low wage worker in it oftentimes,

02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:20.880
and again, I'm setting aside

02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:23.160
those really good line haul jobs in LTL,

02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:24.640
those are a different case.

02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:30.520
That low wage worker is driving a truck that they might,

02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:32.480
the wheels might roll seven to eight hours a day,

02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:33.920
that's what the truck is designed to do,

02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:36.280
and that's what makes the money for the company.

02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:38.000
In other seven, eight hours a day,

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.880
the driver's doing other kinds of work

02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:41.920
that, you know, is not driving.

02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:42.840
And then the rest of the day,

02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:45.520
they're basically living out of the truck.

02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:49.000
You really can't find a more inefficient use of an asset

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.160
than that, right?

02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:53.040
Now, a big part of that is we pay for the roads

02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:55.680
and we pay for the rest areas and all this other stuff.

02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:58.800
So the way that I work and the way that, you know,

02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:01.200
I think about these problems is I try to find analogies,

02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:02.760
right, sort of labor processes

02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:05.440
and things that make economic sense, you know,

02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:10.440
that seem, you know, in the same area of the economy,

02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:14.840
but have some different characteristics for workers,

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:17.040
right, and sort of try to figure out

02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:19.560
why does the economics work there, right?

02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:24.560
And so if you look at those really good jobs,

02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:29.120
the most likely way that you as a passenger car driver

02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:30.840
would know that it's one of those drivers

02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:33.120
is that there are multiple trailers, right?

02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:35.640
So you see these like, maybe it's three small trailers,

02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:37.920
maybe it's two sort of medium sized trailers,

02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:39.080
some places you might even see

02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:40.800
two really big trailers together.

02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:44.560
You do that because labor is expensive, right?

02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:45.720
And it's highly skilled.

02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:48.000
And so you use it efficiently and you say,

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.280
all right, you know, rather than having you, you know,

02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:52.400
haul that little trailer out of the ports, you know,

02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:54.080
that sort of half-size container,

02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:55.160
we're gonna wait till we get three

02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:56.600
or we're gonna coordinate the movement

02:10:56.600 --> 02:10:57.880
so that they're three ready.

02:10:57.880 --> 02:11:00.640
You go do what truckers call make a set,

02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:03.200
put them together, right, and you go.

02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:06.120
That's a massive productivity gain, right?

02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:08.160
Because, you know, you're hauling two,

02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:09.920
three times as much freight.

02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:13.920
So the positive scenario that I threw out in 2018

02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:18.800
was why not have a human driven truck

02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:20.720
with a self-driving truck that follows it, right?

02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:22.000
Just a drone unit.

02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:27.960
And it was, you know, to me this seemed as a,

02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:31.120
you know, non-computer scientists, a sociologist, right?

02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:32.160
This made a lot of sense

02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:34.320
because when I got done talking to the,

02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:36.640
you know, the computer scientists and the engineers,

02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:38.840
they were like, well, you know, it's like object recognition,

02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:40.640
decision-making algorithm, all this stuff.

02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:44.720
It's like, all right, so why don't you leave the human brain

02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:46.720
in the lead vehicle, right?

02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:50.520
You got all that processing and then all that following.

02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:54.280
Now, again, this is sort of me being a lay person.

02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:55.720
You know, I said, why don't, you know,

02:11:55.720 --> 02:11:57.040
then that following truck, right,

02:11:57.040 --> 02:11:58.280
takes direction from the front.

02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:01.040
It uses the rear of the trailer as a reference point.

02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:02.120
It maintains the lane.

02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:04.640
You've got cooperative adaptive cruise control

02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:08.600
and you double the productivity of that driver.

02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:12.920
You solve that problem that I hated in my, you know,

02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:15.600
urban truck ports thing about the bridge weight.

02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:17.400
Because when you get to the bridges, you know,

02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:19.800
the two trucks can just spread out

02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:21.400
just enough to make the bridge weight, right?

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:22.640
And you can just program that in

02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:24.480
and, you know, they're 50 feet further apart,

02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:26.880
100 feet further apart.

02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:32.440
So interesting sort of, I think, story about this

02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:35.120
that leads to kind of, I think, the policy questions.

02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:41.640
In, I guess, 2017, Jack Reed and Susan Collins

02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:44.520
and, you know, requested from the Senate,

02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:47.120
the Senate requested research on what the impacts

02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:48.760
of self-driving trucks would be.

02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:51.760
And the first stage of that was for the GAO

02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:56.800
to do a report, sort of looking at the lay of the land,

02:12:56.960 --> 02:12:58.280
talking to some experts.

02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:03.240
And I was working on my 2018 report,

02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:06.320
help contribute to that GAO report.

02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:08.960
And, you know, I had the six scenarios, right?

02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:11.880
I'm like, okay, you know, here's what Starsky's doing,

02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:16.080
you know, here's what Embark and Uber are doing, you know.

02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:18.320
Here's what Waymo might be doing.

02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:20.720
Nobody really knows, right?

02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:22.320
Here's what Peloton's doing.

02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:25.320
You know, here's the autopilot scenario.

02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:28.080
And then here's this one that I think actually

02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:29.560
could be good for drivers.

02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:32.840
So now you've got that driver who's got two, you know,

02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:34.520
two times the freight.

02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:35.760
Their decisions are more important.

02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:37.680
They're managing a more complex system, right?

02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:39.800
They're probably gonna have to have some global understanding

02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:41.280
of how to, you know, the environments

02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:42.560
in which it can operate safely, right?

02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:44.640
Now we're talking upscaling, right?

02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:50.520
And so, you know, the GAO, you know,

02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:52.320
sort of writes up these different scenarios.

02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:54.400
And the idea is that it's gonna prepare

02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:56.080
for this Department of Transportation,

02:13:56.080 --> 02:14:00.680
Department of Labor set of processes to engage stakeholders

02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:05.320
and sort of get, you know, get industry perspectives

02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:07.760
and then do a study on the labor impacts.

02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:12.760
So, you know, that DOT, DOL process starts to happen

02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:17.040
and, you know, I get to the workshop

02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:20.440
and a friend was sitting at the table next to me

02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:22.800
and he holds up the scenarios

02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:25.360
that they're gonna have us discuss at this workshop.

02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:27.840
And he's like, hey, these look really familiar, right?

02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:31.080
Is they were the, you know, scenarios from the report,

02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:34.080
but there were only five instead of six.

02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:35.200
Interesting.

02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:38.240
The sixth scenario, which was the upscaling labor,

02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:42.520
good for workers scenario, wasn't discussed.

02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:45.760
So to clarify that the integral piece of technology

02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:47.480
there is platooning.

02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:50.080
Yeah, I mean, in a sense it's platooning,

02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:55.000
but, and in fairness, right, as I pitched that idea

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.720
or sort of ran that idea by the computer scientists

02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:01.600
and engineers and product managers that I would talk to,

02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:05.400
they would say, you know, we thought about that,

02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:09.320
but that following truck, it's not that simple.

02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:12.640
You know, that thing, basically we had to engineer that

02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:15.960
to be capable of independent self-driving

02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:17.640
because what if there was a cut-in

02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:19.600
or, you know, any number of scenarios

02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:23.880
in which it lost that connection to the lead truck

02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:25.280
for whatever reason.

02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:27.120
Now, I mean, I don't know.

02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:29.720
Platooning is hard.

02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:30.720
There's edge cases.

02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:33.760
I guarantee the number of edge cases in platooning

02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:37.400
is orders of magnitude lower than the number of edge cases

02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:40.680
in the general solo full self-drive.

02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:43.840
You do not need to solve the full self-driving problem.

02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:47.240
I mean, if you're talking about probability

02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:50.880
of dangerous events, it just seems with platooning,

02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:54.760
then, like, you can deal with cut-ins.

02:15:54.760 --> 02:15:56.800
Yeah, so this is, you know, this is beyond,

02:15:56.800 --> 02:15:58.280
this is one of the challenges, obviously,

02:15:58.280 --> 02:16:00.320
of being a researcher who, you know,

02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:03.720
doesn't really have any background in the technology,

02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:05.760
right, so I can dream this up.

02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:08.120
You know, I have no idea if it's feasible.

02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:09.520
Well, let me speak, because you spoke

02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:10.720
to the PhDs in economics,

02:16:10.720 --> 02:16:12.920
let me speak to the PhDs in computer science.

02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:14.560
If you think platooning is as hard

02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:19.040
as the full self-driving problem, we need to talk

02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:20.360
because I think that's ridiculous.

02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:23.440
I think platooning, in fact, I think platooning

02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:26.680
is an interesting idea for ride sharing as well

02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:28.400
for the general autonomous driving problem,

02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:30.360
not just trucking, but obviously trucking

02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:32.120
is the big, big benefit

02:16:32.120 --> 02:16:35.360
because the number of A to B points in trucking

02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:38.120
is much, much lower than the general ride sharing problem.

02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:40.440
But anyway, I think that's a great idea,

02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:42.680
but you're saying it was removed.

02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:45.000
Yeah, and so, you know, you can go, you know,

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.200
and, you know, listeners could go to these reports,

02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:49.880
they're publicly available, and they explain why

02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:52.840
in the footnote, and, you know, they note

02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:55.680
that there was this other scenario suggested by,

02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:57.360
at least me, and I can remember if they said

02:16:57.360 --> 02:17:00.800
someone else did too, but they said, you know,

02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:03.960
we didn't include it because no developers

02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:05.000
were working on it.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:05.920
Interesting.

02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:08.600
Full disclosure, that was the approach

02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:11.120
that I took in my research, right,

02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:13.400
which was to go to the developers and say,

02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:14.920
what's your vision, right?

02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:17.000
What are you trying to develop?

02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:20.200
That's what I was trying to do, and maybe, you know,

02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:22.280
and then I tried to think outside the box at the end

02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:23.320
by adding that one, right?

02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:24.480
Like, here's one that I have, you know,

02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:26.000
people aren't talking about that could be cool.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:29.120
Now, again, it had been proposed in like 2014

02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:31.880
for like fuel convoys, so you could just have

02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:35.880
like one super armored lead fuel truck, right,

02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:38.200
in a, you know, bringing fuel to forward operating bases

02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:40.640
in Afghanistan, and then you wouldn't need,

02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:42.160
you know, the super heavy, you know,

02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:43.320
you wouldn't have to protect the human life

02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:44.160
in the following truck.

02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:45.480
So that's interesting, you're saying like,

02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:47.520
when you talk to Waymo, when you talk to these kinds

02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:50.880
of companies, they weren't at least openly saying

02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:53.520
they're working on this, so then it doesn't make sense

02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:56.120
to include it in the list.

02:17:56.120 --> 02:17:58.680
Yeah, and so, but here's the thing, right?

02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:01.080
This is the Department of Transportation, right,

02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:03.160
and the Department of Labor.

02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:04.760
Maybe they could consider some scenarios,

02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:06.840
like maybe we could say, you know,

02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:09.000
this technology has got a lot of potential,

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.160
here's what we'd like it to do, you know?

02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:12.720
We'd like it to reduce highway deaths,

02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:14.920
help us fight climate change, reduce congestion,

02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:16.760
you know, all these other things,

02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:19.120
but that's not how our policy conversation

02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:20.560
around technology is happening.

02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:24.720
We're not, and people don't think that we should,

02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:26.480
and I think that's the fundamental shift

02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:27.880
that we need to have, right?

02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:29.080
I've been involved with this a little bit,

02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:33.360
like NHTSA and DOT, the approach they took is saying,

02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:34.920
we don't know what the heck we're doing,

02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:38.360
so we're going to just let the innovators do their thing

02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:41.400
and not regulate it for a while, just to see.

02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:44.480
You don't, you think that's, you think DOT

02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:46.560
should provide ideas themselves?

02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:49.920
Well, so this is the, this is the great trick

02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:54.920
in policy of private actors, is you get narrow mandates

02:18:56.760 --> 02:18:58.760
for government agencies, right?

02:18:58.760 --> 02:19:02.000
So, you know, the safety case will be handled

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.880
by organizations whose mandate is safety.

02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:07.880
So the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration,

02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:11.280
who is, you know, going to be a key player,

02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:13.640
I argue in an article that I wrote, you know,

02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:15.720
they're going to be a key player in actually determining

02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:18.080
which scenario is most profitable

02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:20.240
by setting the rules for truck drivers.

02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:22.480
Their mandate is safety, right?

02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:25.160
Now they have lots of good people there who want,

02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:26.560
you know, who care about truck drivers

02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:29.360
and who wish truck drivers jobs were better,

02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:32.880
but they don't have the authority to say,

02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:34.040
hey, we're going to write this rule

02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:35.640
because it's good for truck drivers, right?

02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:40.640
And so when you, you know, we need to say, you know,

02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:44.040
as a society, we need to not restrict technology,

02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:45.640
not stand in the way of things.

02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:48.880
We need to harness it towards the goals that matter, right?

02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:52.080
Not whatever comes out the end of the pipeline

02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:53.840
because it's the easiest thing to develop

02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:57.080
or whatever is most profitable for the first actor

02:19:57.080 --> 02:19:58.760
or whatever, but, you know, and we do,

02:19:58.760 --> 02:20:00.760
the thing is we do that, right?

02:20:00.760 --> 02:20:04.840
I mean, like when we sent people to the moon, you know,

02:20:04.840 --> 02:20:07.840
we did that and there were tremendous benefits

02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:09.400
that followed from it, right?

02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:11.440
And we do this all the time in, you know,

02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:13.640
trying to cure cancer or whatever it is, right?

02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:17.240
I mean, we can do this, right?

02:20:17.240 --> 02:20:21.960
Now the interesting sort of epilogue to that story is,

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:25.240
you know, six months or so, I don't know how long it was,

02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:28.280
after those meetings in which that sixth scenario

02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:32.840
was not considered, a company called Locomation,

02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:36.720
you know, ends up using that,

02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:40.000
essentially that basic scenario with a slight variation.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:43.880
So they leave the human driver in both trucks

02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:46.160
and then that following driver goes off duty.

02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:50.080
And then, you know, I've been trying to think

02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:52.960
of what the term is, I think of it as like slingshotting.

02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:54.800
They sort of, when one runs out of hours, you know,

02:20:54.800 --> 02:20:58.000
the one who's off duty goes in front and, you know,

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:02.280
and so, you know, if only they had been, you know,

02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:04.800
around six months earlier,

02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:07.160
it might've been considered by the OT, but it just says,

02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:09.320
you know, who has the authority to propose

02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:10.920
what these visions of the future are?

02:21:10.920 --> 02:21:13.840
Well, some of it is also just the company stepping up

02:21:13.840 --> 02:21:16.400
and just doing it, screw the authority

02:21:16.400 --> 02:21:18.120
and showing that it's possible

02:21:18.120 --> 02:21:19.760
and then the authority follows.

02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:24.760
So that's why I really love innovators in the space.

02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:29.520
The criticism I have, the very sort of real,

02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:31.080
I don't know, harsh criticism I have

02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:34.440
towards autonomous vehicle companies in the space

02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:37.240
is they've gotten culturally,

02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:41.440
they've, it's become acceptable somehow

02:21:42.840 --> 02:21:45.440
to do demos and videos,

02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:48.840
as opposed to the old school American way

02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:50.640
of solving problems.

02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:53.320
There's a culture in Silicon Valley

02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:54.880
where you're talking to VCs

02:21:56.160 --> 02:22:01.160
that have lost that kind of love of solving problems.

02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:03.760
They kind of like envision,

02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:07.400
if the story you told me in your PowerPoint presentation

02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:09.440
is true, how many trillions of dollars

02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:10.760
might I be able to make?

02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:13.280
There's something lost in that conversation

02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:15.240
where you're not really taking on

02:22:15.240 --> 02:22:18.080
like the problem in a real way.

02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:20.240
So these autonomous vehicle companies realize

02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:21.080
we don't need to,

02:22:21.080 --> 02:22:24.240
we just need to make nice PowerPoint presentations

02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:26.120
and not actually deliver products

02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:29.080
that like everybody looks outside

02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:32.080
and says, holy shit, this is life changing.

02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:34.280
This is where I have to give props to Waymo

02:22:34.280 --> 02:22:38.040
is they put driverless cars on the road

02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:41.560
and like forget PowerPoint slide presentations,

02:22:41.560 --> 02:22:42.640
actual cars on the road.

02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:44.080
Then you can criticize like,

02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:45.680
is that actually going to work?

02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:46.520
Who knows?

02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:48.400
But the thing is they have cars on the road

02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:49.880
and that's why I have to give props to Tesla.

02:22:49.880 --> 02:22:53.040
They have whatever you want to say about risk

02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:54.280
and all those kinds of things.

02:22:54.280 --> 02:22:55.760
They have cars on the road

02:22:55.760 --> 02:22:57.440
that have some level of automation

02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:00.280
and soon they have trucks on the road as well.

02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:04.000
And that kind of, that component,

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.880
I think is important part of the policy conversation

02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:09.400
because you start getting data

02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:12.240
from these companies that are willing to take the big risks

02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:14.440
as opposed to making slide decks,

02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:16.680
they're actually putting cars on the road

02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:19.400
and like real lives are at stake.

02:23:19.400 --> 02:23:22.040
They could be lost and they could bankrupt the company

02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:23.560
if they make the wrong decisions.

02:23:23.560 --> 02:23:26.000
And that's deeply admirable to me.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.040
Speaking of which, I have to ask,

02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:31.120
Waymo trucks, I think it's called Waymo Via.

02:23:32.080 --> 02:23:34.720
So I'm talking to the head of trucking at Waymo.

02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:37.440
I don't know if you got any chance to interact with them.

02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:39.560
What's a good question to ask the guy?

02:23:39.560 --> 02:23:41.400
What's a good question of Waymo?

02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:45.120
Because they seem to be one of the leaders in the space.

02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:49.040
They have the Zen-like calm of like being willing

02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:51.600
to stick with it for the long-term

02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:53.360
in order to solve the problem.

02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:55.920
Yeah, and I guess they have that luxury, right?

02:23:56.920 --> 02:23:58.440
Which I don't think I,

02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:01.920
if I had another life as a researcher,

02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:05.400
I would love to just study the business strategies

02:24:05.400 --> 02:24:10.040
of startups and Silicon Valley sort of structure.

02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:12.200
Would you consider Waymo startup?

02:24:12.200 --> 02:24:13.640
No. No.

02:24:13.640 --> 02:24:14.480
No, right?

02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:16.280
I mean, it's at least not in the things

02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:18.960
that seem to matter in the self-driving space.

02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:20.720
So you mentioned the demos.

02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:24.360
And I don't have enough data as a sociologist

02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:27.280
to really say like, oh, this is why they do what they do.

02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:30.040
But my hypothesis is,

02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:33.520
there's a real scarcity of talent and money for this.

02:24:33.520 --> 02:24:36.280
And there certainly was a scarcity of partnerships

02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:39.960
with OEMs and the big trucking companies.

02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:42.120
And there was a race for it, right?

02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:47.120
And the way that if you don't have the backing of Alphabet,

02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:49.880
you do a demo, right?

02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:52.120
And you get a few more good engineers who say,

02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:54.120
hey, look, they did that cool thing.

02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:56.760
Like Anthony Lewandowski did with Otto

02:24:56.760 --> 02:25:00.200
and that resulted in the Uber purchase of that program.

02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:03.280
So what would I ask?

02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:06.640
I mean, I think I would ask a lot of questions,

02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:07.480
but I think the markets-

02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:09.840
Well, there's also on-record and off-record conversations

02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:12.040
because unfortunately I'm asking

02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:14.320
for an on-record conversation.

02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:18.720
And that, I don't know if these companies

02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:21.840
are willing to have interesting on-record conversations.

02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:22.800
Yeah.

02:25:22.800 --> 02:25:24.840
I mean, I assume that, like there are questions

02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:26.240
that I don't think you'd have to ask.

02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:28.680
Like I assume they're gonna be actually driverless, right?

02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:31.280
They're not gonna like keep the driver in there.

02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:33.520
So, I mean, for the industry,

02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:35.720
I think it would be interesting to know

02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:39.440
where they see that first adopter, right?

02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:42.120
Oh, you mean from like the scenarios that laid out

02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:44.120
which one are they going to take on?

02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:46.200
Yeah, I mean, cause that's gonna, again,

02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:48.560
it's those really expensive, good jobs, right?

02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:51.440
So those LTL jobs, the like UPS jobs.

02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:54.120
Now that's gonna be, that's where labor is too, right?

02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:55.080
That's where the Teamsters are.

02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:57.280
That's the only place they are left, right?

02:25:57.280 --> 02:26:00.560
So that's gonna be the big fight on the Hill

02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:03.360
and public, if labor can muster it, right?

02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:04.200
I don't know.

02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:06.560
There's a really cool,

02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:09.400
like one thing I would recommend to you

02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:11.640
and your listeners, if you really wanna see some,

02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:14.160
like a remarkable page in sort of the history

02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:17.880
of labor and automation, there's a report

02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:21.880
that Harry Bridges, who was the socialist leader

02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:24.600
of the longshoremen on the West Coast

02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:26.400
and just galvanized that union

02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:28.440
and they still control the ports today

02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:31.920
because of the sort of vision that he laid down.

02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:35.840
In the 1960s, he put out a photo journal report

02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:37.880
called Men and Machines.

02:26:37.880 --> 02:26:39.280
And basically what it was

02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:42.120
was it was an internal education campaign

02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:44.080
to convince the membership

02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:46.760
that they had to go along with automation.

02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:48.320
Machines were coming for their jobs.

02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:49.960
And what the photo journal,

02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:51.960
it's almost like a hundred pages or something like that

02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:54.160
is like, here's how we used to do it.

02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:56.200
Some of you old timers remember it.

02:26:56.200 --> 02:26:58.680
Like we used to take the barrels of olive oil

02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:01.560
and we'd stack them in the hold and we'd roll them by hand

02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:03.400
and we'd put the timber in and we'd, you know,

02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:05.680
stack the crates tight, you know?

02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:08.160
And that was the pride of the longshoremen

02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:10.000
was a tight stow.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.080
And now you all know, you know,

02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:13.360
there are cranes that come down

02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:15.600
and there's no longer any, you know, rope slings

02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:17.800
and we're loading bulldozers into the hold

02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:19.720
to push the ore up into piles

02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:21.920
and then clamshells are coming down.

02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:24.240
And he made this case to them.

02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:27.880
And he said, this is why we're signing this agreement

02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:32.880
to basically allow the employer to automate.

02:27:33.200 --> 02:27:34.840
And we're gonna lose jobs,

02:27:34.840 --> 02:27:37.760
but we're gonna get a share of the benefits.

02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:39.440
And so our wages are gonna go up.

02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:41.200
We're gonna continue to control the hiring

02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:42.760
and training of workers.

02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:44.160
Our numbers are gonna go down,

02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:46.600
but, you know, basically that last son of a bitch

02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:48.160
who's working at the ports,

02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:51.640
he's gonna be one really well-paid son of a bitch,

02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:54.000
you know, it may just be one standing,

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:55.680
but he's gonna love his job.

02:27:56.760 --> 02:27:57.960
You should check out that report.

02:27:57.960 --> 02:27:59.800
That's an interesting vision of a future

02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:02.040
that probably still holds.

02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:04.240
That is, I mean, there is some level

02:28:04.240 --> 02:28:07.160
to which you have to embrace the automation.

02:28:07.160 --> 02:28:08.000
Yeah.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:09.600
I mean, and who gets, you know, it's the benefits, right?

02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:12.120
It's like, I mean, think of the public dollars

02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:14.080
that went into developing self-driving vehicles

02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:14.960
in the early days, right?

02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:16.320
Not just the vision of it, right?

02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:18.920
Which was a public vision to, you know,

02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:20.560
take soldiers out of harm's way.

02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:24.840
But, you know, a lot of money.

02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:27.400
And there's some way, if you are a business

02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:29.720
that's leveraging the technology

02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:33.880
from a broad historical ethical perspective,

02:28:33.880 --> 02:28:38.880
you do owe it to the bigger community to pay back,

02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:45.000
like for all the investment that was paid

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.240
to make that technology a reality.

02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:51.000
In some sense, I don't know how to make that right, right?

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:56.000
On one, there's pure capitalism and then there's communism,

02:28:56.280 --> 02:29:01.280
and I'm not sure how to get that balance right.

02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:06.280
You know, I don't have all the answers in here.

02:29:06.280 --> 02:29:09.120
You know, and I wouldn't expect, you know,

02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:11.960
individual private companies to kind of kick back, right?

02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:14.120
That's, capitalism doesn't allow that, right?

02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:15.840
Unless you have a huge monopoly, right?

02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:17.560
And then you can, on the backside,

02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:21.280
create music halls and libraries and things like that.

02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:23.520
But, you know, here's what I think, you know,

02:29:23.520 --> 02:29:28.520
the basic obligation is, is, you know, come to the table,

02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:31.840
like, and have an honest conversation

02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:35.880
with the policymakers, with the truck drivers, you know,

02:29:35.880 --> 02:29:38.000
with the communities that are at risk.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:41.960
Like, at least let's talk about these things, you know,

02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:43.560
in a way that doesn't look like

02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:45.440
the way lobbying works right now.

02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:49.200
Where you send a well-paid lobbyist to the Hill

02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:52.640
to, you know, convince some representative or senator

02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:55.360
to stick a sentence or two in that favors you into the,

02:29:55.360 --> 02:29:57.840
like, let's have a real conversation.

02:29:57.840 --> 02:29:58.680
Real human conversation.

02:29:58.680 --> 02:29:59.520
Can we just do that?

02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:01.480
Yeah, don't play games.

02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:03.280
Real, real human conversation.

02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:06.560
Let me ask you, mentioned autopilot,

02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:10.160
gotta ask you about Tesla, this renegade little company

02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:12.280
that seems to be, from my perspective,

02:30:12.280 --> 02:30:13.880
revolutionizing autonomous driving

02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:15.080
or semi-autonomous driving,

02:30:15.080 --> 02:30:18.600
or at least the problem of perception and control.

02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:22.200
They've got a semi on the way.

02:30:22.200 --> 02:30:24.360
They got a truck on the way.

02:30:24.360 --> 02:30:26.640
What are your thoughts about Tesla Semi?

02:30:26.640 --> 02:30:30.440
You know, I, and I did have some very preliminary

02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:35.040
conversations with, you know, policy folks there.

02:30:35.040 --> 02:30:37.320
You know, nothing really in the tech

02:30:37.320 --> 02:30:40.040
or business side of it too much.

02:30:40.040 --> 02:30:41.000
And here's why.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.920
I think because electrification and autonomy

02:30:43.920 --> 02:30:45.320
run in opposite directions.

02:30:46.200 --> 02:30:50.040
And I just, you know, I don't see the application,

02:30:50.040 --> 02:30:52.600
the value in self-driving for the truck

02:30:52.600 --> 02:30:55.520
that Tesla's gonna produce in the near term.

02:30:55.520 --> 02:30:58.960
You know, they're just, you're not gonna have the battery.

02:30:58.960 --> 02:31:01.240
Now you could have wonderful safety systems

02:31:01.240 --> 02:31:02.920
and, you know, reinforcing, you know,

02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:06.160
the auto, you know, self-driving features

02:31:06.160 --> 02:31:08.920
supporting a skilled driver,

02:31:08.920 --> 02:31:11.160
but you're not gonna be able to pull that driver out

02:31:11.160 --> 02:31:12.960
for long stretches the way that you are

02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:14.280
with driverless trucks.

02:31:14.280 --> 02:31:18.480
So do you think, I mean, the reason,

02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:23.280
so yeah, the electrification is not obviously

02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:24.720
coupled with the automation.

02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:29.880
They have a very interesting approach to semi-autonomous,

02:31:29.960 --> 02:31:32.680
pushing towards autonomous driving, right?

02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:34.200
It's very unique.

02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:38.400
No lidar, now no radar.

02:31:38.400 --> 02:31:41.560
It's computer vision alone from a large,

02:31:41.560 --> 02:31:44.400
they're collecting huge amounts of data from a large fleet.

02:31:44.400 --> 02:31:46.680
It's an interesting, unique approach,

02:31:46.680 --> 02:31:48.920
bold and fearless in this direction.

02:31:48.920 --> 02:31:52.520
If I were to guess whether this approach would work,

02:31:52.520 --> 02:31:55.440
I would say no, let's start it.

02:31:55.440 --> 02:31:58.240
One, you would need a lot of data

02:31:58.240 --> 02:32:01.880
and two, because you have actual cars deployed on the road

02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:04.800
using a beta version of this product,

02:32:04.800 --> 02:32:08.880
you're going to have a system that's far less safe

02:32:08.880 --> 02:32:10.320
and you're going to run into trouble.

02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:14.320
It's horrible PR, like it just seems like a nightmare,

02:32:14.320 --> 02:32:17.440
but it seems to not be the case, at least up to this point.

02:32:17.440 --> 02:32:20.160
It seems to be, you know,

02:32:20.640 --> 02:32:25.640
on par, if not safer, and it seems to work really well

02:32:27.760 --> 02:32:32.000
and the human factor somehow manages,

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:33.840
like drivers still pay attention.

02:32:33.840 --> 02:32:36.680
Now there's a selection of who is inside

02:32:36.680 --> 02:32:39.800
the Tesla Autopilot user base, right?

02:32:39.800 --> 02:32:42.160
There could be a self-selection mechanism there,

02:32:42.160 --> 02:32:45.000
but however it works, these things are not running

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:46.280
off the road all the time.

02:32:47.280 --> 02:32:50.120
So it's very interesting whether that can sort of

02:32:51.080 --> 02:32:52.960
creep into the trucking space.

02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:57.960
Yes, at first, the long haul problem is not solved.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.600
They need to charge, but maybe you can solve,

02:33:00.600 --> 02:33:05.600
you know, a lot of your scenarios involved small distances

02:33:06.960 --> 02:33:10.200
and you know, that last mile aspect,

02:33:10.200 --> 02:33:12.160
which is exactly what Tesla is trying to solve

02:33:12.160 --> 02:33:17.160
for the regular passenger vehicle space

02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:20.400
is the city driving.

02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:22.640
It's possible that you have these trucks.

02:33:22.640 --> 02:33:27.640
It's almost like, yeah, you solve the last mile delivery

02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:31.280
part of some of the scenarios that you mentioned

02:33:31.280 --> 02:33:32.760
in autonomous driving space.

02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:35.520
Is that, do you think that's from the people

02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:37.600
you've spoken with too difficult of a problem?

02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:41.560
The thing that, you know, keeps me so interested

02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:43.600
in this space and thinking that it's so important,

02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:46.920
you know, is again, that efficiency question

02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:50.960
and that safety question and the way that these economics

02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:53.200
can push us potentially, you know,

02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:54.760
toward a more efficient system.

02:33:54.760 --> 02:33:57.480
So I want to see those Tesla electric trucks

02:33:57.480 --> 02:33:59.240
running out to those truck ports

02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:02.280
where you've got those two, you know,

02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:05.600
two trucks with a human driver in front, right?

02:34:05.600 --> 02:34:08.480
You know, I think that's now what's powering those

02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:11.280
is that hydrogen, you know, I mean, I don't, you know,

02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:13.040
again, it's very interesting as a researcher

02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:14.560
who does not have a background in technology

02:34:14.600 --> 02:34:18.440
and doesn't have a horse, you know, in this race.

02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:20.600
I mean, you know, for all I know,

02:34:20.600 --> 02:34:22.720
self-driving trucks will ultimately be achieved

02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:26.520
by some biomechanical sensor that uses echolocation

02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:29.200
because we took stem cells of bats and, you know, I mean,

02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:34.200
I don't, I am completely unable to assess who's, you know,

02:34:35.520 --> 02:34:37.760
who's ahead or who's behind or who makes sense.

02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:39.920
But I think one key component there,

02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:42.520
and this is what I see with Tesla often,

02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:45.560
and it's quite sad to me that other companies

02:34:45.560 --> 02:34:49.560
don't do this enough, is that first principles thinking,

02:34:49.560 --> 02:34:51.120
like, wait, wait, wait, okay,

02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:54.120
it's looking at the inefficiencies as opposed to,

02:34:54.120 --> 02:34:57.040
I've worked with quite a few car companies

02:34:57.040 --> 02:35:00.280
and they basically have a lot of meetings.

02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:01.800
There's a lot of meetings.

02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:04.680
And the discussion is like, how can we make this cheaper,

02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:06.320
this cheaper, this cheaper, this component cheaper,

02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:08.680
this cheaper, the cheapification of everything,

02:35:08.680 --> 02:35:11.720
just like you said, as opposed to saying, wait a minute,

02:35:11.720 --> 02:35:13.200
let's step back.

02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:15.800
Let's look at the entirety of the inefficiencies

02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:17.280
in the system.

02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:19.280
Like, why have we been doing this like this

02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:20.960
for the last few decades?

02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:25.440
Like, start from scratch, can this be 10X, 100X cheaper?

02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:30.440
Like, if we not just decrease the cost of one component here

02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:33.680
or this component here or this component here,

02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:37.920
but like, let's like redesign everything.

02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:42.920
Let's infrastructure, let's have special lanes.

02:35:42.920 --> 02:35:45.200
Or in terms of truck ports,

02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:47.560
as opposed to having regular human controlled truck ports,

02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:51.720
have some kind of weird, like sensors,

02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:54.400
like where everything about the truck

02:35:55.480 --> 02:35:58.800
connecting at that final destination is automated fully

02:35:58.800 --> 02:35:59.800
from the ground up.

02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:01.640
You build the facility from the ground up

02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:03.480
for the autonomous truck.

02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:06.840
All those kinds of sort of questions are platooning.

02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:09.040
Let's say, wait a minute, okay.

02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:11.280
I know we think platooning is hard,

02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:14.400
but can we think through exactly why it's hard

02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:16.000
and can we actually solve it?

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:19.160
Like, if we collect a huge amount of data, can we solve it?

02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:22.440
And then teleoperation.

02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:25.520
Like, okay, yeah, yeah, it's difficult to have good signal,

02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:30.520
but can we consider the probability of those edge cases

02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:32.480
and what to do in the edge cases

02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:34.280
when the teleoperation fails?

02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:35.360
Like, how difficult is this?

02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:36.360
What are the costs?

02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:39.640
How do we actually construct a teleoperation center

02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:41.800
full of humans that are able to pay attention

02:36:41.800 --> 02:36:44.760
to a large fleet where the average number of vehicles

02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:46.760
per human is like 10 or 100?

02:36:48.720 --> 02:36:52.160
Having that conversation as opposed to kind of having,

02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:54.400
you show up to work and say, all right,

02:36:55.880 --> 02:36:58.640
it seems like because of COVID,

02:36:58.640 --> 02:37:00.600
we are not making as much money.

02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:02.280
Can we have a cheaper,

02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:04.600
can we give less salary to the trucker?

02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:07.960
And can we build, like,

02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:12.800
decrease the cost or decrease the frequency

02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:14.600
at which we buy new trucks?

02:37:14.600 --> 02:37:16.320
And when we do buy new trucks,

02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:18.600
make them cheaper by making them crappier,

02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:20.160
like this kind of discussion.

02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:23.240
This is why, to me, it's like Tesla is like rare in this.

02:37:23.240 --> 02:37:26.200
And there's some sectors in which innovation

02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:27.600
is part of the culture.

02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:29.280
In the automotive sector, for some reason,

02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:31.200
it's not as much.

02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:33.800
This is obviously the problem that Ford and GM

02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:34.640
are struggling with.

02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:37.320
It's like, they're really good at making cars

02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:41.240
at scale cheap, and they're like legit good,

02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:42.600
like Toyota at this.

02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:44.520
They're some of the greatest manufacturing people

02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:45.360
in the world, right?

02:37:45.360 --> 02:37:46.200
That's incredible.

02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:48.840
But then when it comes to hiring software people,

02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:49.680
they're horrible.

02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:54.680
So it's culture, and it's such a difficult thing

02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:57.080
for them to sort of embrace,

02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:00.240
but greatness requires that they embrace this,

02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:03.120
embrace whatever is required

02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:05.000
to remove the inefficiency from the system.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.680
And that may require you to do things very differently

02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:09.440
than you've done in the past.

02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:12.040
Yeah, I mean, there are certain things

02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:13.880
that the market can do well.

02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:15.640
This is how I see the world, right?

02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:21.480
That's the best way to organize certain kinds of activities

02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:24.320
is the market and private interests.

02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:28.840
But I think we go too far in some areas.

02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:33.840
Transportation is, if we can't have a public debate

02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:37.720
about the roads that we all pay for,

02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:40.920
forget about it, private factories

02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:43.120
and all these other healthcare and other places,

02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:45.360
it's gonna be way harder there.

02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:49.680
Healthcare, I guess, has some direct contact

02:38:49.680 --> 02:38:51.800
with the consumer where we're probably gonna have lots

02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:54.760
of sort of hands-on public policy

02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:57.880
about concerns around patient rights and things like that.

02:38:57.880 --> 02:39:00.160
But if we can't figure out

02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:02.680
how to have a public policy conversation

02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:07.080
around how technology is gonna reform our public roadways

02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:08.800
and our transportation system,

02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:14.040
we're really leaving way too much to private companies.

02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:17.480
And it's just, it's not in their,

02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:19.640
I get asked this question, what should companies do?

02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:22.720
And I'm like, just go about doing what you're doing.

02:39:22.720 --> 02:39:24.460
Please come to the table and talk about it,

02:39:24.460 --> 02:39:26.680
but it's not their role.

02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:30.000
And I appreciate Ilan's attempts

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:34.760
to have species level goals,

02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:36.440
like, oh, we're gonna go to Mars.

02:39:36.440 --> 02:39:37.720
I mean, that's amazing.

02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:42.720
And that's incredible that someone can realize that,

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:44.680
have a chance at realizing that vision.

02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:46.040
It's amazing, right?

02:39:46.040 --> 02:39:50.200
But when it comes to so many areas of our economy,

02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:51.540
we can't wait for a hero.

02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:56.560
And there are way too many interests involved.

02:39:57.400 --> 02:39:58.480
Who builds the roads, who, you know,

02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:02.160
I mean, the money that sloshes around on Capitol Hill

02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:05.440
to decide what happens in these infrastructure bills

02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:09.120
and the transportation bill is just obscene, right?

02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:12.160
See, I think this is an interesting view of markets.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:14.680
Correct me if I'm wrong.

02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:17.040
Let me propose a theory to you.

02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:22.040
That progress in the world is made by heroes

02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:24.080
and the markets remove the inefficiencies

02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:26.240
from the work the heroes did.

02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:30.520
So going to Mars from the perspective of markets

02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:32.320
probably has no value.

02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:34.160
Maybe you can argue it's good for hiring

02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:35.960
to have a vision or something like that.

02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:38.040
But like those big projects

02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:40.600
don't seem to have an obvious value.

02:40:40.600 --> 02:40:45.600
But our world progresses by those big leaps.

02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:49.240
And then after the leaps are taken,

02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:51.060
then the markets are very good

02:40:51.060 --> 02:40:53.560
at removing sort of inefficiencies.

02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:56.520
But it just feels like the autonomous vehicle space

02:40:56.520 --> 02:40:59.880
and the autonomous trucking space requires leaps.

02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:04.440
It doesn't feel like we can sneak up into a good solution

02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:06.280
that is ultimately good for labor,

02:41:06.280 --> 02:41:08.520
like for human beings in the system.

02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:13.520
It feels like some, like, probably a bad example,

02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:16.400
but like a Henry Ford type of character steps in

02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:19.360
and say like, we need to do stuff completely differently.

02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:24.360
Yeah, and you said we can't hope for a hero,

02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:28.440
but it's like, no, but we can say we need a hero.

02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:29.920
We need more heroes.

02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:32.160
So if you're a young kid right now listening to this,

02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:33.880
we need you to be a hero.

02:41:33.880 --> 02:41:35.600
It's not like we need you to start a company

02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:36.440
that makes a lot of money.

02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:39.520
No, you need to start a company that makes a lot of money

02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:43.000
so that you can feed your family as you become a hero

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.840
and take huge risks and potentially go bankrupt.

02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:49.800
Those risks is how we move society forward, I think.

02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:52.000
Maybe there's a romantic view, I don't know.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:53.120
I totally disagree.

02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:54.600
You disagree, goddammit.

02:41:54.600 --> 02:41:55.440
I mean, I-

02:41:55.440 --> 02:41:58.240
And out of the two of us, you're the knowledgeable one.

02:41:58.240 --> 02:42:02.600
No, no, I think it's a matter of like,

02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:03.600
do we need those heroes?

02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:04.680
Absolutely.

02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:09.680
I mean, I saw the boosters come down from SpaceX's rockets

02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:14.960
and land nearly simultaneously with my kids

02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:16.760
after school one day.

02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:18.640
And I thought, oh my god,

02:42:18.640 --> 02:42:22.600
like science fiction has been made real.

02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:23.440
It's incredible.

02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:26.760
And it's a pinnacle of human achievement, right?

02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:29.520
It's like, this is what we're capable of.

02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:34.520
But we need to have those heroes oriented.

02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:38.520
We need to allow them to orient towards the right path.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:42.960
To orient toward the right, toward the goals, right?

02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:45.760
We got it, climate change, you know?

02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:48.920
I mean, all the heroes out there, right?

02:42:48.920 --> 02:42:52.160
I mean, it's time, the clock is ticking.

02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:53.920
It's past time.

02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:55.840
I've been working on climate change issues

02:42:55.840 --> 02:42:58.720
since the mid-90s.

02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:03.720
Like, I still remember the first time in 2010

02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:08.600
when I got a grant that was completely focused

02:43:08.600 --> 02:43:11.080
on adaptation rather than prevention.

02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:17.080
And just when it hit me that like, wow.

02:43:18.560 --> 02:43:22.160
So adaptation versus prevention is like acceptance

02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:25.440
that there's going to be catastrophic impact.

02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:27.040
We just need, we need to figure out

02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:28.680
how we at least live with that.

02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:29.520
Yeah.

02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:30.360
And you know, the grant was like,

02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:32.680
okay, our agriculture system is gonna move.

02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:34.880
Our breadbasket is no longer gonna be California.

02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:36.440
It's gonna be Illinois.

02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:38.560
What does that mean for truck transportation?

02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:42.040
So it's like, so in terms of a big philosophical

02:43:42.040 --> 02:43:44.640
societal level, that's kind of like giving up.

02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:45.480
Yeah.

02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:47.520
In terms of the big heroic actions, yeah.

02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:49.320
You know, failures in human history?

02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:53.800
Yeah, that's gonna be, let's hope not the biggest,

02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:56.160
but could be.

02:43:56.160 --> 02:43:57.000
Do you?

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.520
So let me say why I disagree, right?

02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:02.600
Henry Ford, amazing, right?

02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:05.680
He's the sort of mass produce cars, right?

02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:08.320
Daimler to put that first truck on the road

02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:10.280
without the roads, right?

02:44:10.280 --> 02:44:12.560
So there's like, we need that innovation.

02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:13.560
There's no doubt about it.

02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:15.200
And there are rules for that,

02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:20.200
but there's big public stuff that sets the stage.

02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:21.400
It's critical.

02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:23.560
And you know, and what it really is,

02:44:23.560 --> 02:44:26.160
it's a sociological problem, right?

02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:27.000
It's a political problem.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:27.840
It's a social problem.

02:44:27.840 --> 02:44:30.920
We have to say, and we have these screwed up ideas, right?

02:44:30.960 --> 02:44:33.520
And I think that's a big problem in politics right now,

02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:35.880
where everybody feels like they're getting screwed

02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:39.680
and someone undeserving is benefiting.

02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:41.880
When in fact, at least in the middle, right?

02:44:41.880 --> 02:44:42.720
They're huge.

02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:45.160
I used to teach this course on rich and poor,

02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:46.720
on economic inequality.

02:44:46.720 --> 02:44:50.720
And I would go through public housing subsidies

02:44:50.720 --> 02:44:54.720
in Philadelphia, section eight subsidies.

02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:58.840
And then I would go through my housing subsidies

02:44:58.840 --> 02:45:00.320
interest deduction.

02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:02.960
And it worked out to basically the average payment

02:45:02.960 --> 02:45:06.800
for a section eight housing voucher in my neighborhood.

02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:08.080
I'm not a welfare recipient

02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:10.240
according to the dominant discourse.

02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:13.240
And so we have this completely screwed up sense

02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:15.160
of like where our dollars go

02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:17.680
and who benefits from the investment.

02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:21.920
And we need to, I don't know that we can do it,

02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:24.720
but if we're gonna survive,

02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:28.920
we need to figure out how to have honest conversations

02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:32.680
where private interest is where we need it to be

02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:36.400
in fostering innovation and rewarding the people

02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:37.600
who do incredible things.

02:45:37.600 --> 02:45:41.120
Please, we don't wanna squash that,

02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:43.480
but we need to harness that power to solve

02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:47.520
what I think are some pretty big existential problems.

02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:50.640
So you think there's like government level,

02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:53.200
national level collaboration required

02:45:53.240 --> 02:45:54.520
for infrastructure project.

02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:59.520
Like we should really have large moonshot projects

02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:04.920
that are funded by our governments.

02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:06.240
At least guided by.

02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:08.200
I mean, I think there are ways to finance them

02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:10.920
and other things, but we gotta be careful, right?

02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:13.560
Cause that's where you get all these sort of perverse

02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:15.280
unintended consequences and whatnot.

02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:18.440
But if you look at transportation in the United States

02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:23.120
and it is the foundation of the manifest destiny

02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:25.240
of economic growth, right?

02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:29.080
That built the United States into the world superpower

02:46:29.080 --> 02:46:31.040
that it became and the industrial power that it became.

02:46:31.040 --> 02:46:33.600
It rested on transportation, right?

02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:35.640
It was like the Erie Canal.

02:46:35.640 --> 02:46:38.440
I grew up a few miles from where they dug

02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:40.600
the first shovel full of the Erie Canal

02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:44.120
and everyone thought it was crazy, right?

02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:48.080
But those public infrastructure projects, the canals, right?

02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:50.160
The railroads, yeah, they were privately built,

02:46:50.160 --> 02:46:51.840
but they wouldn't have been privately built

02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:55.040
without Lincoln funding them essentially

02:46:55.040 --> 02:46:59.120
and giving the railroads land

02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:01.200
in exchange for building them.

02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:03.520
The highway system, the Eisenhower,

02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:06.760
the payback that the US economy got

02:47:06.760 --> 02:47:09.720
from the Dwight D. Eisenhower interstate system

02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:12.200
is phenomenal, right?

02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:14.040
No private entity was gonna do that.

02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:16.480
Electrification, dams, water.

02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:21.600
We need to do this infrastructure, infrastructure.

02:47:22.240 --> 02:47:23.080
And now more than ever,

02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:25.840
it's been really upsetting to me on the COVID front.

02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:29.680
There's one of the solutions to COVID,

02:47:29.680 --> 02:47:32.520
which seems obvious to me from the very beginning

02:47:32.520 --> 02:47:35.000
that nobody is supposed to.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.160
It's one of the only bipartisan things

02:47:37.160 --> 02:47:41.560
is at home testing, rapid at home testing.

02:47:41.560 --> 02:47:45.320
There's no reason why at the government level,

02:47:45.320 --> 02:47:47.880
we couldn't manufacture hundreds of millions of tests

02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:48.840
a month.

02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:51.320
There's no reason starting in May, 2020.

02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:55.240
And that gives power to a country that values freedom,

02:47:55.240 --> 02:47:57.160
that gives power information to each individual

02:47:57.160 --> 02:47:59.320
to know whether they have COVID or not.

02:47:59.320 --> 02:48:04.320
So it's possible to manufacture them for under a dollar.

02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:05.840
It's like an obvious thing.

02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:07.160
It's kind of like the roads.

02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:09.000
It's like everybody's invested.

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.600
Let's put countless tests in the hands

02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:13.520
of every single American citizen,

02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:16.640
maybe every citizen of the world.

02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:19.560
The fact that we haven't done that to date

02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:21.880
and there's some regulation stuff with the FDA,

02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:24.440
all the kind of dragging of feet,

02:48:24.440 --> 02:48:26.120
but there's not actually a good explanation

02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:31.120
except our leaders and culturally,

02:48:31.480 --> 02:48:36.000
we've lost the sort of, not lost,

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.080
but it's a little bit dormant,

02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:42.160
the will to do these big projects that better the world.

02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:46.040
I still have the hope that when faced

02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:50.640
with catastrophic events,

02:48:50.640 --> 02:48:52.880
the more dramatic, the more damaging,

02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:53.920
the more painful they are,

02:48:53.920 --> 02:48:56.720
the higher we will rise to meet those.

02:48:56.720 --> 02:48:58.960
And that's where the infrastructure style projects

02:48:58.960 --> 02:48:59.800
are really important.

02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:03.920
But it's certainly a little bit challenging

02:49:03.920 --> 02:49:06.680
to remain an optimist in the times of COVID

02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:10.480
because the response of our leaders has not been as great

02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:14.360
and as historic as I would have hoped.

02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:17.440
I would hope that the actions of leaders

02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:19.800
in the past few years in response to COVID

02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:23.200
would be ones that are written in the history books.

02:49:23.200 --> 02:49:25.880
And we talk about it as we talk about FDR,

02:49:25.880 --> 02:49:27.640
but sadly, I don't know.

02:49:27.640 --> 02:49:29.840
I think the history books will forget this,

02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:32.360
the actions of our leaders.

02:49:35.640 --> 02:49:39.760
Let me just, to wrap up autonomy,

02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:42.840
when you look into the future,

02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:49.600
are you excited about automation in the space of trucking?

02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:54.280
Is it, when you go to bed at night,

02:49:56.360 --> 02:50:00.240
do you see a beautiful world in your vision

02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:01.880
that involves autonomous trucks?

02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:05.640
Like all of the truckers you've become close with,

02:50:05.640 --> 02:50:07.320
you've talked to,

02:50:07.320 --> 02:50:09.120
do you see a better world for you?

02:50:09.280 --> 02:50:10.400
Do you see a better world for them

02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:11.840
because of autonomous trucks?

02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:14.160
Damn you, Alex.

02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:16.040
You know why?

02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:19.200
Because I mean, I want to be an optimist,

02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:21.440
and I want to think of myself, I guess,

02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:23.840
as a half glass full kind of person.

02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:25.640
But when you ask it like that,

02:50:25.640 --> 02:50:27.880
and I think about like,

02:50:30.680 --> 02:50:35.680
when I look at the challenges to harnessing that for,

02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:40.840
you know, just let's take just labor and climate, right?

02:50:40.840 --> 02:50:42.520
There are other issues, congestion, et cetera,

02:50:42.520 --> 02:50:45.240
infrastructure that are going to be affected by this.

02:50:45.240 --> 02:50:48.680
You know, again, those big transformational issues.

02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:53.280
I think it's going to take the best of us.

02:50:53.280 --> 02:50:58.280
Like it's going to take the best of our policy approaches.

02:50:58.400 --> 02:50:59.600
It's going to take, you know,

02:50:59.600 --> 02:51:03.640
we need to start investing in building those,

02:51:03.640 --> 02:51:05.160
rebuilding those institutions.

02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:07.680
I mean, that's what we've seen in the last four years, right?

02:51:07.680 --> 02:51:11.400
And the erosion of that was so clear

02:51:11.400 --> 02:51:12.480
among these truck drivers.

02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:16.040
Like, you know, when Trump came in and said like,

02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:18.960
you know, free trades, good for workers,

02:51:18.960 --> 02:51:20.800
like, yeah, right, you know?

02:51:21.720 --> 02:51:23.600
I grew up in the Rust Belt, you know?

02:51:23.600 --> 02:51:25.720
I watched factory after factory close.

02:51:25.720 --> 02:51:28.480
All of my ancestors worked at the same factory.

02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:30.200
It's still holding on by a thread.

02:51:30.200 --> 02:51:34.280
Like, you know, the Democratic Party told,

02:51:34.320 --> 02:51:36.640
you know, blue collar workers for years,

02:51:36.640 --> 02:51:38.520
I don't worry about, you know, free trade.

02:51:38.520 --> 02:51:39.680
It's not bad for you.

02:51:39.680 --> 02:51:41.200
And I know the economists will probably get

02:51:41.200 --> 02:51:43.040
in the comment box now.

02:51:43.040 --> 02:51:44.240
You know, about how-

02:51:44.240 --> 02:51:45.800
We'll look forward to your comments.

02:51:45.800 --> 02:51:46.800
We'll look forward to your comments

02:51:46.800 --> 02:51:48.800
about how free trade benefits everybody.

02:51:49.920 --> 02:51:54.240
But, you know, immigration, you know, you go,

02:51:54.240 --> 02:51:56.280
and I'm, you know, I think immigration is great.

02:51:56.280 --> 02:52:00.040
The United States benefits from it tremendously, right?

02:52:00.040 --> 02:52:01.960
But there are costs, right?

02:52:01.960 --> 02:52:06.080
Go down to South Philadelphia and find a drywaller

02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:08.960
and tell him that immigration hasn't hurt him, right?

02:52:08.960 --> 02:52:12.720
You know, go to these places where there's competition,

02:52:12.720 --> 02:52:13.560
right?

02:52:13.560 --> 02:52:15.720
And yes, we benefit overall,

02:52:15.720 --> 02:52:19.440
but we have a system that allows some people

02:52:19.440 --> 02:52:22.160
to pay really high costs.

02:52:22.160 --> 02:52:24.360
And Trump tapped into that, you know?

02:52:24.360 --> 02:52:27.200
And there was no, you know,

02:52:27.200 --> 02:52:28.720
more than that too, obviously.

02:52:28.720 --> 02:52:31.080
And there's lots of really dark stuff

02:52:31.080 --> 02:52:33.000
that goes along with it, you know,

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.720
the sort of racialization of others and things like that.

02:52:35.720 --> 02:52:40.400
But he hit on those core, you know, issues that, you know,

02:52:40.400 --> 02:52:42.560
if you were to go back over my trucking interviews

02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:44.920
for 15 years, you would have heard those stories

02:52:44.920 --> 02:52:46.160
over and over and over again,

02:52:46.160 --> 02:52:49.200
that sense of voicelessness, that sense of powerlessness,

02:52:49.200 --> 02:52:50.960
that sense that there's no difference

02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:52.480
between the Democrats and the Republicans

02:52:52.480 --> 02:52:54.920
because they're all gonna screw us over.

02:52:54.920 --> 02:52:56.560
And that was there, you know?

02:52:56.560 --> 02:52:58.400
And you just ignore it as long as you want

02:52:58.400 --> 02:53:00.400
and tell people, don't worry, trade's good for you.

02:53:00.440 --> 02:53:02.080
Don't worry, immigration's good for you

02:53:02.080 --> 02:53:04.280
as their communities lose factories.

02:53:04.280 --> 02:53:06.120
And I mean, a lot of them were lost to the South

02:53:06.120 --> 02:53:08.160
before they were lost to overseas, whatever,

02:53:08.160 --> 02:53:10.360
but tapped into that.

02:53:10.360 --> 02:53:13.800
You know, and there's a fundamental distrust of,

02:53:13.800 --> 02:53:15.720
you know, you look at these like pew polls

02:53:15.720 --> 02:53:17.800
on like, you know, whether people trust the media, right?

02:53:17.800 --> 02:53:21.080
But whether or not they trust higher education, you know?

02:53:21.080 --> 02:53:24.240
You know, these institutions that I find magical, right?

02:53:24.240 --> 02:53:28.000
I mean, you look at the vaccine research and stuff

02:53:28.240 --> 02:53:33.240
just brilliant people doing incredible things for humanity

02:53:33.720 --> 02:53:38.560
like the idea that we can take these viruses

02:53:38.560 --> 02:53:42.120
that used to ravage through the human population

02:53:42.120 --> 02:53:44.240
and that we had to be terrified of.

02:53:44.240 --> 02:53:46.360
And you know, we've suffered,

02:53:46.360 --> 02:53:51.360
but we have such power now to defend ourselves, right?

02:53:52.560 --> 02:53:54.600
Behind these programs, right?

02:53:54.600 --> 02:53:56.760
And to see those, people would be like,

02:53:56.800 --> 02:53:58.360
I'm not sure if higher education's good

02:53:58.360 --> 02:53:59.280
for the country or not.

02:53:59.280 --> 02:54:02.000
You know, it's like, where are we?

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.200
You know, so we need to rebuild the faith and trust

02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:05.640
in those institutions and have these,

02:54:05.640 --> 02:54:07.440
but we need to have honest conversations

02:54:07.440 --> 02:54:10.000
before people are gonna buy it, you know?

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
You have ideas for rebuilding the trust

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:13.480
and giving a voice to the voices.

02:54:13.480 --> 02:54:18.040
So is the, many of the things we've been talking about

02:54:18.040 --> 02:54:21.440
is so sort of deeply integrated.

02:54:21.440 --> 02:54:24.760
You think like, this is the trouble I have with people

02:54:24.760 --> 02:54:27.720
that work on AI and autonomous vehicles and so on.

02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:31.000
It's not just a technology problem.

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:36.000
It's this human pain problem.

02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:39.800
It's the robot essentially silencing the voice

02:54:39.800 --> 02:54:43.160
of a human being because it's lowering their wage,

02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:46.040
making them suffer more and giving them no tools

02:54:46.040 --> 02:54:48.880
of how to escape that suffering.

02:54:48.880 --> 02:54:52.760
Is there something, I mean,

02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:55.600
it even gets into the question of meaning, you know?

02:54:55.600 --> 02:54:57.120
So if money is one thing,

02:54:58.560 --> 02:55:01.320
but it's also what makes us happy in life.

02:55:01.320 --> 02:55:06.400
You know, a lot of those truckers,

02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:08.360
the set of jobs they've had in their life

02:55:08.360 --> 02:55:10.920
were defining to them as human beings.

02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:14.800
And so, and the question with automation

02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:18.920
is not just how do we have a job

02:55:18.920 --> 02:55:22.920
that gives you money to feed your family,

02:55:22.920 --> 02:55:24.800
but also a job that gives you meaning,

02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:26.040
that gives you pride.

02:55:26.040 --> 02:55:26.880
Yeah.

02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:32.840
And for me, the hope is that AI and automation

02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:40.920
will provide other jobs that will be a source of meaning.

02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:47.200
But coupled with that hope is that there will not be

02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:49.400
too much suffering in the transition.

02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:53.520
And that's not obvious from the people you've spoken with.

02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:55.640
I mean, I think we need to differentiate

02:55:55.640 --> 02:55:57.040
between the effects of technology

02:55:57.040 --> 02:55:58.600
and the effects of capitalism, right?

02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:02.760
And they are, you know, the fact that workers

02:56:02.760 --> 02:56:06.760
don't have a lot of power, right, in the system matters.

02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:08.160
No, we had a system, right?

02:56:08.160 --> 02:56:09.400
And that's why I would say, you know,

02:56:09.400 --> 02:56:12.960
go to that Harry Bridges report.

02:56:12.960 --> 02:56:16.760
And, you know, those were workers who had a sense of power.

02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:17.600
They said, you know what,

02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:19.320
we can demand some of the benefits.

02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:21.200
Like, yeah, automate our jobs away.

02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:24.280
But, you know, kick a little down to us, right?

02:56:24.280 --> 02:56:28.840
And we had, in the golden era of American industrialism

02:56:28.840 --> 02:56:32.320
in post-World War II, that was the contract.

02:56:32.320 --> 02:56:35.160
The contract was employers can do what they want

02:56:35.160 --> 02:56:37.000
in automation and all these things.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:38.400
Yeah, sure, there's some union rules

02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:40.960
that make things less efficient in places.

02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:45.440
But the key compromise is tie wages to productivity.

02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:46.280
That's what we did.

02:56:46.520 --> 02:56:47.720
That's what unions did.

02:56:47.720 --> 02:56:50.640
They tied wages to productivity, kept demand up, right?

02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:54.200
It was good for the economy, some economists think, right?

02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:57.520
And that's what, you know, we need to,

02:56:57.520 --> 02:56:59.800
I think we need to acknowledge that.

02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:02.720
We need to acknowledge the fact

02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:04.560
that it's not just technology,

02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:08.880
it's technology in a social context

02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:10.560
in which some people have a lot of power

02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:12.600
to determine what happens.

02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:14.400
For me, I don't have all the answers,

02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:15.920
but I know what my answer is.

02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:19.240
And my answer is, and I think I started with this, you know,

02:57:20.440 --> 02:57:24.280
I can learn from every single person, you know?

02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:26.600
Did I have to talk to the 200th truck driver?

02:57:27.560 --> 02:57:30.040
In my opinion, yes,

02:57:30.040 --> 02:57:31.680
because I was gonna learn something

02:57:31.680 --> 02:57:33.920
from that 200th truck driver.

02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:38.920
Now, people with more power might talk to none,

02:57:39.680 --> 02:57:41.720
or they might talk to five and say, okay, I got it.

02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:46.720
You know, people are amazing,

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.880
and every one of them has a life experience and concerns

02:57:49.880 --> 02:57:53.920
and, you know, can teach us something.

02:57:53.920 --> 02:57:57.160
And they're not in the conversation, you know?

02:57:57.160 --> 02:58:00.720
And I know this because I'm the expert, you know?

02:58:00.720 --> 02:58:02.720
So I get pulled into these conversations

02:58:02.720 --> 02:58:04.240
and people wanna know, you know,

02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:06.040
what's gonna happen to labor, you know?

02:58:06.040 --> 02:58:10.200
It's like, well, so I try to be a sounding board,

02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:14.040
and I feel a tremendous weight of responsibility,

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:16.280
you know, for that.

02:58:18.680 --> 02:58:21.680
But I'm not those workers, you know?

02:58:21.680 --> 02:58:24.960
And they may listen to this or, you know,

02:58:24.960 --> 02:58:27.160
walk in the door sometime, it's about to be like,

02:58:27.160 --> 02:58:29.640
that guy's full of shit, that's not what I think at all,

02:58:29.640 --> 02:58:30.480
you know?

02:58:31.480 --> 02:58:34.720
And they don't get heard over and over and over again.

02:58:34.720 --> 02:58:36.960
But in a small way, you are providing a voice to them,

02:58:36.960 --> 02:58:41.960
that's kind of the, if at scale we apply that empathy

02:58:42.520 --> 02:58:45.360
and listening, that we could provide the voice

02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:46.720
to the voiceless through our votes,

02:58:46.720 --> 02:58:48.160
through our money, through, I mean,

02:58:48.160 --> 02:58:50.920
that's one way to make capitalism work

02:58:50.920 --> 02:58:55.920
at not making the powerless more powerless,

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.440
is by all of us being a community

02:58:58.440 --> 02:58:59.880
that listens to the pain of others

02:58:59.880 --> 02:59:01.160
and tries to minimize that,

02:59:01.160 --> 02:59:03.320
to try to give a voice to the voiceless,

02:59:03.320 --> 02:59:05.480
give power to the powerless.

02:59:05.480 --> 02:59:08.520
I have to ask you on, by way of advice,

02:59:09.640 --> 02:59:12.080
young people, high school students, college students,

02:59:12.080 --> 02:59:15.080
entering this world full of automation,

02:59:17.400 --> 02:59:22.400
full of these complex labor markets and markets period,

02:59:23.520 --> 02:59:25.600
what would you, what kind of advice would you give

02:59:25.600 --> 02:59:28.960
to that person about how to have a career?

02:59:28.960 --> 02:59:31.280
How to have a life they can be proud of?

02:59:32.520 --> 02:59:35.280
Yeah, I think, you know, this is such a great question.

02:59:35.280 --> 02:59:40.280
I don't, it's okay to quote Steve Jobs, right?

02:59:42.040 --> 02:59:45.600
Always.

02:59:45.600 --> 02:59:49.520
Yeah, I mean, so, and I just heard this recently,

02:59:49.520 --> 02:59:51.600
it was a commencement speech that he gave,

02:59:51.600 --> 02:59:53.040
and I can't remember where it was.

02:59:53.040 --> 02:59:54.240
And he was talking about, you know,

02:59:54.240 --> 02:59:56.640
he had famously dropped out of school,

02:59:56.640 --> 02:59:59.000
but continued to take classes, right?

02:59:59.840 --> 03:00:02.080
And he took a calligraphy class

03:00:02.080 --> 03:00:04.880
and it influenced the design of the Mac

03:00:05.400 --> 03:00:06.360
and sort of fonts and, you know,

03:00:06.360 --> 03:00:09.800
just was something that he had no, you know,

03:00:09.800 --> 03:00:11.360
sense of what it was gonna be useful for.

03:00:11.360 --> 03:00:13.560
And his lesson was, you know,

03:00:13.560 --> 03:00:16.720
you can't connect the dots looking forward.

03:00:16.720 --> 03:00:19.840
You know, looking back, you can see all the pieces

03:00:19.840 --> 03:00:22.480
that sort of led you to where you ended up.

03:00:22.480 --> 03:00:24.880
And for me, studying truck driving,

03:00:24.880 --> 03:00:27.080
like, I mean, I literally went to graduate school

03:00:27.080 --> 03:00:28.840
because I was worried about climate change

03:00:28.840 --> 03:00:31.240
and like, you know, I had a whole other dissertation planned

03:00:31.240 --> 03:00:32.800
and then was like driving home and like,

03:00:32.800 --> 03:00:35.760
I had read about all this management literature

03:00:35.760 --> 03:00:37.640
and sort of like how you get workers to work hard

03:00:37.640 --> 03:00:38.960
for my qualifying exams,

03:00:38.960 --> 03:00:40.960
and then read a popular article

03:00:40.960 --> 03:00:43.960
on satellite linked computers.

03:00:43.960 --> 03:00:45.840
And the story in the literature was,

03:00:45.840 --> 03:00:47.120
you sort of sense of autonomy.

03:00:47.120 --> 03:00:49.880
And I was like, well, that monitoring

03:00:49.880 --> 03:00:51.280
must affect the sense of autonomy.

03:00:51.280 --> 03:00:54.120
And it's just this question that I found interesting,

03:00:54.120 --> 03:00:55.440
and it never in a million years

03:00:55.440 --> 03:00:57.120
that I ever thought I was gonna like,

03:00:57.120 --> 03:01:01.520
spend 15 years of my life studying truck driving.

03:01:02.520 --> 03:01:07.000
And it was like, if you were to map out a career path

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:10.280
in academia or research, like, you know,

03:01:10.280 --> 03:01:14.080
you would do none of the things that I did

03:01:14.080 --> 03:01:15.840
that many people advise me against,

03:01:15.840 --> 03:01:17.640
where like, you can't like go spend a year

03:01:17.640 --> 03:01:20.800
working as a truck driver, you know, like that's crazy.

03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:22.000
Or, you know, you can't, you know,

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.840
spend all this time trying to write like one huge book.

03:01:24.840 --> 03:01:26.400
And, you know, so I mean-

03:01:26.400 --> 03:01:28.080
By the way, if I could just interrupt,

03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:32.600
what was the fire that got you to take the leap

03:01:32.600 --> 03:01:34.560
and go and work as a truck driver

03:01:34.560 --> 03:01:36.840
and go interview truck drivers?

03:01:36.840 --> 03:01:39.720
This is what a lot of people would be incapable of doing,

03:01:39.720 --> 03:01:41.320
just took that leap.

03:01:41.320 --> 03:01:43.800
What the heck is up with your mind

03:01:43.800 --> 03:01:46.080
that allowed you to take that big leap?

03:01:46.080 --> 03:01:50.080
So I think it's probably like Tolkien

03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:51.320
and Lord of the Rings, you know?

03:01:51.320 --> 03:01:54.080
I mean, I think as a teenager, you know,

03:01:54.080 --> 03:01:57.720
I sort of adopted some sense of needing

03:01:58.400 --> 03:02:01.960
to heroically go out in the world and, you know,

03:02:01.960 --> 03:02:03.640
which I've done at various points in my life

03:02:03.640 --> 03:02:07.200
and like looking back in absolutely stupid ways

03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:08.840
that, you know, where I could have completely,

03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:11.200
I ended up dead and traumatized my family,

03:02:11.200 --> 03:02:14.720
including like I took a couple week trip in the Pacific,

03:02:14.720 --> 03:02:16.280
like solo trip on a kayak.

03:02:16.280 --> 03:02:18.640
And basically my kayaking experience up till that,

03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:20.200
you know, point had been, you know,

03:02:20.200 --> 03:02:22.440
on a fairly calm lake and like class one-

03:02:22.440 --> 03:02:24.560
Solo trip on a kayak in the Pacific.

03:02:24.560 --> 03:02:25.400
Yeah, yeah.

03:02:25.960 --> 03:02:28.600
I was working on forestry issues

03:02:28.600 --> 03:02:30.560
and we were starting a campaign

03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:33.120
up in really remote British Columbia.

03:02:33.120 --> 03:02:35.320
And I was like, okay, if I'm gonna work on this,

03:02:35.320 --> 03:02:36.760
I've got to actually go there myself

03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:38.160
and see what this is all about

03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:40.760
and see whether it's worth like devoting my sort of,

03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:42.520
you know, life right now to.

03:02:42.520 --> 03:02:45.280
And just drove up there with this kayak

03:02:45.280 --> 03:02:47.200
and, you know, put into the Pacific.

03:02:47.200 --> 03:02:52.120
And it was insane, you know, like the tides are huge.

03:02:52.120 --> 03:02:54.200
And, you know, there was one point

03:02:54.200 --> 03:02:56.440
in which I was going down a fjord

03:02:56.440 --> 03:03:00.520
and two fjords kind of came up and there was a cross channel.

03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:03.400
And I had hit the timing completely wrong.

03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:05.840
And the tide was sort of rushing up like, you know,

03:03:05.840 --> 03:03:08.640
rivers in these, you know, two fjords.

03:03:08.640 --> 03:03:11.600
And then coming through this cross channel and met

03:03:11.600 --> 03:03:14.360
and created this giant standing wave

03:03:14.360 --> 03:03:16.360
that I had to paddle through.

03:03:16.360 --> 03:03:19.680
And now actually very recently I've gone out on Whitewater

03:03:19.680 --> 03:03:21.800
with some people who know what the hell they're doing.

03:03:21.800 --> 03:03:26.280
And I realized like just how absolutely stupid

03:03:26.280 --> 03:03:28.360
and, you know, ill fit I was.

03:03:28.360 --> 03:03:31.160
But that's just, I think I've always had that.

03:03:31.160 --> 03:03:33.520
Were you afraid when you had that wave before you?

03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:35.160
That wave scared the shit out of me, yeah.

03:03:35.160 --> 03:03:39.120
Okay, what about taking a leap and becoming a trucker?

03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:41.120
Yeah, there was some nervousness for sure.

03:03:41.120 --> 03:03:44.120
I mean, and, you know, I guess my advantage

03:03:44.120 --> 03:03:48.960
as an ethnographer is I grew up in a blue collar environment.

03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:52.880
You know, again, all my ancestor for factory workers.

03:03:52.880 --> 03:03:56.640
So I can move through spaces.

03:03:56.640 --> 03:04:01.520
I'm really, I feel, I can become comfortable

03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:03.920
in lots and lots of places, you know, not everywhere,

03:04:03.920 --> 03:04:07.120
but, you know, along class lines for sort of white,

03:04:07.120 --> 03:04:09.240
you know, even white ethnic workers.

03:04:09.240 --> 03:04:11.320
Like that's, you know, I can move

03:04:11.320 --> 03:04:13.120
in those spaces fairly easily.

03:04:13.120 --> 03:04:16.240
I mean, not entirely, there was one time

03:04:16.240 --> 03:04:17.480
where I was like, okay, you know,

03:04:17.480 --> 03:04:19.400
and then I grew up around people who worked on cars

03:04:19.400 --> 03:04:22.120
and I'd been to drag races and NASCAR.

03:04:22.120 --> 03:04:24.600
And I'd been to, you know, Colgate University.

03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:26.800
And so I'd, and I think that was probably

03:04:26.800 --> 03:04:28.400
my initial training was, you know,

03:04:28.400 --> 03:04:32.520
being this just working class kid who ends up in this,

03:04:32.520 --> 03:04:36.200
you know, sort of blue blood, small liberal arts college

03:04:36.200 --> 03:04:39.640
and just feeling like, you know,

03:04:39.640 --> 03:04:42.000
both having the entire world opened up to me

03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:43.880
like philosophy and Buddhism

03:04:43.880 --> 03:04:46.800
and things that I never heard of, you know,

03:04:46.880 --> 03:04:48.960
and just became totally obsessed with

03:04:48.960 --> 03:04:52.400
and just like, you know, just following my interests.

03:04:52.400 --> 03:04:55.400
But also culturally perhaps didn't feel like you fit in.

03:04:55.400 --> 03:04:57.800
Feeling like just a fish out of water.

03:04:57.800 --> 03:04:59.840
I just, you know, but, and at the same time,

03:04:59.840 --> 03:05:02.120
that, you know, sort of drove me in the sense

03:05:02.120 --> 03:05:04.320
that it drove an opening of my mind

03:05:04.320 --> 03:05:06.080
because I couldn't understand it.

03:05:06.080 --> 03:05:09.800
You know, I was like, I didn't know that this world existed.

03:05:09.800 --> 03:05:11.760
I don't understand.

03:05:11.760 --> 03:05:14.640
And I think maybe that's where my real first step

03:05:14.680 --> 03:05:17.160
in trying to understand other people

03:05:17.160 --> 03:05:18.600
because they were my friends, you know?

03:05:18.600 --> 03:05:19.920
I mean, they were my teammates.

03:05:19.920 --> 03:05:21.280
I played lacrosse in college.

03:05:21.280 --> 03:05:22.760
So like, you know, I was close to people

03:05:22.760 --> 03:05:25.840
who came from such different backgrounds than I did.

03:05:25.840 --> 03:05:29.360
And I just, I was so confused, you know?

03:05:29.360 --> 03:05:32.000
And so I think I learned to learn

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:34.200
and then, you know, sort of went from there.

03:05:34.200 --> 03:05:36.040
And then develop your fascination with people.

03:05:36.040 --> 03:05:39.000
And the funny thing is you went from trucking now

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:40.240
to autonomous trucks.

03:05:40.240 --> 03:05:41.760
I mean, just speaking of not being able

03:05:41.760 --> 03:05:45.160
to connect the dots and, you know, your life

03:05:45.160 --> 03:05:48.960
in the next 10 years could take very interesting directions

03:05:48.960 --> 03:05:50.240
and very difficult.

03:05:50.240 --> 03:05:53.360
First of all, us meeting is a funny little thing

03:05:53.360 --> 03:05:57.320
given the things I'm working on with robots currently.

03:05:57.320 --> 03:06:00.760
But, you know, it may not relate to trucks at all.

03:06:00.760 --> 03:06:03.320
There's, at a certain point,

03:06:03.320 --> 03:06:06.640
autonomous trucks are just robots.

03:06:06.640 --> 03:06:08.720
And then it starts getting into a conversation

03:06:08.720 --> 03:06:11.640
about the roles of robots in society.

03:06:12.480 --> 03:06:15.560
And the roles of humans and robots.

03:06:15.560 --> 03:06:18.400
And that interplay is right up your alley.

03:06:19.720 --> 03:06:21.920
As somebody who deeply cares about humans

03:06:21.920 --> 03:06:25.080
and have somehow found themselves studying robots.

03:06:25.080 --> 03:06:26.160
Yeah, no, it's crazy.

03:06:26.160 --> 03:06:28.960
I mean, even four or five years ago,

03:06:28.960 --> 03:06:30.440
I would, if you had asked me

03:06:30.440 --> 03:06:32.080
if I was gonna be studying trucking still,

03:06:32.080 --> 03:06:33.520
I would have said no.

03:06:33.520 --> 03:06:36.840
And so my advice is, I think if I was gonna give advice,

03:06:36.840 --> 03:06:39.880
you know, is, you know, you can't connect the dots

03:06:39.880 --> 03:06:40.720
looking forward.

03:06:40.720 --> 03:06:43.440
You just gotta follow what interests you, you know?

03:06:43.440 --> 03:06:47.480
And I think we downplay, right,

03:06:47.480 --> 03:06:50.600
that when we talk to, you know, kids,

03:06:50.600 --> 03:06:52.360
especially, you know, if you have some bright gifted kid

03:06:52.360 --> 03:06:54.560
that gets identified as like, oh, you could go somewhere.

03:06:54.560 --> 03:06:55.960
Then we're like, we feed them stuff.

03:06:55.960 --> 03:06:57.080
You're like, well, learn the piano

03:06:57.080 --> 03:06:58.640
and learn another language, right?

03:06:58.640 --> 03:06:59.560
And learn robotics.

03:07:00.880 --> 03:07:03.760
And then we tell other kids like, oh, learn a trade.

03:07:03.760 --> 03:07:05.320
You know, like figure out what's gonna pay well.

03:07:05.320 --> 03:07:06.800
And not that there's anything against trades.

03:07:06.800 --> 03:07:10.040
I think everyone should learn like manual skills

03:07:10.040 --> 03:07:10.880
to make things.

03:07:10.880 --> 03:07:13.720
I think it's incredibly satisfying and wonderful.

03:07:13.720 --> 03:07:15.080
And we need more of that.

03:07:15.080 --> 03:07:18.200
But also, you know, tell, you know, all kids,

03:07:18.200 --> 03:07:20.720
it's okay to like take a class in something random

03:07:20.720 --> 03:07:22.040
that you don't think you're gonna get

03:07:22.040 --> 03:07:23.960
any economic return on.

03:07:23.960 --> 03:07:26.440
Because maybe you will end up going into a trade,

03:07:26.440 --> 03:07:30.040
but that class that you took in studio art

03:07:30.040 --> 03:07:31.960
is gonna mean that, you know,

03:07:31.960 --> 03:07:33.640
you look at buildings differently, right?

03:07:33.640 --> 03:07:36.440
Or you end up sort of putting your own stamp on,

03:07:36.440 --> 03:07:38.360
you know, woodworking, you know?

03:07:39.160 --> 03:07:42.400
I think that's the key is like follow, you know,

03:07:42.400 --> 03:07:44.560
it's cheesy because everybody says follow your passion.

03:07:44.560 --> 03:07:48.720
But, you know, we say that, and then we just, you know,

03:07:48.720 --> 03:07:51.480
the 90% of what people hear is, you know,

03:07:51.480 --> 03:07:54.200
what's the return on investment for that, you know?

03:07:54.200 --> 03:07:55.920
It's like, you're a human being.

03:07:55.920 --> 03:07:58.400
Like things interest you, music interests you,

03:07:58.400 --> 03:08:00.840
literature interests you, video games interest you,

03:08:00.840 --> 03:08:02.400
like follow it, you know?

03:08:02.400 --> 03:08:04.680
Go grab a kayak and go into the...

03:08:04.680 --> 03:08:05.800
Go do something real.

03:08:05.800 --> 03:08:07.280
No, don't do that.

03:08:07.320 --> 03:08:11.000
Go do something stupid and something you'll regret

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:11.840
a lot later.

03:08:11.840 --> 03:08:13.840
My poor mother, thank God she didn't know.

03:08:13.840 --> 03:08:16.840
Well, let me ask, because for a lot of people, work,

03:08:16.840 --> 03:08:20.440
for me it is, quote unquote, work is a source of meaning.

03:08:20.440 --> 03:08:24.480
And at the core of something we've been talking about

03:08:24.480 --> 03:08:27.280
with jobs is meaning.

03:08:27.280 --> 03:08:28.720
So the big ridiculous question,

03:08:28.720 --> 03:08:31.440
what do you think is the meaning of life?

03:08:31.440 --> 03:08:36.280
Do you think work for us humans in modern society

03:08:36.320 --> 03:08:38.800
is as core to that meaning?

03:08:38.800 --> 03:08:42.240
Is that something you think about in your work?

03:08:42.240 --> 03:08:43.840
Sort of the deeper question of meaning,

03:08:43.840 --> 03:08:46.720
not just financial wellbeing and the quality of life,

03:08:46.720 --> 03:08:49.160
but the deeper search for meaning?

03:08:50.160 --> 03:08:53.720
Yeah, the meaning of life is love

03:08:53.720 --> 03:08:56.880
and you can find love in your work.

03:08:57.760 --> 03:09:00.520
Now, and I don't think everybody can.

03:09:00.520 --> 03:09:02.920
There are a lot of jobs out there that just, you know,

03:09:02.920 --> 03:09:04.160
you do it for a paycheck.

03:09:04.160 --> 03:09:08.520
And I think we do have to be, you know, honest about that.

03:09:08.520 --> 03:09:10.240
There are a lot of people who, you know,

03:09:10.240 --> 03:09:12.280
don't love their jobs and, you know,

03:09:12.280 --> 03:09:15.920
we don't have jobs that they're gonna love, you know,

03:09:15.920 --> 03:09:18.480
and maybe that's not a sort of realistic, you know,

03:09:18.480 --> 03:09:20.560
that's a utopia, right?

03:09:20.560 --> 03:09:24.120
But for those of us that have the luxury, I mean,

03:09:24.120 --> 03:09:29.120
I think you love what you do that people say that.

03:09:30.040 --> 03:09:35.040
I think the key, you know, for real happiness

03:09:35.280 --> 03:09:37.960
is to love what you're trying to achieve.

03:09:37.960 --> 03:09:40.400
And maybe you love trying to build a company

03:09:40.400 --> 03:09:42.840
and make a lot of money just for the sake of doing that.

03:09:42.840 --> 03:09:44.520
But I think the people who, you know,

03:09:44.520 --> 03:09:47.360
are really happy and have great impacts, you know,

03:09:47.360 --> 03:09:49.760
they love what they do because it has an impact

03:09:49.760 --> 03:09:53.800
on the world that they think expresses that love, right?

03:09:53.800 --> 03:09:57.600
And that could be, you know, at a counseling center,

03:09:57.640 --> 03:10:00.520
that could be, you know, in your community,

03:10:00.520 --> 03:10:04.080
that could be sending people to Mars, you know.

03:10:04.080 --> 03:10:06.160
Well, I also think it doesn't necessarily,

03:10:06.160 --> 03:10:07.880
the expression of love isn't necessary

03:10:07.880 --> 03:10:10.320
about helping other people directly.

03:10:10.320 --> 03:10:12.360
There's something about craftsmanship and skill,

03:10:12.360 --> 03:10:13.840
as we've talked about,

03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:16.720
that's almost like you're celebrating humanity

03:10:16.720 --> 03:10:21.720
by like searching for mastery in the task.

03:10:23.600 --> 03:10:27.440
Especially tasks that people outside may see

03:10:28.280 --> 03:10:30.040
as menial, as not important.

03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:33.200
Nevertheless, searching for mastery,

03:10:33.200 --> 03:10:34.800
for excellence in that task.

03:10:34.800 --> 03:10:38.040
There's something deeply human to that and also fulfilling

03:10:38.040 --> 03:10:42.880
that just like driving a truck and getting damn good at it.

03:10:42.880 --> 03:10:45.480
Like, you know, the best who's ever lived

03:10:45.480 --> 03:10:48.440
at driving the truck and taking pride in that,

03:10:48.440 --> 03:10:50.800
that's deeply meaningful.

03:10:50.800 --> 03:10:55.360
And also like a real celebration of humanity

03:10:55.400 --> 03:10:59.200
and a real show of love, I think, for humanity.

03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:00.720
Yeah.

03:11:00.720 --> 03:11:02.040
Yeah, I just had my floors redone

03:11:02.040 --> 03:11:04.200
and the guy who did it was, he was an artist.

03:11:04.200 --> 03:11:06.200
You know, he sanded these old, 100-year-old floors

03:11:06.200 --> 03:11:08.840
and made them look gorgeous and this is craft.

03:11:08.840 --> 03:11:10.440
That's love right there.

03:11:10.440 --> 03:11:12.560
Yeah, I mean, he showed us some love.

03:11:12.560 --> 03:11:15.320
You know, the product was just like,

03:11:15.320 --> 03:11:17.400
it's enriching our lives.

03:11:17.400 --> 03:11:19.520
Steve, this was an amazing conversation.

03:11:19.520 --> 03:11:21.000
We've covered a lot of ground.

03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:23.320
Your work, just like you said,

03:11:23.320 --> 03:11:24.840
impossible to connect the dots,

03:11:24.840 --> 03:11:28.280
but I'm glad you did all the amazing work you did.

03:11:28.280 --> 03:11:31.280
You're exploring human nature at the core

03:11:31.280 --> 03:11:35.040
of what America is, the blue collar America.

03:11:35.040 --> 03:11:36.400
So thank you for your work.

03:11:36.400 --> 03:11:38.760
Thank you for the care and the love you put in your work.

03:11:38.760 --> 03:11:40.280
And thank you so much for spending

03:11:40.280 --> 03:11:42.360
your valuable time with me.

03:11:42.360 --> 03:11:43.480
I appreciate it, Lex.

03:11:43.480 --> 03:11:46.000
I'm a big fan, so it's just been great to be on.

03:11:47.160 --> 03:11:49.040

03:11:49.040 --> 03:11:50.600

03:11:58.480 --> 03:12:00.840
If you cannot do great things,

03:12:00.840 --> 03:12:03.800
do small things in a great way.

03:12:04.880 --> 03:12:07.920
