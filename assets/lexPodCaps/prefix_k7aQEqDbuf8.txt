00:00.000 --> 00:01.560
Habib beat Connor.

00:02.600 --> 00:05.480
Putin was on FaceTime before he even made it to the, to the locker room.

00:05.880 --> 00:10.960
Um, Trump sitting president, ex-president watching all the fights, calling

00:10.960 --> 00:12.080
wants to talk about the fights.

00:12.560 --> 00:15.920
Um, Valentina Shevchenko, every time she goes home, she meets with

00:15.920 --> 00:16.760
the president of the country.

00:16.960 --> 00:18.480
The list goes on and on and on.

00:18.720 --> 00:22.080
The most powerful Elon Musk, Zuckerberg.

00:22.360 --> 00:23.840
I mean, the list goes on and on and on.

00:24.280 --> 00:28.040
The most powerful people in the world are all obsessed with fighting.

00:30.640 --> 00:35.520
The following is a conversation with Dana White, the president of the UFC,

00:35.880 --> 00:40.400
a mixed martial arts organization that revolutionized the art, the sport,

00:40.400 --> 00:41.520
and the business of fighting.

00:41.880 --> 00:46.280
And Dana is truly the mastermind behind the UFC.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.200
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.480
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:52.840 --> 00:56.120
And now dear friends, here's Dana White.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.240
Do you remember when you saw your first fight?

01:00.080 --> 01:00.840
I think so.

01:01.080 --> 01:05.720
I remember being at my grandmother's house and I think it was an Ali fight.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.680
And all my uncles were going crazy during the fight.

01:08.680 --> 01:12.760
And it was just this buzz and this energy in the house that I

01:12.760 --> 01:14.680
liked at a very young age.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.680
And I'm pretty sure that was my first fight.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.320
Ali was something special.

01:18.400 --> 01:18.800
Yeah.

01:18.960 --> 01:19.560
Incredible.

01:19.760 --> 01:24.960
I mean, when you look around, um, not just here in the office, but at my

01:24.960 --> 01:27.440
house, Ali and Tyson are everywhere.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.920
Would you put Ali as the greatest of all time boxing?

01:30.160 --> 01:34.920
Well, I would put Ali as the greatest all time human being.

01:35.440 --> 01:40.640
I mean, when you, it's, it's, it's easy as a fight fan to

01:40.640 --> 01:43.240
focus on him as a fighter.

01:43.560 --> 01:48.840
But when you focus on him as a human and you think about what he meant at that

01:48.840 --> 01:54.360
time and place, the things he said, the poems he came up with, uh, you know,

01:54.600 --> 02:02.200
just, just the overall brilliance of Muhammad Ali, um, the guts, the guts to

02:02.200 --> 02:06.480
have the strength mentally, physically, and emotionally to go against the grain

02:07.000 --> 02:10.960
at the time that he did it was a very dangerous time for him to be who he was.

02:11.720 --> 02:18.040
Um, yet because of how smart he was and because of his personality and how, if

02:18.040 --> 02:22.600
you sat down with them, you could, you could be the biggest racist on the planet.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.720
It's hard to get in a room with Ali and not like Ali.

02:26.000 --> 02:26.400
Yeah.

02:26.440 --> 02:32.120
He's all love, humor, all of it and had the guts in the ring and the

02:32.120 --> 02:35.480
guts to take a stand when it was hard.

02:35.720 --> 02:39.680
He might be one of the all time greatest humans.

02:39.840 --> 02:40.520
You know what I mean?

02:40.920 --> 02:46.680
Just an impactful, powerful human being who happened to be a great boxer.

02:47.120 --> 02:51.120
And sometimes the right moment meets the, the great human being.

02:51.120 --> 02:51.840
That's important.

02:52.040 --> 02:52.880
I agree with you.

02:52.920 --> 02:56.360
And he was the right guy in the right place at the right time.

02:56.640 --> 03:02.280
And he's also a guy who used his platform for all the right things.

03:02.920 --> 03:06.920
So that might've been your first fight, but when did you fall in love with

03:06.920 --> 03:09.480
fighting the art of it, the science of it?

03:09.520 --> 03:11.960
Yeah, I would say I really fell in love with it.

03:12.600 --> 03:19.360
So I was a senior, it was 1987 and Hagler Leonard happened.

03:20.000 --> 03:20.280
Yeah.

03:20.640 --> 03:25.200
And I watched that fight and I taped it and I watched that

03:25.200 --> 03:26.640
fight like a million times.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.280
I was a huge, huge Hagler fan.

03:29.880 --> 03:33.720
And, uh, I like sugar Ray Leonard too, but I was a huge Hagler fan.

03:34.360 --> 03:38.160
And, uh, you know, I just remember I watched that fight a million times

03:38.520 --> 03:42.840
because I was, I was pissed off and I felt like Hagler got robbed in the

03:42.840 --> 03:43.880
fight, you know what I mean?

03:44.400 --> 03:49.080
But it, that was really what made me start to love the sport of boxing.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.040
The battle of it.

03:50.280 --> 03:51.960
Like, yeah, I was 17.

03:53.000 --> 04:00.560
And then after that, um, USA Tuesday night fights, uh, came out on television

04:00.560 --> 04:04.200
was on every Tuesday night, religiously never missed Tuesday night fights.

04:04.200 --> 04:09.920
I was there, watched all those fights and, uh, you know, a lot of, uh, a lot

04:09.920 --> 04:16.160
of the, the things you see in the UFC, not, not necessarily, um, just the

04:16.160 --> 04:22.960
production, but I would say the, um, the feel and the style and all those things

04:22.960 --> 04:28.800
are, are all things that I, things that I loved about boxing and things that

04:28.800 --> 04:34.600
I hated about boxing, right down to the commentary you loved and hated, hated

04:34.600 --> 04:38.520
the, yeah, hated the commentary, certain things that I loved about boxing.

04:38.600 --> 04:42.920
I incorporated into the UFC things that I hated about boxing.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.400
I made sure that the UFC stayed far away from.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.600
I think I can't stand Larry Merchant, can't stand Larry Merchant.

04:49.720 --> 04:54.440
And I used to watch HBO boxing and mute the commentary so that

04:54.440 --> 04:55.680
I didn't have to listen to them.

04:56.120 --> 05:02.040
Um, Lampley too, uh, you know, you, you would, you would spend this money for

05:02.040 --> 05:06.320
the pay-per-view to watch these people that you idolized to hear these idiots,

05:06.320 --> 05:09.280
rip them apart while the fight was happening, you know, they were

05:09.280 --> 05:11.040
criticizing or taking them apart.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.200
I've gotten used to the UFC.

05:12.200 --> 05:15.320
So I don't, I'm trying to remember looking back, it was bad, it was bad.

05:15.360 --> 05:21.000
It was really bad, but, uh, that the sweet science, the art of boxing was beautiful.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.320
Still like the stories.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.920
I want to do this with you right now.

05:24.440 --> 05:28.120
Hey, we, we, we bring your cell phone over here and, and pull up YouTube.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.920
I want to do this for you so that you, you can understand this and understand

05:31.920 --> 05:35.680
where I was coming from for the commentary at this point in time.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.200
I have all good memories.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.320
You're going to ruin it for me.

05:38.320 --> 05:42.520
But the presentation and, and, and a lot of things, but it, but it's, how

05:42.520 --> 05:45.520
fucking weird is it that I even cared about this shit at that point in my life?

05:45.520 --> 05:49.720
And that time in my life, like what impact could I possibly have on it?

05:50.600 --> 05:54.240
So think about Tyson and how much everybody loved Tyson at the time.

05:54.240 --> 05:59.000
And when I listen to this, listen to this entrance of the former undisputed

05:59.000 --> 06:01.640
heavyweight champion, and here he comes.

06:01.640 --> 06:05.080
He's coming to the ring, he's coming to the ring, he's coming to the ring, he's

06:05.080 --> 06:08.040
coming to the ring, he's coming to the ring, he's coming to the ring, he's

06:08.520 --> 06:13.440
Mike Tyson as he heads toward the same ring, he made his distasteful exit in June

06:13.440 --> 06:17.760
of 90, one of the baddest motherfucking walk-ins of all time, by the way.

06:18.240 --> 06:18.600
Right.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.680
So what this guy should be doing.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.080
And this is one of the Albert brothers.

06:23.200 --> 06:23.520
Yeah.

06:23.960 --> 06:24.880
Shut the fuck up.

06:25.240 --> 06:25.640
Yeah.

06:25.880 --> 06:26.680
Stay out of the way.

06:26.760 --> 06:27.120
Yeah.

06:28.880 --> 06:29.760
Maybe build them up.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.640
Or that, or don't say anything.

06:32.880 --> 06:37.800
Just let the fans, that's why that's why we paid our money.

06:38.200 --> 06:42.240
You don't need to say anything scary, imposing music.

06:46.760 --> 06:50.520
Will he be able to intimidate his opponent tonight?

06:50.560 --> 06:51.480
Will it even matter?

06:52.120 --> 06:59.040
I really thought that the more of an explosion by the crowd here, but very

06:59.040 --> 07:04.880
mixed, even with the wind tonight, no matter how one sided, he will still

07:04.880 --> 07:10.640
have his detractors following the two fights to with Holyfield.

07:10.640 --> 07:11.640
His stock plummeted.

07:11.640 --> 07:15.680
The pundits came down hard feeling they were due at his knockouts.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.840
We're over second rate fighters.

07:17.960 --> 07:23.920
Now the crowd erupts more as he gets into the ring, but it's

07:23.920 --> 07:25.560
certainly nothing overwhelming.

07:27.240 --> 07:28.080
What a dick.

07:28.680 --> 07:29.400
You're right.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.160
I don't remember that.

07:31.200 --> 07:31.960
You're right.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.000
Imagine.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.480
You're right.

07:34.520 --> 07:39.120
You, you, you, you paid your money to watch Mike Tyson and you got to listen

07:39.120 --> 07:43.320
to these fucking jerk offs, talk shit about them the whole way to the right.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.640
First of all, one of the coolest walk-ins ever, you know, first time

07:47.320 --> 07:49.120
anybody had heard DMX, right?

07:49.240 --> 07:53.800
And, uh, you know, he's walking into some scary, imposing music.

07:53.800 --> 07:57.560
Will it even matter whether, you know, it's just all that kind of stuff.

07:57.560 --> 08:04.400
I literally used to analyze every ounce of the production that would happen

08:04.400 --> 08:09.400
on television and, uh, at a time when I didn't even know why I was doing it.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.120
But, but it's in there somewhere.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.640
Like you were thinking about it, right?

08:12.920 --> 08:16.080
So yeah, I hated HBO, uh, commentary.

08:16.080 --> 08:21.440
I thought, you know, at the time HBO boxing was obviously the gold standard

08:21.440 --> 08:25.000
for, you know, but when you really think about boxing at that time, their

08:25.000 --> 08:28.800
production, the only thing that changed over 30 years was like HD.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.920
I mean, even the commentators were the same for 30 years.

08:31.920 --> 08:36.760
And then you had the time when Larry Merchant gets up and literally starts

08:37.280 --> 08:41.400
fighting with Floyd Mayweather during the interview and says, if I was 30 years

08:41.400 --> 08:42.960
younger, I'd kick your ass right now.

08:43.040 --> 08:43.880
Oh yeah, I remember that.

08:44.320 --> 08:47.720
I mean, these are the interviews that we have to listen to when we're

08:47.720 --> 08:49.160
trying to watch a boxing match.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.680
The level of boxing was good.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.080
Think about a fighter, right?

08:52.360 --> 08:57.680
Fighter has been gone for months away from their families and away from

08:57.680 --> 09:01.040
everything, training, cutting weight, sparring.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.280
Then they go in and they have to fight that night.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.560
And then you have to, you know, if you watch your fight back, you got to listen

09:06.560 --> 09:08.520
to this bullshit from these guys.

09:08.520 --> 09:12.960
And then, and then you get interviewed and your interview is, is this, it's

09:12.960 --> 09:15.200
just, and it's not just about the pay-per-view money.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.000
It's about like, these are legends of humanity.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.480
Like we should celebrate the highest form of like accomplishment.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.320
These aren't like Mike Tyson.

09:23.320 --> 09:28.120
So, you know, who goes in there and interviews fighters, Joe Rogan, right?

09:28.200 --> 09:33.400
Who has trained and done everything and has the utmost respect for the

09:33.400 --> 09:38.920
sport and the athletes, or you got like Daniel Cormier, who was a former

09:38.920 --> 09:42.040
world champion himself and has actually been through it, done it, knows.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.600
And those are the type of people that we put in the booth, people that

09:44.600 --> 09:45.760
are actually experienced in it.

09:46.400 --> 09:50.320
Not, not, not, not these people who've never been in a fight in

09:50.320 --> 09:51.640
their fucking life, right?

09:52.160 --> 09:52.480
Yeah.

09:52.520 --> 09:56.120
But they're also both DC and Rogan are like big kids.

09:56.200 --> 09:56.880
They love it.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.080
A hundred percent love it.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.000
Well, everybody does.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.480
I mean, if you look at it, it's the difference between our commentary

10:02.480 --> 10:04.120
and what I feel their commentary was.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.600
We don't hire paid talking heads.

10:07.120 --> 10:13.000
We hire people that have actually been in it, done it, love it, and are

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
super, super passionate about the sport.

10:15.720 --> 10:20.320
And I would say that none of them that ever covered the sport back then were.

10:20.960 --> 10:24.760
I don't know if that was Marv Albert or what Albert brother that was, but he

10:24.800 --> 10:30.840
sound like he's a fan of the sport or anyway, you got me, you, you got me on

10:30.840 --> 10:33.400
this and I lose my mind.

10:34.480 --> 10:38.480
Maybe we wouldn't, we wouldn't have a UFC if they didn't fuck it up so bad.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.240
And for the types, it would be different.

10:40.240 --> 10:40.960
You're not wrong.

10:40.960 --> 10:41.560
You're not wrong.

10:41.560 --> 10:42.280
It would be different.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.240
There's no doubt about it.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.840
All those experiences growing up, being a boxing fan, help

10:46.840 --> 10:48.320
create what the UFC is today.

10:49.200 --> 10:52.440
You know, it's interesting because humans have been fighting for millennia.

10:53.080 --> 10:58.440
And it seems like with the UFC, the rate of innovation is just insane.

10:58.440 --> 11:03.320
In these last three decades, it seems like we've discovered how to do unarmed

11:03.320 --> 11:09.200
combat faster and better than, than at any time in human history.

11:09.480 --> 11:10.760
I agree with you a hundred percent.

11:11.240 --> 11:14.920
Um, the first UFC happened in 1993, right?

11:14.920 --> 11:16.360
Martial art versus martial art.

11:16.400 --> 11:16.680
Yeah.

11:16.880 --> 11:21.920
And now over the last 30 years, martial arts has evolved faster

11:21.960 --> 11:22.880
than, you know what I mean?

11:22.880 --> 11:28.120
And, and, and like you just said, combat sports, fighting, whatever

11:28.120 --> 11:29.480
you want to call it, martial arts.

11:29.840 --> 11:35.480
It has evolved so much in 30 years, more than the last 300 years.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.200
What did you think when you saw UFC one with hoists?

11:39.040 --> 11:42.200
I remember everybody talking that this fight was going to happen and there

11:42.200 --> 11:44.760
was going to be no rules and all this other stuff and we're like, there's

11:44.760 --> 11:45.800
no way that's bullshit.

11:46.960 --> 11:50.280
And then we ended up at some guy's house that night in Boston and watching

11:50.280 --> 11:54.200
it and it was happening and it was fun and it was exciting and everything else.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.440
And then, uh, and then I sort of fell off after that.

11:57.480 --> 12:01.440
The first one I, I watched, but I was too big of a boxing fan.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.920
Plus once grappling started taking over and, you know, by grappling, meaning

12:05.600 --> 12:09.560
the wrestling and the, and the jujitsu guys had just laid there, you know, I

12:09.560 --> 12:10.680
completely lost interest.

12:11.320 --> 12:14.200
It's funny that I'm having this conversation with you right now, because

12:14.200 --> 12:18.600
last night I was out last night with my friends and we were talking about, um,

12:19.360 --> 12:23.840
cause one, one of my buddies who's a host here in town just did jujitsu for

12:23.840 --> 12:26.040
the first time yesterday.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.480
And he was like, did he get his ass kicked?

12:28.760 --> 12:32.520
But when you first go in, our first jujitsu lesson, me, Lorenzo and

12:32.520 --> 12:33.880
Frank was with John Lewis.

12:34.520 --> 12:39.600
And I remember thinking, Holy shit.

12:40.440 --> 12:47.400
I, I, I can't believe that I'm, you know, 28 years old and this is the first time

12:47.400 --> 12:51.560
I'm experiencing this, that another human being could do this to me on the ground.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.560
It is such an eye opening, mind blowing experience when you do it for the first

12:56.560 --> 13:02.120
time and then you become completely addicted to it and you know, we were

13:02.120 --> 13:06.720
training three, four days a week, trying to kill each other and, and, uh, me and

13:06.720 --> 13:10.520
the frittitas and that's how we fell in love with the sport.

13:10.560 --> 13:15.720
I think that first time that you do jujitsu, it's like the red pill

13:15.720 --> 13:16.960
and the blue pill in the matrix.

13:17.040 --> 13:21.040
Do you want to believe that this is the world that you live in or do you want

13:21.040 --> 13:22.440
to see what the real world looks like?

13:22.680 --> 13:24.040
Just as a real red pill.

13:24.120 --> 13:24.880
It really is.

13:24.960 --> 13:29.880
You realize, Holy shit, all that shit talking I've been doing about me being a

13:29.880 --> 13:33.840
bad ass, you realize you're not, you get dominated by another human being.

13:33.840 --> 13:34.680
You realize, no.

13:35.360 --> 13:36.280
And I mean, dominate.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.560
I mean, completely treat you like you're a little kid.

13:41.040 --> 13:45.600
And then we had the opportunity to roll with a lot of different guys at the time

13:45.600 --> 13:49.960
because of the whatever, and we don't have a good relationship at all, but I'll

13:49.960 --> 13:56.600
tell you this Frank Shamrock came in one day and Frank Shamrock had me in a side

13:56.600 --> 14:02.920
control, the pressure that this guy put on my chest made me tap.

14:03.520 --> 14:08.320
Felt like there was a car on my chest and with zero effort from him.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.200
It was absolutely effortless.

14:10.680 --> 14:17.920
And when you train with somebody that's at such a level when you're not, it just,

14:17.920 --> 14:22.520
it is the most humbling, mind blowing experience you can have, especially as a

14:22.520 --> 14:26.800
man, but as a human being, do you remember just for fun?

14:26.800 --> 14:29.840
Do you remember like what your go-to submission was?

14:30.320 --> 14:30.680
Yeah.

14:30.720 --> 14:34.320
So, you know, when we first started out and started doing it, I had a pretty

14:34.320 --> 14:37.280
good guillotine in the beginning, so I'd catch a lot of people in guillotines.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.040
And you're okay being on like on bottom.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.640
So like, yeah, I was okay with the bottom.

14:40.640 --> 14:40.880
Yeah.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.080
I was okay with being on bottom.

14:42.080 --> 14:45.320
I was comfortable there, but you know what I never liked?

14:45.320 --> 14:46.240
I never liked a gi.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.440
Like we started fucking around with a gi in the beginning.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.320
We would, you know, that's how we started.

14:50.760 --> 14:55.120
And then once I took the gi off, I felt like I had no submissions because I

14:55.120 --> 14:56.280
couldn't grab onto anything.

14:56.760 --> 15:01.080
So I, after that, I went all no gi and I never wanted to wear a gi.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.440
And it's fascinating because no gi has become big now.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.720
And there's a lot of interesting people.

15:04.760 --> 15:09.960
I got trained on Gordon Ryan and like the level there is just fascinating.

15:09.960 --> 15:13.680
It's become like the science and it looks like fighting now.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.560
It looks more like fighting as opposed to with the gi.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.280
Sometimes it doesn't quite look like fighting.

15:18.560 --> 15:18.880
Right.

15:19.040 --> 15:24.400
And I feel like it's a transferable to actual like MMA fighting, no gi stuff.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.000
Or street.

15:25.240 --> 15:25.680
Street.

15:25.840 --> 15:26.040
Yeah.

15:26.040 --> 15:26.400
Right.

15:27.240 --> 15:31.560
I mean, if you're, if you start off in your first year, you're in a gi.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.160
I mean, you better hope guys got like winter jackets on or something.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.320
That's something that happens in the street.

15:36.320 --> 15:40.720
Cause in my opinion, I know all the jujitsu fucking people are gonna go crazy

15:40.720 --> 15:44.280
over this, but in my opinion, no gi is way better than gi.

15:44.600 --> 15:45.000
That's it.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.040
I also do judo.

15:46.040 --> 15:51.400
So in the street scenario, if you're comfortable on the feet and you can clench

15:51.400 --> 15:56.040
and you can throw, you can, because most of us wear clothing, especially in

15:56.040 --> 15:59.680
Boston and what you're saying, so if you're comfortable on the feet, you

15:59.680 --> 16:01.560
could still do well there.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.240
The problem with jujitsu is most people are not comfortable on the feet.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.840
The sports jujitsu, most people kind of want to get to the

16:06.840 --> 16:08.080
ground as quickly as possible.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.400
So what'd you think of hoists at that time?

16:11.400 --> 16:14.480
Like in the early, like what, cause it blew a lot of people's minds that

16:14.480 --> 16:17.560
there's like more to this puzzle.

16:17.640 --> 16:18.280
A hundred percent.

16:18.280 --> 16:23.920
And the fact that you had, um, like these guys like Ken Shamrock that were jacked,

16:24.200 --> 16:29.120
right, and you had all these wrestlers or, you know, the big massive guys,

16:29.560 --> 16:32.920
that they had in the different weight classes and this skinny little dude,

16:32.920 --> 16:35.520
like hoist was out there beating everybody.

16:35.920 --> 16:39.160
I mean, if you look at the way that the Gracie's played that, you

16:39.160 --> 16:42.520
couldn't have had a better advertisement for, for Gracie jujitsu at the time.

16:42.680 --> 16:49.400
But also like for MMA, because there's just like a lot of surprising elements.

16:49.400 --> 16:52.040
A lot of people's prediction was wrong.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.920
They didn't think the skinny guy would win and they're like,

16:54.920 --> 16:56.480
oh shit, there's more to this.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.480
What's the real beautiful thing about jujitsu?

16:58.480 --> 17:01.320
It's like when you talk about, if you wanted to get your

17:01.320 --> 17:04.760
daughter into a martial art, should I put my daughter into karate?

17:04.760 --> 17:05.600
Or should I put her into this?

17:06.000 --> 17:09.720
You put your daughter into jujitsu a hundred percent because it's

17:09.720 --> 17:11.560
not about size or strength.

17:11.560 --> 17:12.560
It's about technique.

17:13.160 --> 17:18.480
And you give your daughter a bunch of jujitsu and a little bit of Muay Thai.

17:19.480 --> 17:20.920
You know, she becomes dangerous.

17:20.920 --> 17:24.160
It's like the perfect combo because you can put your son into anything.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.280
Your son can get into some, you know, boys are going to learn how to fight

17:27.280 --> 17:29.600
and they're going to do whatever, but girls are, girls are different.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.640
And the other thing, I mean, this is the biggest selling point for

17:32.640 --> 17:33.640
jujitsu for women.

17:33.640 --> 17:37.000
I mean, when a woman, no matter how big, how small can put a

17:37.000 --> 17:38.960
guy to sleep in three and a half seconds.

17:39.520 --> 17:43.720
What's the origin story of the UFC as it is today, as you've created it

17:43.720 --> 17:47.440
and you and Lorenzo and Fertito brothers built it.

17:48.080 --> 17:52.520
It started with, with John Lewis, you know, and, and, and seeing him,

17:52.520 --> 17:56.120
Frank and I were out one night at the hard rock and John Lewis was there.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.800
And he's like, Oh, that's that ultimate fighting guy.

17:59.240 --> 18:02.560
And I was like, I know him and Frank's like, I've always wanted

18:02.560 --> 18:05.040
to learn, uh, ground fighting.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.280
And I said, yeah, I'm interested in it too.

18:08.320 --> 18:12.280
So we went over, we talked to John Lewis and we made an appointment

18:13.320 --> 18:14.600
to wrestle with him on Monday.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.240
And we told Lorenzo and Lorenzo came with us.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.840
And, uh, that was the beginning of the end.

18:20.840 --> 18:25.920
I mean, we started doing jujitsu and started to meet a lot of the fighters.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.600
And we were like, you know, at the time there was a stigma attached to the sport

18:29.600 --> 18:33.560
that these guys were, you know, Despicable, disgusting human beings,

18:33.560 --> 18:35.280
but which was the furthest thing from the truth.

18:35.280 --> 18:39.000
These, these kids, uh, had all gone to college, had college degrees.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.720
Most of them, cause they wrestled in college and we started to meet

18:42.720 --> 18:44.280
something, we loved the different stories.

18:44.640 --> 18:48.160
You had Chuck Liddell who, you know, had this Mohawk looks like an ax

18:48.160 --> 18:53.560
murder and, uh, but graduated from Cal Poly, uh, you know, with

18:53.560 --> 18:55.440
honors and accounting, you know?

18:55.840 --> 18:59.240
Then you had Matt Hughes, who was this farm boy, you know,

18:59.280 --> 19:00.480
literally lived on a farm.

19:00.480 --> 19:05.000
And so there were all these cool stories with all these good people that

19:05.000 --> 19:06.280
weren't what people thought they were.

19:06.760 --> 19:11.280
And Lorenzo and I always felt like there's something here that if this

19:11.280 --> 19:14.080
thing was done the right way, this could be big.

19:14.960 --> 19:21.080
And what was crazy was I, uh, I was in a contract negotiation with Bob

19:21.080 --> 19:24.600
Meyerwitz, the old owner of the UFC over Tito's contract.

19:24.840 --> 19:28.400
Um, and Chuck Liddell, they didn't even want Chuck Liddell in the UFC.

19:28.720 --> 19:31.040
I was trying to get Chuck in the UFC and they didn't even want him.

19:32.080 --> 19:36.440
And we got into this contract dispute over Tito's contract.

19:36.440 --> 19:37.840
And Bob Meyerwitz said, you know what?

19:38.440 --> 19:39.800
There is no more money.

19:39.800 --> 19:40.280
Okay.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.280
I don't even know if I'll even be able to put on one more event.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.320
And he like flipped out when we hung up the phone.

19:46.320 --> 19:49.440
I literally picked up the phone and called Lorenzo and I said, Hey,

19:50.040 --> 19:52.280
I just got off the phone with Bob Meyerwitz, the owner of the UFC.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.840
I think they're in trouble and I think we could buy it.

19:54.840 --> 19:56.920
And I think we should, you should reach out to them.

19:57.640 --> 20:02.680
So Lorenzo, uh, Lorenzo called Meyerwitz and I don't know how, I don't remember

20:02.680 --> 20:05.480
the timeline, but within the next two months, we ended up owning the

20:05.480 --> 20:06.800
UFC for 2 million bucks.

20:07.520 --> 20:10.600
And, uh, you've said that you fought a lot of battles during that time.

20:11.840 --> 20:16.760
I mean, the early days of building this company and building the sport, it

20:16.760 --> 20:17.960
was the wild, wild West man.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.480
It was, it was crazy back then.

20:20.480 --> 20:25.640
Um, yeah, I was literally at war every day with all different types of people.

20:26.320 --> 20:30.680
Plus traditionally there's bad people that are involved in, in fighting

20:30.680 --> 20:31.960
men, lots of bad people.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.880
And we had to sift our way through that for the first seven, eight years.

20:36.200 --> 20:39.560
So in general, there's like corruption and the people kind of steal money.

20:39.560 --> 20:42.200
They're thinking just about themselves, not the bigger business.

20:42.200 --> 20:42.960
Let me tell you about this.

20:42.960 --> 20:45.120
I mean, I want to say it was the Netherlands.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.560
I don't remember exactly where it could have been Amsterdam.

20:47.560 --> 20:50.600
I mean, MMA promoters were like car bombing each other.

20:50.600 --> 20:54.880
And then the other guy shot up the other guy's house with machine guns.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.360
And that's the kind of shit that was going on.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.280
I'll tell you the story.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.520
So affliction, do you remember affliction?

21:02.560 --> 21:02.880
Yeah.

21:03.200 --> 21:07.320
So there was a guy, I want to say, I want, I want to say the name was

21:07.320 --> 21:09.320
Tom Todd beard or something like that.

21:10.640 --> 21:14.800
This guy used to text me every day when they were, when they started their

21:15.160 --> 21:20.320
MMA thing telling me he was going to kill me, like legitimately,

21:20.320 --> 21:21.520
legitimately going to kill me.

21:22.440 --> 21:23.760
You punk motherfucker.

21:24.360 --> 21:25.720
I'm going to fucking kill you.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.960
You don't understand who I am and what I've done and this and that.

21:28.960 --> 21:32.280
I think this guy would get drunk or do drugs every night or whatever his deal

21:32.280 --> 21:35.760
was, this guy would call me, text me and threaten my life every day.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.320
I used to go, fuck you.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.560
And you said, fuck you.

21:39.240 --> 21:39.800
Oh yeah.

21:40.240 --> 21:41.160
Especially back then.

21:41.480 --> 21:41.920
Yeah.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.680
But yeah, but I mean, this is the type of shit that went on in the early days.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.320
This guy, this guy who was one of the owners of affliction was like one of

21:49.320 --> 21:52.480
the, you know, not, not a good human.

21:52.480 --> 21:53.280
Let's put it that way.

21:53.720 --> 21:54.960
What about the business side of it?

21:55.200 --> 21:57.720
It's tough to make money in this business.

21:57.720 --> 21:57.840
Yeah.

21:57.840 --> 21:58.760
We weren't making money.

21:58.760 --> 22:08.080
So, you know, trying to build this thing, corrupt, uh, corrupt, uh, the guys that

22:08.440 --> 22:14.680
work for in-demand pay-per-view at the time, uh, we're not good dudes, you know,

22:14.680 --> 22:16.960
and that thing was a fucking total monopoly.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.640
God, I wish I could remember his name right now.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.400
He used to run in demand and he was a fucking bad guy.

22:22.680 --> 22:27.040
Then he, then he comes over and starts running direct TV, who we always had a

22:27.040 --> 22:32.640
great relationship with and he's the reason we left direct TV and said, fuck it.

22:32.640 --> 22:33.840
We'll just go streaming then.

22:34.680 --> 22:35.120
Yeah.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.200
I don't remember his name.

22:36.520 --> 22:37.720
I'd have to ask Lorenzo.

22:38.080 --> 22:42.000
So in general, just in this whole space, there's a lot of shady people.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.960
Everybody you deal with is dealing with a lot of, a lot of, a lot of different

22:45.960 --> 22:51.200
forces and your, your, your hands are in a lot of different businesses, uh, you

22:51.200 --> 22:57.480
know, from the venue business to the merchandise business, to the video game

22:57.480 --> 23:02.080
business, uh, the pay-per-view business, you know, the list goes on and on of all

23:02.080 --> 23:06.280
the different types of the production business of all these different, you know,

23:06.280 --> 23:12.240
when I first started this, I, uh, we had a production team that was the production

23:12.240 --> 23:15.400
team that was in it before we bought it.

23:16.360 --> 23:20.760
So there was this, there was this incident with Phil Barone where Phil

23:20.760 --> 23:25.960
Barone, we did an interview with him and Barone flips out in the interview when

23:25.960 --> 23:28.520
they're interviewing him and goes crazy.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.000
And I thought it was awesome.

23:30.440 --> 23:33.920
So I'm like, we're going to leave this in, we're going to leave this interview

23:33.920 --> 23:36.080
in and the production guys were arguing with me.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.120
They're like, we can't leave this in.

23:38.280 --> 23:39.560
This is totally unprofessional.

23:39.560 --> 23:40.640
And I said, I don't give a shit.

23:41.240 --> 23:42.600
This is, this is what we're doing.

23:42.920 --> 23:45.680
We're going to, we're going to do this and clip it like this and do it like that.

23:46.400 --> 23:50.520
We're sitting in the venue that night and I lean over to Lorenzo cause the fight's

23:50.520 --> 23:53.280
coming up, I go, waiting to see this fucking interview with Barone.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.240
They didn't fucking do it.

23:57.240 --> 23:57.880
They didn't do it.

23:58.440 --> 24:01.840
These guys were guys that were freelance guys that worked for Showtime at the time

24:01.840 --> 24:03.040
or one of the, something like that.

24:03.600 --> 24:07.120
I literally went, got up from my fucking seat, went back there, kick the fucking

24:07.120 --> 24:11.560
door in the truck open and I said, you motherfuckers, you ever do that again?

24:11.560 --> 24:12.960
And I'll fire every fucking one of you.

24:13.120 --> 24:13.880
Let's just put it this way.

24:13.880 --> 24:17.040
I ended up firing every one of them anyway, and going with a whole new crew.

24:17.040 --> 24:21.960
But these were the type of things that early on, you know, there's so much stuff.

24:21.960 --> 24:25.200
I mean, I could sit here for fucking three days and walk you through all the

24:25.200 --> 24:27.080
stuff that used to go on back in those days.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.680
But it was the wild, wild West man.

24:29.920 --> 24:33.520
But how'd you figure out, how'd you know how to deal with all this mess?

24:33.520 --> 24:36.440
First of all, to fire people, to fire people that aren't doing a good job.

24:36.440 --> 24:40.680
All of that, like how to be a leader, how to be a business leader.

24:40.720 --> 24:42.560
Get it, getting it in the early days.

24:42.560 --> 24:47.920
There was two employees, me and another girl that worked for me, for my company

24:47.920 --> 24:49.400
before I started doing this.

24:49.960 --> 24:53.240
And then we slowly started to bring people on and you start to build a team.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.480
Then before you know it, we had 10 people.

24:55.480 --> 24:57.600
I mean, we used to do our Christmas parties back then too.

24:58.120 --> 25:00.640
There'd be eight to 10 people at our Christmas party, you know?

25:02.160 --> 25:07.040
But a lot of it is you learn as you go, you know, you know what me and the

25:07.040 --> 25:10.600
Fertitas knew about production when we bought this UFC, we had like, I want to

25:10.600 --> 25:12.960
say we had two or three weeks to pull off of an event.

25:13.400 --> 25:14.880
This is what we knew about production.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.040
Jack shit.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.400
So we had to dive in and we had to learn it.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.400
We had to figure it out and we, we knew what we wanted.

25:21.440 --> 25:22.320
We knew what we liked.

25:22.360 --> 25:25.000
We knew what we were looking for.

25:25.680 --> 25:28.400
Um, it's just about building, building a good team.

25:28.760 --> 25:33.360
And I think that's one of the things if you want to talk about what I've

25:33.360 --> 25:37.120
accomplished in the last, you know, 25 years of my life, I've been

25:37.120 --> 25:38.360
really good at building teams.

25:39.080 --> 25:42.040
Already have a vision of what you want the final thing to look like, and then

25:42.040 --> 25:43.600
build a team that can bring that to life.

25:44.600 --> 25:49.520
Well, you have to have the vision without the vision, there's nothing.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.200
So that's sort of what I do.

25:52.400 --> 25:56.400
Um, I, I am the vision part of this thing.

25:56.640 --> 25:59.800
We're going to open a, a PI in Mexico.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.440
We're going to, uh, do this.

26:01.440 --> 26:06.160
We're going to do that, you know, and then, uh, and then you build the

26:06.160 --> 26:07.920
team to come in and help execute.

26:09.400 --> 26:12.560
A lot of people that do, uh, fighting promotions fail.

26:12.840 --> 26:15.560
You succeeded against long odds.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.040
Uh, what's the secret to your success?

26:18.040 --> 26:20.200
If you would just looking back over the years.

26:20.640 --> 26:27.080
Well, the secret to success, I would say, first of all, is passion and consistency.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.120
You have to love what you do.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.200
You have to get up every day.

26:31.440 --> 26:34.440
And I, I, I get here every day at nine 30 in the morning.

26:35.800 --> 26:41.080
When we sold in 2016, a lot of people in the company made a lot of money

26:41.400 --> 26:43.440
and they all took off and they retired.

26:43.680 --> 26:43.920
Yeah.

26:43.920 --> 26:44.200
Right.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.760
Um, other than the Fertitas, I made the most money.

26:48.080 --> 26:48.960
I'm still here.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.000
I get here at nine 30 every morning.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.120
Last night I left here at eight 30, you know, and I don't know how

26:54.120 --> 26:57.000
late I'm going to be here tonight, but I love what I do.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.920
We get up every day and grind.

26:59.320 --> 27:01.560
I work just as hard now as I did back then.

27:02.200 --> 27:05.840
The difference between back then and now is I don't have to do a bunch of

27:05.840 --> 27:07.560
the shit that I don't really like to do.

27:07.720 --> 27:08.640
Like budget meetings.

27:08.840 --> 27:09.920
I don't like budget meetings.

27:11.600 --> 27:15.920
I sat through enough fucking budget meetings, horrible budget meetings,

27:16.080 --> 27:20.400
horrible budget meetings, horrible, you know, we're losing, you know,

27:20.440 --> 27:23.760
millions of dollars a year and I'm in these, in these budget meetings.

27:23.840 --> 27:27.640
Um, you know, so I get to pick and choose what I do these days.

27:27.640 --> 27:29.880
Back in the early days, you don't get to pick and choose.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.360
You have to be involved in everything.

27:32.440 --> 27:32.760
Yeah.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.800
So costs, you're just looking at costs.

27:35.320 --> 27:41.240
You literally go through line by line, every fucking number in the company

27:41.240 --> 27:43.760
and where did the money go and how can we save costs?

27:44.280 --> 27:45.600
How can we do this better?

27:45.680 --> 27:51.520
How can we, you know, they are, they, they, they are brutal and they're

27:51.520 --> 27:55.080
multiple times a week and probably helps to deeply appreciate how much

27:55.080 --> 27:55.960
the shit costs though.

27:56.200 --> 27:56.720
A hundred percent.

27:56.720 --> 28:00.160
Well, you have to know that in the early days, when you start your business,

28:00.600 --> 28:03.640
you have these people who, when I hear them say, you know what?

28:04.680 --> 28:08.200
I, uh, I want to work for myself.

28:08.240 --> 28:12.280
I want to create my own schedule and I want to do all the, it just, it's,

28:12.760 --> 28:16.720
if that's your thought process going into it, you're never going to be successful.

28:17.520 --> 28:20.520
You have to pay attention to every single detail of the business early on.

28:20.880 --> 28:22.080
You're involved in everything.

28:22.080 --> 28:22.960
There's no days off.

28:22.960 --> 28:23.880
There's no birthdays.

28:23.880 --> 28:24.920
There's no fucking Christmas.

28:24.920 --> 28:25.800
There's none of that shit.

28:26.040 --> 28:29.880
I literally moved the birth of my second son for a chocolate L fight.

28:30.680 --> 28:33.760
We had a chocolate L fight coming up and I, and they're like, yeah, your son's

28:33.760 --> 28:34.720
going to be born on this date.

28:34.720 --> 28:36.080
And I'm like, yeah, that's not going to work.

28:37.320 --> 28:38.600
We're going to have to take them earlier.

28:39.120 --> 28:43.720
So they literally gave my wife a C-section and, and, and took my son early.

28:43.960 --> 28:44.800
You're all in.

28:45.000 --> 28:45.480
All in.

28:45.680 --> 28:46.080
Yeah.

28:46.640 --> 28:50.200
And the fascinating thing, like you said, you, uh, you've said that you

28:50.200 --> 28:51.480
could care less about money.

28:51.760 --> 28:54.560
You're doing this for, for the love of it.

28:55.040 --> 28:55.360
Yeah.

28:55.680 --> 28:59.640
I was doing this when I was broke and I'm doing this now and I'm not broke.

28:59.960 --> 29:01.200
I'm doing this because I love it.

29:01.200 --> 29:07.880
And I, and I, I feel like there's so much more to do and this is truly my passion

29:07.920 --> 29:08.360
in life.

29:08.360 --> 29:10.640
It's like the sphere we're doing this fear.

29:10.760 --> 29:12.800
Why, why would I do this fear?

29:12.840 --> 29:14.280
It's going to cost me a bunch of money.

29:15.280 --> 29:16.360
It's really challenging.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.760
Um, most people think it can't be pulled off and, uh, you're looking at weird

29:21.760 --> 29:26.400
angles, different things going on inside other than the fight and all this other

29:26.400 --> 29:31.040
stuff, but yeah, I'm doing it because it's awesome and it's challenging and it's

29:31.040 --> 29:37.440
hard and I think that if anybody can do it right, it's us, so why not take that

29:37.440 --> 29:37.920
challenge?

29:37.920 --> 29:38.840
It's actually why I'm here.

29:38.840 --> 29:41.640
I'm going to this fear for the first time because I'm hanging out with Darren

29:41.640 --> 29:44.120
Aronofsky who put together the thing that's in there now.

29:44.680 --> 29:47.760
And I can't believe you're thinking of, I don't know how you're

29:47.760 --> 29:48.880
going to solve that puzzle.

29:48.920 --> 29:52.160
There's many puzzles to solve for this one, many puzzles.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.440
Uh, so how can you speak to that?

29:54.440 --> 29:59.080
Like what, uh, are interesting challenges that you're encountering?

29:59.240 --> 29:59.520
Yeah.

29:59.520 --> 30:00.360
So there's a lot.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.840
So you have the octagon, right.

30:03.240 --> 30:06.080
And then behind it is the world's biggest screen ever.

30:06.280 --> 30:06.680
Right.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.320
So what is the theme?

30:09.440 --> 30:10.520
How do you program it?

30:10.680 --> 30:15.520
First of all, it's super expensive to shoot and, uh, you know, the

30:15.520 --> 30:19.120
format for the sphere, um, angles.

30:19.120 --> 30:24.320
We were talking about, uh, today, I just had a big meeting today, um, about

30:24.320 --> 30:30.360
the sphere this afternoon and making sure that all my departments, all the

30:30.360 --> 30:35.400
details that I want, I'll start to come together here in the next two weeks.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.520
I want the creative, the commercial.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.040
I have some goals.

30:40.640 --> 30:44.640
I will tell people as we get closer, what I'm looking to achieve with this,

30:44.640 --> 30:48.120
other than putting on one of the greatest, most unique sporting events of

30:48.120 --> 30:52.120
all time and probably the greatest combat sporting event of all time.

30:53.280 --> 30:57.520
Um, but yeah, there's, I mean, there's challenges, there's a laundry list

30:57.520 --> 30:58.760
of challenges for this thing.

30:58.840 --> 31:02.560
And not to mention the fact that it's on independent, uh, Mexican independence

31:02.560 --> 31:09.280
day, and we're going to weave in the whole history of combat in Mexico.

31:09.560 --> 31:10.160
Yeah.

31:10.320 --> 31:14.120
And this event, but the production, I mean, this is hilarious.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.560
Cause you were just talking about knowing nothing about production.

31:17.280 --> 31:20.880
So now tackling the sphere, the hardest production effort ever.

31:21.560 --> 31:22.960
And that will be live.

31:23.160 --> 31:23.760
It'll be live.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.760
It'll be live on pay-per-view.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.640
It'll be live in the arena and it will also be in movie theaters.

31:30.920 --> 31:31.440
Nice.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.400
So there'll be, uh, it'll be shown.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.160
We'll be shown at the sphere later too.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.320
Like, will you try to create an experience?

31:37.320 --> 31:38.480
ESPN is doing a doc on it.

31:38.760 --> 31:39.320
Nice.

31:39.400 --> 31:40.440
The making of the sphere.

31:40.480 --> 31:40.920
Yeah.

31:41.240 --> 31:42.200
Are you feeling good about it?

31:42.360 --> 31:42.800
Oh yeah.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.000
I feel incredible about it.

31:45.600 --> 31:46.520
I can't wait.

31:46.560 --> 31:47.880
It's going to be, it's going to be fun.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.600
I can't wait to see how you solve the puzzle.

31:49.920 --> 31:50.360
Thank you.

31:50.840 --> 31:55.320
Another guy that I feel like could care less about the money is Joe Rogan.

31:55.760 --> 32:00.880
How important is he to the UFC, to the rise of the UFC and what in general do

32:00.880 --> 32:01.760
you love about Joe?

32:02.560 --> 32:03.280
It's a fact.

32:03.480 --> 32:08.240
He doesn't care about money and he did the first 13 shows for free for us.

32:08.800 --> 32:09.280
You know what I mean?

32:09.280 --> 32:12.400
That was at a time when we were hurting and he's like, wait a minute, you

32:12.400 --> 32:14.320
want me to do the commentary.

32:14.960 --> 32:17.640
You're saying that I get to sit in the best seat in the house and watch these

32:17.640 --> 32:18.320
fights for free.

32:18.880 --> 32:19.480
Yeah, I'm in.

32:19.680 --> 32:20.040
Yeah.

32:20.080 --> 32:25.480
So, um, and then obviously when we turn things around, we, we made it up to

32:25.480 --> 32:30.800
Joe, but Joe is one of the things that I loved early on about, so I'll tell

32:30.800 --> 32:31.240
you the story.

32:31.240 --> 32:36.160
So we buy the UFC, um, they're based in New York.

32:36.800 --> 32:39.840
We're, we're moving the, the, the corporate offices to Vegas.

32:40.320 --> 32:45.200
So I have to fly out to New York, go into the offices and, and, uh, start

32:45.200 --> 32:49.320
going through everything and figuring out what needs to come back to Vegas

32:49.320 --> 32:50.400
and what we can just throw away.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.840
So they literally had a VHS machine and a TV and there were a million

32:55.840 --> 32:56.920
tapes in this place, man.

32:57.280 --> 32:59.920
So I didn't know what tapes were.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.720
These definitely we have to keep or these we don't need.

33:02.880 --> 33:06.520
So I had to sit there and go through every single tape and I popped in a tape

33:06.520 --> 33:10.840
and there was an interview on the ivory Kenan Wayans show, right?

33:10.960 --> 33:15.000
The oldest Wayans brother and he had a talk show at the time and he had Joe

33:15.000 --> 33:20.840
Rogan, the guy from fear factor on the show and he was promoting fear factor,

33:20.840 --> 33:28.880
but all he would talk about was UFC and he was talking about how people think

33:28.880 --> 33:32.960
that these guys in the martial arts movies are tough and he was talking

33:32.960 --> 33:38.040
about what UFC fighters would do to these, these martial arts guys, if

33:38.040 --> 33:39.200
they ever got their hands on them.

33:39.440 --> 33:42.360
And I was like, this is exactly what I need.

33:42.400 --> 33:50.200
A guy who isn't afraid to speak his mind and knows the sport inside and out, but

33:50.200 --> 33:53.280
more importantly is super passionate about it and loves it.

33:53.600 --> 33:57.680
So when you see Joe Rogan on camera and I was talking about the paid dock

33:57.680 --> 34:02.280
talking heads that they had in HBO boxing that were terrible, Joe Rogan

34:02.280 --> 34:04.160
does not come off as a paid talking head.

34:04.160 --> 34:06.680
He comes off as a guy who loves this.

34:07.320 --> 34:11.360
And so early on, no media would cover us.

34:12.360 --> 34:15.040
So I had to buy my way onto radio.

34:15.880 --> 34:17.880
So we do these radio tours, right?

34:18.320 --> 34:19.480
And they would drop us in.

34:20.280 --> 34:23.800
You'd have to get up at three 30 in the morning in Vegas on the West coast.

34:24.480 --> 34:28.640
And they, cause that they're at six 30 in the morning in New York and Boston

34:28.640 --> 34:30.040
and Florida and all these other places.

34:30.720 --> 34:34.160
So they drop you into these markets to do radio, right?

34:34.600 --> 34:36.880
And the fighters were horrible at it.

34:37.360 --> 34:41.240
Fighters getting up at three 30 in the morning, especially leading up to a fight.

34:42.240 --> 34:42.800
Never good.

34:43.760 --> 34:45.040
They sound like they're tired.

34:45.200 --> 34:48.040
They act like they're tired and they definitely act like they

34:48.040 --> 34:48.800
don't want to be on there.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.360
And it's, it's bad radio.

34:50.720 --> 34:52.080
What you can't have is bad radio.

34:52.760 --> 34:57.280
So the only two people that could pull off these radio tours were me and Joe Rogan.

34:58.520 --> 35:03.960
So me and Joe Rogan would alternate doing these radio tours all over the country.

35:04.120 --> 35:06.840
Just talking about fighting, talking about what this whole thing is,

35:07.360 --> 35:08.600
like getting people excited.

35:08.640 --> 35:11.680
Two guys that are really into it and passionate about it and love it.

35:11.680 --> 35:15.680
And, and, and can, and, and it's one of the things about Rogan too, when, when

35:15.920 --> 35:21.360
early on nobody understood the ground game, Joe Rogan would walk you through

35:21.360 --> 35:25.520
what was happening literally before it would happen, he would tell you the

35:25.520 --> 35:27.040
setup, what was going to come next.

35:27.040 --> 35:31.840
And everything you just absolutely articulate it perfectly brilliantly.

35:32.120 --> 35:33.960
And people at home started to understand.

35:33.960 --> 35:39.760
And the impact that Joe Rogan has had and continues to have on this

35:39.760 --> 35:42.520
sport is immeasurable.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.240
He's the biggest podcaster in the world.

35:45.880 --> 35:53.160
And he is on the UFC pay-per-views, you know, 14 times a year, and he's

35:53.160 --> 35:54.480
always talking about the sport.

35:54.520 --> 35:59.600
It's immeasurable what this guy has, has, has done for this company and the sport.

35:59.960 --> 36:00.200
Yeah.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.720
Still to this day, like I'll have dinner with him offline.

36:02.760 --> 36:03.920
He'll just talk fighting.

36:04.440 --> 36:05.280
Just loves it.

36:05.640 --> 36:06.040
It's true.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.400
Loves every aspect of it.

36:07.480 --> 36:07.760
Yep.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.880
Joe Rogan is, is, is one of those guys.

36:09.880 --> 36:14.480
I saw that early on when, why would you go after the fear factor guy?

36:15.080 --> 36:15.320
Yeah.

36:15.360 --> 36:22.360
You know, to be such a key component to not only the company, but to the sport.

36:22.920 --> 36:26.920
I saw it in the fucking interview on ivory Keenan Wayans.

36:28.400 --> 36:29.840
I value loyalty a lot.

36:30.160 --> 36:34.840
And I remember there was a moment, not too long ago, maybe a year ago when I

36:34.840 --> 36:38.400
was sitting with Joe and he had a phone call with you, Joe was getting canceled

36:38.400 --> 36:43.880
for something and, uh, they didn't want him commentating the fights.

36:44.600 --> 36:50.840
And you on the phone offered your resignation over this.

36:51.360 --> 36:52.880
I got teary eyed over that.

36:53.600 --> 36:57.400
That's such a, you're a good man.

36:57.520 --> 36:58.520
You know, thank you.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.240
That was powerful.

37:01.000 --> 37:07.440
Anybody who is with me has been with me knows when you're with me, you're with me.

37:07.640 --> 37:08.600
It's a two way street.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.000
It's not a, it's not a one way street.

37:11.120 --> 37:16.400
Um, I'm not one of these guys that, uh, it's kind of roll over and, uh, it's

37:16.400 --> 37:19.760
like going through COVID, um, I wasn't laying any of these people.

37:19.760 --> 37:21.440
Some of these people have been with me for 20 years.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.560
We're going to, we're going to, we're going to lay them off.

37:26.640 --> 37:32.280
This motherfucker will burn, burn before I would do that to my people.

37:32.720 --> 37:36.480
It's just, it's just never that none of that type of stuff is ever

37:36.480 --> 37:38.080
going to happen while I'm here.

37:39.080 --> 37:43.000
I can't say what's going to happen when I leave, but when I'm here, the people

37:43.000 --> 37:47.080
who are with me and have been with me, they know exactly what's up and Joe

37:47.080 --> 37:51.200
knows what's up and, and, and, and, and it's, and again, it's a two way street.

37:51.840 --> 37:56.080
Joe Rogan has been very loyal to me and I am very loyal to Joe Rogan.

37:57.000 --> 38:01.520
Lorenzo, another guy you've close friendship with, you seem to have

38:01.520 --> 38:04.440
been extremely effective together as business partners.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.000
What's, what's the magic behind that?

38:06.080 --> 38:06.360
Yeah.

38:06.400 --> 38:07.240
How can you explain that?

38:07.400 --> 38:07.960
I love them.

38:08.280 --> 38:11.800
Lorenzo and I work really well together because we have two different

38:11.800 --> 38:13.200
personalities, right?

38:13.640 --> 38:16.560
I'm the guy that always I'm going here.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.600
Lorenzo was always here, right?

38:19.000 --> 38:22.320
You could walk in a room and say, Lorenzo, you just lost $10 million.

38:23.880 --> 38:26.040
Lorenzo, you just won $10 million.

38:27.200 --> 38:28.120
It never changes.

38:28.160 --> 38:30.240
And I'm a guy that goes like this, right?

38:30.840 --> 38:33.480
So we almost balance each other out.

38:34.360 --> 38:36.840
There's a lot of things that he's really fucking good at.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.040
And there's a lot of things that I'm really fucking good at.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.760
And they're both on the opposite sides of the spectrum.

38:41.800 --> 38:46.640
So that level headed thing was useful when the UFC was losing money and it

38:46.640 --> 38:50.600
was unknown whether it's going to survive those low points.

38:50.720 --> 38:51.360
A hundred percent.

38:51.640 --> 38:52.400
What's incredible.

38:52.400 --> 38:59.040
When you think of this, the story of the UFC, um, at the time, the casino

38:59.040 --> 39:00.560
business was cranking, right?

39:00.720 --> 39:02.320
And station casinos was killing it.

39:03.280 --> 39:08.320
And stations, their money from stations is what was funding the UFC.

39:09.000 --> 39:17.800
Then in, uh, the 08-9 crash, the UFC was killing it in 08-09 and, you know,

39:18.120 --> 39:19.720
the casino businesses were hurting.

39:20.640 --> 39:25.040
So timing on everything, the way that it all worked out, couldn't have worked

39:25.040 --> 39:31.560
out better for them, um, and obviously for all of us, when you think about the

39:31.560 --> 39:37.120
UFC and how big it is and how far it reaches and how many people it touches,

39:37.800 --> 39:42.680
the Fritidas brothers made a $2 million investment, then put in like another

39:42.680 --> 39:50.160
44 million and look at how many lives that investment has changed over

39:50.160 --> 39:52.560
the last 25 years.

39:54.440 --> 39:55.320
It's fascinating.

39:55.440 --> 39:56.600
And it's also crazy.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.200
Just forget the business of it.

39:58.240 --> 40:04.080
Just the effect it has on the history of humanity in terms of this, what we do

40:04.400 --> 40:06.000
or descendants of apes that fight.

40:06.360 --> 40:11.560
And this is like the organizations that catalyze the innovation in how we fight.

40:11.920 --> 40:12.120
Right.

40:12.120 --> 40:12.720
It's crazy.

40:12.880 --> 40:17.880
And it created a whole new sport that people all over the world participate in.

40:17.880 --> 40:22.560
Now, literally there isn't a place on earth that we can't get a fighter from now.

40:23.520 --> 40:30.840
You said in the UFC 299 post fight press conference that, um, sometimes fighters

40:30.840 --> 40:34.960
might complain that, you know, they get matched up on even odds, but that's

40:34.960 --> 40:36.400
actually when legends are made.

40:37.400 --> 40:40.200
Uh, I think you gave Dustin Poirier as an example.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.360
Can you elaborate on that a little bit?

40:42.600 --> 40:43.640
Like what makes a legend?

40:43.640 --> 40:45.000
What makes greatness in a fight?

40:45.320 --> 40:50.520
So behind the scenes, fighters are a very paranoid bunch of people.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.160
They're very paranoid.

40:53.120 --> 40:58.640
And there's been this, this, this theme with fighters where they're

40:58.640 --> 41:00.840
trying to get me beat, right?

41:02.880 --> 41:04.840
We don't determine who wins and loses.

41:05.120 --> 41:07.080
If we did, we'd be the WWE.

41:07.160 --> 41:07.640
Okay.

41:08.280 --> 41:10.080
Um, you do.

41:11.400 --> 41:12.720
I'm the bells and whistles guy.

41:12.920 --> 41:16.680
I make sure that as many people that we can possibly let know that you're

41:16.680 --> 41:20.920
fighting on Saturday, know that you're fighting on Saturday, who you are, who

41:20.920 --> 41:23.320
you're going against and why people should give a shit.

41:23.920 --> 41:24.640
That's what I do.

41:24.840 --> 41:25.280
Right.

41:25.920 --> 41:31.080
Then the night you show up, I put on the best live event that I possibly can.

41:31.640 --> 41:34.240
And I put on the best television show that I possibly can.

41:35.160 --> 41:38.640
Once that door shuts, it's all up to you.

41:39.320 --> 41:41.040
You determine whether you lose or not.

41:41.520 --> 41:49.000
And if you get into a position where you become so paranoid that you think that

41:49.000 --> 41:58.840
the powers that be here are against you and you, you try to steer yourself

41:58.840 --> 42:05.320
away from certain fights and that's one of the big things that happens in

42:05.320 --> 42:10.480
these other organizations and these other organizations, the inmates run

42:10.480 --> 42:12.400
the asylum, right?

42:12.760 --> 42:15.960
So if they don't want to fight bad enough, these other companies don't

42:15.960 --> 42:17.520
push and they don't do this and they don't.

42:18.120 --> 42:22.120
We put on the best possible matchups that we can make.

42:22.800 --> 42:29.760
And in this business, you might be an older fighter, but if you're still ranked

42:29.760 --> 42:36.440
in the top 10, there's young guys coming for you, killers, young killers are coming

42:36.440 --> 42:39.480
out and they want your position, right?

42:40.040 --> 42:45.480
So you being the, the veteran that you are, have to prepare yourself to go in

42:45.480 --> 42:49.440
and, you know, everybody was saying when we made that fight with St.

42:49.440 --> 42:52.000
Denis, that Poirier was in big trouble.

42:52.880 --> 42:53.560
Da da da da da.

42:54.320 --> 42:55.080
That's awesome.

42:55.800 --> 43:00.600
That, that helps build the entire thing that Poirier and then Poirier goes out

43:00.600 --> 43:02.000
and does what he did that night.

43:03.280 --> 43:05.800
That's what makes fucking legends.

43:06.440 --> 43:07.120
It's interesting.

43:07.120 --> 43:10.720
Cause like sometimes being the underdog is a really good thing for the long

43:10.720 --> 43:12.760
term story of who you are as a fighter.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.400
Especially when you're a big name and a name that people recognize and a name

43:16.400 --> 43:20.560
that people know and, you know, and they're like, Oh man, I remember Israel

43:20.560 --> 43:27.040
out of Sonia and Sean Strickland, a hundred out of a hundred people knew for

43:27.040 --> 43:32.400
a fact that Israel was going to win that fight and here comes Strickland.

43:32.760 --> 43:34.760
And we could go on for days with this.

43:34.760 --> 43:35.480
You know what I mean?

43:36.040 --> 43:40.120
That is what creates legendary moments, legendary fights, and it's

43:40.120 --> 43:41.480
what builds stars and legends.

43:41.760 --> 43:45.080
I mean, arguably Conor McGregor with Jose Aldo.

43:45.400 --> 43:45.640
Yep.

43:45.880 --> 43:48.080
Conor McGregor with a bunch of people in the beginning, people

43:48.080 --> 43:48.920
said he couldn't wrestle.

43:48.920 --> 43:50.800
People said he wouldn't be able to defend a takedown.

43:51.240 --> 43:52.280
Um, blah, blah, blah.

43:52.600 --> 43:54.120
Nate Diaz against Conor McGregor.

43:54.600 --> 43:55.280
You know what I mean?

43:55.920 --> 44:01.400
And, uh, and Conor McGregor against Khabib, underdog probably.

44:02.080 --> 44:05.360
But if you won, there's an opportunity to win.

44:05.400 --> 44:08.000
If you won, that's, that's the legend for me.

44:08.360 --> 44:11.520
He's now in the conversation with the greatest of all time without argument.

44:11.520 --> 44:15.200
And if you look at the way that Khabib ran through so many people,

44:16.040 --> 44:19.600
Conor hung in there, you know, and it could have been made a fight of it.

44:19.800 --> 44:20.520
It could have been.

44:20.600 --> 44:21.880
What do you think about that matchup?

44:22.080 --> 44:25.240
It's one of the, one of the greats, one of the great matchups that you've

44:25.240 --> 44:27.600
made Conor McGregor versus Khabib.

44:28.000 --> 44:28.320
Yeah.

44:28.320 --> 44:34.040
I mean, at the time I was incredibly criticized for putting together the

44:34.040 --> 44:40.920
spot that had the, the scene with the bus in it, you know, you know, the

44:40.920 --> 44:44.840
fucking media is, but they were saying that I was pandering to the, you know,

44:44.840 --> 44:48.920
to the violence that happened and trying to, I'm telling you a story, telling

44:48.920 --> 44:57.000
you a story of how we got here and how big this fight is and how bad the

44:57.000 --> 44:58.560
blood is between these guys.

44:59.440 --> 45:04.880
And I mean, I think that's what we do the best job at is telling the

45:04.880 --> 45:10.160
fucking stories of why we go into Monday.

45:11.040 --> 45:11.640
It's fight week.

45:12.320 --> 45:16.000
We got a whole list of things that we do fight week, right?

45:16.440 --> 45:19.680
And then you get right down to the press conference on Thursday, the

45:19.680 --> 45:22.320
weigh-ins on Friday, and then the fights on Saturday.

45:22.800 --> 45:24.320
Now my people fly back home.

45:25.120 --> 45:28.240
They go to bed on Sunday night and it's groundhog day.

45:28.640 --> 45:32.400
We wake up again on Monday and it starts all over again, every

45:32.400 --> 45:34.960
weekend, every Saturday for a year.

45:35.720 --> 45:38.680
So there's lots of stories that need to be told.

45:38.680 --> 45:43.720
There's lots of, when you think about what I compete with, whatever takes

45:43.720 --> 45:47.240
your attention on a Saturday night is my competitor.

45:47.600 --> 45:50.280
So you're always trying to build a foundation for great stories.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.520
And like, if the fighters step up, they step up and they

45:53.520 --> 45:55.560
can together create greatness.

45:55.920 --> 45:56.880
That's exactly right.

45:56.880 --> 46:00.960
So when we are aligned, like when you get to the UFC, I mean, you just saw it with

46:00.960 --> 46:06.880
MVP, you're going to see it with Kayla Harrison and so many others that have

46:06.920 --> 46:12.640
come from other organizations and they get here, they notice immediately the

46:12.640 --> 46:16.880
difference between fighting here and fighting wherever they were before.

46:17.000 --> 46:21.760
It's not even comparable to the impact it has on you when you leave whatever

46:21.760 --> 46:23.840
organization you're with and you come to the UFC.

46:24.320 --> 46:32.080
And I think that it gives them a sense of, holy shit, I can really, I mean, MVP,

46:32.080 --> 46:36.960
when he came, I mean, there were probably more people at the press conference than

46:36.960 --> 46:39.360
any fight he'd ever fought in Bellator.

46:39.360 --> 46:40.040
You know what I mean?

46:40.720 --> 46:44.480
And you feel that energy and you feel that you feel the difference

46:44.480 --> 46:46.400
of the impact of being here.

46:46.640 --> 46:49.120
And I think it takes a lot of these guys to another level.

46:49.200 --> 46:49.400
Yeah.

46:49.400 --> 46:50.480
Just the aura of it.

46:50.480 --> 46:52.560
Like this is where you're supposed to step up.

46:53.320 --> 46:53.600
Yeah.

46:53.600 --> 46:56.840
It's the way people feel about Ted talks and giving lectures.

46:57.160 --> 46:57.920
This is your moment.

46:57.920 --> 46:59.240
You get 15 minutes in this.

46:59.240 --> 47:01.640
You better say some interesting shit.

47:02.440 --> 47:02.640
Yeah.

47:02.640 --> 47:04.280
And Kayla Harrison, by the way, is a badass.

47:04.280 --> 47:05.520
I can't wait to see what happens.

47:05.520 --> 47:08.320
She was walking around like this sleeveless shirt the night of the fights

47:08.320 --> 47:11.160
and holy shit, she is jacked, man.

47:11.160 --> 47:11.920
It's crazy.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.320
Two-time Olympic gold medalist.

47:13.560 --> 47:13.880
Right.

47:13.880 --> 47:15.200
You don't fuck with those people.

47:15.440 --> 47:16.600
You win a medal.

47:16.600 --> 47:20.120
You're, you're, you're made of something special, especially in judo.

47:20.360 --> 47:20.800
Yeah.

47:21.120 --> 47:24.000
Especially in American judo where it's not, you don't have many training

47:24.000 --> 47:26.640
partners that are great, so you better fucking work for it.

47:27.560 --> 47:32.200
Ridiculous question, but who is in the conversation for the greatest of all time?

47:32.720 --> 47:33.200
John Jones.

47:34.080 --> 47:37.840
So you've talked about John Jones, but what are the metrics involved here?

47:38.080 --> 47:38.960
He's never been beat.

47:39.800 --> 47:42.520
He destroyed everybody at light heavyweight, which at the time was the

47:42.600 --> 47:48.400
toughest weight class, um, in the company, in the sport.

47:48.960 --> 47:52.880
And then I moved up to heavyweight one easily at heavyweight.

47:53.320 --> 48:01.240
Um, and, and, and when you look at a guy and you look at what he was doing

48:01.240 --> 48:05.200
outside the octagon at the same time, which shouldn't be part of it, shouldn't

48:05.200 --> 48:11.440
be part of the, the equation, but when you do, wow, John Jones, there's no

48:11.440 --> 48:14.840
debate, nobody can debate who's the greatest of all time.

48:14.880 --> 48:17.040
It's absolutely positively John Jones.

48:17.360 --> 48:19.200
He's never lost nobody.

48:19.200 --> 48:21.200
He's never been beaten the octagon ever.

48:21.560 --> 48:27.560
So that's one of the metrics like pure sheer dominance, but there's others, right?

48:27.560 --> 48:33.120
There you could losing sometimes is a catalyst for greatness.

48:33.440 --> 48:37.160
I don't disagree, but when you've never lost, right?

48:37.160 --> 48:39.600
It's this, uh, you've never lost.

48:39.960 --> 48:45.160
We we've never found somebody and, and all the other thing is that you have

48:45.160 --> 48:48.200
to put factor into is longevity.

48:49.040 --> 48:52.040
How long he's cause sometimes with a lot of these guys, the sport

48:52.040 --> 48:56.920
passes them by the younger guys that are faster, this, that, and the sport evolves.

48:57.720 --> 48:59.760
Nobody's been able to beat John Jones.

49:00.480 --> 49:04.800
Oh, and the other thing that you measure is, you know, when you said dominance,

49:05.720 --> 49:08.440
it's true if you're this guy that has unbelievable power and you're just

49:08.440 --> 49:12.480
going in and you're just fucking knocking everybody out and nobody's ever pulled

49:12.480 --> 49:13.920
you into the deep water before.

49:14.320 --> 49:18.000
That was when my opinion of John Jones started to change.

49:18.560 --> 49:20.520
Gustafson took him into the deep water.

49:20.840 --> 49:23.200
Gustafson hit him with some shit he'd never been hit with.

49:23.840 --> 49:29.000
Gustafson tested him and put John Jones in a place where I, I bet if you sat

49:29.000 --> 49:33.520
down and interviewed John Jones, going into the deep rounds of that, John

49:33.520 --> 49:34.760
Jones thought he was going to die.

49:35.480 --> 49:36.240
You know what I'm saying?

49:36.600 --> 49:38.600
He's willing to go there and he kept going.

49:38.680 --> 49:43.840
He was, he was willing, willing to do whatever it took to win that fight.

49:44.080 --> 49:48.160
And it breaks my heart because he beat DC and DC is one of the greatest of all time.

49:48.200 --> 49:49.120
That's the thing too.

49:49.400 --> 49:54.000
And I believe that DC doesn't get the credit he deserves because of the John

49:54.000 --> 49:57.120
Jones thing, when you look at DC and what he's accomplished, right.

49:57.840 --> 49:59.400
And John Jones beat him twice.

50:00.280 --> 50:01.640
It's undeniable.

50:02.240 --> 50:03.440
You can hate all you want.

50:03.880 --> 50:05.480
John Jones was the greatest of all time.

50:05.680 --> 50:08.720
Do you think, uh, Habib was tested enough?

50:09.240 --> 50:12.520
I think that Habib had the potential to be in the running for that.

50:13.040 --> 50:14.760
He didn't, he just didn't stick around a lot.

50:14.760 --> 50:19.120
First of all, he, he, he had injuries that, that, that, you know, he should

50:19.120 --> 50:21.120
have been where he got a lot sooner.

50:21.360 --> 50:24.880
Had he not had the injuries that he had and the setbacks in his career, but

50:24.880 --> 50:27.920
there's no doubt Habib is one of the all time greats.

50:28.920 --> 50:32.320
What's the good, the bad and ugly of your relationship with Connor?

50:33.040 --> 50:34.280
There's literally no ugly.

50:34.920 --> 50:38.040
Connor McGregor has been an incredible partner to work with.

50:38.440 --> 50:42.280
Everybody thinks that Connor, if Connor showed up to things on time, there

50:42.280 --> 50:44.320
wouldn't be one fucking bad thing I could say about Connor.

50:45.000 --> 50:45.840
Only being late.

50:46.200 --> 50:49.520
If you fucking said, you put a gun to my fucking head, right.

50:49.520 --> 50:51.280
And said, don't lie motherfucker.

50:51.600 --> 50:54.080
Tell me all the bad things about Connor McGregor.

50:54.680 --> 50:56.120
I'd say the guy doesn't show up on time.

50:56.520 --> 50:57.080
That's it.

50:57.160 --> 50:57.560
That's it.

50:57.560 --> 51:01.200
If Connor McGregor showed up to shit on time and sometimes he does, sometimes he

51:01.200 --> 51:04.040
does, he'd be, he'd be, he's been a great partner.

51:04.040 --> 51:09.280
If you look at what a huge superstar he became, the fights that he was involved

51:09.280 --> 51:11.400
in, let me tell you what Connor McGregor never did.

51:11.640 --> 51:14.920
We never walked in a room and said, Connor, this guy just fell out.

51:15.040 --> 51:16.880
Um, we want you to fight this guy.

51:16.880 --> 51:17.920
And he was like, no way.

51:17.920 --> 51:19.320
I'm not taking this fucking risk.

51:19.520 --> 51:23.800
I'm at this point in my career where my money, my, this, my, that he was

51:23.800 --> 51:26.120
like, fuck it, let's do it.

51:26.160 --> 51:28.200
You know, he'd always say, let's do it.

51:28.200 --> 51:31.960
The other thing that Connor McGregor never did, no matter how big he was or

51:31.960 --> 51:36.440
whatever it was, and we were heading into a fight, Oh, Connor, this guy just fell

51:36.440 --> 51:40.280
out, Aldo fell out, we were looking for another, yeah, I'll do it, but I'm going

51:40.280 --> 51:42.120
to need another fucking 200,000.

51:42.120 --> 51:43.640
I'm going to need another million dollars.

51:43.800 --> 51:47.920
I'm going to, Connor McGregor never did that kind of chicken shit, you know,

51:47.920 --> 51:49.240
bullshit kind of stuff.

51:49.520 --> 51:50.960
He never did any of that.

51:51.320 --> 51:54.760
Connor was as solid a guy as you could possibly work with.

51:54.800 --> 51:55.480
Just fuck it.

51:55.480 --> 51:55.920
I'll do it.

51:56.240 --> 51:56.760
I'll do it.

51:57.840 --> 52:01.280
Literally would, there's actually a scene cause we were filming something.

52:01.280 --> 52:03.320
I don't know if it was embedded or what we were filming at the time.

52:03.720 --> 52:06.440
Me and Lorenzo walk into his house that he rented here in Vegas.

52:06.640 --> 52:09.920
And I'm pretty sure it was when Aldo fell out and we're telling him this,

52:09.920 --> 52:11.240
that, and we're looking at some options.

52:11.640 --> 52:13.840
He says, I'm going to the gym.

52:14.960 --> 52:16.320
When I'm done working out, let me know.

52:16.640 --> 52:17.680
You know, he just woke up out of bed.

52:17.680 --> 52:20.400
He's in his fucking underwear and he gets hit with this.

52:20.680 --> 52:22.400
And he's like, all right, I'm going to the gym.

52:23.080 --> 52:24.560
Let me know when I get out who I'm fighting.

52:25.720 --> 52:26.440
Doesn't care.

52:27.280 --> 52:28.200
Doesn't want to know.

52:28.640 --> 52:29.760
Doesn't want any more money.

52:30.280 --> 52:33.280
Nothing fucking shows up and he delivers.

52:34.240 --> 52:34.640
Yeah.

52:34.880 --> 52:37.920
So, you know, Connor has been incredibly successful.

52:38.200 --> 52:43.000
He's made a lot of money and you know, he's had his ups and downs outside and

52:43.000 --> 52:48.560
inside the octagon, but as for a guy who was, you know, on the dole and was a

52:48.560 --> 52:52.240
plumber, he's actually a really smart businessman and he's been one of the best

52:52.240 --> 52:54.880
partners that I've ever had in the history of the sport.

52:55.280 --> 52:55.640
Yeah.

52:55.720 --> 52:57.480
An important part of the history of the UFC.

52:57.960 --> 53:00.280
He opened it up to all kinds of new eyes.

53:01.040 --> 53:01.280
Yep.

53:01.520 --> 53:08.640
He literally, um, you know, set Europe, Australia, Canada, and many other

53:08.640 --> 53:10.080
parts of the world on fire, man.

53:10.080 --> 53:15.560
He, he, he, he was, uh, our, our first legit mega star.

53:15.880 --> 53:20.120
And I personally think he doesn't get enough credit for just how good he was

53:20.120 --> 53:22.760
as a fighter and people love to talk shit about Connor.

53:23.040 --> 53:24.360
I suppose that's part of his magic.

53:24.560 --> 53:26.840
And, and, and, but, but, but it comes with success.

53:26.880 --> 53:27.200
Yeah.

53:27.280 --> 53:30.240
When you're successful, there's always people out there that are going to talk

53:30.240 --> 53:34.920
shit, you know, you always have a bunch of no nothing, do nothing, fucking

53:35.200 --> 53:37.560
losers that love to talk shit.

53:37.760 --> 53:41.280
You think if you were to do it all over again, Habib is the right matchup.

53:41.480 --> 53:46.400
Yeah, listen, you, the thing that you can't do is avoid matchups.

53:46.880 --> 53:47.560
You know what I mean?

53:47.600 --> 53:48.640
This is what we're talking about.

53:48.640 --> 53:53.640
When you talk about being a legend, Connor McGregor needed Habib.

53:54.440 --> 53:56.200
Habib needed Connor McGregor.

53:57.200 --> 53:59.480
It's it, you can hate each other as much as you want.

54:00.120 --> 54:05.640
But you have to fight these other legendary bad motherfuckers to, to

54:05.640 --> 54:06.880
yourself become a legend.

54:06.880 --> 54:11.480
I mean, it's like John Jones needed Cyril Gaunt, right?

54:11.720 --> 54:13.120
And Cyril Gaunt needed John Jones.

54:13.120 --> 54:17.480
Cause if Cyril could have beat John, the first guy, if anybody can ever figure it

54:17.480 --> 54:20.880
out and beat John Jones, it's a big deal.

54:20.880 --> 54:26.240
And it's almost like your obligation as a fighter, right?

54:26.280 --> 54:30.680
And when you think about John Jones became who he is today, and the reason I'm

54:30.680 --> 54:34.200
sitting here telling you how great he is because all these other guys gave him

54:34.200 --> 54:37.880
the opportunity to beat them, right?

54:38.000 --> 54:39.080
Or they beat John.

54:39.680 --> 54:43.000
It's all about giving these other guys the opportunity.

54:43.400 --> 54:43.800
St.

54:43.800 --> 54:45.040
Denis, right?

54:45.320 --> 54:49.600
Poirier gave him the opportunity to come in and beat him.

54:50.200 --> 54:51.400
That's how this all works.

54:51.800 --> 54:53.240
It's the two of them together.

54:53.240 --> 54:54.480
The two fighters together.

54:54.480 --> 54:55.560
You have to have them both.

54:55.760 --> 55:00.680
Listen, I could line up, I could line up a bunch of no-name bums that

55:00.680 --> 55:02.000
John Jones could run through.

55:02.160 --> 55:04.560
That's what they do in all the other organizations, right?

55:05.280 --> 55:07.520
We would have nothing to fucking talk about right now.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.880
That's why, luckily, a perfect record in the UFC is not as important

55:11.920 --> 55:13.560
as who you fought, how you fought.

55:14.480 --> 55:21.240
But when you have a perfect record in the UFC, holy shit, right?

55:21.800 --> 55:25.520
That's what you would, when you can have a perfect record in the UFC,

55:25.920 --> 55:31.040
you are absolutely one of the most special athletes on planet earth.

55:31.720 --> 55:33.360
You and Trump are friends.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.880
I just talked to Ivanka last night and I bought her experience

55:36.880 --> 55:39.000
at the, at the, in the Miami event.

55:39.080 --> 55:39.720
She loves it.

55:40.200 --> 55:40.960
She's training too.

55:40.960 --> 55:42.640
You're talking about getting girls to train.

55:42.680 --> 55:43.240
She's trained.

55:43.280 --> 55:44.200
And the kids are training.

55:44.200 --> 55:44.520
Yeah.

55:44.760 --> 55:47.720
Her father's the biggest fucking fight fan on the planet.

55:48.200 --> 55:53.120
Calls me all the time to talk about the fights and, and, uh, Don

55:53.120 --> 55:56.400
Jr said that I'm like the only guy on earth that he bros out with.

55:56.440 --> 56:00.760
Like, you know, we, we, it's, it's funny when you talk about how

56:00.760 --> 56:02.160
powerful fighting is, right?

56:02.600 --> 56:07.280
This last Miami event, the president of Ecuador and the president of

56:07.280 --> 56:11.480
Spain, both posted about the fights, right?

56:11.960 --> 56:15.280
Um, Habib beat Connor.

56:16.320 --> 56:19.200
Putin was on FaceTime before he even made it to the, to the locker room.

56:19.600 --> 56:24.720
Um, Trump sitting president, ex-president watching all the fights, calling

56:24.720 --> 56:25.840
wants to talk about the fights.

56:26.280 --> 56:29.680
Um, Valentina Shevchenko, every time she goes home, she meets with

56:29.680 --> 56:30.480
the president of the country.

56:30.720 --> 56:35.840
The list goes on and on and on the most powerful Elon Musk Zuckerberg.

56:36.120 --> 56:37.560
I mean, the list goes on and on and on.

56:38.000 --> 56:41.760
The most powerful people in the world are all obsessed with fighting.

56:42.160 --> 56:44.240
When did you first discover that Trump loves fighting?

56:44.840 --> 56:48.280
So I first discovered that Trump was a big fight fan.

56:48.760 --> 56:51.480
Obviously you saw him part of all the big, you're talking about

56:51.480 --> 56:52.800
how big boxing fans we were.

56:53.160 --> 56:54.840
He was a part of all the big fights back then.

56:54.960 --> 56:59.840
But, um, when we first bought the UFC, this thing was so bad,

56:59.840 --> 57:01.200
venues didn't even want us.

57:01.760 --> 57:05.240
And we ended up doing, uh, you know, our first event in the Atlantic

57:05.240 --> 57:06.520
city at the Trump Taj Mahal.

57:06.960 --> 57:10.440
Now think about this at that time, Trump brand here, UFC brand.

57:10.640 --> 57:12.280
I mean, I can't go low enough.

57:13.000 --> 57:19.720
And, uh, he had us at his venue two times, back to back, showed up for

57:19.720 --> 57:22.760
the first fight of the night and stayed till the last fight of the night.

57:23.640 --> 57:28.120
Then after that, any good thing that would ever happen to me in my career,

57:28.440 --> 57:31.520
Trump would reach out, whether it was we were on the front page of the

57:31.520 --> 57:32.680
New York times at one time.

57:32.960 --> 57:35.160
And he said, congratulations, Dana.

57:35.160 --> 57:36.600
I always knew you guys were going to do it.

57:37.240 --> 57:41.120
Little things like that, but that, that are big things and mean a lot,

57:41.800 --> 57:43.360
especially coming from a guy like him.

57:43.520 --> 57:45.440
So he saw, he saw something in you.

57:45.480 --> 57:46.600
Like this is going to be

57:47.360 --> 57:48.400
he definitely saw it.

57:49.440 --> 57:56.800
And, uh, then comes 15, 16, whenever it was, I don't remember, but he called

57:56.800 --> 58:03.920
me and he said, listen, if you don't want to do this, I completely understand,

58:04.520 --> 58:07.600
but I would be honored if you would speak at the national Republican convention

58:07.600 --> 58:10.280
for me, and I'm not a very political guy.

58:10.400 --> 58:11.120
You know what I mean?

58:11.600 --> 58:14.040
And everybody told me not to do it.

58:14.440 --> 58:15.520
Do not do this.

58:16.040 --> 58:18.480
But I was like, why would I not do this?

58:18.480 --> 58:23.160
This guy's been, been great to me, you know, and, uh, I did it.

58:23.960 --> 58:27.040
And our relationship is just like, you know what I mean?

58:27.480 --> 58:30.920
I consider Donald Trump to be one of my very, very good friends.

58:31.080 --> 58:32.480
Any, uh, favorite stories?

58:33.800 --> 58:35.160
I mean, there's so many stories.

58:35.160 --> 58:40.080
I mean, once, once he, he won the election, like I'd be at work.

58:40.960 --> 58:45.240
And, uh, I'd be down the hall was in the matchmaker room, whatever.

58:45.240 --> 58:49.160
And my secretary told the president's on the phone, fucking come running down

58:49.160 --> 58:52.880
the hallway and grab the phone and he'd want to talk about the fight that was

58:52.880 --> 58:54.240
coming up at the fight that happened.

58:54.640 --> 58:57.360
Or I'd be in my car and I'd answer the phone.

58:57.360 --> 59:00.320
It's like, uh, hi, this is the white house.

59:00.320 --> 59:03.440
We have the president of the United States on the phone.

59:03.800 --> 59:06.320
You know, that's a trip when that first starts happening.

59:06.720 --> 59:15.120
And then, um, just to, to, to, to sum him up, this is the kind of guy

59:15.160 --> 59:18.240
that you want to talk about a fighter.

59:19.640 --> 59:21.640
It's the most resilient human being I've ever met.

59:22.120 --> 59:24.960
If you see the shit that this guy's going through publicly every day.

59:26.840 --> 59:33.360
And I'll call him on the phone as a friend and be like, Hey, you're good.

59:34.000 --> 59:34.560
How you doing?

59:34.680 --> 59:34.960
Mm-hmm.

59:35.800 --> 59:40.520
Unfazed, unfazed, like nothing's going on.

59:41.120 --> 59:43.640
And he'll start talking to me about this and that and all this other shit.

59:44.000 --> 59:44.720
One time.

59:45.840 --> 59:50.040
There's only been one time I've never talked about this publicly, but one

59:50.040 --> 59:53.640
time I called him and he was not good.

59:54.800 --> 59:57.720
He was, he was a mess and I've never heard him like that.

59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.480
And I've never seen him like that when, uh, Ivana died.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.920
The only time I've ever seen him fucked up.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:11.120
Obviously, as soon as I heard it, I reached out and I have never, they

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.160
look at all the stuff that's gone on with Trump, all the bad stuff that they

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.760
say they're trying to attack them.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.600
They're trying to ruin them.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:17.880
Unfazed.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:21.560
I called him that day and he was, that's the first time I've ever seen

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.120
that guy bust it up and, and, and not good.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:29.760
But that says something that that's the only time that guy is, I mean, walking

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:30.400
through the fire.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.040
He will walk through fire.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.960
He's a absolute savage.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.760
You think he wins the presidential election?

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:37.480
I don't know, man.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:42.960
It's going to depend on how this whole, I politics is the most dirtiest, scummiest

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.280
thing on planet earth, man.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.880
And, and who knows how this is all going to play out.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:47.960
It's, it's all dirty.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:48.640
It's all ugly.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:54.360
And, you know, obviously I'm rooting for him and I'm behind him and I hope he does.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.000
Um, but we'll see.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:00.360
What's dirtier, the, uh, the fighting game in the early days or politics?

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.440
There's nothing dirtier than politics.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:03.760
Nothing.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.000
There's literally nothing dirtier.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.040
It is the dirtiest thing on planet earth.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.200
I just wanted to get that on record.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:12.440
Uh, another guy who doesn't seem to be fazed by the fire.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.920
I've gotten to know him as Elon.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.920
I have to ask you, it's a bit, a bit of fun.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.640
You were a part of, um, thinking about putting together Zuck versus Elon.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I trained with both.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:28.080
I did a phone call with Elon and you when you, when we were training on the

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.800
mat, uh, you really think that could have been a good fight?

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.600
It would have been the biggest fight ever done.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:34.960
The spectacle of it.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:41.720
Two of the most powerful, wealthiest men in the world, right?

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.720
Lots of guys talk shit and go back and forth and sue each other and do all this.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:48.880
Said these two guys were literally talking about facing each other

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.040
in the octagon and fighting.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:54.840
There's nothing, and they're in a business that's looked at as geeky.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:55.680
You know what I mean?

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.920
They're, they're, they're tech nerds.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:57.840
They're this, they're that.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.800
These are two dudes that were willing to throw down and fight.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.840
And, uh, and, and, and you know, as well as I do, there's a lot of

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.120
public speculation about this.

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.440
I was taking serious real time and working on this thing.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.680
I mean, I had projections, I had numbers, I was looking at venues.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.960
I was on the phone with the fucking Coliseum in Italy, you name it.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:17.760
I was in it.

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.680
These guys were serious and this was something that was really going to happen.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:27.040
And I'll tell you right now, the, in the short amount of time that it was,

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.120
uh, it was going down.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:28.600
It was fun.

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.760
I was having a blast with it.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:34.280
What do you think about Tyson, Tyson fighting Jake Paul?

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:41.000
I love Mike Tyson and, uh, I'm not a fan of anybody fighting at our age.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.080
Um, but he's a grown man, obviously.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:47.640
And, you know, he's, he's going to do what he's going to do.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:53.560
But at least I know I talked to, um, I talked to his wife a couple of days ago

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.280
and he's taken this serious and he's trained it for it.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.360
And, you know, so we'll see how it plays out.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.880
Why do you think he fights though?

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.440
Like, what is that about?

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.560
Is there a broader lesson there about fighters?

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000
I think that Mike Tyson is actually one of those unique guys who has crossed over

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.400
any of these other boxers that from his era, they have no way of making

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.880
money other than fighting.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.560
Mike Tyson has made a lot of money outside of fighting.

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:23.360
I mean, Tyson still has that aura.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:27.480
You could be at a restaurant and he walks in and you're like, holy

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.800
fuck, Mike Tyson's here.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:34.040
You know, he still has that type of aura and, and energy in a room.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.960
Um, and, and, and he makes lots of money outside of the ring.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.640
I just, I think that he ends up getting these offers that he can't refuse.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.320
Oh, you think it's financial.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.080
So how much, I mean, that's a good question to ask.

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:52.880
You work with a lot of fighters for how many of them is it about money?

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:57.360
And for how many is it about the fact, the pure love of fighting?

01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:02.600
Well, the guys that get into it for the right reason are the guys who get into

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.320
it for greatness, because you want to be the fucking best, right?

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.480
And, um, when you're in it for that reason, right?

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.360
You love it and you want to be looked at as the best ever.

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:18.080
And you have the talent, the money happens, right?

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:19.840
Then you have other guys who get in.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:23.360
I believe me, I've dealt with fighters who just wanted to be famous and just

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.040
wanted to make money, you know what I mean?

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.560
And it's, you know, listen, it is what it is.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:33.400
It's, it's, it's your, it's your life and you live it the way that you want

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:36.920
and, and do your thing, but the ones that are beloved are the guys who

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.280
really want to be fucking great.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.760
And they're the ones that are remembered.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:43.680
And I mean, when you look at Tyson in his early years, when he came out,

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.480
I mean, he was a student of the game.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.120
He, he, he loved everything.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:50.760
He became completely infatuated with the fight game.

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:54.360
Then he became such a massive superstar.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:58.520
It's almost like the whole thing starts to turn on you, you know, all the

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.800
things that come at you at a young age and that kind of money.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.360
And it's, it's tough.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.800
It's tough to navigate and get through.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.320
And, you know, you, you say something like that and people like, Oh, poor him.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:11.960
He had fucking a hundred million dollars and couldn't, uh, at that age,

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:17.680
and with all the shit that people talk and all the things that you got to put up with.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:21.240
And the fame, a lot of people deal with fame.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.960
Some people handle it really well.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.880
And some people don't.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:30.360
And the perfect example of that was Forrest Griffin and Stefan Bonner.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.240
You know, they fought that, that unbelievable fight on the ultimate fighter.

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.200
Everything blew up after that.

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:40.440
Forrest dealt with fame really well and, and, and Stefan did not.

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.200
That was a special fight.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.640
What do you think attracted people to that fight?

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.840
So that, that made, that was a big leap for the UFC.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.080
It was everything.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:52.760
It was everything.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.240
Why do you think people love that fight?

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.280
What attracted people to that fight?

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.240
Why did they change everything?

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.960
Well, what happened that night is that the rest of the show was a disaster.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:06.600
Um, you know, we had the co-main event and the main event, uh, Diego

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.880
Sanchez ran through Kenny Florian in seconds.

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.920
Um, oh my God, that was, that was terrible.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:15.200
And the fights that led up to that weren't anything to talk about either.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:21.320
Then Stefan and Forrest got in there and just went toe to toe in this

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:26.080
unbelievable slugfest live on free television when cable still mattered.

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:32.560
And what I heard was at the time, you know, you had people picking up the

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.880
phone going, are you watching this show?

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.880
I'm like, the numbers just started climbing.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.760
Then you got a razor thin decision.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:39.560
Who's going to win?

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.880
He got the crowd stomping their feet.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:46.240
It sounded like a train was going through the place and everybody's chanting

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:50.560
one more round, me and the Fertitta brothers get together and we talk.

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.360
We're going to give them both contracts.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.600
So we give them both contracts and the place erupts.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:07:00.320
It just, it couldn't have been a more perfect fight at the most perfect time.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:03.520
And it just, it, it, it all came together.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.920
It's almost like this was meant to be, you know what I mean?

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:12.200
So we had so many problems with Spike TV at the time, right?

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:16.640
Because halfway through the season, the president of the company got fired.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:22.160
All the things that we thought we were going to get that year, you know, we

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.280
had this runaway hit show and normally at that time, when you would see

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:29.200
runaway hit shows, there'd be commercials.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:30.920
It'd be on, be on billboards.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.000
It'd be on the side of buses in LA and New York.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.600
We got none of that, right?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.280
We didn't even know if we were going to get a, you know, a second season

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.240
coming out of that, right?

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:49.480
And when that fight was over, I swear to God, I was like, I don't even give a fuck.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.600
We're going to end up somewhere now after this fight.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.880
And we didn't even make it out of the building that night.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.800
The Spike guys did the contract with us in the alley on a

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.200
fucking napkin after the fight.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.600
So you saw the, you already saw the magic of the fight itself.

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.560
It happened and all the shit.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.840
And at that time, I didn't know what the ratings, not like we were streaming

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:13.760
and we could see what we were, we had no idea, but I knew, I knew.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:14.840
What is it?

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:20.840
It's like just two people being willing to stand toe to toe and just go to war.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.920
And when you think about what was at stake, there was a car.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:28.240
Remember the Kia, the winner got a Kia, right?

01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:30.760
That's, that's what was the fucking right.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.480
And Stefan and Forrest, the will to win.

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:38.080
They both wanted to win that fight so bad.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.760
It was bigger than the Kia, probably.

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:44.080
You know, Forrest drove that Kia to like 200,000 miles.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:48.240
The biggest mistake Kia ever made was not doing a fucking commercial

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:50.160
with Forrest Griffin about that car.

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:52.000
Forrest Griffin loved that car so much.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:52.600
He drove it.

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.720
I think he still has it.

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.040
It's got like 200,000 miles on it.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.800
I mean, you couldn't have a better fucking commercial than that.

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:01.360
And we reached out to him too.

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:02.760
I said, Kia should know about this.

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:04.160
They fucking blew it.

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:07.840
You got a bunch of, you know how those guys are in the business world.

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:08.920
They don't fucking get anything.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.840
Maybe it was about the Kia then.

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.120
It was about winning.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.840
They both wanted to win the ultimate fighter so bad.

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:18.000
It's the Kia, it's, it's the win.

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:22.240
It's the, it's the, um, the contract you get the whole thing.

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:26.320
But I think at that point, you even forget all of that when you're in there, you

01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:30.880
probably just, there's that primal thing where like, I'm not backing down.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.000
They're both bad dudes.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.480
They were both real fighters at the end of the day.

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:35.600
That's why the fight was so great.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:36.280
Yeah.

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:36.920
You know what I mean?

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:41.000
And just throw it all, all the caution to the wind and just fight.

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:45.400
Those are some of the greatest moments in the FC too, when the technique is not

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:49.480
kind of falls apart and you're just like, fuck it.

01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:51.800
Because you're in those deep rounds.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.120
You've had, you've been through a war.

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:58.080
Now it's all about heart and dog who can dig deeper and who's got it and who wants

01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.120
it, who wants it?

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:03.520
I mean, we all know when that, when that moment happens in a fight, when you see

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:07.040
that both of these guys are fucking exhausted and for people that are watching

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.720
this, people that don't know a lot of everybody thinks they know a lot about

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.440
fighting 99.9% of the people out there don't know fucking jack shit about fighting

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.800
or what it takes to do what these people do.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:24.160
But when you get into those later rounds and fatigue sets in and then fatigue

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.960
makes you start to fucking doubt yourself.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:30.360
And then you start to wonder, can I even make it through the rest of this round?

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.040
And then you start to think, am I going to fucking die right now?

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:39.320
And these kids dig fucking deep and they just, like you said, all the other shit

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:43.560
flies out the window and now they're just on fucking autopilot to fight and win.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:47.040
Those are definitely the best fights you'll ever see in any combat sport.

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.520
I mean, that saying is true.

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.960
Like the exhaustion makes cowards of us all.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.080
I mean, there, uh, there's something about, cause I've competed a lot in Jiu-Jitsu.

01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:01.920
Uh, so there's the violence of being hit too, but even just exhaustion, it

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.480
makes you question everything.

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:09.760
It just takes you to this, some weird place where your brain starts to think

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.320
you're going to die for sure.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.800
Your brain starts to think like, why am I doing this?

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:21.400
All these excuses, all this, and then the truly heroic action is to say,

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.960
fuck it in that moment and just to get in there.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:27.840
When you think about these fights that you see in the UFC every fucking Saturday,

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:32.080
when these, these men and women get to this point where they've been in a dog

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:37.240
fight, yet they keep fucking going and you keep trying to win, you can't imagine

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:43.640
what's going on inside their heads, you know, self doubt and all these other

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:49.160
things that come into play when exhaustion sets in and they fucking power through it.

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:49.400
Yeah.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:53.320
Those moments, sometimes they're not, they don't have a glorious knockout at the end,

01:11:53.800 --> 01:12:00.640
but your decision in the third round or the fifth round to still keep pushing

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:06.040
forward, not running, but just that's a, that doesn't matter what happened.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:09.760
That like, that is a person winning a battle over themselves.

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:10.440
So true.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:11.520
It's so true.

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.160
And it happens every fucking weekend.

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:18.240
It's so impressive that I say it all the time that the people that are involved

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:23.320
in this sport are this much of the population, the people that make it to the

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:28.440
top five are incredibly unique, special human beings, man.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.440
It's, it's fucking awesome.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:32.440
You love gambling.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:33.200
I do.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:38.560
What's the biggest win of your gambling career?

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.600
Maybe psychologically, if not financially.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.560
Well, two things.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:48.160
I won a million dollar hand one night.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:52.800
It's happened one time, a million dollar hand one night at Mandalay Bay.

01:12:54.520 --> 01:13:02.280
And then one summer I beat, I beat Caesars for 12 million throughout the summer.

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.040
Throughout the summer.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:03.440
Yeah.

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.320
And then I'm on a pretty good run right now too.

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.480
This is Blackjack.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:09.040
Yeah.

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:12.080
What's the biggest loss?

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:20.280
Biggest loss was, I would, here, here is, I would call this the biggest

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.280
loss for many different reasons.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.520
This, this is what, you know, you live and you learn in life and you, you

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.640
know, you, you figure things out as you go along.

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.600
So one night I'm over at the, at the Rio, right.

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:38.480
And they got big sweets over there.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.920
So I go over there with some buddies and we got one of the sweets and we have

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:43.560
some dinner and we start drinking, right.

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:46.080
So we're having some drinks at dinner and blah, blah, blah.

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.400
Starts to ramp up, having a good time.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:53.600
And I make my way down to the Thai limit room.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:14:00.880
We start gambling and I continue to drink, having a blast.

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:07.000
I ended up leaving and going home that night and I lost like 80 grand, right.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:11.440
So I wake up the next morning and I'm like, fuck those motherfuckers got

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.680
me for 80,000 last night and da, da, da, da, da.

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:19.520
So I'm at work the next day and the host over there calls me and he says, Hey,

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:23.400
Dana, are you coming back?

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.720
Do you still need the room that you guys had where you ate and all this shit

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:31.840
used to, and I said, no, I don't need the room, but don't get, don't, don't get

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:33.400
too comfortable with my fucking 80 grand.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:34.280
I'm coming back for it.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:38.200
Dead fucking silence on the other end of the phone.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:42.800
And he's like, Dana, you lost $3 million last night.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:45.880
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:50.680
I, I, I, I only have a million and a half dollar credit line.

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:56.520
He goes, yeah, you, uh, you made us call the GM of the hotel and you started

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.920
calling him a fucking pussy and, and da, da, da, da.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.720
And I'm, and I went, yeah, no, that, that, that sounds like something I would do.

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:06.080
Yeah.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.600
So that's a real number.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.200
That was the real number.

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:14.440
And then, and then, you know, there's been a lot of cases where people are in

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:20.400
Vegas and they're like, um, Oh, you know, I lost all this money, you know, and

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:24.120
they were giving me free drinks and I drank too much and I was taken advantage

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:30.760
of, no, no, you stupid motherfucker, man up, you got fucking drunk, right?

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:35.920
They didn't, alcohol is free, but you don't have to fucking drink it.

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.040
You know what I mean?

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.840
And you know, this, this was a huge learning lesson for me.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.720
So I never drank again.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:49.000
When I, when I was playing cards after that night, but yeah, I mean, when you

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.440
asked me, that's the one that stands out most as far as, uh, having a bad loss.

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:58.560
And then, you know, of course I said, call the GM and I started calling him a

01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:59.920
pussy at three o'clock in the morning.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.640
So that is something I would absolutely do.

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.560
How do you deal with those psychologically?

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.880
Do you, uh, when you gamble, maybe this applies to fighting too.

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:12.520
Do you love winning or hate losing more?

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.120
They go hand in hand.

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:24.440
So the way that I, that I play is I live in Vegas, so 2024 is a war for me.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.360
I go to war in 24.

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:26.800
Okay.

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.240
All these nights that I play are little battles inside the

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.160
war that I will fight in 24.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:38.680
Now, at the end of the year, we will tell, you know, tally up all these

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:42.920
little battles and see where I stand on when wins and losses.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.320
And, um, you know, there's, there's, there's lots of talk about, out there

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:53.040
about my gambling, you know, places that I've been, um, kicked out of and things

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:58.600
like that, and I, I, I do pretty well.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:02.440
I do pretty well, but it's, it's, it's what I like to do, you know, I, I

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:08.440
don't gamble in a way that I would ever hurt myself or hurt my family or, uh,

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.080
you know, I'm sure you've heard the Norm MacDonald stories.

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:15.280
Norm MacDonald lost like his entire personal wealth four times or something

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:18.880
like that, um, yeah, that's, that's not going to happen to me.

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:24.080
So you, you, you manage it, but just psychologically you're able to be even.

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:24.400
Yeah.

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:27.200
So, so when I win, it's awesome.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.000
It's always great to win.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:35.520
Winning is a great feeling in business and sports and life and definitely in

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:40.960
gambling, um, losing is, is, is never fun, but it's part of the game.

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:41.960
You know what I mean?

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:47.520
If, if you want to be in the game and it's sports, it's business or whatever,

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.880
there's going to be wins and there's going to be losses and you have to take

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:55.200
them both in stride and you have to be able to, you know, um, there's a lot of

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:58.000
people when you gamble, right.

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.440
And you lose and you go into a deep, dark depression.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:06.640
I've seen this with guys that do get depressed and gambling isn't for you.

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:11.760
You know, if you are the type of person that's on social media and people say

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:16.080
horrible things to you and you get depressed and you shouldn't be on social

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:17.600
media, you know what I mean?

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.520
These are all part of being in the game.

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:24.520
When you're in the game, great things happen and really bad things happen.

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.000
And you got to take it all in stride and you got to pick yourself up the next

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.360
day, strap your fucking shoes back on and get out there and go to fucking war again.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:33.400
That's how it works.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:34.880
That's some Goggins shit right there.

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:35.280
All right.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.280
I love that motivational speech.

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:39.520
It's the truth though.

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.040
Yeah, it is.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:40.760
It's the truth though.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.880
Listen, every day when you get out of bed, life's standing right there to kick

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:49.200
you in the fucking face, man, could be anything, could be you get up and you

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:52.160
walk downstairs, you had a fucking flat tire and you're late for work and you

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:56.360
got this and that life is going to throw all kinds of crazy shit at you, right?

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.480
And you have to be ready for it and you got to fucking deal with it.

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.200
You can't curl up into a ball.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.280
You can't run away from it.

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.080
You can't hide.

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.280
You have to take all this shit head on.

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.120
You have to get up every day.

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:10.920
When I get up out of bed, I strap up and I'm getting ready for fucking war.

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.520
Cause I know I'm coming in here.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:15.480
I know a bunch of bad shit's going to happen that I'm going to fucking deal

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:20.440
with and if that's not bad enough, when I finally get out of here, I'm probably

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:23.520
going to go to the casino and I'm going to get into another fucking war.

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:24.360
You know what I mean?

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:26.560
I thrive in chaos.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.120
I actually love chaos.

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.320
I, everybody talks about retiring.

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:31.840
Fuck that shit.

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:33.760
What am I going to do when I retire?

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:34.560
What would I do?

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:37.120
What would I, I liked, I liked to go to war.

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:37.960
I liked the battle.

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:38.800
I liked to win.

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:41.920
Sometimes I lose, but then I have to come back from the loss.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.120
And I love to build brands.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:49.160
I love to set short-term and long-term goals and then knock them all down.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:53.960
You know, um, this is just the stuff that, that, that excites me and, and, and

01:19:53.960 --> 01:20:01.400
whether it's, um, business or, or gambling or I like being a fan of things too.

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.120
Like I like live music.

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:07.280
So when I find a, like a band that I like, I get excited, uh, to, to, to

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.680
go watch the band live or Celtics game.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.560
I love the fucking Boston Celtics and I love, you know, going to

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:13.440
the games and watching them.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.680
This is the year, hopefully we're going to fucking win it this year.

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:20.680
Um, these are all things that make me happy and excite me in my life.

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:24.640
And it's funny because there's this post that I post maybe

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:25.560
three, four nights a week.

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:27.760
I also love the city.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:32.400
I can't tell if the city of Las Vegas was built for me or I was

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.400
built for this fucking city, but I love it.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:38.560
And there's this turn on Summerlin Parkway, right?

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.600
Every night and it's dark.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.120
And from there, you can see the entire fucking city and it's all

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:44.440
fucking lights and it's bad ass.

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:49.360
And I'm usually driving home after a fucking incredible day, right?

01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:53.520
This amazing day and this unbelievable fucking life that I have.

01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:57.880
And I have this just moment of gratitude every time I take that turn.

01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:01.080
And I'm like, God damn, I love this fucking city.

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:05.160
And just every night when I go home, I'm just so happy and grateful

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.160
for this life that I have.

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:07.000
So you're grateful.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.520
You're celebrating, even if the day is full of shit, full of problems,

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:11.760
you have to solve all of this.

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.800
You're still able to put that behind you.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:14.640
I love that too.

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:16.480
I love problem solving.

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:24.240
I love, um, I love taking things that seem impossible and fucking who,

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:28.280
what's been shit on more than this fucking company right here.

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.080
Power slap, right?

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:30.640
Yeah.

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:32.800
This thing's a fucking beast.

01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:38.200
It's an absolute beast of a, in 13 months, that's the most successful

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.480
thing I've ever been a part of.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:43.520
And I love every fucking minute of it, especially the negativity.

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.120
I love negativity.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:45.440
Awesome.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:46.400
You almost feed on it.

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.080
That's great.

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:47.520
That's great.

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:48.120
You're a build for it.

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.080
I eat that shit for fucking breakfast, man.

01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:50.760
I love it.

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:54.520
What's your favorite movie about Vegas casino?

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.400
Yeah, it would have to be casino.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:57.520
No doubt about it.

01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:58.440
Yeah.

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:03.800
You ever see a movie that changed your life that that actually impacted

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:05.400
your life in some way, shape or form?

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:06.400
Probably.

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:06.960
Which one?

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:07.800
That's a good question.

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:12.520
I have to think, um, I, well, I have a lot, a lot, because, you know,

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:18.120
could be one of them probably taught me about women, um, you know, Forrest

01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:22.600
Gump for me is a simple movie, but I was, it was a really good movie to show.

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:27.320
It reminded, cause I've been really fortunate in my life, like over and

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.480
over and over, and I don't think I deserve any of it.

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:31.560
So I just always felt like Forrest Gump.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:35.360
So when I finally saw it, uh, it really connected with me.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:38.800
It was like, okay, this, this universe works in weird ways and

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:42.480
stuff just materializes and you just kind of be good to people.

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.520
Put that good karma out there and it happens for you.

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.080
So that, that was a movie like that.

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.400
I'm actually very superstitious about that.

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:52.600
I believe that, that, that what you, what you put out, you get back.

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:57.560
Um, and I believe that when you have, you should take care of other people

01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:02.520
and you should always try to bring people up with you and all that kind of stuff.

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:08.160
But the movie that changed the whole trajectory of my life was Vision Quest.

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:08.760
Oh yeah.

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.480
Well, yeah, that that's a good one too.

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:10.680
Yeah.

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:11.520
Vision Quest, man.

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:13.320
I fucking love that movie.

01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.960
It's basically, you know, it's telling the story of a kid who really

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:19.960
wasn't anybody in high school and nobody kind of knew who he was.

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:21.640
It wasn't popular or any of that kind of shit.

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:26.640
And he decided that that was the year that he was going to make his mark.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.240
And he was a good wrestler at 178 pounds, but he was going to move down

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:34.040
to 160 something to take on the shoot, the scariest guy and the whatever.

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:39.560
But there's all these little things in the movie that, that really

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.720
lay out what life is all about.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:47.040
One of the parts is he's in a class and he's talking about, the

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:50.600
teacher is talking about some poem and he says, what does this poem mean to you?

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:54.320
Well, this little girl is walking through, um, you know, the park and all

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:57.760
the leaves are falling off the trees and she realizes that she's going to die

01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:03.680
someday and that a lot of people think they have all this time, so they fucking

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:07.520
waste it and they never go out and do what they really set out to do or

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:10.120
accomplish or do anything great in their life.

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:11.240
That's one meaning.

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:13.760
Then he's got the guy that he works with at work.

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:16.600
You know, he's cutting weight and his nose is bleeding and all this shit.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.720
And this guy keeps going, why the fuck are you doing this?

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.120
Pick that thing up and eat it like a fucking man.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.360
This is ridiculous.

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:24.480
I don't know why you're doing this to yourself, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:27.560
So then when he meets the girl and he gets to the point where he

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.800
feels like he wants to quit, right.

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:31.120
Where does he go?

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:35.240
He goes to that guy's fucking apartment because he knows when he shows up at

01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:37.520
this guy's apartment, he's going to go, yeah, fuck this shit.

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.920
No, he went to work.

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:42.120
He went to work to talk to him and he wasn't at work.

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.320
He took the night off.

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:47.400
So he shows up at the fucking house, the shitty little fucking apartment that the

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.200
guy lives in and the guy's putting a suit and tie on and shit.

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:51.840
He's like, they said you called in sick.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:52.320
What's going on?

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.600
He's like, well, yeah, aren't you wrestling this guy tonight?

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:56.920
And he's like, yeah, but why would you?

01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:58.520
You're going to get docked a night's pay.

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:00.120
And all of a sudden she says, you know what, man?

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:01.800
And it all gets laid out.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.720
I get the goosebumps even telling you this fucking.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:04.880
Is that the place speech?

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:05.360
Pele.

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:05.880
Yeah.

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:10.440
What are you saying about, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucking cooking in an

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:12.120
overnight hotel fucking thing.

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.440
And I live in this shitty apartment.

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:18.400
A human being can lift himself upside down and backwards and kick a ball into a

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.720
fucking net and the whole stadium goes crazy.

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:24.320
And this guy runs around and I'm sitting here in my fucking apartment alone.

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.440
And I start crying.

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:25.640
Yeah.

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:26.280
I start crying.

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:29.920
So the guy who's been shitting on him the whole fucking time actually really

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:34.040
respects him for what he's done and sees what this kid is capable of doing.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:34.880
And all this shit.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:39.080
This just, this fucking movie spoke to me on so many different levels.

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:43.160
And I think it's probably the most underrated movie of all time.

01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:46.400
When you really break down the meaning of what this movie is about.

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.360
And, and, and, and it fucking really spoke to me.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:52.720
That's probably the greatest movie on combat one-on-one combat.

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:54.440
I would agree.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:55.520
Ever made.

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.120
I would agree.

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:56.560
Yeah.

01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:01.560
And especially if you can really hear the messages that it's, that it's, that

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:03.760
it's given you in this movie, it's, it's, it's excellent.

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:04.800
You know, it's funny.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:09.480
They just did like the, and I saw this after the fact, which completely

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:14.640
fucking pissed me off, they did like the 25 year or the 30 year thing.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.440
It was filmed in Spokane, Washington.

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.400
They showed the movie at a movie theater there and the cast members

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:20.760
came out and spoke about it.

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.480
I would have fucking flown there for that.

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.440
Are you shitting me?

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:28.120
I'd have been there fucking 30 seconds to go up there and, and, and be a part of that.

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:29.760
That, that movie literally changed my life.

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:30.760
Yeah.

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:31.880
I suppose me too.

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:34.560
It made me, uh, it made me want to wrestle.

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:39.480
I mean, probably the reason I was, maybe it made me love fall in love with wrestling.

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:40.160
Well, you know, it's funny.

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:44.440
I wasn't even into wrestling at all and I didn't have to be for that movie to.

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:44.880
Yeah.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.360
It's the basic human story.

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:47.400
It's such a great movie.

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:48.520
I mean, that's what fighting does.

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:53.000
It brings out the basic, like the, the, the humanity of a person really, like

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.320
if the, for the people that choose to step up and step in the ring and then

01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:02.200
chase greatness and actually do it from like against the long odds, that's

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:03.240
why it's a beautiful game.

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:04.200
And it's so true.

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:09.560
I mean, when you think about like, I'm 54 years old right now, like that, I mean,

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:15.080
it just fucking flew by and, uh, you think when you're young, that you have

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.720
all this time, you have no time.

01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:18.600
There's dirt.

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:19.360
There's no time.

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:24.200
I mean, one of the, one of the quotes on the wall and the gym in there is, um,

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:29.360
you know, there is no tomorrow from, from, from Rocky three, you know, there

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.880
is no tomorrow, fuck that shit.

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.520
Let's, let's, let's get all this shit done today.

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:34.920
Do you think about your death?

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.920
I'm not, I'm not afraid of death.

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:38.520
Not even a little bit.

01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.080
I'm not afraid of it.

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:45.200
Um, I don't know if that'll be the case when I'm facing it, you know, when I'm

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:49.200
looking down the barrel of it, laying in a hospital bed somewhere, but

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.000
for now, just squeezing as much as you can out of it.

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.240
I literally, I don't even like to sleep.

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:56.280
My life is so fucking awesome.

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:57.840
I don't even want to go to bed at night.

01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:58.920
I don't even want to go to sleep.

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.160
I want to stay up fucking.

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.600
I wish I could fucking do 24 hours and never have to sleep.

01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:05.080
That's how much I love my life.

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:09.440
What has a watching thousands of fights over the years taught you about human

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:11.760
nature, about us humans?

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:14.600
I don't care what color you are, what country you come from,

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:15.600
what language you speak.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:16.920
We're all human beings.

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.280
Fighting's in our DNA.

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:19.320
We get it and we like it.

01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:20.360
And it's true.

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:21.920
Fighting is in our DNA.

01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:23.640
It's a part of who we are.

01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:29.440
And, uh, you know, no matter where you are, if a fight breaks out, it creates

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:33.920
this fucking energy, this buzz, the sense of fear.

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:37.520
I mean, a lot of different emotions happen in people when fights break out.

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.440
But one thing that, that, that is always the case.

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.040
Everybody's watching, man.

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.640
Everybody's fucking it.

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:45.880
All of their eyes are on the fight.

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:47.640
I mean, we were just in Mexico.

01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:52.320
Fucking fight broke out, like in the good seats, like right here with

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:54.120
these seats, they're super expensive.

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:56.600
And security never fucking came.

01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:01.120
They just let these guys fight until they gassed out and then everybody put

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:04.880
their chairs back together and sat back down and fucking, I literally got up from

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:10.000
my table, walked over and was watching this fight at the fights at the fights.

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:10.560
Yeah.

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:14.120
Humans fight and humans love watching fighting.

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:14.800
Absolutely.

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:18.120
And that was my thought process going into buying the UFC.

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.920
And I believe that this would work everywhere.

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:22.640
And thank God we were right.

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:28.800
Well, Dana, thank you for bringing this very human thing of fighting the art of

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:34.120
it, the science of it, the heroic stories, the vision quest stories of it all.

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:34.600
Boom.

01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:36.640
Um, really appreciate you talking to me, brother.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:37.240
Thank you.

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:37.960
Pleasure, buddy.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.080
Thank you for the kind words.

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:43.840
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Dana White to support this podcast.

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:46.320
Please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:49.680
And now let me leave you with some words from Muhammad Ali.

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:56.160
Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to

01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:00.600
live in a world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it.

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:02.560
Impossible is not a fact.

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:03.400
It's an opinion.

01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:05.640
Impossible is not a declaration.

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:07.120
It's a dare.

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:11.520
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
