00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
If you get into a sauna the way I just described,

00:02.640 --> 00:05.240
not the two hours a day, but 30 minutes,

00:05.240 --> 00:07.460
twice a week or three times per week,

00:07.460 --> 00:09.460
you reduce the likelihood of dying

00:09.460 --> 00:12.440
of a cardiovascular event by 27%.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.720
If you do it four or more times per week,

00:14.720 --> 00:17.960
you reduce the probability of dying by 50%.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.840
Is there any scientific evidence

00:19.840 --> 00:22.460
that being naked is beneficial in the sauna?

00:22.460 --> 00:25.640
Well, in certain contexts, it leads to childbirth.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.580
Okay, well, I'll have to read up on that.

00:27.620 --> 00:29.320
I think Dorothy Parker said,

00:30.220 --> 00:32.580
the cure for boredom is curiosity.

00:32.580 --> 00:34.440
There is no cure for curiosity.

00:36.700 --> 00:39.400
The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman,

00:39.400 --> 00:41.740
his third time on this podcast.

00:41.740 --> 00:45.300
He's a brilliant neuroscientist at Stanford University

00:45.300 --> 00:48.220
and the host of one of the best,

00:49.520 --> 00:51.300
the best, if you ask me,

00:51.300 --> 00:53.280
health and science podcast in the world

00:53.280 --> 00:55.620
called Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:55.620 --> 00:58.860
Check him out on Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube.

00:58.860 --> 01:01.940
Most importantly, Andrew is a great human being

01:01.940 --> 01:05.340
and has quickly become a great friend.

01:05.340 --> 01:07.420
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

01:07.420 --> 01:09.580
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:09.580 --> 01:10.860
in the description.

01:10.860 --> 01:14.820
And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Huberman.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.620
We meet again, my friend.

01:17.620 --> 01:19.780
We should talk on each other's podcast once a year.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.560
I think we should make a deal.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.060
I was just talking to the guys.

01:23.060 --> 01:24.380
This is a show called Louie.

01:24.380 --> 01:25.900
I don't know if you know it.

01:25.900 --> 01:26.740
Louie CK?

01:26.740 --> 01:27.740
Yeah, Louie CK.

01:27.740 --> 01:30.380
And there's this thing called Bang Bang,

01:30.380 --> 01:31.700
which people that are probably watching

01:31.700 --> 01:33.580
know exactly what I'm talking about.

01:33.580 --> 01:37.060
It's this worst possible thing you can do in terms of meals,

01:37.060 --> 01:41.000
which is you go to a restaurant, do a full meal,

01:41.000 --> 01:43.340
and then you go to another restaurant and do a full meal,

01:43.340 --> 01:44.700
and you pack, you.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.540
That's brutal.

01:46.540 --> 01:51.100
So they go Mexican, Italian, sushi, pizza, barbecue,

01:51.100 --> 01:53.020
IHOP, that one is disgusting.

01:53.020 --> 01:57.900
This kind of thing reminds me of the joy of food.

01:57.900 --> 02:01.940
Last time we were hanging out, we went to see Joe do comedy

02:01.940 --> 02:04.740
and then we went to eat Russian food.

02:04.740 --> 02:08.520
And it was a particularly fun experience

02:08.520 --> 02:11.180
to go to a Russian restaurant.

02:11.180 --> 02:14.420
The only person there that didn't speak Russian

02:14.420 --> 02:16.060
and eat Russian food with you.

02:17.500 --> 02:20.500
Because I felt walking in, they trusted you.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.300
They didn't trust me.

02:22.300 --> 02:24.820
The funny thing about the people there,

02:24.820 --> 02:26.700
they were talking to you in Russian

02:26.700 --> 02:29.180
and then they refused to sort of switch to English,

02:29.180 --> 02:31.320
even though they understood you speak no Russian.

02:31.320 --> 02:34.120
This is Russian house in Austin, by the way.

02:34.120 --> 02:38.180
Anyway, by way of question, what's the worst or the best,

02:38.180 --> 02:40.200
depending on your perspective, cheap meal?

02:40.200 --> 02:41.580
Let's call it a pigging out meal,

02:41.580 --> 02:45.260
but it could be a cheap meal that you've ever had

02:45.260 --> 02:48.700
or you want to have that's like on the bucket list

02:48.700 --> 02:49.980
or something that's in the past,

02:50.100 --> 02:52.340
where you did something like a bang bang,

02:52.340 --> 02:54.140
which is like, you're talking about

02:54.140 --> 02:56.820
multiple thousands of calories

02:56.820 --> 02:59.100
that you just feel horrible about yourself

02:59.100 --> 03:01.560
but you still keep eating because it's delicious,

03:01.560 --> 03:03.960
but also great company.

03:03.960 --> 03:07.320
Something about the atmosphere is just right.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.740
Screw the diet, screw all the things you know,

03:09.740 --> 03:12.460
just like you should be doing,

03:12.460 --> 03:14.500
but just throw it all out the window.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.940
I've done that several times.

03:16.940 --> 03:18.140
Yeah, I don't do this anymore,

03:18.140 --> 03:21.260
but the entire time I was a postdoc, so five years,

03:21.260 --> 03:23.620
and the entire time I was a pre-tenured professor,

03:23.620 --> 03:27.420
so five years, so I basically followed

03:27.420 --> 03:29.660
the Tim Ferriss slow carb diet,

03:29.660 --> 03:31.420
which is, you know, people can look it up,

03:31.420 --> 03:32.920
but it worked really well.

03:32.920 --> 03:37.180
It was basically some, you know, like good animal proteins,

03:37.180 --> 03:38.620
you know, fish and meat and things like that.

03:38.620 --> 03:39.460
Why slow carb?

03:39.460 --> 03:41.580
Because slow carb is like low glycemic stuff

03:41.580 --> 03:44.460
is mostly lentils and beans and things and vegetables,

03:44.460 --> 03:48.580
no dairy, no, anyway, but then one day-

03:48.580 --> 03:49.420
Pasta in there?

03:49.420 --> 03:50.260
Sorry to interrupt.

03:50.260 --> 03:51.180
No, no pasta.

03:51.180 --> 03:53.580
So it wasn't low carb, but it was low glycemic carb.

03:53.580 --> 03:55.260
And I did that and it worked terrifically well

03:55.260 --> 03:56.300
just for energy levels

03:56.300 --> 03:57.400
because I want to be able to train and work.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.900
And then one day a week,

03:58.900 --> 04:02.760
you're supposed to go full cheat day.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.380
And so I would do what used to be 12 hours,

04:05.380 --> 04:07.220
but then it became 24, you know,

04:07.220 --> 04:09.800
you start to redefine what the day is.

04:09.800 --> 04:13.820
And I would, and that was when Costello was pretty young

04:13.820 --> 04:14.940
and we would do it together.

04:14.940 --> 04:18.100
So I would get pizzas and croissants and donuts

04:18.100 --> 04:20.060
and I would just do the full thing.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.660
And by the end of the day,

04:21.660 --> 04:24.020
you don't want to look at an item of food.

04:24.020 --> 04:25.540
You're just repulsed by food.

04:25.540 --> 04:27.100
The only modification I made

04:27.100 --> 04:29.360
was the next day I would fast completely

04:29.360 --> 04:32.340
just to avoid the gastric distress of eating anything.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.220
And so I would do them on Sundays

04:34.220 --> 04:35.520
and then Mondays I'd fast all day.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.580
And then by Tuesday, I felt pretty good again,

04:37.580 --> 04:38.740
but Sunday and Monday,

04:38.740 --> 04:42.680
or you just feel like you're sliding down the slope

04:42.680 --> 04:44.880
of just blood sugar disaster.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.000
Terrible idea or a good idea?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.160
You know, at the time I enjoyed it.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.280
I love donuts, croissants, all that kind of stuff.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.400
What's interesting is after stopping that whole protocol,

04:53.400 --> 04:54.840
now I just try and eat well each day.

04:54.840 --> 04:55.680
Protocol.

04:55.680 --> 04:56.520
It's really a protocol.

04:56.520 --> 04:59.240
Now I basically, I do a pseudo intermittent fasting.

04:59.240 --> 05:00.420
I don't, I'm not really strict,

05:00.420 --> 05:02.200
but I'll start eating around 11,

05:02.200 --> 05:03.280
eat my first meal around 11.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.360
I usually train in the morning,

05:04.360 --> 05:06.520
eat my last bite of food somewhere around eight or nine.

05:06.520 --> 05:07.620
And I'm not super strict.

05:07.620 --> 05:09.440
I might have some berries or something late at night.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.160
Three meals, two meals?

05:11.160 --> 05:14.760
Two meals, and then maybe a little bit of snacking

05:14.760 --> 05:16.160
on some nuts or something in the middle.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.760
Ever fast, 24 hours?

05:17.760 --> 05:18.900
Never done a long fast,

05:18.900 --> 05:20.800
except when I was doing the cheat days.

05:20.800 --> 05:24.520
And then, and actually there are a couple different ways

05:24.520 --> 05:25.820
to do cheat days that were fun.

05:25.820 --> 05:26.920
Like if you were in a new city,

05:26.920 --> 05:30.520
you could try all the restaurants that you wanted.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.040
Yeah, and I think Tim and our mutual friend,

05:33.040 --> 05:34.440
John Romanello did a,

05:34.440 --> 05:36.760
I think it was like a cheat day marathon where they did,

05:36.760 --> 05:38.360
you know, marathons, 26.3 miles.

05:38.360 --> 05:41.680
They went to 26.3 different locations in New York.

05:41.680 --> 05:42.680
They put it on a map.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.520
And I never took it to that extreme, but-

05:45.520 --> 05:46.360
Wait, wait, wait.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.480
Over how many days?

05:47.480 --> 05:48.320
One day.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.140
That was their cheat day.

05:49.140 --> 05:49.980
What?

05:49.980 --> 05:51.000
Just cause they were, you know-

05:51.000 --> 05:53.040
Just a little bit of something at each place?

05:53.040 --> 05:54.320
Yeah, exactly.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.440
I mean, there are things that guys do in their thirties

05:56.440 --> 05:58.040
that you just shouldn't do in your forties.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.640
I can say that cause I'm in my forties.

05:59.640 --> 06:02.000
And now I just try and eat well most days.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.220
And what's interesting is about 12 to 14 months ago,

06:05.220 --> 06:08.140
I completely lost all appetite for sweets.

06:08.860 --> 06:09.700
I don't know what happened.

06:09.700 --> 06:10.540
I still love savory foods.

06:10.540 --> 06:12.340
So meat and butter and cheese.

06:12.340 --> 06:14.240
And I love vegetables too.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.900
I love fruit also, but lost all appetite.

06:16.900 --> 06:18.820
So if you put a donut in front of me or ice cream

06:18.820 --> 06:22.180
or something like, I just, it's almost aversive to me.

06:22.180 --> 06:23.380
And I don't know what happened.

06:23.380 --> 06:24.260
I don't know what changed.

06:24.260 --> 06:25.780
It's probably a scientific explanation.

06:25.780 --> 06:26.620
Sure.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.460
It says to do, maybe-

06:27.460 --> 06:28.660
Neuron loss, dementia.

06:28.660 --> 06:29.940
Yeah.

06:29.940 --> 06:34.940
The sugar, the desire for that rush maybe is gone

06:35.860 --> 06:37.460
from your soul.

06:37.700 --> 06:38.820
What was the most delicious thing?

06:38.820 --> 06:40.620
Is it croissant, donuts?

06:40.620 --> 06:42.260
Is there a thing that-

06:42.260 --> 06:44.780
There's a place in Portland,

06:44.780 --> 06:45.780
I don't know if it's still open,

06:45.780 --> 06:47.820
called Little Tees Bakery.

06:47.820 --> 06:50.780
And they have croissants that easily rival

06:50.780 --> 06:52.220
the croissants in Paris.

06:52.220 --> 06:54.680
People make a lot of the pastry in Paris,

06:54.680 --> 06:57.040
but it's really the bread in Paris that's amazing.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.460
We lived there when I was a kid

06:58.460 --> 06:59.780
and we did a sabbatical there.

06:59.780 --> 07:01.780
And there they do the baguette morning bake

07:01.780 --> 07:02.940
and afternoon bake.

07:02.940 --> 07:06.260
And there's nothing like the bread in Paris

07:06.300 --> 07:07.140
or the people.

07:08.460 --> 07:10.940
But if you're in the Pacific Northwest,

07:10.940 --> 07:13.040
you can find amazing croissants there.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.100
What do you do with the croissant?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.300
What do you do with the bread?

07:15.300 --> 07:16.620
Butter or is it just-

07:16.620 --> 07:18.420
I actually used to, I don't eat them anymore.

07:18.420 --> 07:19.800
I don't have much of an appetite for them,

07:19.800 --> 07:20.860
even though they're not a sweet food.

07:20.860 --> 07:24.020
But I'm always putting butter on the croissant.

07:24.020 --> 07:25.420
Butter on the butter croissant.

07:25.420 --> 07:26.240
No jam.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.500
I would never adulterate my croissant.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.380
I have to actually be honest about this

07:30.380 --> 07:31.620
because people talk about steak

07:31.620 --> 07:34.500
and they talk about bread with the butter.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.860
I feel like butter is cheating.

07:36.420 --> 07:40.060
I feel like you're disrespecting the fundamental food

07:40.060 --> 07:41.340
by adding butter.

07:41.340 --> 07:46.340
Because butter, it's like a elite version of ketchup.

07:47.980 --> 07:49.540
Well, there we diverged because for me,

07:49.540 --> 07:52.120
bread is just a vehicle for butter.

07:54.180 --> 07:56.760
A cracker is just a vehicle for cheese.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.380
Oh, so that's just the cracker

07:58.380 --> 07:59.920
and the bread is just texture.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.180
It's just that people look at you funny

08:01.180 --> 08:03.240
if you just eat the butter straight,

08:03.240 --> 08:04.340
which occasionally I do.

08:04.340 --> 08:05.180
I got it.

08:05.620 --> 08:07.880
I put a little piece of bread underneath it,

08:07.880 --> 08:10.260
not because I'm low carb, strictly low carb,

08:10.260 --> 08:12.980
but just because otherwise you get some funny looks.

08:12.980 --> 08:17.140
That's like pasta is a vehicle for pasta sauce.

08:17.140 --> 08:18.460
It's interesting.

08:18.460 --> 08:23.420
But like Indian non-bread, you have the bread.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.460
I've had a lot of soul searching

08:25.460 --> 08:28.780
on which part of Indian brings me so much joy.

08:28.780 --> 08:30.780
Is it the bread or is it all the sauces

08:30.780 --> 08:31.660
that come with the bread?

08:31.660 --> 08:32.820
Well, there we diverge again

08:32.820 --> 08:36.900
because for whatever reason, no disrespect to anyone,

08:36.900 --> 08:39.100
but Indian food doesn't appeal to me.

08:39.100 --> 08:40.300
Well, you're a lucky man

08:40.300 --> 08:43.140
because the number of calories in that food,

08:43.140 --> 08:44.780
it sneaks like non-bread.

08:44.780 --> 08:46.100
I don't know how non-bread is made,

08:46.100 --> 08:49.320
but I think it's just soaked in oil

08:49.320 --> 08:51.820
and it just very intensely,

08:51.820 --> 08:55.380
like the density of calories is very, very high.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.700
For me, barbecue, I would say is probably the-

08:58.700 --> 08:59.540
That's good.

08:59.540 --> 09:02.940
Anytime I'm in Austin, I start thinking about barbecue.

09:02.940 --> 09:04.380
I do love meat.

09:04.380 --> 09:05.220
My dad's Argentine.

09:05.220 --> 09:06.220
I mean, I love steak.

09:06.220 --> 09:07.060
I love meat.

09:07.060 --> 09:09.420
I mean, in Argentina, chorizo sausage

09:09.420 --> 09:12.620
is an appetizer before you have steak.

09:12.620 --> 09:13.660
It's meat on top of meat.

09:13.660 --> 09:15.980
And it's not just the men, right?

09:15.980 --> 09:18.380
You see women, sometimes very petite women,

09:18.380 --> 09:22.540
eating steaks that are bigger than their skull size.

09:22.540 --> 09:24.340
Slowly, they eat very slowly there.

09:24.340 --> 09:26.220
And they all eat dessert too, which is interesting.

09:26.220 --> 09:28.860
And they generally do the sort of one meal per day

09:28.900 --> 09:30.540
and do that kind of real flexibly.

09:30.540 --> 09:31.740
That's how I think about it,

09:31.740 --> 09:32.940
because I often eat one meal a day,

09:32.940 --> 09:34.220
especially when I'm traveling.

09:34.220 --> 09:36.660
It feels like a cheap meal because it allows,

09:36.660 --> 09:38.860
it gives you a bit of more freedom

09:38.860 --> 09:42.540
to just lose yourself in the quantity of the food.

09:42.540 --> 09:46.220
I did the three day fast and I ate chicken breast,

09:46.220 --> 09:48.000
like literally chicken breast with nothing else,

09:48.000 --> 09:48.900
just grilled.

09:48.900 --> 09:51.500
And it was the most delicious piece of meat I've ever eaten.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.620
And that gives you,

09:53.620 --> 09:55.460
the problem is when you fast for three days,

09:55.460 --> 09:56.460
you really can't pig out.

09:56.460 --> 09:57.300
You really shouldn't.

09:57.580 --> 09:59.500
Well, your stomach will shrink in size already.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.780
Your gut microbiome is almost completely depleted

10:01.780 --> 10:02.840
by fasting.

10:02.840 --> 10:03.680
A lot of people think,

10:03.680 --> 10:05.780
oh, cleanses and fasts are great for the microbiome.

10:05.780 --> 10:07.660
They quash your microbiome.

10:07.660 --> 10:09.680
However, when you start eating again,

10:09.680 --> 10:11.660
the microbiome comes back better

10:11.660 --> 10:13.120
than it was before your fast.

10:13.120 --> 10:13.980
For people who don't know,

10:13.980 --> 10:15.400
Sergey and Todd are on the call.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.980
They're kind of pulling stuff up.

10:16.980 --> 10:17.820
They just pulled up.

10:17.820 --> 10:18.660
Oh, there's Phelps.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.580
Phelps with, I forget how many calories,

10:20.580 --> 10:21.700
just eating 10,000.

10:21.700 --> 10:22.540
You know what's interesting?

10:22.540 --> 10:24.800
There's some cool physiology around this.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.780
The reason he needed to eat so much

10:26.820 --> 10:30.080
is not that he was burning that many calories

10:30.080 --> 10:31.340
in pure movement.

10:31.340 --> 10:33.380
It's that when you do exercise in water,

10:33.380 --> 10:34.700
even if it's warm water,

10:34.700 --> 10:36.560
the heat transfer in water is greater.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.260
So you burn far more calories.

10:38.260 --> 10:40.560
And again, here, I'm admittedly lifting that

10:40.560 --> 10:43.300
from a knowledge that was passed on to me by Tim Ferriss.

10:43.300 --> 10:46.140
I did not, so, but I checked it out and it's absolutely true.

10:46.140 --> 10:48.020
So if you exercise in water,

10:48.020 --> 10:49.620
even if it's not really cold water,

10:49.620 --> 10:50.700
your caloric needs go way up,

10:50.700 --> 10:52.300
which is why you get out of the pool

10:52.300 --> 10:53.660
and you're often really hungry.

10:53.660 --> 10:56.060
And for fans of the Human Lab podcast,

10:56.100 --> 10:59.200
and if you're not a fan, what are you doing with your life?

11:00.480 --> 11:02.140
You would probably chuckle at the fact

11:02.140 --> 11:05.900
that Andrew just cited his sources even on that statement.

11:05.900 --> 11:08.140
Because you're so good at,

11:08.140 --> 11:09.420
I don't know how your memory works,

11:09.420 --> 11:12.820
but the only person whose memory is better

11:12.820 --> 11:14.580
than Joe Rogan is yours.

11:14.580 --> 11:16.460
But my colleague's joke,

11:16.460 --> 11:20.900
you know, PubMed sort of scrolls through my mind.

11:20.900 --> 11:22.620
Also in science, as you know,

11:22.620 --> 11:25.600
attribution is so baked into what we do.

11:26.480 --> 11:27.520
And I think that it's interesting

11:27.520 --> 11:29.840
because now spending a lot of time on social media,

11:29.840 --> 11:31.600
attribution is not as common.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.960
But in academia, you learn really early on

11:34.960 --> 11:37.280
that if you give a talk about your data

11:37.280 --> 11:39.320
and you cite all these amazing sources,

11:39.320 --> 11:42.380
all it does is make you look better, right?

11:42.380 --> 11:44.520
Whereas in social media and elsewhere

11:44.520 --> 11:45.640
in the business sector,

11:45.640 --> 11:47.000
it's almost like citing other people,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.340
people feel as if it's gonna take away some of the credit.

11:49.340 --> 11:50.880
All it does is place you in the company

11:50.880 --> 11:52.500
of people that do really nice work.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.340
So I have tremendous,

11:53.340 --> 11:55.700
and I have genuine and tremendous respect for Tim.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.020
He's been about 10 years ahead

11:57.020 --> 11:59.020
on a huge number of health-related things

11:59.020 --> 12:01.380
and other things, an extremely kind person,

12:01.380 --> 12:02.340
very thoughtful person.

12:02.340 --> 12:04.020
So it's also just a pleasure

12:04.020 --> 12:05.780
to shine light on other people.

12:05.780 --> 12:07.940
Yeah, well, I actually, to push back,

12:07.940 --> 12:12.000
I know there's a culture of if you write a paper,

12:12.000 --> 12:15.140
standing on the shoulders of giants is a powerful thing,

12:15.140 --> 12:18.380
but there's also a culture of not giving credit

12:19.360 --> 12:21.360
to the strongest idea in your paper

12:21.400 --> 12:24.880
and instead say it's kind of, or imply that it's original.

12:24.880 --> 12:28.480
There is a culture of kind of not celebrating others.

12:28.480 --> 12:33.160
I think people get most competitive in all walks of life,

12:33.160 --> 12:35.400
but especially in science when they're,

12:35.400 --> 12:39.000
the closer they get in the exact other thing they work on.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.280
And so there's this dance,

12:41.280 --> 12:43.040
there's a few researchers

12:43.040 --> 12:46.180
in each of the individual little things that you work on.

12:46.180 --> 12:48.000
If you're studying a particular kind of ant,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.120
you know that other asshole

12:50.160 --> 12:52.600
that also is studying that particular ant,

12:52.600 --> 12:56.120
and then you're not going to often give credit

12:56.120 --> 12:59.760
for the brilliant ideas that that other researcher is doing.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.920
And I think one of the things you've discovered

13:01.920 --> 13:03.640
and just as part of your nature

13:03.640 --> 13:06.480
and which is why it's really great

13:06.480 --> 13:08.560
that you have an audience

13:08.560 --> 13:09.840
and you inspire others to do the same

13:09.840 --> 13:13.360
is you celebrate that other ant studier is great

13:13.360 --> 13:16.820
and everybody wins, it raises all boats.

13:16.820 --> 13:19.840
But that initial instinct to be like,

13:19.840 --> 13:21.160
what is it in Borat?

13:21.160 --> 13:26.160
Like my neighbor gets a toaster, I get a bigger toaster.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.200
Yeah, that mindset to,

13:28.200 --> 13:31.320
it's not that I'm not competitive in certain domains,

13:31.320 --> 13:33.800
but yeah, I get great pleasure

13:33.800 --> 13:37.200
from sharing things that I find.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.980
And I think that at the end of the day,

13:40.980 --> 13:43.680
you're as strong as your community

13:43.680 --> 13:45.960
and you can build a wonderful community

13:45.960 --> 13:48.800
just by pointing out things that you love.

13:48.800 --> 13:49.880
Like these are all just loves.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.600
I see a paper and I love it.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.120
Only rarely do I think, oh, I wish we had done that.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.320
I usually think fantastic.

13:55.320 --> 13:56.720
Now I can just focus on something else

13:56.720 --> 13:58.420
because they checked off that box.

13:59.320 --> 14:02.000
And by the way, you mentioned PubMed and Barbecue.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.200
I should mention that I got a chance to hang out

14:04.200 --> 14:06.160
with Rick Rubin, thanks to you.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.960
He's a friend of yours and you made the connection.

14:07.960 --> 14:11.180
That was a huge gift to my spirit, I guess.

14:11.180 --> 14:13.200
He's a truly, truly special human being.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.600
And there's a lot I could say

14:15.600 --> 14:17.480
about why he's a special human being.

14:17.480 --> 14:19.680
I'd love to learn how you met him.

14:19.680 --> 14:22.400
But I should also just mention on the PubMed thing,

14:23.560 --> 14:25.960
it was so interesting talking to him about music

14:27.360 --> 14:31.040
and both on the podcast and privately

14:31.040 --> 14:32.800
and just listening to music together.

14:32.800 --> 14:36.080
Because when you mention a song,

14:36.080 --> 14:40.000
he does this thing where he like closes his eyes

14:40.000 --> 14:42.480
and he finds that song in the album

14:42.480 --> 14:44.160
that we're talking about.

14:44.160 --> 14:46.200
And he steps through the album.

14:46.200 --> 14:49.520
You could see the brain stepping through individual songs

14:49.520 --> 14:51.240
to find that song in the album.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.080
And there's that kind of lookup process.

14:53.080 --> 14:56.440
And then he puts himself mentally in that space of like,

14:56.440 --> 14:59.840
okay, this is whatever the album is.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.560
And not just the ones he produced,

15:01.560 --> 15:04.980
but he's an encyclopedia of music.

15:04.980 --> 15:06.520
And it's so interesting.

15:06.520 --> 15:10.160
It also, the thing I really love about him

15:10.160 --> 15:13.560
is something like a calmness that radiates from him.

15:13.560 --> 15:16.720
It's okay to close your eyes and place yourself

15:16.720 --> 15:19.720
in the place where that album was recorded,

15:20.580 --> 15:22.880
in the feeling of that album,

15:22.880 --> 15:25.360
and like that silence, let's go there.

15:25.360 --> 15:26.680
Let's go there together.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.720
It's like Alice in Wonderland and we'll go there together.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.200
You do a good Rick Rubin, minus the beard.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.040
Minus the beard.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.760
His beard is epic, right?

15:33.760 --> 15:35.960
You can't fake a beard like that.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.280
How'd you guys meet?

15:37.280 --> 15:39.560
Yeah, well, Rick, I'm very blessed

15:39.560 --> 15:43.000
to consider a close friend.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.600
Rick and I got introduced

15:44.600 --> 15:47.320
through a common friend during the pandemic.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.680
And we started doing some FaceTime together

15:49.680 --> 15:52.000
and just talking about things related to science and health.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.840
And I'm not a musician.

15:53.840 --> 15:56.020
I have no musical ability or talent.

15:56.020 --> 15:58.200
I have a good ability to memorize lyrics

15:58.200 --> 16:00.280
and I love lyrics and I love poetry.

16:00.280 --> 16:02.740
So I asked him a lot of questions about musicians

16:02.740 --> 16:05.420
that I happen to love that he's worked with and knows.

16:05.420 --> 16:07.840
And so he would give me stories about musicians

16:07.840 --> 16:10.140
and I would talk to him about health.

16:10.140 --> 16:12.040
And then eventually we formed a friendship

16:12.040 --> 16:13.360
where we would talk about any number

16:13.360 --> 16:15.600
of different topics in life.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.720
And then we started spending time together in person

16:18.720 --> 16:21.120
when he was in town or nearby.

16:21.120 --> 16:25.320
And as you now know, Rick,

16:26.380 --> 16:28.560
in addition to all his incredible accomplishments,

16:28.560 --> 16:31.280
has an incredible understanding

16:31.280 --> 16:36.280
of how to get the brain and body into state, right?

16:36.680 --> 16:38.080
And as you pointed out,

16:38.080 --> 16:41.520
he's willing to do the things that allow him

16:41.520 --> 16:45.120
to help these incredible artists get into the best state

16:45.120 --> 16:46.960
to do their craft.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.660
And so if he needs to sit there and be quiet

16:49.660 --> 16:52.760
with his eyes closed for a minute or two or more,

16:53.600 --> 16:54.880
he'll do that.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.920
He has routines to allow himself to get into state.

16:57.920 --> 17:01.180
And it's really inspired me to think about states of mind

17:01.180 --> 17:03.840
as something that we'd all love to just flip the switch

17:03.840 --> 17:05.640
and say, we're focused or we're creative,

17:05.640 --> 17:09.960
but to actually ratchet through the challenging steps

17:09.960 --> 17:12.720
in order to do that and to figure out what one needs to do

17:12.720 --> 17:16.400
on a regular basis to get into a proper state.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.040
It's not just gonna come from a cup of coffee,

17:20.520 --> 17:22.640
a lamp of a particular wavelength or something.

17:22.640 --> 17:23.620
It's gonna be those things,

17:23.620 --> 17:26.680
but it's also going to be really teaching oneself

17:26.680 --> 17:28.480
how to get into proper state.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.120
Yeah, you did an episode on hypnosis.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.600
Do you think it's a kind of self-hypnosis?

17:32.600 --> 17:33.920
Yes, I do.

17:33.920 --> 17:38.160
Because hypnosis is a, you limit the context,

17:38.160 --> 17:41.400
you're very alert and you're very calm.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.360
And he has a number of these different practices

17:44.360 --> 17:45.640
and so we would talk about those.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.460
And then we also have enjoyed a lot of discussions

17:48.460 --> 17:50.200
about deep neuroscience.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.760
In fact, I introduced Rick to a friend of mine

17:52.760 --> 17:54.900
who's a neurosurgeon and neuroscientist

17:54.900 --> 17:56.560
and they've become friendly.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.520
Rick is one of these people

17:57.520 --> 18:00.680
that he sort of defies definition, incredibly kind,

18:00.680 --> 18:02.160
incredibly private person too.

18:02.720 --> 18:04.120
I'm being respectful of that.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.520
And then of course, he's a fan of your podcast.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.040
And so when I learned that,

18:09.040 --> 18:11.900
I just made natural sense to introduce you.

18:11.900 --> 18:13.780
And I know he really enjoyed meeting you.

18:13.780 --> 18:15.440
And we talk about you a lot.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.600
And of course, in a positive light,

18:17.600 --> 18:21.880
I think his dedication to getting into these states of mind

18:21.880 --> 18:22.920
and his willingness to do that

18:22.920 --> 18:26.400
has completely transformed my routines around life.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.240
Like for instance,

18:27.240 --> 18:29.360
before doing a very long podcast recording,

18:29.360 --> 18:30.200
the solo ones,

18:30.200 --> 18:32.320
which often take me several hours or more,

18:32.320 --> 18:35.340
six hours to record, sometimes more, sometimes less.

18:35.340 --> 18:37.480
I realized that there's a certain brain state

18:37.480 --> 18:38.360
associated with that.

18:38.360 --> 18:40.760
So I have to really limit the kind of interactions

18:40.760 --> 18:42.560
I have for the two hours before.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.720
I actually walk and talk out loud through my neighborhood.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.000
People think I'm crazy,

18:47.000 --> 18:47.960
but I live in a neighborhood

18:47.960 --> 18:50.880
where there are a lot of crazy creatives anyway.

18:50.880 --> 18:51.720
So-

18:51.720 --> 18:52.560
Are you saying you're not crazy?

18:52.560 --> 18:57.560
Well, at least not institutionally defined as crazy yet.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.760
But getting into state of mind

19:00.760 --> 19:02.160
is something that we'd all just imagine

19:02.160 --> 19:03.000
we'd flip the switch,

19:03.000 --> 19:04.080
but Rick really convinced me,

19:04.080 --> 19:06.680
you have to do the work to do the work.

19:06.680 --> 19:09.400
Can you maybe linger on that,

19:09.400 --> 19:10.480
elucidate a little bit more

19:10.480 --> 19:12.880
your process of how you get in that space?

19:12.880 --> 19:14.040
That's really interesting.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.600
As I have to admit,

19:16.600 --> 19:19.240
I do everything last minute before a podcast.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.060
I don't know,

19:21.300 --> 19:24.160
like there's a lot of anxiety because like whatever,

19:24.160 --> 19:25.480
if I have to pack,

19:25.480 --> 19:27.120
if I have to set up stuff,

19:27.120 --> 19:29.040
you were luckily a few minutes,

19:29.040 --> 19:30.520
you showed up a few minutes later.

19:30.520 --> 19:31.880
Which for an academic is right on time.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.280
It's right on time.

19:33.280 --> 19:36.040
But the stress is immense.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.080
And on top of that,

19:38.080 --> 19:41.560
you look at like a situation with Rick Rubin,

19:41.560 --> 19:44.760
is I had to set up microphones in front of him.

19:44.760 --> 19:47.000
And just that stress, the anxiety.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.320
He knows a lot about microphones.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.160
What'd he say, which I really loved.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.000
He's like,

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
how close do you like the microphone to be?

19:56.760 --> 19:59.160
That's a very Rick Rubin kind of thing, right?

19:59.160 --> 20:01.640
That the details really matter.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.640
The details really matter,

20:03.640 --> 20:07.640
right down to your relationship to the microphone, right?

20:07.640 --> 20:09.680
Distance and whether or not it brings out the timbre

20:09.680 --> 20:10.520
in your voice.

20:10.520 --> 20:11.340
But of course this is what he does.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.180
He produces music.

20:12.180 --> 20:14.040
But he also said like,

20:14.040 --> 20:15.880
he is the professional.

20:15.880 --> 20:20.360
He said, how close do you like it to be?

20:20.360 --> 20:22.480
And he said it with the gentleness,

20:22.480 --> 20:24.840
where I had like an existential crisis,

20:25.400 --> 20:26.440
I don't know.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.680
He gave me so much like,

20:29.680 --> 20:32.000
wow, like he made me feel like an artist.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.080
Like that the microphone distance

20:35.080 --> 20:37.360
is a decision you're supposed to make.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.360
Well, I have to say,

20:38.360 --> 20:39.440
and this has actually come up

20:39.440 --> 20:41.480
in some of our conversations about you.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.960
I mean, you are an artist.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.840
And actually Joe Rogan,

20:44.840 --> 20:47.000
once I heard him talking about podcasting

20:47.000 --> 20:49.240
and the fact that he's always trying to get better at it.

20:49.240 --> 20:52.520
And he described podcasting at one moment as an art, right?

20:52.520 --> 20:55.640
And it is, it's a certain medium of communication.

20:55.640 --> 20:59.440
And there's a cadence and a rhythm that when it's working,

20:59.440 --> 21:01.960
it really can facilitate the transfer of information.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.240
When it's not, it doesn't.

21:03.240 --> 21:05.760
I mean, obviously Joe just being himself

21:05.760 --> 21:08.840
has tapped into that cadence that allows,

21:08.840 --> 21:11.880
and it's made so many people excited to hear him talk.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.240
Well, in his case and in general,

21:13.240 --> 21:17.920
I think part of the art is refusing the world

21:17.920 --> 21:21.160
as you get a bigger audience, change who you are.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.680
There's one quote that I've seen out there

21:22.680 --> 21:25.120
where he says, talking about himself,

21:25.120 --> 21:27.600
he says, I'm like the fish that got through the net.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.800
There's no stage version of me, right?

21:29.800 --> 21:34.080
How he is in person is how he is out in the world.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.480
And of course there's nuance to his life, right?

21:36.480 --> 21:40.240
And his different relationships, of course, but it's true.

21:40.240 --> 21:42.600
I mean, we've had the great fortune

21:42.600 --> 21:43.760
of spending time with him

21:43.760 --> 21:46.880
out away from the microphones, so to speak.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.200
Joe is Joe.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.760
So can you speak to that process?

21:50.760 --> 21:52.720
You mentioned the walking and the talking to yourself,

21:52.720 --> 21:53.560
because that's fascinating.

21:53.560 --> 21:57.640
Yeah, I try and do a couple of things.

21:57.640 --> 21:59.120
First of all, when I was a kid,

21:59.120 --> 22:01.400
I had a little bit of a grunting tick.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.240
When I was five or six,

22:03.240 --> 22:06.720
I would feel this buildup of tension in my throat

22:06.720 --> 22:07.720
and I would do this grunting tick.

22:07.720 --> 22:10.320
If I get very tired, I start to do it still.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.840
We actually know that this is related

22:11.840 --> 22:14.160
to these basal ganglia circuits for go, no go.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.200
You've got an accelerator and a brake basically

22:16.200 --> 22:17.560
in your neural circuitry.

22:17.560 --> 22:21.240
And kids with Tourette's and OCD,

22:21.240 --> 22:23.400
the brake doesn't work quite as well.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.680
And so one thing that happens is if I wake up in the morning

22:25.680 --> 22:27.920
and especially if I'm well-rested,

22:27.920 --> 22:29.080
well, if I'm not well-rested,

22:29.080 --> 22:32.280
I do a hypnosis or yoga nidra in order to recover my sleep.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.120
That works really well.

22:33.120 --> 22:36.840
But then once I'm into the process of preparing the podcast,

22:36.840 --> 22:37.960
I've already gone through my notes.

22:37.960 --> 22:39.520
I know what I wanna say more or less

22:39.520 --> 22:40.880
in a kind of general contour.

22:40.880 --> 22:44.520
And then I take a walk and I try to,

22:44.520 --> 22:45.520
so no phone with me.

22:45.520 --> 22:49.200
And I try to assess whether or not my energy

22:49.200 --> 22:52.160
is too high or too low for podcasting.

22:52.160 --> 22:54.200
Because when you podcast, as you know,

22:54.200 --> 22:55.960
you have to punch out a lot of material,

22:55.960 --> 22:57.680
but then there's times when you really need to slow down

22:57.680 --> 22:59.640
and emphasize and articulate.

22:59.640 --> 23:04.200
And so what I do, I've never revealed this,

23:04.200 --> 23:08.040
what I do actually is I will recite the lyrics of songs

23:08.040 --> 23:12.520
for about 10 minutes, songs I love, while I walk out loud.

23:12.520 --> 23:13.920
It calms you and focuses you.

23:13.920 --> 23:14.740
What does it do for you?

23:14.740 --> 23:19.740
I think it gets my vocal cords warmed up and it also.

23:19.780 --> 23:21.140
Do you sing or speak them?

23:21.140 --> 23:25.660
I often sing them and fortunately nobody hears.

23:25.660 --> 23:29.340
And as I do this, I start to evaluate whether or not

23:29.340 --> 23:30.940
I'm straining to get the words out

23:30.940 --> 23:34.980
or whether or not I'm straining to make them slow enough

23:34.980 --> 23:37.260
so that I can articulate them.

23:37.260 --> 23:39.860
So there are days when I have so much energy

23:39.860 --> 23:44.500
that I'm trying to speak faster than I should

23:44.500 --> 23:46.100
in order to articulate properly.

23:46.100 --> 23:47.380
There are other days when I'm tired

23:47.380 --> 23:49.500
and I can't sort of keep up with my thoughts.

23:49.500 --> 23:51.500
And so what I try and do is assess that

23:51.500 --> 23:55.260
and then adjust the transmission, the RPM so to speak.

23:55.260 --> 23:56.540
For instance, I can speak very quickly

23:56.540 --> 23:57.860
and then I can slow down.

23:57.860 --> 23:59.680
So I can change the cadence of my voice.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.520
And when you teach in the classroom,

24:01.520 --> 24:02.940
you learn as you know,

24:02.940 --> 24:03.900
because you're an excellent teacher,

24:03.900 --> 24:05.800
I've watched your lectures in the classroom.

24:05.800 --> 24:09.500
As you teach in the classroom, when you want to slow down,

24:09.500 --> 24:11.300
every teacher knows you turn to the whiteboard

24:11.300 --> 24:13.020
or chalkboard and you start writing, right?

24:13.020 --> 24:14.260
It gives you a break.

24:14.260 --> 24:16.220
And then you turn around and you fire back

24:16.220 --> 24:19.020
the kind of machine gun fire of information.

24:19.020 --> 24:20.900
And then you slow down or you underline something.

24:20.900 --> 24:24.600
When you podcast, you don't have that opportunity, right?

24:24.600 --> 24:26.340
There are no visuals in my podcast.

24:26.340 --> 24:31.340
So what I try and do is always get my voice warmed up

24:31.560 --> 24:33.740
and make sure that I'm thinking and speaking

24:33.740 --> 24:36.020
at approximately the same rate.

24:36.020 --> 24:37.580
And then I also do this thing of,

24:37.580 --> 24:40.780
I put my vision into panoramic vision when I walk,

24:40.780 --> 24:42.660
which is very calming.

24:42.660 --> 24:46.060
And then I actually start to remind myself

24:46.060 --> 24:47.540
of the purpose of podcasting.

24:47.540 --> 24:49.460
This sounds very mission statement-y,

24:49.460 --> 24:51.460
but you asked what I do.

24:51.460 --> 24:54.820
I remind myself first and foremost

24:54.820 --> 24:56.160
that what I want to communicate,

24:56.160 --> 24:57.260
what I want to come through

24:57.260 --> 25:00.160
is the beauty and utility of biology.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.980
And I only feel comfortable saying the word beauty

25:02.980 --> 25:06.380
publicly now about science things, thanks to you,

25:06.380 --> 25:07.620
because I think-

25:07.620 --> 25:09.020
Love and beauty.

25:09.020 --> 25:10.060
Yeah, love and-

25:10.060 --> 25:10.880
Love and beauty.

25:10.880 --> 25:11.860
Dr. Andrew Huberman.

25:11.860 --> 25:14.780
Love and beauty, but also darkness and hatred.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.180
And if you're talking about the Lex Fridman podcast,

25:17.180 --> 25:18.020
you have to adjust,

25:18.020 --> 25:21.100
you have to address the shadow also, the shadow side.

25:21.100 --> 25:22.360
But I think about the,

25:22.360 --> 25:26.340
I want to communicate the beauty and utility of biology.

25:26.340 --> 25:29.940
And then I check my emotional state.

25:29.940 --> 25:32.780
I want to make sure that I'm not angry about anything.

25:33.840 --> 25:34.740
And certainly if I am,

25:34.740 --> 25:36.300
that I'm going to set it aside for the podcast,

25:36.300 --> 25:38.620
because that's not a place for my,

25:38.620 --> 25:40.260
whatever I might be dealing with.

25:40.260 --> 25:43.460
I also really start to feel into the parts of the research

25:43.460 --> 25:45.620
and the papers I found that I really love,

25:45.620 --> 25:50.620
because that's the part of me that I like the most, frankly.

25:52.060 --> 25:54.780
And on the podcast, if there's a paper,

25:54.780 --> 25:56.420
like for instance, we have a paper,

25:56.420 --> 26:01.060
excuse me, a podcast coming out soon about heat as a tool,

26:01.060 --> 26:02.300
sauna, but some other things.

26:02.300 --> 26:03.660
And in researching this,

26:03.660 --> 26:07.460
I learned so much about these heat shock proteins

26:07.580 --> 26:09.940
and the use of sauna in Finland

26:09.940 --> 26:11.100
for increasing growth hormone,

26:11.100 --> 26:12.940
but also for the treatment of mental illness.

26:12.940 --> 26:15.180
And I realized I fell in love with this literature.

26:15.180 --> 26:16.980
It's just a beautiful literature.

26:16.980 --> 26:19.020
These people are true pioneers for doing this work.

26:19.020 --> 26:21.740
Now everyone's in the sauna, but this was 20 years ago.

26:21.740 --> 26:23.820
The way the experiments were done were amazing

26:23.820 --> 26:25.220
with all these Finnish people

26:25.220 --> 26:28.300
with thermocouples up their rectum to measure temperature,

26:28.300 --> 26:30.700
swimming in pools, it's hilarious and great.

26:30.700 --> 26:33.620
And so I start to think about, and I think,

26:33.620 --> 26:36.660
you know, I just start to really access my love of the work.

26:36.660 --> 26:39.180
And then when we finally sit down,

26:39.180 --> 26:42.460
meaning my producer, Rob and I, and record,

26:42.460 --> 26:46.180
I just sort of want to just bask in sharing it.

26:46.180 --> 26:48.740
Just like the little version of me when I was six or seven,

26:48.740 --> 26:51.100
I used to spend all weekend reading the encyclopedia,

26:51.100 --> 26:53.020
Guinness Book of World Records,

26:53.020 --> 26:55.980
making my mother drive me places to introduce me to,

26:55.980 --> 26:57.700
I had this obsession with trapping animals

26:57.700 --> 26:58.900
when I was a kid, meet these people.

26:58.900 --> 27:00.620
And then on Monday I would insist

27:00.620 --> 27:03.660
on giving a lecture in class, just as a little kid.

27:03.660 --> 27:04.700
So that's basically what it is.

27:04.700 --> 27:07.900
I just try and access that childlike energy.

27:07.900 --> 27:09.940
And so I want to be clear.

27:09.940 --> 27:13.100
The goal is always to make the information interesting,

27:13.100 --> 27:15.620
clear, and actionable.

27:15.620 --> 27:18.740
And if it's also surprising, then that's a bonus.

27:18.740 --> 27:19.940
But that's basically the process.

27:19.940 --> 27:24.660
But yeah, I'm singing and talking and getting into state.

27:24.660 --> 27:27.940
And I used to feel very sheepish about sharing any of this.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.780
This is the first time I've ever shared it out loud.

27:29.780 --> 27:31.980
But Rick was the one who encouraged me

27:31.980 --> 27:34.620
to find a process that works.

27:35.460 --> 27:36.860
And continue to develop that process

27:36.860 --> 27:39.580
and not let anything get near that process.

27:39.580 --> 27:41.660
People in my personal life know this.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.980
And when it's time, it's like,

27:42.980 --> 27:44.940
I don't care what else is going on,

27:44.940 --> 27:47.220
I'm moving into that brain state.

27:47.220 --> 27:48.620
And there's probably a process like that

27:48.620 --> 27:51.860
for anything that you do in life that you take seriously.

27:51.860 --> 27:55.100
So the people that have perfected this is athletes.

27:55.100 --> 27:56.580
Like if Olympic level athletes,

27:56.580 --> 27:58.340
they have to have a process like this.

27:58.340 --> 28:00.580
You know, and I think Tiger Woods actually was,

28:00.580 --> 28:02.340
taught self-hypnosis quite young.

28:03.020 --> 28:07.780
And used self-hypnosis often during his tournaments.

28:07.780 --> 28:11.420
Sometimes to great success and other times less so.

28:11.420 --> 28:15.220
Is there other places in life that you use

28:16.340 --> 28:20.460
kind of a protocol, like a mental protocol to get ready?

28:20.460 --> 28:22.460
Many of the best areas of life

28:22.460 --> 28:25.180
are their own form of hypnosis, right?

28:25.180 --> 28:26.020
True.

28:26.020 --> 28:27.700
You know that you're in hypnosis if, for instance,

28:27.700 --> 28:29.220
you're in a movie and something happens

28:29.220 --> 28:30.580
and you feel the emotional lift

28:31.220 --> 28:33.180
without being self-conscious about it.

28:34.980 --> 28:38.420
Yes, I think that one thing that we've tried to do

28:38.420 --> 28:42.820
in our house is around meal times to try and set a state.

28:42.820 --> 28:44.020
That food isn't just something

28:44.020 --> 28:46.460
that we just throw down on our throats.

28:46.460 --> 28:47.980
And I'm fortunate that, you know,

28:47.980 --> 28:49.300
my partner cooks really well.

28:49.300 --> 28:52.420
And so I try and give her the space to do that.

28:52.420 --> 28:55.420
And that's a whole thing of her getting into state.

28:55.420 --> 28:56.260
And then-

28:56.260 --> 28:57.080
For the cooking.

28:57.080 --> 28:57.920
For the cooking.

28:57.920 --> 28:58.740
The preparation of all the-

28:58.740 --> 28:59.580
I can just see it.

28:59.580 --> 29:01.260
I can see the way she approaches the whole thing

29:01.260 --> 29:03.020
and the pleasure in serving it.

29:03.020 --> 29:04.780
And I'm an eater, not a cooker.

29:05.820 --> 29:06.660
But-

29:06.660 --> 29:08.020
Both are important roles.

29:08.020 --> 29:09.580
You could be a very good eater.

29:09.580 --> 29:11.220
Like, there's something about,

29:11.220 --> 29:14.820
is there anything better in this world than that feeling,

29:14.820 --> 29:18.580
especially if it's a family, getting around a table,

29:18.580 --> 29:20.540
just the warmth of that?

29:20.540 --> 29:25.100
I don't know, it's like the cold outside

29:25.100 --> 29:27.940
of the cruel world cannot touch you

29:27.940 --> 29:29.860
in this place that you've returned to.

29:29.860 --> 29:32.500
And if, I mean-

29:32.500 --> 29:34.680
Did you grow up eating meals as a family?

29:34.680 --> 29:35.520
Yeah, yeah.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.360
I mean-

29:36.360 --> 29:37.920
You didn't sit down, no television?

29:37.920 --> 29:40.580
No, well, I didn't really have television period

29:42.300 --> 29:43.380
outside of meals.

29:44.420 --> 29:48.300
So most of my time was spent, you know,

29:48.300 --> 29:51.240
like a stray cat outdoors,

29:51.240 --> 29:53.900
just running around, playing soccer.

29:53.900 --> 29:56.980
I imagine you in this like dirt or concrete lot

29:56.980 --> 30:00.260
between two very high rise buildings playing soccer

30:00.260 --> 30:04.500
in like athletic gear that you only see in Eastern Europe.

30:04.500 --> 30:05.820
You know how like you come to the States

30:05.820 --> 30:07.220
and people wear their athletic gear,

30:07.220 --> 30:09.300
you go to Europe and you see,

30:09.300 --> 30:10.900
maybe it's the soccer culture,

30:10.900 --> 30:12.260
but you see athletic gear

30:12.260 --> 30:14.140
that you just don't see anywhere else.

30:14.140 --> 30:14.980
That's interesting.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.980
I mean, I grew up pretty poor.

30:16.980 --> 30:20.780
So first of all, I was always wearing my brother's,

30:20.780 --> 30:23.580
who's an older brother, brother's clothes.

30:23.580 --> 30:26.240
And they were like old,

30:28.020 --> 30:30.540
like my favorite things were American things

30:30.540 --> 30:31.980
that I didn't understand.

30:31.980 --> 30:34.260
It would be like a Pepsi shirt or something.

30:34.260 --> 30:36.560
And it was just, that was the gear.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.040
And it was like too large for me,

30:38.040 --> 30:40.220
but I thought I was the coolest person ever

30:40.220 --> 30:44.820
just wearing this fancy like Kanye like type of fashion.

30:44.820 --> 30:45.660
Yeah, there's something about it,

30:45.660 --> 30:47.700
I feel like in Eastern Europe,

30:47.700 --> 30:50.100
they wear athletic gear where like the guys like zip up-

30:50.100 --> 30:52.100
Yeah, no, that's like fancy stuff.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.500
That's if you like, those are the cool kids.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.020
I see, I see.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.700
Like the cool soccer players, football players

30:58.700 --> 31:02.440
that like they were in a league of some kind.

31:02.440 --> 31:04.760
So they would get uniforms or like,

31:04.760 --> 31:08.220
or they somehow, I always thought anyone

31:08.220 --> 31:11.860
who had anything nice had to do something

31:11.860 --> 31:13.100
really bad to get it.

31:13.100 --> 31:15.720
That was my way, view of the world.

31:15.720 --> 31:20.420
Because like, I guess I didn't understand

31:20.420 --> 31:22.420
how it's possible to be rich.

31:22.420 --> 31:25.300
Because most of us were surrounded by people who are poor

31:25.300 --> 31:26.820
and that life was beautiful and simple.

31:26.820 --> 31:28.860
And it's like, why do you escape that life?

31:28.860 --> 31:31.020
But you still admire the cool,

31:31.020 --> 31:34.820
like when we got McDonald's, it was like,

31:35.700 --> 31:40.020
what kind of world does this place come from?

31:40.020 --> 31:42.640
Like who invented this?

31:42.640 --> 31:45.540
This is a fascinating view from a child's perspective

31:45.540 --> 31:47.740
of like, of capitalism essentially.

31:47.740 --> 31:49.940
Yeah, but the fact that you ate dinner together

31:49.940 --> 31:51.420
is really interesting.

31:51.420 --> 31:53.580
My parents divorced when I was an adolescent.

31:53.580 --> 31:56.620
So then there was a total fracture of any family structure.

31:56.620 --> 31:58.900
But prior to that, we ate dinner together every night.

31:58.900 --> 32:00.920
I was expected to know how to use my knife and fork.

32:00.920 --> 32:05.920
And you know, it was like a very structured thing.

32:05.980 --> 32:07.620
I don't know if kids do that now.

32:08.700 --> 32:11.220
You know, if I ever have kids, they're gonna do that.

32:11.220 --> 32:13.700
And certainly, actually on the way over here,

32:13.700 --> 32:16.760
I was thinking, you know, I really want a lot of kids.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.380
I want like a whole litter.

32:18.380 --> 32:21.300
And I was thinking, if Lex has kids and I have kids,

32:21.300 --> 32:22.800
then like, then we can,

32:22.800 --> 32:25.260
we can like pit them against each other with Jiu-Jitsu.

32:25.260 --> 32:26.860
This is my chance at redemption.

32:26.860 --> 32:30.460
You know, like soccer, right?

32:30.460 --> 32:33.140
They'll all want to be engineers or physicists.

32:33.140 --> 32:37.220
They won't want to be biologists, but in all seriousness,

32:37.220 --> 32:41.380
I look forward to the day that our kids play together.

32:41.380 --> 32:43.500
Yeah, I think there's something,

32:43.500 --> 32:47.220
so the family dinner, the ritual of the family dinner,

32:47.260 --> 32:49.220
but also the special occasion dinners,

32:49.220 --> 32:51.980
like where there's a little bit more preparation,

32:51.980 --> 32:53.820
a little bit more cooking,

32:53.820 --> 32:57.060
whether it's on the weekend or for some holiday.

32:57.060 --> 33:00.020
In Russia, it was a thing that actually I find

33:00.020 --> 33:02.860
completely missing for the most part.

33:02.860 --> 33:04.860
In America is there was neighbors.

33:04.860 --> 33:09.540
There was a, you broke the walls between families

33:09.540 --> 33:11.140
much more commonly.

33:11.140 --> 33:13.860
Like there would be kind of regular characters,

33:13.860 --> 33:14.940
like a sitcom almost.

33:14.940 --> 33:16.380
You know, if you watch the sitcom,

33:16.420 --> 33:17.660
it's never just the family.

33:17.660 --> 33:19.300
There's always like other characters that-

33:19.300 --> 33:20.220
Just bursting in the door.

33:20.220 --> 33:21.140
Bursting in the door.

33:21.140 --> 33:22.220
I'm gonna start doing that here,

33:22.220 --> 33:23.620
just to make you feel at home.

33:23.620 --> 33:24.780
I'll just start showing up in your studio.

33:24.780 --> 33:25.700
I know where you live.

33:25.700 --> 33:28.540
I think people want to respect like, you know,

33:28.540 --> 33:30.820
Michael Malice lives next door to me.

33:30.820 --> 33:33.860
And I think people want to respect each other's privacy

33:33.860 --> 33:34.700
or something like that.

33:34.700 --> 33:39.500
And I think we all get super busy and, you know,

33:39.500 --> 33:44.500
like it's kind of work to do this dinner together

33:44.940 --> 33:47.060
or, you know, if you see it as a thing

33:47.060 --> 33:49.060
that needs to be scheduled, it's work.

33:49.060 --> 33:49.900
We get busy.

33:49.900 --> 33:50.740
There's a lot of stuff going on.

33:50.740 --> 33:54.100
But if it's part of a ritual, a part of the culture,

33:54.100 --> 33:57.020
all of those walls get broken down.

33:57.020 --> 34:00.140
And then you realize like that's like later looking back,

34:00.140 --> 34:01.700
those are the things you miss.

34:01.700 --> 34:03.580
Like that's what life is about.

34:03.580 --> 34:05.060
Like all the stupid stuff you're doing

34:05.060 --> 34:07.900
in terms of career or whatever, all the busy things,

34:07.900 --> 34:08.740
those don't matter.

34:08.740 --> 34:10.580
What matters is the people.

34:10.580 --> 34:12.820
Yeah, in academia, you know,

34:13.220 --> 34:15.740
this changed in the last few years, of course,

34:15.740 --> 34:19.540
but one of the great joys was professors will stop by

34:19.540 --> 34:20.380
your office or your lab.

34:20.380 --> 34:22.300
Nobody set up an appointment.

34:22.300 --> 34:24.140
There was a guy when I was a professor in San Diego,

34:24.140 --> 34:24.980
a guy named Harvey Cartney,

34:24.980 --> 34:26.340
he's a member of the National Academy,

34:26.340 --> 34:29.980
the truly the world's expert in the evolution of vision

34:29.980 --> 34:32.300
and evolution of brains generally.

34:32.300 --> 34:33.980
And he would show up in my lab

34:33.980 --> 34:35.380
and he would just start talking to the students

34:35.380 --> 34:40.380
in post-docs and I mean, in a pure encyclopedia.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.860
And then at some point you'd say,

34:43.860 --> 34:45.140
hey, Harvey, I gotta go.

34:45.140 --> 34:46.700
And you'd kick him out, right?

34:46.700 --> 34:49.620
Or this guy, he's a physicist, David Kleinfeldt,

34:49.620 --> 34:50.980
who's same way.

34:50.980 --> 34:52.700
Actually, David Kleinfeldt is an interesting one.

34:52.700 --> 34:55.820
He, a student of his went on to create

34:55.820 --> 34:57.460
the Beavis and Butthead cartoon.

34:57.460 --> 34:59.380
And one of them is David, he's a physics professor.

34:59.380 --> 35:01.020
Now people can look him up.

35:01.020 --> 35:02.860
And David's one of those guys who's walking

35:02.860 --> 35:03.900
into your office and you just sit down

35:03.900 --> 35:05.420
and you just start talking to you.

35:05.420 --> 35:07.340
And so there's a kind of a family feel.

35:07.340 --> 35:09.820
It's like Cheers or Seinfeld or one of those shows

35:09.820 --> 35:10.900
where somebody just walks in.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.700
And yeah, I think you and I both share a love

35:13.700 --> 35:14.980
of the community around things.

35:14.980 --> 35:17.740
And podcasting is a little bit more isolated.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.620
I should say for the guest episodes,

35:19.620 --> 35:21.340
the preparation is completely different

35:21.340 --> 35:22.980
because it's more conversational.

35:22.980 --> 35:24.580
And so there I don't do any of this business

35:24.580 --> 35:26.300
of putting myself into state.

35:26.300 --> 35:30.060
I just try and make sure that the guest is taking care of.

35:30.060 --> 35:32.940
And I do list out the questions I'm gonna ask before,

35:32.940 --> 35:35.460
but those actually really like the interview episodes

35:35.460 --> 35:37.940
far more than I like doing the solo ones.

35:37.940 --> 35:39.180
Just psychologically, I mean.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.540
I just like learning from someone directly

35:41.540 --> 35:44.100
because you asking an expert about something.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.700
Like sitting here with you when we recorded the podcast

35:46.700 --> 35:48.580
where you were a guest on the Huberman Lab podcast.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.500
And for the first time, and finally,

35:51.500 --> 35:53.220
someone was explaining to me the difference

35:53.220 --> 35:55.180
between machine learning, artificial intelligence

35:55.180 --> 35:56.460
and all these other things.

35:56.460 --> 35:58.060
You know, and I've finally forgiven you

35:58.060 --> 36:02.420
for making me cry about Costello on camera

36:02.420 --> 36:03.580
because it helped me move through it.

36:03.580 --> 36:06.180
But in all seriousness, the interview ones

36:06.180 --> 36:08.580
are a sheer pleasure.

36:08.620 --> 36:12.620
The solo ones I really enjoy, but their work,

36:12.620 --> 36:14.140
sometimes I think like I'm gonna sweat

36:14.140 --> 36:16.140
a little blood prepping for them.

36:16.140 --> 36:18.500
Well, it's interesting because I do think prepping

36:18.500 --> 36:21.220
for interviews, having a similar process

36:21.220 --> 36:23.020
might be also very valuable.

36:23.020 --> 36:26.300
Like I have to think about that

36:26.300 --> 36:31.220
because I think when you do a conversation

36:31.220 --> 36:35.060
for several hours, especially when it's a high stakes one,

36:35.060 --> 36:36.780
so it's not like you and I know,

36:36.780 --> 36:38.580
it's more like it's just chatting and so on.

36:38.580 --> 36:40.740
World order isn't gonna shift according to it.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.380
Although you never know.

36:42.380 --> 36:44.020
Knowing you will probably be into some pretty

36:44.020 --> 36:45.980
controversial topics in a few minutes.

36:45.980 --> 36:48.100
You like to ride the edge more than I do.

36:48.100 --> 36:50.380
There are a number of topics that I just completely avoid.

36:50.380 --> 36:52.580
And my response to those is always that

36:52.580 --> 36:54.100
I have a lot of opinions about that,

36:54.100 --> 36:55.780
but not a lot to say, you know.

36:55.780 --> 37:00.780
But whereas you've become far braver

37:00.780 --> 37:02.820
in terms of the topics you'll encounter

37:02.820 --> 37:06.060
and some of your guests have been a bit controversial.

37:06.300 --> 37:11.140
Some of them are people that a lot of people don't like.

37:11.140 --> 37:13.820
And you've been willing to just sit down

37:13.820 --> 37:16.300
and maybe it's the jujitsu thing.

37:16.300 --> 37:17.140
I don't know.

37:17.140 --> 37:18.140
It is tricky.

37:18.140 --> 37:20.900
One of my goals for this year is to talk to people

37:20.900 --> 37:24.580
that a lot of people really don't like.

37:24.580 --> 37:26.260
Are you gonna share with us?

37:26.260 --> 37:27.260
And here I am.

37:29.260 --> 37:34.260
People that are in prison, major political leaders

37:34.300 --> 37:37.020
have been thinking a lot about how to talk

37:37.020 --> 37:41.340
to really difficult, controversial figures,

37:41.340 --> 37:45.220
but find together something with them

37:45.220 --> 37:47.700
that's deeply honest about their nature,

37:47.700 --> 37:52.700
about the ideas they have about the world.

37:54.300 --> 37:56.620
Reveal something real.

37:56.620 --> 37:59.500
And some people, you have to be very careful.

37:59.500 --> 38:03.620
Some people are very good at hiding the real inside them.

38:03.620 --> 38:05.260
Even from themselves.

38:05.260 --> 38:06.660
That's something I think about a lot.

38:06.660 --> 38:08.340
I think about dictators of the past

38:08.340 --> 38:09.980
and I put myself in the mindset,

38:09.980 --> 38:12.740
well, how do you reveal something real

38:12.740 --> 38:14.740
about this person to themselves?

38:14.740 --> 38:17.700
I think that to me, and you kind of spoke to that,

38:17.700 --> 38:22.700
but a great conversation is one

38:23.060 --> 38:27.420
where both of you discover something new.

38:27.420 --> 38:31.300
Like it's not just, so I love that too.

38:31.300 --> 38:32.860
That's my favorite thing that you mentioned,

38:32.860 --> 38:34.540
which is allowing your curiosity

38:34.540 --> 38:35.740
and you ask all kinds of questions

38:35.740 --> 38:38.180
and get excited and to learn from an expert,

38:38.180 --> 38:42.500
but also to push them to discover something about themselves,

38:42.500 --> 38:45.180
about their ideas together.

38:45.180 --> 38:49.640
And then that discovery, and sometimes it's like,

38:50.700 --> 38:55.460
we don't see it in the moment, but the audience hears it.

38:55.460 --> 38:58.100
It's weird to say, like, I would compare it

38:58.100 --> 38:59.100
to when you're a musician,

38:59.100 --> 39:00.820
you're playing with other musicians,

39:00.820 --> 39:02.060
you lose yourself in the moment.

39:02.060 --> 39:04.340
Yeah, it's all, it's like, it's working right.

39:04.340 --> 39:09.340
It's working, but you don't really see the big picture

39:09.780 --> 39:13.780
impact of what it's working right actually feels like.

39:13.780 --> 39:17.420
And that's where the audience can see that.

39:17.420 --> 39:19.380
Like if you talk to somebody evil,

39:22.980 --> 39:24.900
for me as an interviewer,

39:24.900 --> 39:27.660
I have to empathize with that person.

39:27.660 --> 39:29.180
If I want to understand,

39:29.180 --> 39:30.800
I have to put myself in that mind space

39:30.840 --> 39:32.960
and to put yourself in that mindset,

39:32.960 --> 39:34.400
you really have to become that,

39:34.400 --> 39:37.680
you have to understand the evil inside of you.

39:38.600 --> 39:41.400
Like you can't just think if somebody is in power

39:41.400 --> 39:45.280
and has used that power to abuse others,

39:45.280 --> 39:48.240
you can't just be, I personally,

39:48.240 --> 39:50.080
a person who seeks to understand,

39:50.080 --> 39:53.040
you can't just be a journalist asking generic questions.

39:53.040 --> 39:55.920
You have to put yourself in a place

39:55.920 --> 39:58.560
where you're somebody who's given a lot of power

39:58.560 --> 40:01.360
and slowly you start to abuse that power.

40:01.360 --> 40:03.400
And what does that person become?

40:03.400 --> 40:04.600
Who are you?

40:04.600 --> 40:07.280
I have to plug myself into those moments in my life

40:07.280 --> 40:09.760
in the past where I've been angry at something

40:11.080 --> 40:14.680
and where I've been cruel because I was angry

40:14.680 --> 40:17.640
in little ways, but then you magnify them at scale

40:17.640 --> 40:21.080
and I have to go there and that's very human.

40:21.080 --> 40:23.080
And then I have to look at another person

40:23.080 --> 40:25.280
from across the table for me and understand,

40:25.280 --> 40:26.880
well, you're there too.

40:26.920 --> 40:31.440
And then you had more opportunity to do truly cruel things.

40:31.440 --> 40:36.440
And then where I have to plug myself into places

40:37.240 --> 40:39.720
where I've been, I can imagine I can go

40:39.720 --> 40:43.360
where I was cruel to others and was unaware of it.

40:43.360 --> 40:45.800
So I was in a mind space where I was thinking

40:45.800 --> 40:48.320
that I'm doing good and I was doing not good.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.400
Again, I've never gotten an opportunity

40:50.400 --> 40:52.600
to do any of those things at a large scale,

40:52.600 --> 40:54.960
but all of us have done it at a small scale.

40:54.960 --> 40:58.840
And I plug myself into that and then we're here.

40:58.840 --> 41:01.560
We're too, if it's somebody who's in prison,

41:01.560 --> 41:03.480
if it's somebody who's a dictator,

41:03.480 --> 41:07.120
we're in that space where evil is,

41:07.120 --> 41:09.640
all of us have the capacity to do that evil

41:09.640 --> 41:13.520
and I have to imagine myself being able to do that evil.

41:13.520 --> 41:17.960
And then we're here together in that dark, dark place.

41:17.960 --> 41:20.040
And then if it's just right,

41:20.040 --> 41:21.840
something real can actually come.

41:21.840 --> 41:24.000
Something from that person's childhood,

41:24.080 --> 41:27.680
maybe awakening to a realization

41:27.680 --> 41:30.840
that I thought it was a good person and I'm not.

41:30.840 --> 41:34.920
And that only happens when you truly empathize.

41:34.920 --> 41:37.000
Those moments of discovery are beautiful,

41:37.000 --> 41:38.760
but they also happen in science.

41:38.760 --> 41:42.400
When you just have a conversation and you realize,

41:42.400 --> 41:44.040
I feel like talking to Stephen Wolfram,

41:44.040 --> 41:46.120
I feel like we constantly realize

41:46.120 --> 41:48.080
beautiful things together.

41:48.080 --> 41:52.280
On this element of evil and sociopathy

41:52.600 --> 41:57.600
Jung had this notion that we have all things inside us

41:57.760 --> 41:59.560
and that we all have the capacity

41:59.560 --> 42:01.480
to be good or evil, et cetera.

42:02.760 --> 42:06.160
But I have the good fortune of working with somebody

42:06.160 --> 42:08.680
who has deep understanding of psychiatry,

42:08.680 --> 42:11.720
but also psychoanalysis and Jungian theory.

42:11.720 --> 42:15.040
And he said to me recently, he said,

42:15.040 --> 42:17.960
whether or not all people have all things inside them

42:17.960 --> 42:20.400
is still debated in the psychology community

42:20.400 --> 42:22.000
and in the neuroscience community

42:22.840 --> 42:24.400
and as a matter of philosophy.

42:24.400 --> 42:28.240
But there are certain people, not many,

42:28.240 --> 42:29.960
but there are certain people

42:29.960 --> 42:33.280
for whom they've actually lived out many versions

42:33.280 --> 42:37.040
of their possible selves in the first person.

42:37.040 --> 42:38.760
And so those are unique individuals.

42:38.760 --> 42:41.240
And even if they tapped into these things,

42:41.240 --> 42:44.400
as you mentioned, at a more minor level,

42:44.400 --> 42:48.960
as opposed to impacting people negatively at scale.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.960
So being able to access those different parts

42:50.960 --> 42:52.280
of oneself is key.

42:52.280 --> 42:54.080
And you've been willing to step into that.

42:54.080 --> 42:57.440
My podcast is not one in which we get down to those matters.

42:57.440 --> 42:59.080
Yet, yet.

42:59.080 --> 43:00.520
You never know, we might do an episode

43:00.520 --> 43:02.800
on narcissism and sociopathy.

43:02.800 --> 43:04.920
The other thing that I took away from a conversation

43:04.920 --> 43:08.440
with a friend who did a lot of years in special operations

43:08.440 --> 43:10.840
in the intelligence community, he said,

43:10.840 --> 43:14.600
if you look at somebody's past, at some point,

43:14.600 --> 43:17.360
you will come to understand some pretty good reasons

43:17.360 --> 43:19.520
as to why they became who they are.

43:19.520 --> 43:21.720
But you have to draw the, his words,

43:21.720 --> 43:23.320
the red line someplace.

43:23.320 --> 43:25.040
And what he was referring to was the fact

43:25.040 --> 43:26.920
that certain people, at least in the eyes

43:26.920 --> 43:30.240
of certain communities, deserve to be eliminated

43:30.240 --> 43:33.200
as a consequence of their actions, right?

43:33.200 --> 43:35.160
Regardless of what drove them to those actions.

43:35.160 --> 43:36.800
So it gets right down to the line

43:36.800 --> 43:40.800
between nature, nurture, neuroscience,

43:40.800 --> 43:43.880
and the law and justice.

43:43.880 --> 43:45.720
Complicated, complicated themes.

43:45.720 --> 43:47.040
I can think of a number of people

43:47.040 --> 43:49.240
that I would love to hear you interview.

43:49.240 --> 43:51.920
And here I'm not revealing the reasons why,

43:51.920 --> 43:53.520
but except for the fact that I think

43:53.520 --> 43:56.040
you would be uniquely suited to bring out

43:56.040 --> 43:58.480
the important components of the conversation

43:58.480 --> 44:02.600
that other people have not been able to do,

44:02.600 --> 44:04.840
which, for instance, Liz Holmes.

44:04.840 --> 44:08.520
This is one of the most mysterious

44:08.520 --> 44:11.520
and yet disliked people on the planet.

44:12.360 --> 44:15.640
She's sort of synonymous with deception.

44:17.320 --> 44:20.240
I don't know if there have been any real interviews

44:20.240 --> 44:22.960
of her since the whole thing.

44:22.960 --> 44:23.920
I haven't followed that case.

44:23.920 --> 44:27.280
I listened to the book and I followed it a little bit

44:27.280 --> 44:29.440
because it was happening in my hometown, right?

44:29.440 --> 44:31.000
Theranos was right up the road.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.320
The building's still there.

44:32.320 --> 44:33.720
It's interesting, it's some of the most

44:33.720 --> 44:35.800
premier real estate in Silicon Valley,

44:35.800 --> 44:36.960
but nobody wants it.

44:36.960 --> 44:38.520
It's sort of like, it's very hard to sell a home

44:38.520 --> 44:40.120
where somebody committed suicide

44:40.120 --> 44:42.600
or committed a murder, even if it's a beautiful home.

44:42.600 --> 44:44.000
It's sort of feel like the Theranos building

44:44.000 --> 44:44.840
is that building.

44:46.080 --> 44:48.560
So that would be a really interesting interview.

44:48.560 --> 44:50.600
I would love to hear that interview.

44:50.600 --> 44:55.600
One of the most interesting dark human beings in science.

44:55.800 --> 44:58.640
Yeah, and then there'll even be people that say,

44:58.640 --> 44:59.760
was it even science, right?

44:59.760 --> 45:01.160
It might've all been deception.

45:01.160 --> 45:02.400
It might've been one part deception,

45:02.400 --> 45:05.560
one part goal setting mixed in with,

45:05.560 --> 45:08.600
clearly there were so many factors

45:08.600 --> 45:10.760
impacting what happened.

45:10.760 --> 45:15.000
I think the big difference between Theranos and that story

45:15.000 --> 45:17.520
and some of the other stories about Silicon Valley

45:17.520 --> 45:19.920
where people promised a lot more than they could deliver

45:19.920 --> 45:21.720
is they were promising things

45:21.720 --> 45:23.720
that were directly related to health and healthcare.

45:23.720 --> 45:26.960
People were taking blood tests with the understanding

45:26.960 --> 45:29.280
that the data they were getting was important,

45:29.280 --> 45:31.200
information about sexually transmitted diseases

45:31.200 --> 45:33.400
and other diseases and making real world decisions

45:33.400 --> 45:34.480
on the basis of that.

45:34.480 --> 45:37.240
Whereas if you remember when the iPhone first came out

45:37.240 --> 45:38.760
and Steve Jobs was still alive

45:38.760 --> 45:40.600
and the phones were dropping calls

45:40.600 --> 45:41.920
if you held it in a particular way.

45:41.920 --> 45:43.480
And his response was a little flip.

45:43.480 --> 45:45.920
He said, it's, hey folks, it's a phone

45:45.920 --> 45:47.720
as if like, don't get so worked up.

45:47.720 --> 45:50.840
But people held him understandably to a very high standard.

45:50.840 --> 45:54.080
You know, she sort of, it seemed, and I don't know

45:54.080 --> 45:55.360
cause I certainly wasn't there,

45:55.360 --> 45:57.800
seemed like she sort of adopted this idea

45:57.800 --> 45:59.360
that you could get it wrong a bunch of times

45:59.360 --> 46:00.960
before you get it right,

46:00.960 --> 46:02.720
except if the allegations are true.

46:02.720 --> 46:05.760
And I think they, she was found guilty, I believe

46:05.760 --> 46:07.120
on a number of counts.

46:07.960 --> 46:09.440
That a number of the things that they were doing

46:09.440 --> 46:11.880
were impacting real world decision-making.

46:11.880 --> 46:14.560
So Steve's point about the phone, it's just a phone.

46:14.560 --> 46:15.400
Well, it depends on the call.

46:15.400 --> 46:18.440
If you're calling 911, then it's not just a phone, right?

46:19.360 --> 46:21.600
But in the case of blood tests and disease,

46:21.600 --> 46:22.880
you know, that's serious.

46:22.880 --> 46:24.960
I think that the Theranos case was super interesting to me

46:24.960 --> 46:27.600
because of the number of people from major universities

46:27.600 --> 46:31.400
and from government that both trusted her

46:31.400 --> 46:34.360
and the number of people who did not trust her

46:34.360 --> 46:37.320
and yet either didn't speak up or no one listened to them.

46:37.320 --> 46:39.680
It was only in the forensic version of it

46:39.680 --> 46:42.440
that everyone said, oh yeah, I knew that she was lying,

46:42.440 --> 46:44.320
et cetera, et cetera, they were lying.

46:44.320 --> 46:45.320
There were multiple people involved

46:45.320 --> 46:46.680
in those lies apparently.

46:46.680 --> 46:49.120
But I have a deep interest in the neuroscience

46:49.120 --> 46:51.480
of narcissism, sociopathy,

46:51.480 --> 46:54.000
and some of the darker aspects of the mind.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.080
So yeah, maybe someday, maybe we'll do a podcast together.

46:57.080 --> 46:59.840
It can be like in the kind of early 90s version

46:59.840 --> 47:01.360
of talk shows where we darken the lights

47:01.360 --> 47:02.680
and we do it together.

47:02.680 --> 47:03.520
You can use your voice

47:03.520 --> 47:06.880
because your voice is much more sinister sounding than mine.

47:06.880 --> 47:08.760
Good cop, bad cop.

47:08.760 --> 47:11.480
Well, it'd be interesting from a scientific perspective

47:11.480 --> 47:15.800
of somebody who is a sociopath or a psychopath,

47:16.800 --> 47:20.240
how to reveal something real about them.

47:20.240 --> 47:24.520
I think that requires not just,

47:24.520 --> 47:26.560
well, I don't know what that requires.

47:26.560 --> 47:28.520
That requires the same skill that it takes

47:28.520 --> 47:31.640
to be a good therapist.

47:31.640 --> 47:35.160
Right, and some therapists won't work with sociopaths

47:35.160 --> 47:38.440
because they don't feel any progress can be made.

47:38.440 --> 47:40.400
Some therapists will work with sociopaths

47:40.400 --> 47:43.480
because for the wealthy ones, they often,

47:43.480 --> 47:44.880
they want their money.

47:44.880 --> 47:47.360
I think most therapists are good and benevolent,

47:47.360 --> 47:48.320
but there's some that will do it.

47:48.320 --> 47:50.480
Just same way lawyers will work with criminals

47:50.480 --> 47:52.080
knowing they're criminals, right?

47:53.440 --> 47:55.320
Oftentimes because they're criminals.

47:55.320 --> 47:57.000
There are certain domains of psychiatry

47:57.000 --> 47:59.760
that are more tractable than others, right?

47:59.760 --> 48:01.400
Borderlines are interesting, I should just mention

48:01.400 --> 48:03.840
because they have this phenomenon of splitting.

48:03.840 --> 48:05.720
So in the world of psychology,

48:05.720 --> 48:09.960
the idea is that being neurotic is actually the goal.

48:09.960 --> 48:13.360
The idea that you could feel something

48:13.360 --> 48:15.080
and then work a lot to overcome it

48:15.080 --> 48:18.760
or have some sort of defense mechanism in place,

48:18.760 --> 48:20.320
but that's not destructive.

48:20.320 --> 48:23.320
That's actually a pretty healthy state to be in,

48:23.320 --> 48:25.360
provided it's not destructive.

48:25.360 --> 48:29.800
Psychotic is truly delusional thinking about reality.

48:29.800 --> 48:32.000
And the idea is that borderline split,

48:33.120 --> 48:37.320
intermittently split between psychotic and neurotic.

48:37.320 --> 48:38.960
That's why it's called this beautiful work

48:38.960 --> 48:41.000
by Melanie Klein that describes this,

48:41.000 --> 48:42.960
which I'm just now kind of delving into.

48:42.960 --> 48:46.000
But so the borderline is the person who is like,

48:46.000 --> 48:47.520
I love you, I love you, I love you,

48:47.520 --> 48:49.720
and then truly feels as if they hate you

48:49.720 --> 48:51.320
and you become the bad object.

48:52.520 --> 48:54.600
Borderlines are challenging for psychologists

48:54.600 --> 48:56.480
because of the splitting, right?

48:57.520 --> 48:58.760
Schizophrenics are challenging

48:58.760 --> 49:02.920
because of the detachment from reality.

49:02.920 --> 49:05.120
And narcissists are challenging

49:05.120 --> 49:07.640
because they're often so charming

49:07.640 --> 49:10.040
that even the therapists are charmed.

49:10.040 --> 49:12.280
I believe you mentioned Karl Deisseroth.

49:12.280 --> 49:13.120
We'll talk about him.

49:13.120 --> 49:14.440
He was definitely not a narcissist.

49:14.440 --> 49:16.400
He's one of the more humble people, but he is brilliant.

49:16.400 --> 49:18.240
Thanks again to you.

49:18.240 --> 49:19.400
You've connected us.

49:20.360 --> 49:22.840
I had the pleasure of having a conversation with him.

49:22.840 --> 49:23.920
You had a conversation with him.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.680
I really enjoyed it on the podcast.

49:25.680 --> 49:29.720
You guys come from the same science, from the same place,

49:29.720 --> 49:31.480
maybe different journeys, fascinating.

49:31.480 --> 49:32.360
And levels.

49:32.360 --> 49:33.960
We were post-docs together.

49:33.960 --> 49:37.880
Karl is truly the Michael Jordan, the Wayne Gretzky,

49:37.880 --> 49:40.400
five children, amazing marriage,

49:40.400 --> 49:43.000
also an amazing scientist, his wife Michelle Mongees

49:43.000 --> 49:44.920
in our neurology department at Stanford,

49:44.920 --> 49:49.920
incredible thinker, writer, very kind person, humble.

49:51.480 --> 49:52.720
Speaking of getting into state,

49:52.720 --> 49:54.280
sorry, Karl, I'm gonna out you on this,

49:54.280 --> 49:58.320
but Karl, despite being at the highest levels

49:58.320 --> 49:59.800
of science and engineering

49:59.800 --> 50:01.400
and a practicing psychiatrist,

50:02.280 --> 50:06.160
his office is literally a coat closet

50:06.160 --> 50:07.880
with a small table lamp.

50:07.880 --> 50:10.200
When you meet with Karl, if you manage to meet with him,

50:10.200 --> 50:12.960
because he's very hard to get to, you walk in,

50:12.960 --> 50:15.680
you sit down as if you're going through some interrogation

50:15.680 --> 50:20.040
and some spy novel, and he'll ask you,

50:20.040 --> 50:22.040
what are you most excited about lately?

50:22.040 --> 50:23.960
And I've got 11 minutes or something.

50:24.520 --> 50:27.000
And that's a meeting with Karl, because he's that busy.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.120
But he doesn't have the office

50:28.120 --> 50:30.760
with the pictures of the kids and the thing and all that.

50:30.760 --> 50:32.520
All that is kept elsewhere.

50:32.520 --> 50:34.360
So in order to get, I asked him,

50:34.360 --> 50:35.960
why do you work in this office, right?

50:35.960 --> 50:38.040
You work on light and channels of light,

50:38.040 --> 50:39.800
things related to light of all things.

50:39.800 --> 50:40.960
Here you are in this dark room, and he said,

50:40.960 --> 50:43.240
well, this is what gets me into the state of mind

50:43.240 --> 50:44.280
to be able to do what I want to do.

50:44.280 --> 50:48.840
Very Rick Rubin-ish, not at all the same person,

50:48.840 --> 50:50.600
but very similar in that he's figured out

50:50.600 --> 50:52.360
the physical space he needs in order to get

50:52.360 --> 50:54.000
into the optimal state to do the work

50:54.000 --> 50:55.480
that he needs to do in this lifetime.

50:55.480 --> 50:57.480
And it's very unusual, right?

50:57.480 --> 50:59.320
If I don't have a window, I kind of freak out.

50:59.320 --> 51:00.520
I can do it here for a while.

51:00.520 --> 51:02.520
We're in this black cube here,

51:02.520 --> 51:03.960
floating in space, of course.

51:05.400 --> 51:08.880
But I find that amazing that these people

51:08.880 --> 51:10.840
that are operating at this super high level

51:10.840 --> 51:12.560
are willing to actually deprive themselves

51:12.560 --> 51:14.040
of a lot of conditions.

51:14.040 --> 51:16.580
They're not sitting there with the secretary coming in,

51:16.580 --> 51:19.080
offering them espresso every five minutes and things that,

51:19.080 --> 51:21.920
no, no, no, that's New York neuroscience I'm picking.

51:21.920 --> 51:24.000
The New York neuroscience mafia is kind of famous

51:24.000 --> 51:28.160
for having all the tickets to the opera and this and that,

51:28.160 --> 51:30.200
and they enjoy lifestyle a lot.

51:30.200 --> 51:31.440
The New York neuroscience mafia.

51:31.440 --> 51:32.280
Oh, there is one.

51:32.280 --> 51:33.100
There definitely is one.

51:33.100 --> 51:34.360
They know who they are.

51:34.360 --> 51:35.200
They know who they are.

51:35.200 --> 51:38.920
But people don't know Andrew Huberman is from the West Coast

51:38.920 --> 51:40.440
and now he's just starting wars

51:40.440 --> 51:41.600
with the neuroscience mafia.

51:41.600 --> 51:42.640
Well, they do amazing science.

51:42.640 --> 51:45.520
They think they love their lifestyle and that's wonderful,

51:45.520 --> 51:47.240
but the culture is very different.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.560
Carl and I think Silicon Valley in general

51:50.560 --> 51:54.360
kind of prides itself on this kind of monk-like,

51:54.360 --> 51:56.120
that says, schism, right?

51:56.120 --> 51:57.840
But at the individual scale,

51:57.840 --> 51:59.680
be deliberate about controlling the environment.

51:59.680 --> 52:01.880
I think about that with the conversations too.

52:01.880 --> 52:04.160
I haven't been deliberate about that either

52:04.160 --> 52:07.480
in terms of controlling the space you're in.

52:07.480 --> 52:10.680
Visually, yes, black curtains, all those kinds of things.

52:10.680 --> 52:13.840
There is nothing like the Lex Fridman podcast studio.

52:14.840 --> 52:17.200
First of all, when you do them remotely,

52:17.200 --> 52:20.040
I always feel like I'm in a witness relocation program.

52:20.600 --> 52:23.120
You only get the coordinates at the last moment

52:23.120 --> 52:25.360
and you always get the sense

52:25.360 --> 52:27.160
that there are people behind the walls

52:27.160 --> 52:30.080
that are recording things.

52:30.080 --> 52:32.560
Well, there's something about creating a feeling.

52:32.560 --> 52:34.440
I have a sense that there's a robot over there.

52:34.440 --> 52:36.560
There's several throughout this place.

52:36.560 --> 52:41.480
And I think part of that,

52:42.840 --> 52:44.080
part of creating a feeling

52:44.080 --> 52:47.600
would be having the robots constantly moving around

52:47.600 --> 52:49.920
and having a mind of their own

52:50.800 --> 52:54.680
because that would most closely put guests

52:54.680 --> 52:58.080
and other humans that interact with into a place

52:58.080 --> 53:01.480
that's closest to my mind

53:01.480 --> 53:03.920
because it's such an engineering mind

53:03.920 --> 53:06.480
and one where when things come to life,

53:06.480 --> 53:08.480
it's a beautiful place to be.

53:08.480 --> 53:10.720
And whatever that is, that could be like art,

53:10.720 --> 53:12.800
but to me, robots are art.

53:12.800 --> 53:15.280
And so I'm thinking about that

53:15.280 --> 53:17.760
both for me and for guests.

53:17.800 --> 53:19.920
And I'm also thinking about the difficult guests

53:19.920 --> 53:22.600
just to return to, you said Elizabeth Holmes,

53:22.600 --> 53:26.520
one person, maybe a couple of things I wanna say.

53:26.520 --> 53:31.000
One person I think I would like to talk to

53:31.000 --> 53:34.320
is Ghislaine Maxwell.

53:34.320 --> 53:35.640
I always get afraid right

53:35.640 --> 53:37.200
before you reveal these kinds of things.

53:37.200 --> 53:39.040
And now I know why I get afraid.

53:39.040 --> 53:40.840
Yeah, I mean, again,

53:40.840 --> 53:44.720
assuming that she did the things that people claim she did,

53:44.720 --> 53:45.920
they're despicable, right?

53:45.920 --> 53:48.000
I mean, these were underage children, right?

53:48.000 --> 53:50.480
There's just no version of the story

53:50.480 --> 53:54.560
where she did the things she was accused of doing

53:54.560 --> 53:56.600
and is still a quote unquote good person.

53:56.600 --> 53:59.240
There's just in my mind, right?

53:59.240 --> 54:01.760
And yet I think there is tremendous interest

54:01.760 --> 54:06.000
in understanding like what led her to do all that.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.320
So at least for some people.

54:07.320 --> 54:08.160
Let me say a couple of things.

54:08.160 --> 54:11.720
So one is at a high level,

54:11.760 --> 54:14.880
let me say that she believes,

54:14.880 --> 54:18.920
or her current story is that she's the victim.

54:18.920 --> 54:20.000
Of who?

54:20.000 --> 54:21.040
Of Jeffrey Epstein.

54:21.040 --> 54:21.880
Oh my.

54:23.160 --> 54:26.800
I think I'll just leave that there as is.

54:26.800 --> 54:29.920
So these are ideas that you're facing.

54:31.400 --> 54:34.720
The nature of truth and the nature of the human mind

54:34.720 --> 54:36.360
is what it is.

54:36.360 --> 54:38.920
And this is, imagine folks,

54:38.920 --> 54:43.080
if you went into a room with a person that says that,

54:43.080 --> 54:44.240
what do you do next?

54:45.200 --> 54:50.200
Let me also say that I never or rarely,

54:51.120 --> 54:52.360
let me say not say never,

54:52.360 --> 54:57.240
I rarely mention names that I'm interested in talking to

54:57.240 --> 55:00.880
without having made significant progress

55:00.880 --> 55:03.200
in already securing that interview.

55:03.200 --> 55:07.640
So people sometimes ask me about Vladimir Zelensky

55:07.640 --> 55:09.720
and Vladimir Putin.

55:09.720 --> 55:13.000
I do not bring them up lightly

55:13.000 --> 55:17.200
in terms of there being a path to an actual conversation.

55:17.200 --> 55:19.200
That said, something I regret,

55:19.200 --> 55:23.720
but I'm not sure I know what to do with it.

55:23.720 --> 55:27.360
But in the case of all the people I just mentioned,

55:27.360 --> 55:30.520
I haven't been preparing for those conversations.

55:30.520 --> 55:35.520
I only start really preparing seriously when it's confirmed

55:36.520 --> 55:39.880
because it's such a heavy burden.

55:39.880 --> 55:43.880
And one of the things I regret in having mentioned

55:43.880 --> 55:46.800
a conversation with Vladimir Putin

55:46.800 --> 55:50.720
before the war in Ukraine broke out in the past few years

55:50.720 --> 55:55.320
is that I would mention it very loosely, very casually,

55:55.320 --> 56:00.320
and without having really deeply put myself into a place

56:00.880 --> 56:02.600
that I'm ready to talk to him.

56:02.600 --> 56:04.840
And that's a tricky thing

56:05.280 --> 56:10.280
because then the internet, the audience in general,

56:10.800 --> 56:14.360
and just me, when I listen back to my dumb self,

56:14.360 --> 56:16.280
think, well, why are you speaking so lightly

56:16.280 --> 56:17.720
about these topics?

56:17.720 --> 56:19.520
Well, I know you've had a longstanding interest

56:19.520 --> 56:21.600
in talking to him.

56:21.600 --> 56:25.880
I think now, well, I don't understand

56:27.120 --> 56:31.200
how I would sit down and have a conversation

56:31.200 --> 56:32.160
with somebody like that,

56:32.160 --> 56:36.400
but that's not in the range of my skill sets, right?

56:36.400 --> 56:39.960
Or maybe not in the range of things

56:39.960 --> 56:42.000
that you're drawn to somehow.

56:42.000 --> 56:42.840
Not so much.

56:42.840 --> 56:46.240
I mean, I would watch that episode with great interest.

56:47.360 --> 56:49.720
Well, you did an episode recently with this guy

56:49.720 --> 56:53.960
who was a former cyber criminal turned stateside, right?

56:53.960 --> 56:55.240
I think he works for the government now.

56:55.240 --> 56:57.360
And there was a segment in there.

56:57.360 --> 56:58.200
Remind me his name.

56:58.200 --> 56:59.040
Brett Johnson.

56:59.040 --> 56:59.880
Brett Johnson.

56:59.880 --> 57:02.240
There was a segment in there where he talked about

57:02.240 --> 57:06.120
stealing a lifetime's worth of collected coins

57:06.120 --> 57:08.760
from some elderly woman.

57:08.760 --> 57:10.200
And this was everything she had.

57:10.200 --> 57:15.200
And then he openly admitted that he felt no remorse,

57:15.640 --> 57:18.560
which is the way he described is purely sociopathic.

57:18.560 --> 57:20.120
And then, of course, we learned that he grew up

57:20.120 --> 57:23.120
in a family where criminal behavior was very common.

57:23.120 --> 57:25.840
It was kind of embedded into his notions

57:25.840 --> 57:27.680
of what typical behaviors were.

57:27.720 --> 57:30.600
And I found myself somewhat conflicted,

57:30.600 --> 57:35.600
but also hung up on this idea that he had behaved

57:36.280 --> 57:39.960
as a sociopath or in a sociopathic way.

57:39.960 --> 57:42.600
And it created an internal conflict

57:42.600 --> 57:44.040
because he's a quite charming guest

57:44.040 --> 57:45.880
and his stories are terrific.

57:46.840 --> 57:49.200
Especially, I really enjoyed his discussions

57:49.200 --> 57:52.720
about how he would go out and do all these things

57:52.720 --> 57:56.480
out of a desire to please his girlfriend.

57:56.480 --> 57:58.280
So he was in service to other people,

57:58.280 --> 57:59.360
despite being a sociopath.

57:59.360 --> 58:01.760
You could say he was in service to them as a way to extract.

58:01.760 --> 58:03.240
Gets very complicated.

58:03.240 --> 58:05.120
I think that's the reason I went into science

58:05.120 --> 58:08.600
is that at some level, it's more about facts

58:08.600 --> 58:10.480
than it is opinions and judgments.

58:10.480 --> 58:12.080
And I don't know that I have the ability

58:12.080 --> 58:17.080
to suspend judgment away from the kind of top level contours

58:17.560 --> 58:21.160
of my initial reaction to like, if it's true,

58:21.160 --> 58:23.680
like the Ghislaine Maxwells and the Liz Holmes

58:23.680 --> 58:26.920
and the other sociopaths is one of just kind of revulsion

58:26.920 --> 58:28.240
and repulsion.

58:28.240 --> 58:29.760
But that could also reflect the fact

58:29.760 --> 58:33.640
that I'm not as neurologically sophisticated

58:33.640 --> 58:38.640
as somebody that can spin all the plates of empathy,

58:39.160 --> 58:44.160
forget forgiveness, but also holding people accountable

58:44.160 --> 58:45.000
at the same time.

58:45.000 --> 58:45.820
That's work.

58:45.820 --> 58:46.840
That takes, if you think about it,

58:46.840 --> 58:48.360
that's three, four brain circuits

58:48.360 --> 58:50.720
having to work in parallel.

58:50.720 --> 58:52.720
That's the difference between chess or a game of go

58:52.720 --> 58:53.560
and a game of checkers.

58:54.400 --> 58:56.040
I guess I'm playing checkers and playing chess.

58:56.040 --> 58:58.520
No, so one is actually holding in your mind

58:58.520 --> 59:01.200
and two is the raw skill of conversation.

59:01.200 --> 59:04.040
You're very, just having listened to your interviews,

59:04.040 --> 59:05.680
you're very good at conversation,

59:05.680 --> 59:09.000
but the skill of conversation is really tricky.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.320
I'm not being self-deprecating.

59:10.320 --> 59:12.100
I'm being just objective.

59:12.100 --> 59:15.600
I'm not good at conversation.

59:15.600 --> 59:19.080
I'm working very hard, getting better at it.

59:19.080 --> 59:22.880
I'm speaking not about just podcasting.

59:22.880 --> 59:25.400
I'm speaking just normal life.

59:25.400 --> 59:30.280
I have anxiety from social interaction.

59:30.280 --> 59:31.120
I-

59:31.120 --> 59:31.960
Do you really?

59:31.960 --> 59:33.080
Oh, huge, Jamal, yeah, yeah.

59:33.080 --> 59:37.300
So this is interesting because I never detect that in you,

59:37.300 --> 59:40.680
ever, and I think there are people that we both know

59:40.680 --> 59:45.240
that have said to me that they too feel anxious

59:45.240 --> 59:49.520
and yet your voice is steady.

59:49.520 --> 59:51.480
I don't see any perspiration.

59:51.480 --> 59:52.780
Oh, yeah.

59:53.740 --> 59:55.380
I'm scared shitless.

59:55.380 --> 59:57.540
I was scared shitless with Rick Rubin.

59:57.540 --> 01:00:00.940
Rick Rubin is, when you first meet him,

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:04.540
is intimidatingly calm, but as you get to know him a bit,

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:08.300
you realize that the kindness and the generosity

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.740
that you sense is real.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.660
But yeah, I would never in a million years

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.740
have guessed that you get anxious in conversation.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:19.100
Can I just make another quick comment?

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:22.380
This may come off entertaining to you, Andrew.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.260
Maybe you've already gotten the same,

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:30.340
but having mentioned Vladimir Putin, Vladimir Zelensky,

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:37.160
Ghislaine Maxwell, there's a natural question.

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:43.000
How does Lex have access to these people?

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.260
Who does he work for?

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:48.500
Like how does he-

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.820
Who works for him.

01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.100
Who works for him.

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:53.220
What does he have on others?

01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:55.820
This, I'm actually, I ask myself,

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:57.840
when I look in the mirror,

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:02.020
just somebody who kind of enjoys conspiracy theories,

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:03.300
I wanna ask the same question.

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:05.540
Like, well, I usually ask in the following way,

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.260
like how the fuck am I so lucky?

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:11.140
Like who am I being, am I a robot

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:12.580
being controlled by somebody else?

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:16.380
Or like, how is this my life right now?

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:17.220
What is happening?

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.820
It really does feel like a simulation.

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:22.060
So let me just speak to several things.

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:25.340
First of all, I have no boss.

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:29.220
I know of nor am I controlled

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:32.500
by any intelligence agencies of any nation.

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.940
We're gonna get you a dog, Lex.

01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:36.060
So that I can talk to.

01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:38.460
I'm scared of getting a dog

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:41.620
because I would fall in love so deeply, I think that-

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.740
Next time I'm bringing a puppy.

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:46.940
I'm just gonna bring a puppy and I'm gonna leave it here.

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.580
And then you'll never see me again.

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:53.580
I love dogs so much, but I was also surprised

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:58.580
and maybe I have never talked to an intelligence agency,

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.140
which is very interesting to me.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.060
That you're aware of.

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:08.220
Cause they're very good at communicating with people.

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:10.980
But I've been very suspicious on this exact point.

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:15.500
That's the downside of kind of being an introvert,

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.440
having anxiety about social interaction,

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.200
but then having so much love thrown your way

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.880
because connect over podcasts.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.560
Podcasts have a powerful way of connecting people.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.200
So people come with you with love that I really love.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:32.400
I appreciate, but I wonder exactly this question.

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.400
Why is this person with a Russian accent talking to me

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.480
and showing me so much love?

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.120
Because, sorry to interrupt you again,

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.800
but it's what we do.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.360
And it's a sign of interest, by the way.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.040
Sometimes, yeah, I have a colleague at Stanford

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.940
and she said, you know, interruption,

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:54.640
75% of the time is a sign of real interest

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.560
in what the person is saying, if nothing else.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.800
Well, you're very lovable.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.840
Well, I mean, I learned about Hedgehog in the Fog from you.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.960
You know, when I learned, you know, you're very lovable.

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.760
People love you because you're lovable.

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.480
I love love, okay, so 100%.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.800
And it's, I mean, especially here in Austin, Texas,

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:17.120
people are so, so amazing.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:20.000
I go just hugs and just, I love people, but.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:20.840
Do you want a family?

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.320
Are you eventually? 100%.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.280
I mean, you're, I take what you said as a challenge

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.920
in terms of having a family with kids

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.280
and they do jujitsu and obviously defeat you

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:37.280
and make you miserable for your failures as a father

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.320
because you couldn't.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.000
You're gonna be a great dad.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.160
Build up an army of good jujitsu people.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.920
But yes, I would love a family.

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.160
I would love to have children,

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.640
but I just want to finish that point

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:50.600
because I'm nervous about it.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.840
I'm nervous about the way people perceive

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.000
what you're seeing as a Forrest Gump type character.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.120
Like what, who I am, I seem to be,

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:00.760
and this is how like the world seems to work

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:03.480
is you just try, you try to be yourself.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.560
Like you try to find yourself.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.280
That's maybe the better way to say it.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:12.280
And just be that, be kind to people,

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:17.160
work your ass off and say F you

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.520
to anybody that wants to control you

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.520
or to tell you what to do.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.560
Just be free and then put love out there in the world

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.440
and doors open.

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.520
This karma thing seems to work.

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.920
Something like how the hell did,

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:32.880
how the hell, my friends as you know,

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:35.680
how the hell did I get a chance to eat barbecue

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.120
with Rick Rubin, right?

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.280
Like doors.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.120
You guys had a barbecue.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.440
He had a barbecue.

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.480
Right, of course.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.320
He's from New York.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.880
Any New Yorker that I know has very high standards for food

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:49.280
because bad restaurants don't last long in New York.

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.760
And barbecue counts as.

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.600
Oh yeah.

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.840
Oh yeah, Texas barbecue.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:56.720
Well, you know, I would also add that you,

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:59.400
whether or not you realize or not, you took tremendous risk.

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.200
I mean, we come from the same original community,

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.200
which is academic science, right?

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:07.600
And to be at MIT and to start posting lectures online

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.400
is risky, right?

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.640
To, you know, I was third or fourth man in on,

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.600
in terms of podcasting as an academic,

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.000
because you had gone on Rogan many times.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.520
David Sinclair had gone on there.

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:22.560
You know, the, especially before the pandemic,

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.960
you just didn't see many academics and scientists talking

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.880
in a public facing way.

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.040
So you took tremendous risk, right?

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.200
You took tremendous risk,

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:33.400
always wearing that jacket and tie, right?

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.040
The only time I haven't seen you in that truly

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.800
is when we rolled jujitsu, which is,

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.400
and I hear I'm being generous to myself saying,

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.320
I rolled jujitsu and basically you choked me out

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.160
in front of hundreds of thousands.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.200
That was really, really good.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.760
It was great fun and I-

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:46.720
Thank you for doing that.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.640
To have a beginner's mind is a beautiful thing.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:51.280
I have admittedly, I have not been taking the classes,

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.080
but I'm going to, I truly am.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.640
Especially there's a small chance I might find myself

01:05:56.640 --> 01:06:00.440
in Austin a bit more often in the near future, but the-

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.640
Well, if you're out in San Francisco,

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:02.920
you should train with Mark Zuckerberg.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.160
He just started, so.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.000
Oh yeah?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:05.840
You guys get-

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.680
Interesting.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.200
Sure.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.000
I mean, he's actually, I mean,

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.760
people listen to an episode perhaps.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.120
He's a fascinating human being too.

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:14.960
I listened to it.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.800
It was great.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:19.720
You took tremendous risk as an academic to do what you did.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:24.120
So I do believe that when one takes intelligent risk,

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.280
because you can die or can crash your career.

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:28.840
You can do all sorts of self-destructive

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.160
or destructive things when taking risks.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.440
You took risks and they paid off, right?

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.200
And you take different risks at different stages,

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.960
but I don't throw around the word admiration lightly.

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:41.520
I mean, I admire that you were in this classroom in MIT.

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:43.760
You're like, I'm going to film this and put it online.

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.040
You, one of your early interviews is with Ido Portal,

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.160
who's very hard to get to.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.800
I've communicated with Ido a few times.

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.760
You should definitely talk to him.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.040
I can't wait to talk to him.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.200
I'm dying to talk to him.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.520
I was supposed to do some course teaching with him

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.760
right before the pandemic hit,

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.720
and then it got canceled because he couldn't travel,

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.000
but getting to him is exceedingly challenging.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.360
So you do have this incredible ability to get to people

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.880
and for them to trust you and know you.

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:12.360
And I think it's through your authenticity.

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.080
And I think it's the fact that you're willing to go places

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.800
where people haven't been before.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.560
You know, this is, what's the saying about pioneers?

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.840
How do you spot the pioneers?

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:23.080
They're the people with the arrows in their backs.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.280
You know, so that's the, you know, yeah.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:28.200
And that's actually a quote that I lifted

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.120
from Terry Signowski, who's a-

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:30.960
There you go.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.040
Exciting sources again.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.320
Terry's a, you should talk to Terry.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.600
He's a computational neuroscientist

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.440
down at the Salk Institute,

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.760
Howard Hughes Investigator, et cetera.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.400
But so, you know, taking risks

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:48.280
that other people have not taken is, that's a real thing.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:53.160
And to do it with integrity and rigor, that's a real thing.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.160
And so, yeah, I'm complimenting you

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.960
and I hope it lands and lands deeply.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.400
But I also hope that people will hear that

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.680
and understand that it's one thing

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:06.400
to do what other people are already doing boldly.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.520
It's a whole other thing to launch an entire art form

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.840
or venue, and you did that.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.560
And you didn't write a book, hopefully you will someday,

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:16.560
but you didn't go write a book.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.440
A lot of academics have written books.

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:19.960
You went online.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.040
Jordan Peterson, another controversial character,

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.400
he did it too, all those lectures that he filmed.

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.040
And then it's led to this other thing.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:30.200
So, you know, there's karma,

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.800
and then there's also having the spine

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.760
to just put it all on the line

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.880
and do something for which there is no prior example

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:43.040
to hold onto while you go through those headwinds.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.280
The really fascinating thing,

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:46.480
and actually a lot of people tell me about you,

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:51.480
Andrew Huberman, like the reach of a podcast

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.040
is really fascinating.

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:56.160
It's not the numbers of people that listen.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.720
I don't know if that's important at all.

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.480
What's important is like the depth of connection

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.240
you have with certain people.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:08.600
It really moves them, and like they really get you.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.240
So there's a lot of big Andrew Huberman fans

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.680
that really get you.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:13.960
It's not just the science.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.920
It's the stuff between the lines.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:16.920
It's Costello.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.000
It's the whole picture of a scientist

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.120
that finds beauty in biology and reveals it,

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.280
and they love you for it.

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:28.200
You know, because it was on television at the time,

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:31.680
I followed that Amanda Knox story pretty carefully,

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.280
and I don't watch television,

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:34.720
but whenever I would travel,

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.120
if there was a TV on the airplane,

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.400
I would find myself getting wrapped into things

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:42.200
like locked up abroad, you know,

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.080
and these things which would make you terrified

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:47.200
to travel anywhere, let alone commit a crime overseas.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.520
You know, the scenes of some of these prisons

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.800
are so dramatic, and you know,

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.480
I mean, her case got a ton of interest,

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:55.600
and then, you know, she went and then was a student

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.240
at the University of Washington,

01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:59.680
and has talked quite openly about, you know,

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:02.600
how she was treated and how people assume guilt,

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.240
and you know, eventually, you know, she was exonerated,

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.040
and you know, we can only go by what we know

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.440
with the law determined,

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.240
but you know, these are people

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:13.560
that the world is fascinated by.

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.560
I would, I'm guessing about a third of people

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:18.240
have already decided this person is despicable.

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.520
Why would you ever give them an audience?

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:24.120
About a third of people, I think, are open to,

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.080
or at least interested in learning more about them,

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.120
and then I think the remaining third,

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.920
kind of the third that,

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:33.320
the category that I put myself in, which is,

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:37.920
what can I learn about people and myself,

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:41.040
even in my revulsion, right?

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:41.880
What can I learn-

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.720
About myself.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.160
Yeah, what can I learn about myself

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.640
from listening to this conversation

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:48.160
with somebody that I like to think,

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.280
I'm not talking about Amanda here,

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.120
I'm talking about the other people

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:50.960
that you're talking about,

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:53.880
that I don't, I can't relate to, right?

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:57.240
Talk, hearing conversations with and about people

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.680
that you cannot relate to is informative.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:03.640
Otherwise, your whole mind literally becomes insular, right?

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.200
Well, there's an interesting thing I also had to,

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:09.600
ever since the war in Ukraine broke out,

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:12.040
one of the questions I was asking myself,

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.120
and this is not to be dramatic,

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.680
it's just a very simple, honest question

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.200
that I think a lot of journalists

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.800
that operate in the war zone or documentary filmmakers

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.760
that have recently got a chance to meet

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.360
have to be honest with themselves,

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.160
are you willing to put at risk

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.960
your life for things you do?

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:36.040
What are you willing to die for?

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.480
Yeah, what are you willing to die for?

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:38.800
It sounds very dramatic,

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.960
but whenever risk goes up,

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.120
I mean, I don't know,

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.720
you asked that if you want to take out a trip out to space

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:51.320
on a commercial space flight,

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:56.240
you have to, are you willing to die for this journey?

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.040
Now, the odds there are really small.

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.200
I just watched Apollo 13 again.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.320
Great movie. Yeah, great movie.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:02.760
I'm not going to space.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:05.680
I'm not going to space.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:06.560
Bray to Heights?

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.840
No, I'm not Bray to Heights.

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.680
It feels like a terrible place to die.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:12.960
Yeah.

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:17.040
Well, first of all, death anywhere is not great.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.520
Yeah, although I have a song teed up in my phone.

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:24.280
If the plane starts to go down,

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:25.560
I'm going to spend the last few.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.440
It's a rare song.

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:27.280
Nobody knows it.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.800
It's a song off a B track of my favorite band,

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:32.080
which is Rancid, it's called The Sentence.

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.080
And nobody, and I love it

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.360
and I listen to it almost every day.

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.200
Rancid, The Sentence, it's called The Sentence.

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.680
The band is called Rancid, the famous band.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.240
Relatively love those guys, love their music.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.720
And the song is The Sentence.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.920
You can only find it on a B-side or outtake.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.880
And if you don't know how to decipher

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:50.920
Tim Armstrong's voice,

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:52.480
then you probably won't understand the lyrics,

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:55.360
but because it's sung very, very fast.

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.400
But if the plane ever goes, anytime there's turbulence,

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.040
I put that thing in, I put the headphones in.

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.120
I was like, well, if it's time, it's time.

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.400
I'm going to go out like this.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.200
I don't want to drift off into the galaxy

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.480
just slowly asphyxiating and freezing to death.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.080
That sounds horrible.

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.600
Just like I wouldn't want to drown or burn.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.920
But on a plane is okay?

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:11.920
Well, on a plane, I mean, look,

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.160
if the thing starts going down

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:15.200
and there's truly nothing you can do,

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:17.280
you might as well at least listen to your favorite song.

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.240
Yeah, true, true.

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.320
I'll probably go with the Pixies,

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.600
Where's My Mind from Fight Club.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.680
And just the calmness, just sit back

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:26.440
like the musicians playing at the Titanic.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.520
I didn't know you were a Pixies fan.

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:28.360
I'm going to have to.

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.840
Not so much a Pixies fan.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.760
Actually, I should say that I just,

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:34.880
that was the Where's My Mind.

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:37.440
It was the chosen song for Fight Club.

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.800
At the end when the buildings are coming down

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.000
or something like that.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.960
So that there's certain songs that just fit just right

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:49.240
for the collapse of human civilization.

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:54.240
And you're calmly appreciating like that's just it.

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.160
This is how absurd this life is

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.200
at any moment it can end.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.040
And this is it.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:05.560
I love how we both have death and demise soundtracks.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.040
It's just a question.

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.520
When you're an academic, doesn't come up often.

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.800
Right, well, yeah.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:15.920
There are some academics that are bold and brave.

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.920
It's not a phenotype.

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.680
Being bold and brave in the physical world

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:22.040
is not a common phenotype of academics.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.240
I mean, the great neurologist, one of my,

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.720
I don't have any heroes, but Oliver Sacks is a true hero.

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:30.280
I mean, people think of him as a writer,

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.120
but he was foremost a neurologist.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:35.160
And he took tremendous pushback

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.640
from the neurology community

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.000
for doing his books and his articles.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.920
He has a great biography called On the Move.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.000
There's a wonderful documentary that just came out about him.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.640
He died in 2015.

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:49.200
I'm actually kind of a collector of his things,

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.880
but he tremendous, but he was accused of horrible things

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.280
until the movie Awakenings came out

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.000
with De Niro and Robin Williams.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.080
Amazing movie, by the way, people don't,

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:02.240
they seem to not say great things about the movie.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:03.080
I love them.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.120
It was amazing.

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:08.440
And it was only once he became famous from that movie

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:12.000
that his more academic work started to receive

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:12.920
any kind of attention.

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:15.360
And he was invited back to Columbia and NYU.

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.120
You know, the New York neuroscience mafia is a real thing.

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:20.160
And yes, you know who you are.

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.480
And some of them are actually coming on the podcast.

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.920
I think we talked offline about this.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:30.080
We should start a mafia to fight off

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.600
whatever is going on in the East Coast.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:32.840
Although I'm still at MIT,

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:34.440
so I don't know how that works,

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.040
but Boston is different than New York.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.200
Yeah, so I have tremendous respect for science

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.480
done in New York, don't get me wrong.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.200
They are excellent scientists.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:44.480
It's just a very different culture than on the West Coast.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.800
And the personalities, the personalities-

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.920
Tremendous respect for the mob.

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:53.680
Well, and the personalities are a bit more grandiose.

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:57.800
However, because of some of the shift in science culture

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.320
in the last few years,

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:03.600
things around scandals and things of that sort,

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.200
they've been forced to tamp down some of their personality

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.440
or at least their outspoken personality.

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.200
And I actually think it's revealed something

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:12.800
really important and useful in science,

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.280
which is, you know, it used to be the case

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.480
you could really inject your personality into what you do.

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:21.960
You know, Richard Feynman is a good example.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.160
If he did today what he did then,

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.240
bongo drumming on the roof of Caltech,

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:31.200
naked, working out theorems in strip clubs

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:35.000
and things of that, he would have lost his job in moments.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:35.840
Right?

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.720
So that kind of behavior isn't celebrated anymore.

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:39.480
It's actually punished.

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:40.560
And I'm only half kidding

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.280
about this New York neuroscience mafia,

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.160
but because I now exist in multiple realms,

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.200
I can say these sorts of things.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.320
And I, again, admiration and respect,

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:50.440
but I will say that I think it's important

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.400
that people in science and kids that are curious

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:58.080
about science understand that you can have any personality

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.240
provided that you're ethical and respectful in science

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.080
and do well, right?

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.520
There are true bench scientists

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.040
that just want to be at the bench.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.600
There are people that just want to be in their office.

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:11.560
There are people that really enjoy public speaking.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.960
And there are people that love meetings.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.240
There are people that hate crowds.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.160
And so there's a place for everybody,

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:18.200
truly a place for everybody in science.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.880
I would like to be able to shine light on the fact

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:26.320
that you can have a shy personality,

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:27.560
an outgoing personality,

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:32.400
and all of those can have excellent careers in science,

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.120
but you have to find the community in place

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:34.960
that's right for you.

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.600
One reason I like Stanford

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:39.600
is that Stanford is very much about the future.

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.960
We have Nobel Prize winners,

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.040
we have Fields Medal winners and all that stuff,

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.240
and their names are on walls

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:46.080
and we acknowledge their great works.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:49.040
But most of what you hear about in the halls of Stanford

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.400
is about what's happening now and what could happen next.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.960
It's really about the future.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.920
Whereas when I've spent time at other institutions

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:58.320
not to be named, you hear that,

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:02.040
but there's a lot of kind of recycling and regurgitation

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:03.600
of how wonderful people are

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.800
based on things they did previously.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.240
And the students at Stanford, because of Silicon Valley,

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.920
sure, they have respect for Nobel prizes.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.640
They're delighted to be learning from and surrounded

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.120
by all these great minds,

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:17.600
but they're mostly interested in what they're gonna create.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.960
And so I kind of, not kind of,

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:23.200
I really like the shift toward possibility

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.680
as opposed to things that are steeped in tradition.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:28.640
I've never been to high table dinner at Oxford.

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.560
I'm sure it's a wonderful experience.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:35.160
I'm also not sure what purpose it serves for the world,

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.240
but I've never been,

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:37.720
and so I don't know what the conversations are,

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:40.920
and so maybe I'm speaking out of line here.

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:43.080
And then now I'm definitely not getting invited.

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:44.840
No, you're definitely getting invited.

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:45.760
But yeah, I'm with you.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:48.200
The culture's picked the right ones for you.

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:50.880
That's why I like MIT, the spirit of it.

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:55.160
To me, it's not about the past or the future.

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.080
It's about just tinkering

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.480
and having fun building cool stuff.

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:03.520
Like the big ambitious projects, it's there.

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:06.640
I mean, maybe more next in the biology and the health side,

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.720
but like the engineering side,

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.760
it doesn't matter if this has any impact.

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:13.800
Let us build the coolest thing the world has ever built.

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.600
Well, whenever I'm in Kendall Square,

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.800
I've seen, they have those buildings there

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:20.400
that actually tilt toward the ground.

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.400
These are these,

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.120
the architecture of MIT is also really impressive.

01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.520
Yeah, this, he pulled up,

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.400
Sergey just pulled up Elon Musk tweet.

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.840
I'm inspired by curiosity.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.240
That is what drives me.

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:33.040
So let us expand the scope and scale of consciousness

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.720
so that we may aspire to understand the universe.

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.320
Those are like three tweets in one, but curiosity.

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:41.760
Yeah, yeah, curiosity for its own sake.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:42.800
What's that saying?

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.360
I think Dorothy Parker said,

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.600
the cure for boredom is curiosity.

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:50.440
There's no cure for curiosity.

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:52.600
And then you need to celebrate.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.920
So let me just briefly mention

01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:00.600
to my lovely friends at MIT

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.200
to celebrate different weirdness,

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:06.040
to celebrate the weird characters.

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:11.040
I've, I sometimes get loving pressure from

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.080
my lovely friends at MIT

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:18.640
to tone down the weirdness a bit.

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:19.480
Really?

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:20.520
Even from MIT?

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:25.040
I'm very fortunate to have a lot of leverage

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:29.200
to where I have completely resist the pressure,

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:32.560
but I'm very sure that there's young faculty

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:35.840
that with that subtle pressure would

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.920
Dissolve them into a puddle of tears.

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:40.760
Not, no, no.

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:41.880
Oh, they're from Boston, excuse me.

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.920
They're from Boston, that's right.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:43.760
They're tougher than that.

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.840
That's right, but it's a slight nudging

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:49.320
towards conformity that I think ultimately destroys

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:56.360
or at least lessens the power of the kind of science

01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:00.240
that you can do when you encourage diversity,

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.480
diversity in all of its forms,

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.240
including the weirdness of ideas,

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.880
the out of the box thinkers,

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.920
including the flamboyant behavior online,

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:13.880
how you choose to educate, how you choose to inspire.

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.280
People talk about freedom of speech,

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:17.800
but it's not just like freedom of speech

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:20.320
to say controversial things.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.560
It's also freedom of speech to be weird.

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:25.960
Like if you're for some reason fascinated in,

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.640
like you look at Elon Musk, he talks about sex a lot.

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:33.080
Let the guy put sex memes up, who cares?

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:36.400
I mean, I feel like Elon can do basically whatever he wants.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.640
Right, there's no pressure,

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:40.360
but there's a bunch of Elons in the academic world.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:44.720
There's a bunch of, no, actually, sorry, let me backtrack

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.080
because the man deserves props.

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.800
Right, he's unparalleled.

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.480
He's a CEO of major companies.

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:53.240
You better believe there's pressure

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:57.640
to behave more like a CEO as opposed to a giggling schoolboy

01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:02.040
who's posting memes throughout the night, but that is him.

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:06.080
And that freedom, that's what freedom looks like.

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.120
I talked to a lot of CEOs,

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:13.120
and a lot of them feel like caged birds

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.760
who have long ago forgotten how to sing, quite honestly.

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:20.760
Like there's shareholders,

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:22.680
and they come up with excuses for themselves.

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.120
Here's why I have to be this way.

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.120
You have to understand, so on.

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:28.720
There's PR, there's marketing people, there's lawyers,

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:30.320
there's all that kind of stuff.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:35.120
But the final result is the authenticity is suffocated.

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:38.440
The beautiful weirdness of a CEO,

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.640
of a leader, of a creator, of a scientist, all that,

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.040
that's all gone.

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:49.080
Well, Steve Jobs wouldn't have kept his job

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:52.080
in acting the way he did in his 20s and 30s

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.520
in today's climate,

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:57.200
but he probably would have updated his protocols,

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.720
so to speak. A little bit, but maybe.

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:01.080
You know, screaming at employees.

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.920
I mean, these are anecdotes, right?

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:04.440
I call them anecdata

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:05.800
because people treat them as data,

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.160
but they're really just anecdotes.

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.720
We don't know, I wasn't there.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:14.280
But you know, I like the idea of authenticity

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.480
without oversharing, right?

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:19.600
You're very authentic, but there are aspects to your life

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.320
that I'm aware of that your audiences will never be aware of,

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:23.280
and there are aspects of your life

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.360
that I'll never be aware of.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.560
And so you're still authentic, but-

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:28.840
Yeah, wait, which ones are you aware of?

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:29.680
You're not gonna-

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:31.360
People are gonna wonder, like, what is-

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:32.180
You think I'm gonna trip-

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:33.020
Does he have a sex dungeon?

01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:33.860
What is this?

01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:35.380
No, no, no.

01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:37.700
But interesting choice of examples.

01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:42.220
No, but I think that, you know,

01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:44.940
people lose careers on the basis

01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:47.460
of the movement of their thumbs, right?

01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:50.340
I mean, the chair of psychiatry at Columbia

01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:55.340
recently lost his position based on a response to a tweet.

01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:56.500
People can look that up.

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.260
This is one of the most famous psychiatry departments

01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:00.980
in the world, and he put something out there

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:03.060
that was very insensitive, frankly,

01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:06.300
and everyone that I talked to about it was like,

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:09.080
gosh, that was very, very insensitive,

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.940
not thoughtful at all, and he lost his job, right?

01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:12.960
Or at least had to step down.

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:14.260
I don't know the specifics.

01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:18.700
So, you know, I think I read someplace

01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:22.700
that more than half of the job loss due to online behavior

01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:25.940
is because people were trying to be funny, right?

01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:29.780
I mean, not everyone can pull off what Tim Dillon-

01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:30.980
Oh, and by the way, congratulations.

01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:32.500
I heard that you and Tim just got married.

01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:34.340
No, no, we didn't just get married.

01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:35.540
He proposed.

01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.380
Got it, got it, got it.

01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:37.580
And I said yes.

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:40.380
Right, so some people can get a-

01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:41.220
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:42.040
Thank you, Sergey.

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.260
He has that, has that ready to go.

01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:46.140
See those 13.3 thousand likes?

01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:48.140
One of those is mine.

01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:49.740
So for people who are not aware,

01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:52.220
one of the days in April tweeted

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:55.180
that Tim Dillon asked me to get married, and I said yes.

01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:59.380
I think Tim said the wedding will be on Sixth Street

01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:01.280
in Austin, bring all of your weapons,

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.320
which of course is totally inappropriate.

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:04.720
This is-

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:05.560
I was funny.

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:06.600
He's a Canadian.

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:11.600
I was like PG funny, and he's goes rated R funny right away.

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:16.240
But that said, I mean, if there's anyone

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:20.080
I would like to get married with, it's that guy,

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:24.440
and we would do it in Austin, and it would be epic.

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:28.240
It would be like the wedding from November Rain.

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:30.520
Um, one of the-

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:32.520
Mr. and Mrs.

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:33.360
Oh, wow.

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.360
Oh, Mr. and Mr., I apologize.

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:38.820
Wow, yeah, and you broke tradition with the jacket color.

01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:42.760
So it sounds to me that you are a free speech absolutist.

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:44.560
I think freedom is really important,

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:48.460
and that includes letting people who are hateful,

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:51.200
letting people who are controversial

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:53.120
have a voice on platforms.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.160
But it becomes, I'm not sure what exactly to think

01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:02.160
because I also treasure the quiet voices

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:04.620
in the back of the room,

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:10.560
and sometimes the assholes silence those voices,

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:14.320
meaning by being loud and obnoxious and so on,

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.480
it pushes away the thoughtful people.

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:19.360
So I'm also a fan of creating communities.

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:22.440
Like you should be able to let people

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:26.360
kind of build a community that's positive,

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.700
that's loving, or that's constantly trolling,

01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:33.960
or that's super hateful.

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:37.120
All those communities should have a place in the world,

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:42.120
but like the thing I've noticed is that hate can destroy,

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:45.760
a community full of hate can destroy a community

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:49.560
full of love easier than a community full of love

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.080
can overtake one with hate.

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:54.000
So you have to kind of, I don't know exactly how,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.680
but create digital mechanisms

01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:00.320
that discourage the collision of these communities.

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:03.880
They should all have a platform and ability to speak

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:06.880
to a large audience, but you have to be careful

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:11.560
to protect that like little flame of connection

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.400
that people have.

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:14.480
That's the goodness, it sounds like.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:19.480
I mean, yeah, I think in any great city

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.480
like New York, which I love by the way,

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.740
you wanna have a symphony and an opera house

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.400
and you want some punk rock shows happening

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:27.400
on the Lower East Side.

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.520
You want all of that.

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:32.160
You just don't necessarily want them to overlap.

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:36.040
In terms of social media and then podcasts and engagement,

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.600
one thing that I decided very early on

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.260
is was to encourage comments and feedback, et cetera.

01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:44.980
But I have in my mind what I call classroom rules.

01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:46.180
You've taught in the university

01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:48.040
and then you teach in the university

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.600
you establish a certain etiquette within the classroom

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.140
of the kinds of questions that you'll tolerate, right?

01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:56.320
So there's always the student that's gonna ask a question,

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.320
which is basically a 10 minute monologue

01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.120
about their experience that really isn't a question

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.540
that pertains to a lot of people.

01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:04.580
So you politely discourage that kind of question

01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:05.800
and you encourage the kinds of questions

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.180
that are likely to be in the minds of many other students.

01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:09.520
It's just more efficient that way.

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.720
Or not politely, which is what I'm trying to do.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.160
I try and respond to comments and I try and respond,

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:18.020
but also there's this really interesting question now

01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:20.660
if you block people or restrict people,

01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:22.100
people think that you're somehow afraid

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:23.820
of the information that they're posting,

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.620
but that's often not the case.

01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:26.740
I'm not in the habit of blocking

01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:27.860
or restricting too many people.

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:29.420
Occasionally we've had to do it

01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:31.460
only because of how other people are being treated

01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:32.940
in the comment section.

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:35.340
What I can take and what I think other people deserve to take

01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:37.140
are two completely different things.

01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:38.140
David Goggins, right?

01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:40.060
Who we both know well.

01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:40.960
I don't know if he still does this,

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:42.980
but a few years ago he posted something like

01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:45.940
if people ask him, when do you sleep?

01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:47.620
He would just block them.

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:49.920
Because it wasn't consistent with what he was trying to say.

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:50.780
Of course he sleeps,

01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:53.300
but he's trying to get a particular message out.

01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:54.600
I think people should just understand

01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:59.500
that everybody's page is their own to moderate.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.540
Just like in a classroom,

01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:03.300
there are certain rules, of course, of institution,

01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:05.140
but then you establish the etiquette

01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:06.860
within the context of the kind of class.

01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:09.180
A class about personality, psychology,

01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:11.380
or the psychology of love,

01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:14.900
you're gonna have a very different range of conversations

01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:19.200
than a class on membrane physiology.

01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:25.140
So I think social media is a great place for conversation,

01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:26.880
but it's not necessarily a great place

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:28.460
for every kind of conversation.

01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:31.540
Yeah, and I also should say that people that do get blocked,

01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:35.260
I never, this is something I do very deliberately,

01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:38.980
blocked or ignored, I never think poorly of them.

01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:41.980
I actually explicitly think,

01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:44.780
if there's somebody that's saying hateful things

01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:47.580
about me or whatever, I always think positive thoughts.

01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:49.720
It's not some kind of weird guru thing,

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:52.180
but just actually found that as a hack.

01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:53.740
I think well of them,

01:29:53.740 --> 01:29:56.700
and that allows me to never think of them again.

01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:58.260
Like I send them my love,

01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:01.220
and I think this is a fascinating human being

01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:02.860
with a fascinating story.

01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:04.660
I would love to have time to actually learn

01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:07.220
about their story, but there's not enough time in the world,

01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:08.620
and I just think well of them,

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:11.900
and then I move on and enjoy a delicious meal

01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:14.660
with people that are close to me and I love and so on.

01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:19.340
And move on, and never adding to the negativity of like,

01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:21.500
just even in the privacy of my own mind,

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.700
thinking a hateful thought towards them,

01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:25.500
it serves no purpose whatsoever.

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.080
Yeah, I love that about you,

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:29.540
and I know that what you just said to be true.

01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:33.940
One of the, I think more toxic things in life

01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:37.780
is what's called, you know, evocative projection.

01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:40.260
When people feel something and they try and evacuate it

01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:41.500
and project it onto somebody else.

01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:43.220
Projection is fascinating, right?

01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:44.500
What you essentially just said is

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:46.700
that you don't accept projections.

01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:49.020
In fact, you transmute them,

01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:51.320
to put in the language of the Buddhist, you know,

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:53.140
you transmute it into positivity,

01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:58.140
and in that way, you truly neutralize it and transmute it.

01:30:58.540 --> 01:31:02.900
I think that if people were better understood

01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:04.940
when they were experiencing or observing

01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:06.500
evocative projection,

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:11.580
the world would be a much healthier and happier place.

01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:14.780
But it requires a certain stable internal rudder.

01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:18.300
And, you know, when we're tired or sick or angry,

01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:21.460
you know, we're hungry, excessively hungry,

01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:23.460
all of us are less good at it.

01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:25.580
I've been positively struck by the nature

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:28.560
of most of the interactions, not just feedback,

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:32.340
but my favorite thing as an educator in the classroom,

01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:34.980
but also on social media, my absolute favorite thing

01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:38.240
is when the comments about other people's comments

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.660
are positively reinforcing.

01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:42.940
You see people having conversations within the comments,

01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:44.340
and you realize this is like if you,

01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:46.220
as an educator again, you know,

01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:48.540
it's fun to teach and it's fun to talk to the students,

01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:51.740
but the real pleasures in walking by a small group

01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:54.220
of students on campus and hearing them talking

01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:58.380
about the material, that just fills me with joy.

01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:01.760
And because what it means is that the ideas

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.840
are reverberating in their nervous systems

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:06.260
and will eventually wick out to others.

01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:07.700
So it's not just about feedback,

01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:11.140
it's about a venue for parsing information.

01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:13.740
So you actually posted that we're gonna talk on Instagram

01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:15.500
and I collected a bunch of the questions,

01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:20.500
which reminds me of, I have to mention Mike Jones

01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:24.780
and a question he asked, but also a gift he gave

01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:27.100
quite a while ago, if it's okay.

01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:29.180
First, quick bathroom break.

01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:30.500
Yes.

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:33.220
We're looking at an Instagram page of Mike Jones,

01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:35.260
knife and tool, you should check it out.

01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:39.500
He, Andrew gave me a gift from him

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:44.300
that is a bad-ass butcher knife.

01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:46.660
Yours is the earth, dot, dot, dot,

01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:48.860
is from if by A Russia Kipling.

01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:52.060
Yeah, the story of this knife is kind of interesting

01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:53.760
perhaps to people where it was,

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:56.140
I was coming out here to Austin to meet with Lex

01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:57.940
and it was his birthday.

01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:00.200
I want to get him a gift, but I didn't know what to get him.

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:02.500
And I contacted this guy, Mike Jones,

01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.520
that I learned about through Joe Rogan.

01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:08.360
Remember in the old days of Joe Rogan,

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:09.920
when you go on the episode afterwards,

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:11.680
you'd take a picture with an object.

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:13.800
So it was like Elon with a flame thrower

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:14.760
or people would have the ax.

01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:18.820
I picked up this Bushwhacker hatchet thing

01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:20.840
and I was like, I love this thing.

01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:24.280
And Joe said, oh yeah, you should check out Mike Jones' work.

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:25.520
He does these beautiful knives.

01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:29.200
And so then I heard your episode with Joe

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.160
and you recited a poem at the end.

01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:33.320
It was right after your grandmother died.

01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:36.880
And there's a line in that poem from If

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:39.540
that Mike engraved on that knife for you.

01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:41.760
So he makes these by hand.

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:46.760
I love, the old days, before the podcast.

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:48.800
That's his first appearance.

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:50.600
That was the first time on there.

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:55.360
And it was a lot of fun in the old studio in Los Angeles.

01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:59.180
And yeah, Mike makes these beautiful knives.

01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:02.360
And I have this, I just have a great admiration

01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:04.520
for craftspeople.

01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:06.240
So, do you use it?

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:08.520
Do you cut your one meal a day stakes with it?

01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:11.680
I feel, are you taking it with you on your travels?

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:12.840
Exactly.

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:15.280
I actually used to keep it on the table,

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:18.320
but I thought it really intimidates guests.

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:19.280
A little bit.

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.120
But like.

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:20.940
You can put it on their side.

01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:21.920
Yeah.

01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:23.280
It's like, oops.

01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:25.000
It's trust, right?

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.320
What's the story?

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:27.480
I mean, yeah.

01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:28.980
But it's, cause it's not,

01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:33.640
it's quite bad ass, if I may say.

01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:37.920
So the craftsmanship is obvious, but also it is a knife.

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:40.160
It's got some like Dexter like qualities to it.

01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:41.000
Yeah.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.680
It looks like it's designed to cleave through a limb.

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:46.080
If I had like a family or something where people,

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:49.600
there's nothing about this place that softens your

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:54.600
kind of sense that this person might not murder me.

01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:56.800
Let's put it differently.

01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.840
This place could use a woman's touch.

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.840
That's one way to put it.

01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:02.680
If it's okay, let me, because it is,

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:07.680
it is a poem I go to often, actually.

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.800
You mentioned reciting some lyrics

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:13.280
and I'm actually gonna go back to that at some point

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.600
to get a few songs that touch you.

01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:20.120
But this is one of the things I go to often.

01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:23.240
I'll read it to remind myself.

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:28.000
It's advice from a father to son.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.160
And it's a kind of mantra that it's just nice to live by.

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.680
So if it's okay, let me just use this opportunity

01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:34.520
one more time.

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.560
Read If by Roger Kipling.

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.840
If you can keep your head when all about you

01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:41.600
are losing theirs and blaming it on you.

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:44.320
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:47.040
but make allowance for their doubting too.

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:49.980
If you can wait to not be tired by waiting

01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:53.080
or being lied about, don't deal in lies

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.000
or being hated, don't give way to hating.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.800
And yet don't look too good nor talk too wise.

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:02.800
If you can dream and not make dreams your master.

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:05.960
If you can think and not make thoughts your aim.

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:08.360
If you can meet with triumph and disaster

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:11.500
and treat those two imposters just the same.

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:14.240
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken,

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:17.080
twisted by nays to make a trap for fools

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:20.760
or watch the things you gave your life to broken

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:24.480
and stoop and build them up with worn out tools.

01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:27.000
If you can make one heap of all your winnings

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.760
and risk it all on one turn of pitch and toss

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:34.240
and lose and start again at your beginnings

01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:37.200
and never breathe a word about your loss.

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:40.040
If you can force your heart to nerve and sin you

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:42.960
to serve your turn long after they're gone.

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:46.240
And so hold on when there's nothing in you

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:49.340
except the will which says to them, hold on.

01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:53.260
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,

01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:55.700
I like this one, and walk with kings

01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:57.700
nor lose the common touch.

01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:00.700
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,

01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:05.620
if all men count with you but none too much.

01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:08.020
If you can fill the unforgiving minute

01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:10.640
with 60 seconds worth of distance run.

01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:15.740
Yours is the earth and everything that's in it

01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:19.120
and which is more you'll be a man, my son.

01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:20.400
Thank you, Andrew, thank you.

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:23.600
Thank you, Mike, for the knife, it's a, I don't know.

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:24.920
It's an important call.

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:25.980
And engraved in it.

01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:28.080
Yeah, it's yours.

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:31.360
Yours is the earth and everything that's in it.

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:34.200
We toiled over what to engrave

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:36.360
and then finally I just said, Mike,

01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:38.920
just pick something that speaks to you.

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:41.160
You're the craftsman and so he selected that.

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:42.960
There's certain ways to pull yourself in that book.

01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:47.960
Actually, Carl Dysarath, he wrote the book Projections.

01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:51.520
One of my favorite, first of all, just as you said,

01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.080
incredible writer.

01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:57.880
Just, I mean, if you wrote fiction,

01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:59.000
if you wrote those kinds of things,

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.600
I'm curious to see where he goes with his writing.

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:02.440
It's very interesting.

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.880
I think that book took him 10 years to write.

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.520
Which is vindication for me and for you

01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:07.840
because we're both supposed to write books

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:09.040
and we haven't done it.

01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:13.600
Yeah, I mean, you know, in some sense,

01:38:13.640 --> 01:38:18.640
your first book will have, you know, decades in it, right?

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:23.680
Even if you just take half a year to write it.

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.680
It's like the first book, like the first album

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:28.920
for a musician, I mean, it's a journey.

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:35.160
But he uses poems and quotes in there really well.

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:36.080
It's a beautiful book.

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:36.920
It's a dreamy book.

01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:38.900
I think when people hear that it's a book

01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:40.360
about neuroscience, they think they're gonna get

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.960
a textbook or a protocols book or something.

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:44.200
It's nothing like that.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:46.520
But it really is a deep dive into the mind

01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:48.160
of the psychiatrist and the researcher

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:50.600
and so much feeling and compassion.

01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:51.880
I love that you love poetry.

01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:55.760
I mean, I didn't know that until I saw you on Rogan Read If.

01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:00.760
And I'm not a very rabid consumer of poetry

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:03.200
but I'm a big Wendell Berry fan.

01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:10.680
And I try and read a poem once every few days.

01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:13.440
Also, I think if is a tough act to follow.

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:14.800
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:18.320
I mean, that's the richness and the, I mean,

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:21.520
you said every third line in there is something

01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:25.480
that you would consider your life well-lived

01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:27.800
if you said that, right?

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:31.480
What about the preparation for the solo podcast?

01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:33.240
You said you listen to certain songs.

01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:37.200
You know, you sing or recite the lyrics to certain songs.

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.360
Is there ones that kind of come to mind

01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:40.560
that are interesting?

01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:43.680
Yeah, I've always been very lyrics driven

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:45.440
and I don't understand music.

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:46.640
I've talked to Rick about this.

01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:47.760
I think I've talked to you about this a little bit.

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.200
I don't really understand.

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:53.960
I mean, I can hear music and like it

01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:56.600
but I don't really understand the structure of it.

01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:57.440
But lyrics make a lot of sense to me.

01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:00.400
But does it touch your soul, music, or is it the lyrics?

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:02.320
It's the lyrics, it's not the instrumentals.

01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:04.120
So I'm a huge Joe Strummer fan

01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:05.920
and I'm gonna lose punk points for saying this

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:07.360
but I'm not a Clash fan.

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:08.320
Oh, okay.

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:10.240
So he obviously is best known for the Clash.

01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:12.640
Most Clash songs start off great

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:15.520
and then after about 30 seconds, at least in my mind,

01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:17.840
just kind of disintegrate into a bunch of mush.

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:21.120
Whereas Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros,

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:24.920
which is what he did as an adult later,

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:25.920
and some of his solo work,

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:28.000
he actually, Rick produced some work

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.240
that he did with Johnny Cash.

01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:33.040
Rick pulled Johnny Cash essentially out of retirement

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:35.920
and had him do his albums before he died.

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:38.360
And so anything that Strummer did,

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:40.880
there's a favorite song of mine by Strummer,

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:42.200
it's called Burning Lights.

01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:45.400
There is an album now where you can find it

01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:47.280
or Tennessee Rain or some of these things that he did

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.880
which are a little bit more folky, so not really punk.

01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:51.280
So I love that song.

01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:54.400
Bunch of songs by Rancid that I love.

01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:55.840
Yeah, Rancid is great.

01:40:55.840 --> 01:40:57.880
And then if I listen to instrumentals,

01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:01.760
I do, I'll listen to classical piano.

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:04.360
Some dreams are made for children.

01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:06.840
But it's not gonna sound good as a poem.

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:07.680
People can play the song.

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:08.760
Play the song, okay.

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:11.280
Yeah, so I'll, I mean,

01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:12.880
cause it has to be something,

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:14.880
Joe's voice is what makes the song.

01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:17.120
Joe's voice is what makes the song.

01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:18.760
But yeah, that song Burning Lights

01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:22.000
from I hired a contract killer or-

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.080
I don't know, the licks are pretty good.

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:23.920
They're pretty good.

01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:25.480
I mean, Joe is an amazing writer, right?

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:27.920
I'm also a big Bob Dylan fan.

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:30.040
Glenn Gould for classical piano.

01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:33.360
He was at Asperger's and actually I think

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:34.400
you can hear him grunting.

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:35.880
He had a Tourette's like tick.

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:40.640
And I learned about Glenn Gould from Oliver Sacks.

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:42.080
So I'll listen to any number of things.

01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:43.040
It depends on my mood.

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:44.200
If I'm feeling a little more tired

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:45.680
and I need to be amped up,

01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:48.040
I'll listen to something that's a little louder and faster.

01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:49.560
If I'm feeling kind of keyed up

01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:52.160
and I need to bring the cadence down a little bit,

01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.880
then I'll listen to something a little mellower, poppier.

01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:57.960
I love bands like,

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:02.880
I'm a big fan of this British pop band called James.

01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.760
There's like 20 bands named James,

01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:05.880
but this one, you know,

01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:07.640
and again, I lose punk points for saying that,

01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:09.320
but they're amazing.

01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:10.160
And best of luck.

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:11.320
I think you've accumulated enough points

01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:13.760
where you can afford to lose a few.

01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:15.120
Yeah.

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:18.800
But in any case, yeah, music and poetry are,

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:21.880
they're the subconscious, right?

01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:23.600
I mean, if you think about a Bob Dylan song

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:25.960
or a really good Strummer song or a poem

01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:29.080
that the words don't mean anything when read linearly,

01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:30.660
but they make you feel something,

01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:32.900
they're tapping into the subconscious.

01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:34.140
That's really what they're doing.

01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:38.460
They're pulling on neural threads of emotion

01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:41.300
based on either timbre or cadence

01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:45.500
or something that's independent of the word structure.

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:48.660
And that to me is the beauty of music and poetry.

01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:51.740
I often say Johnny Cash's version of Hurt,

01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:55.100
that I say would be my favorite song ever.

01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:56.740
Well, he did a Nine Inch Nails song.

01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:57.580
He did, he covered-

01:42:57.580 --> 01:42:58.860
I think Rick produced that.

01:42:58.860 --> 01:42:59.700
Pretty sure he produced that.

01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:01.100
He produced it.

01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:04.180
I mean, he did like the, Rick produced the,

01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:08.020
he pulled Johnny Cash out from a dark place

01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:11.960
to produce something that, I mean, when you look back

01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:15.500
as one of the great things ever in music,

01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:19.380
which are these like haunting covers

01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:21.980
of certain songs and originals.

01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:25.200
Johnny Cash and Joe Strummer did a version

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:30.040
of Redemption song together that Rick produced,

01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:33.800
which is on loop in my house sometimes,

01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:35.560
for hours and hours.

01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:37.000
That song is fascinating.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.720
Bob Marley's song.

01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:41.760
Song by Johnny Cash and Joe Strummer.

01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:44.760
Sometimes I think what it would be to be a fly on the wall

01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:46.160
when these guys were doing this stuff.

01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:48.640
These songs of freedom.

01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:51.120
There's certain songs where you're like,

01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:56.120
it elicit an emotion that's unlike anything else.

01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:02.000
I mean, I was trying to figure that out with Rick too.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.640
Like there's certain songs that make you want to pull out

01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:07.320
over to the side of the road and just weep

01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:11.680
or just get inspired to just get shit done

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:13.240
or all of those kinds of things.

01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:16.600
Remember your family, the people you've lost,

01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:17.440
all that kind of stuff.

01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:20.960
I mean, hurt, I hurt myself today.

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:22.920
See if I still feel.

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:26.080
There's certain songs that I've loved so much

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:29.360
that I actually won't play them during a relationship

01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:32.660
until the relationship passes a certain duration

01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:35.560
because if you start sharing in those experiences

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:36.680
with somebody in the room

01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:39.280
and it starts to become associated with the relationship,

01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:42.640
you're braiding it in with the dopamine of love

01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:45.480
and that relationship ends, the song is forever tainted.

01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:47.200
There are certain songs that I will never play

01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:49.240
in the company of anybody else.

01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:50.080
They're mine.

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:55.000
It's too risky to give those up.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.680
There's like levels.

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:01.840
They're levels, right.

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:04.040
Exactly.

01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:05.840
We'll leave it at that.

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:10.840
Yeah and the interesting thing about this kind of preparing

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:15.720
for the solo episode, just interacting with Rick

01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:18.120
about that process of preparation

01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:23.120
and because you mentioned with interviews,

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:25.120
by the way, are you do solo solo?

01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:26.920
Are you the only one in the room or?

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:30.160
No, well, it used to be Rob, my producer,

01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:35.160
who I should say, he's really the person behind the podcast.

01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:37.520
I mean, first of all, we're equal partners.

01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:38.960
You're just a pretty face.

01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:43.360
We're just, and I'm aging, man, not to say I love him.

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:45.520
I actually really, I like aging.

01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:46.360
It's weird.

01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:47.880
A lot of people like friends with David Sinclair

01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:49.560
and it's all about not aging.

01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:52.560
I don't wanna live past 90, 95.

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.360
I'm just trying to get as much done as I can

01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:56.040
in this short life and do it right

01:45:56.040 --> 01:46:00.840
and with integrity and heart and accuracy, you know.

01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:02.480
And you like the stages.

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:05.400
Oh yeah, if you read Ericsson's stages of development,

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:08.680
you realize that every stage of life

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:12.160
is a set of neural circuits trying to resolve a problem.

01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:16.160
And if you're gonna try and avoid that progression,

01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:18.360
sure, you might live longer.

01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:21.200
But you know, it's sort of like saying like,

01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:25.440
do you wanna go win the high school jujitsu championship?

01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:28.560
No, you graduated high school a long time ago, right?

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:32.200
So I actually look forward to the future,

01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:35.000
even if it means that I'm starting to shift.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.120
I think that my biology will shift.

01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:37.960
You know, I'll fight that.

01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:39.160
I try and take good care of myself,

01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:41.200
but I don't wanna get sick.

01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:43.080
I don't wanna suffer, who does?

01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:46.600
But I'm embracing this whole developmental arc.

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:49.800
I mean, we're not children and then adults.

01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:52.840
Our entire life is one long developmental arc.

01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:54.800
And if you fail to embrace that,

01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:56.440
you fail to extract the richness

01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:58.640
of what it is to be a human being.

01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:03.640
So in any event, I record Rob is in the room.

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:08.080
I'll sometimes stop and ask him for feedback

01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:09.740
if I feel like something's not landing right.

01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:11.600
So if it's clear, he'll let me know.

01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:12.840
If it's not clear, he'll let me know.

01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:15.600
And then Costello used to be in the room.

01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:19.280
The early days of the podcast, which weren't that long ago,

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:22.160
he's snoring at my feet and farting

01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:23.180
and smelling up the room.

01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:25.000
And we're all just kind of like gasping for air.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.840
He's a bulldog, that's what they do.

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:29.440
With him gone, it changed.

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:30.280
The whole thing changed.

01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:31.720
There will be another dog soon.

01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:36.560
And as you know, I've been moving through that grief process,

01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:41.560
but having him there gave me a levity that I miss.

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:43.160
But in my mind, he's still there.

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:44.000
Yeah, he's still there.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:44.840
Yeah, he's still there.

01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:48.160
And in time, there'll be another dog.

01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:49.800
And who knows, maybe there'll be a dog

01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:51.320
and a couple of infants running around,

01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:53.000
but that would be more distracting.

01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:58.060
But there's no podcast that exists

01:47:58.060 --> 01:47:59.600
just because of the podcaster.

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:02.840
This is true for Joe, this is true for your podcast for me.

01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:05.240
It's not just a staff of people that post stuff.

01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:07.080
That's just the top level contour.

01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:09.240
There's the constant feedback and iteration

01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:11.640
of what you want it to become

01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:14.560
and trying to hold on to something

01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:16.560
that's essential along the way.

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:17.640
Because everything has to evolve,

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:20.480
but you can't lose the essence of something.

01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:24.120
Anytime a company or brand or a course

01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:27.840
or a scientist has done that, it just ends up terrible.

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:31.420
It just becomes like a senator version of itself.

01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:36.420
So to Rick, the power of the people in the room is great

01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:39.700
to inspire and to destroy.

01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:42.140
So you have to be extremely careful

01:48:42.140 --> 01:48:44.460
with the selection of people that are in the room.

01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:47.420
To me, I never really thought of it that way.

01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:50.980
I thought only positive things can happen.

01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:51.940
Oh, by adding people in the room.

01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:52.780
By adding people in the room.

01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:55.300
Oh, I think if there were an audience in the room.

01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:56.140
Well, you know what?

01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:59.020
Someday I'd love to do a live podcast with you.

01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:02.020
I saw you doing like a couple of live things,

01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:05.300
which is great that you're paving the way there to try things.

01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:08.660
I went up to the University of British Columbia

01:49:08.660 --> 01:49:11.700
and did a lecture on a college campus.

01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:13.780
And one of the more gratifying things that happened

01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:16.060
is this kid, he's in his early 20s, I think,

01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:19.740
stood up and said, I've never been on a college campus.

01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:22.140
I didn't think I could go onto a college campus.

01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:23.500
And that still rings in my mind.

01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:25.340
Whoever you are out there, that meant so much to me.

01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:26.580
Because I was like, yes.

01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:27.740
There was something about that to me.

01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:30.580
I was like, okay, it made sense to come all the way up here

01:49:30.580 --> 01:49:31.620
and do this in person.

01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:34.700
Because you can get out to a lot more people online.

01:49:34.700 --> 01:49:35.660
Public speaking events,

01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:37.580
it's not like it's that lucrative or anything.

01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:39.300
I mean, unless you're, whatever,

01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:41.780
you're a famous celebrity or politician or something.

01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:43.100
I'm sure there are people that do well with it,

01:49:43.100 --> 01:49:44.700
but that's not what it's about for us.

01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:47.260
It's really about being able to connect with people

01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:50.460
in a different venue and for interactions like that.

01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:52.700
I don't know how many of them we will do,

01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:55.500
but I'm curious to see how it goes.

01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:57.940
But I'd love to do a podcast with you.

01:49:57.940 --> 01:49:59.300
Is it energizing?

01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:03.780
My fear is the fear of the introvert

01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:08.020
is that I don't know if I can handle so much love

01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:11.940
and fascinating people all around.

01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:13.940
It's like, I don't know.

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:16.180
Well, we'll invite a few haters, too.

01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:18.660
Well, yes, but I love the haters, too.

01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:20.860
But I don't know, it makes me nervous

01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:23.140
because Jordan Peterson is currently on tour.

01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:25.300
I got a chance to hang out with him when he was here.

01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:28.180
He does a lot of live speaking.

01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:31.860
Yeah, he's now on tour where he does every other day.

01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:33.300
And-

01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:35.460
But he doesn't have any small kids at home anymore.

01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:36.580
So you can do that.

01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:38.420
So yeah, you should do it before you have a fan.

01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:39.260
It's also exhausting.

01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:40.180
Yeah, you're touring.

01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:42.380
I'm just speaking from an athlete perspective.

01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:45.980
Like if you're Mick Jagger with the Rolling Stones,

01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:50.980
it's just physically, I mean, you have to speak

01:50:51.100 --> 01:50:54.980
potentially for two hours, then offstage,

01:50:54.980 --> 01:50:57.100
like hanging out with people.

01:50:57.100 --> 01:50:57.940
It's a lot.

01:50:57.940 --> 01:50:58.980
It's a lot of hours.

01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:01.060
It's a lot of hours to stay focused,

01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:05.020
to keep finding your place of calmness and excitement.

01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:06.260
Well, and you're staying in hotels,

01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:08.100
your circadian rhythm's disrupted.

01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:09.980
You're not getting your cold and sauna

01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:13.340
and your workout every day, your food isn't optimal.

01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:16.180
I think done in patches, I could enjoy it

01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:17.780
because it's fun to meet people from different places.

01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:20.460
I'm doing a public lecture in Copenhagen

01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:23.380
for the Lundbeck Foundation in June, June 3rd.

01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:25.540
And that one is particularly gratifying for me

01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:28.100
because the Lundbeck Foundation is an academic foundation.

01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:30.020
So the fact that, and then so when they invited,

01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:32.220
I asked, do you want me to talk about what my lab does

01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:34.100
or do you want me to talk about the stuff on the podcast?

01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:35.980
They're like, no, no, not your lab.

01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:37.980
We want to hear about this like health stuff

01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:39.900
and the stuff that we cover on the podcast.

01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:41.860
So that was amusing to me and tells me

01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:44.340
that things are changing now.

01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:47.700
I think 2020 and 2021 revealed a lot of things

01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:50.060
about people to ourselves.

01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:52.020
But one thing that it made very clear

01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:55.700
is that there's an enormous appetite for tools

01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:56.740
for mental and physical health,

01:51:56.740 --> 01:51:58.100
but also understanding about science

01:51:58.100 --> 01:51:59.580
and how science is done.

01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:02.380
So thanks to you, again, I'm not saying this to flatter you,

01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:03.740
it's true gratitude.

01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:07.300
There is now a runway for scientists to talk to people.

01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:09.060
I mean, you had the, I always forget this guy's name,

01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:10.900
the virus guy from Columbia.

01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:12.140
Vincent Raconiello.

01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:13.340
Yeah, amazing, right?

01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:16.460
I mean, forgetting the controversy around all the stuff

01:52:16.460 --> 01:52:19.380
of 2020, 21, I mean, he is an encyclopedia

01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:21.860
of all things virology.

01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:24.460
Yeah, people should listen to his podcast

01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:25.660
this week in virology.

01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:28.140
He's also an incredible lecturer and educator.

01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:30.340
It's fascinating.

01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:32.580
It's fascinating when people take, again,

01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:36.100
that leap of putting all that education online.

01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:39.220
That's non-controversial at all.

01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:43.300
It's like everybody, people should go listen to him

01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:47.580
for the most part in terms of, at his best at least.

01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:48.780
There's no politics in it.

01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:50.180
There's none of that.

01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:51.660
No, he's a virus jockey.

01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:55.500
He likes playing around with bacteria and viruses

01:52:56.340 --> 01:52:57.820
and molecular biology.

01:52:57.820 --> 01:53:00.460
We all say stuff carelessly all the time.

01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:02.700
So he gets in a bit of trouble on some of the things

01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:06.460
you've said about like dismissing lab leak theory.

01:53:06.460 --> 01:53:07.940
Like there's no way.

01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:08.780
He dismisses that.

01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:12.820
Yeah, but not, he's not making, like folks,

01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:19.020
there's a difference when you say stuff like off the cuff

01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:22.380
and when you say stuff that's like core to your principles

01:53:22.380 --> 01:53:25.060
and you've thought about it for a very long time,

01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:28.380
you're talking for hundreds of hours

01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:29.700
and you can just say stuff.

01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:31.420
You can just say your opinions.

01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:34.820
Will Smith slapped me.

01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:37.220
I was wondering, okay, wait, how long have we been recording?

01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:38.620
I was wondering how long it was gonna take us

01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:40.300
before someone- We talked about Ukraine.

01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:41.340
No, no, Will Smith.

01:53:41.340 --> 01:53:43.220
I was wondering whether or not we'd make it the end.

01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:45.020
I had it planned.

01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:46.940
I was literally in the back of my mind.

01:53:46.940 --> 01:53:48.420
I had it planned that at the end,

01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:50.860
if we didn't talk about the Will Smith, Chris Rock thing

01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:52.940
that I was gonna say, it's amazing.

01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:54.580
This is the first conversation to happen

01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:58.020
in a long time where it wasn't mentioned.

01:53:58.020 --> 01:53:58.860
Oh, no.

01:53:58.860 --> 01:54:01.020
I can't, no, do not pull it out.

01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:01.860
We don't need to see it.

01:54:01.860 --> 01:54:03.020
We don't need to see it. Here we go.

01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:06.260
It revealed some interesting things about human beings,

01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:08.900
impulse control and lack thereof,

01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:11.780
but, you know, oh my goodness.

01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:13.940
Chris Rock has material for the rest of his career.

01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:16.660
Yeah, I think he's not short on material.

01:54:16.660 --> 01:54:21.140
Well, I do, see, if I knew what I wanted to tweet,

01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:23.620
if I knew your lot to just slap comedians,

01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:25.020
my conversation with Tim Dillon

01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:27.140
would have gone very differently.

01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:29.220
People just being humans.

01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:32.420
There's so much fascinating human nature on display there.

01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:37.460
It's also, in terms of it becoming a topic

01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:39.380
that a lot of people are talking about

01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:41.020
versus the war in Ukraine, for example,

01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:42.260
is also fascinating to watch,

01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:46.100
like just these kind of news cycles moving through.

01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:48.140
Well, I think, if I may, I'm sorry to interrupt,

01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:53.020
but, you know, anytime we observe something very limbic,

01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:55.260
very emotional, you know,

01:54:55.260 --> 01:54:59.660
we generally can empathize somewhat, right?

01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:00.980
We all know what it's like to feel angry.

01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:02.260
We all know what it's like to feel ashamed.

01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:04.500
We all know what it's like to feel shocked.

01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:09.340
Images of war are, for most people, very hard to relate to.

01:55:09.340 --> 01:55:10.340
We see it.

01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:12.460
It's, you know, there are these images

01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:15.260
and they're very traumatic and challenging

01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:16.100
to look at at times.

01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:17.500
And yet most people have no idea

01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:19.780
what it feels like to be shot at

01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:21.660
or what it feels like to have your home destroyed

01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:26.260
or what it feels like to be an aggressor in that way.

01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:29.180
So it's very, so I think that people naturally orient

01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:31.780
towards things that feel familiar to them,

01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:33.540
even though the circumstances are different.

01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:36.500
And people also forget, they look at these celebrities,

01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:39.900
that's just like looking at criticism of Will Smith.

01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:43.220
You forget that they're human too.

01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:45.580
That's one of the most surprising things for me,

01:55:45.580 --> 01:55:48.300
having done this podcast and met celebrities

01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:50.020
and stuff like that.

01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:51.300
They're human.

01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:52.140
They're all human.

01:55:52.140 --> 01:55:54.460
That's inspiring to me, like some of these great folks

01:55:54.460 --> 01:55:57.460
that have won Nobel prizes and built some cool things.

01:55:57.460 --> 01:55:59.460
They're just human, like the rest of us.

01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:01.420
Well, and if you look at actors and actresses,

01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:03.060
I mean, there's some amazing ones, right?

01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:05.260
And who also do well in the outside life,

01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:09.740
but their careers were built on the business

01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:12.900
of pretending to be other people.

01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:16.460
And that's got to distort maybe positively,

01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:19.380
but also just, let's be honest, what it is

01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:21.020
that the neuroplasticity there,

01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:22.860
the changes in the areas of the brain

01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:25.420
that represent personality have to be quite different

01:56:25.420 --> 01:56:26.980
for somebody who pretends to be lots

01:56:26.980 --> 01:56:28.940
of different personalities and gets paid for it.

01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:30.820
You're working the reward system

01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:33.260
into the system of self-identity.

01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:37.220
And you have to imagine that that can really

01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:41.700
contort somebody's neurology in ways

01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:45.860
that maybe they are not in touch with reality

01:56:45.860 --> 01:56:47.340
in the same way that we are.

01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:50.300
Earlier we were talking about neurotic versus psychotic.

01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:54.620
They may be more borderline in their kind of ground state

01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:56.100
than we think.

01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:58.220
And so I'm actually impressed any time there's a celebrity

01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:00.500
who doesn't have a messed up life.

01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:02.860
I'm like, oh, wow, finally somebody who's managed

01:57:02.860 --> 01:57:05.820
to maintain some semblance,

01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:08.220
at least from the outside, of normalcy.

01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:12.420
So first of all, I can empathize with the actions

01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:14.100
that Will Smith did, right?

01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:17.220
They're not, I think they're kind of not kind of,

01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:18.940
they're just shitty.

01:57:18.940 --> 01:57:22.060
You should probably talk privately, man to man, not,

01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:24.620
because otherwise it's like a dramatic display.

01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:27.940
It's almost like you are a fake, you're acting.

01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:29.660
Well, there are all these questions, right?

01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:33.060
I mean, obviously it was aggressive at some level.

01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:36.100
There's this question of whether or not it was impulsive.

01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:37.300
I think most people feel yes.

01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:39.460
There's a question, there was a protective nature of it

01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:42.140
because he was doing it to, you know,

01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:43.900
apparently in defense.

01:57:43.900 --> 01:57:47.140
But then there's also the context,

01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:49.420
he lost touch with the context, right?

01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:52.700
Whereas Chris Rock basically gets,

01:57:53.660 --> 01:57:56.700
there's the possible critique that he went too far,

01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:59.100
that's gonna be in the eye of the beholder.

01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:01.580
But then, and depending on how you view comedy and jokes,

01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:04.020
but then there's also the fact that he took that slap

01:58:04.020 --> 01:58:05.180
and then just snapped right back,

01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:07.460
so much so that people thought maybe it was faked.

01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:09.980
He also waited with his hands behind his back.

01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:12.220
That's his nature, he likes to stand like that.

01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:17.260
I mean, I gotta tell a little bit of a story here

01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:22.740
to connect to what Chris Rock did.

01:58:22.740 --> 01:58:27.500
Like, I wish what Chris Rock did in terms of just taking

01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:29.020
this slap and keep going, first of all,

01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:32.540
just props for somebody that's able to maintain cool

01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:35.260
in that situation, for the most part.

01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:36.900
I think I'd like watched it once.

01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:40.660
You only have to be alive on this planet to see it,

01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:42.060
you can't avoid seeing it.

01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:47.220
I wish at that, afterwards, he would sort of say

01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:52.220
something loving and kind to Will Smith and his wife,

01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:56.740
and then hit him real hard, lean into the joke.

01:58:56.740 --> 01:59:00.100
But there, I think in hockey, they call taking a number.

01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:01.740
I have a friend who plays hockey and there's this idea

01:59:01.740 --> 01:59:04.500
that if someone checks you really badly in one game,

01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:06.260
you don't go and check them again,

01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:07.220
you don't get into a fight.

01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:11.100
But three games later, you blade them in the shin.

01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:17.100
So the ability to defer and to handle it

01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:20.300
in whatever fashion one feels is appropriate.

01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:22.580
They're probably also friends in all those kinds of things

01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:25.940
that they respect each other, so he probably didn't.

01:59:25.940 --> 01:59:27.740
But there's a comedian instinct.

01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:32.740
I saw this, I was in an open mic here in Texas.

01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:35.620
I won't say where, there's many open mics.

01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:36.460
Have you gone to a few of these?

01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:37.500
These are pretty fun.

01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:42.500
No, so there is more sort of rougher kind of.

01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:46.460
Yeah, you've been hanging out in West Texas lately.

01:59:46.460 --> 01:59:47.500
Yeah, exactly.

01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:50.620
Austin's too tame for Lex, so he's headed to West Texas.

01:59:50.620 --> 01:59:53.220
Exactly, I put on a cowboy hat

01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:54.740
and instantly I became a cowboy.

01:59:54.740 --> 01:59:56.580
I've been talking like a cowboy.

01:59:56.580 --> 01:59:58.940
I mean, I belong out there in the desert.

01:59:58.940 --> 02:00:02.180
He's gone from eating meat and athletic greens

02:00:02.180 --> 02:00:04.060
to rattlesnakes, rattlesnake jerks.

02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:04.940
Rattlesnakes, exactly.

02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:08.460
No, there is a, open mic is late at night

02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:11.100
and I was one of the only people in the audience.

02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:15.340
There's a couple of drunk folks, a few drunk folks.

02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:20.300
One of them was a couple and like bikers,

02:00:20.300 --> 02:00:23.500
like with helmets and so on, a guy and a girl.

02:00:23.500 --> 02:00:27.460
And then the comedian, the open mic comedian

02:00:28.740 --> 02:00:31.780
did a joke about people who wear helmets.

02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:33.340
I don't know if it was on purpose or not,

02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:34.780
but he did the joke.

02:00:35.620 --> 02:00:38.940
And then the guy about women who wear helmets

02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:41.740
and the guy, it's this exact same situation.

02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:44.140
The guy stood up, walked up to him.

02:00:44.140 --> 02:00:44.980
There was no slap.

02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:46.340
It's so interesting because this happened

02:00:46.340 --> 02:00:47.900
before the Will Smith thing.

02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:51.140
So he walked up to the comedian

02:00:52.740 --> 02:00:54.380
and said he like,

02:00:57.500 --> 02:00:59.300
I think he like pointed his finger down

02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:01.380
and told him to stop or something like that

02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:02.940
and then sat down.

02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:05.580
This is an audience of like six people

02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:09.180
and at midnight around then there's nobody,

02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:10.500
no security, nothing.

02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:11.340
In Texas.

02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:12.180
In Texas.

02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:13.020
Which implies.

02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:16.220
And then this guy was the energy drunk,

02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:21.220
but also a biker and what he felt,

02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:25.660
his lady was now attacked by the comedian

02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:26.580
with his words.

02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:31.220
And the comedian was a kind of out of shape,

02:01:31.220 --> 02:01:32.900
small guy.

02:01:32.900 --> 02:01:34.940
So it's not threatening at all.

02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:37.140
And probably in trouble.

02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:39.220
And the comedian, after he sat down,

02:01:39.220 --> 02:01:41.340
he looked a little bit scared.

02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:43.620
He paced back and forth.

02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:47.580
And then he did the joke again.

02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:48.660
Wow.

02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:50.820
And I was sitting and I started,

02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:53.300
I leaned back and I just did this like,

02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:57.100
because that is comedy.

02:01:57.100 --> 02:02:00.620
And the guy was getting angrier and angrier

02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:02.900
and he just sat there.

02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:06.100
And the comedian went on for a couple more minutes

02:02:06.100 --> 02:02:09.300
and then did another bad joke,

02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:10.660
but another joke about him.

02:02:10.660 --> 02:02:12.700
It's just like he leaned into it.

02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:15.820
If you go to a small comedy club, open mic or otherwise,

02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:17.220
you're in the shooting gallery.

02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:21.900
Like you're basically there teed up as a pin to get it.

02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:24.340
We went and saw Andrew Scholes in San Francisco.

02:02:24.340 --> 02:02:25.180
In San Francisco?

02:02:25.180 --> 02:02:26.380
Yeah, it was hilarious.

02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:27.220
It was amazing.

02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:32.460
He's just masterful in his ability to command an audience.

02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:34.380
But I felt for the people up front,

02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:35.820
but no sympathy either,

02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:40.380
because you buy tickets to sit up front at a Scholes show,

02:02:40.380 --> 02:02:41.460
you're gonna get it.

02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:43.140
But he was very loving.

02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:43.980
Yeah.

02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:44.820
And funny.

02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:46.100
First of all, he's funny.

02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:48.300
The funniness really helps you,

02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:52.820
but the ethic of the comedian is like that fearlessness.

02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:56.780
What I really liked is like,

02:02:56.780 --> 02:02:58.940
the danger, there's risk to comedy,

02:02:58.940 --> 02:03:00.700
and there's also consequences.

02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:02.300
Have you watched that show,

02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:04.580
what is it, the Marvelous Miss Maisel show?

02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:05.820
It's really good.

02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:07.740
I watched a few of them.

02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:09.100
Guilty pleasure there.

02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:11.420
She plays a comic in the,

02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:14.940
I think it's the mid 1960s in New York.

02:03:14.940 --> 02:03:18.940
And there's a character that somewhat resembles Lenny Bruce.

02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:21.220
It's sort of meant to be Lenny Bruce.

02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:24.260
And they're always getting arrested and this kind of thing.

02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:25.620
I think I learned about it from Joe.

02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:27.140
Anyway, the writing's great.

02:03:27.140 --> 02:03:27.980
It's very funny.

02:03:29.260 --> 02:03:32.420
But yeah, comedy is designed to push boundaries, right?

02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:37.420
And to say the thing that people feel they can't say.

02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:39.460
Not something in science, right?

02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:40.460
Science, you're supposed to,

02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:43.340
etiquette is a big part of how you communicate ideas.

02:03:43.340 --> 02:03:46.300
It's about constraining communication.

02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:48.460
This is something, I mean, I confess on the podcast,

02:03:48.460 --> 02:03:52.500
in the goals of making it clear, interesting,

02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:54.500
surprising, and actionable,

02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:57.100
you have to constrain the amount

02:03:57.100 --> 02:03:58.420
and the style of information.

02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:01.260
Otherwise it becomes something else altogether, right?

02:04:02.820 --> 02:04:05.500
I saw Sandeep Prachai, Google CEO,

02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:08.660
said that he likes the thing you mentioned,

02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:11.980
not the Yoga Nidra, but the NSDR,

02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:15.060
non-sleep deep rest podcast, Over Meditation.

02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:17.020
I don't know if you saw that.

02:04:17.020 --> 02:04:17.940
Yeah, I saw that, yeah.

02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:19.500
Yeah.

02:04:19.500 --> 02:04:20.780
Why, what do you think that is?

02:04:20.780 --> 02:04:22.540
What do you think the difference is?

02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:24.660
Yeah, so non-sleep deep rest, NSDR,

02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:26.460
is an acronym that I coined

02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:28.460
because it encompasses a lot of practices

02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:31.220
that are not meditation per se,

02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:32.820
but that bring the brain and body

02:04:32.820 --> 02:04:34.980
into a state of relaxation and focus.

02:04:34.980 --> 02:04:37.100
So hypnosis is one variant of NSDR.

02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:38.580
There are other variants of NSDR.

02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:40.620
You can just look these up and you'll find them.

02:04:40.620 --> 02:04:42.460
And I think that they've caught on

02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:45.980
and that the CEO of Google

02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:49.620
is an avid practitioner of NSDR

02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:51.620
because it has this amazing ability

02:04:51.620 --> 02:04:53.980
to reset your energy levels and focus.

02:04:53.980 --> 02:04:57.460
Whereas with meditation, many people find meditation hard.

02:04:57.460 --> 02:04:58.940
And part of the reason they find it hard

02:04:58.940 --> 02:05:00.980
is that it requires focus.

02:05:00.980 --> 02:05:04.420
NSDR is a state which is very calm and relaxing.

02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:05.620
You don't have to work too hard.

02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:06.860
You're just listening to a script.

02:05:06.860 --> 02:05:09.020
Whereas most forms of meditation, not all,

02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:11.260
but most forms of meditation involve

02:05:11.260 --> 02:05:14.220
cranking up the activity in your prefrontal cortex

02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:16.660
and trying to see your thoughts

02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:18.060
as opposed to thinking your thoughts,

02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:20.220
or focus on your breath,

02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:23.340
but then third-personing yourself in some respect.

02:05:23.340 --> 02:05:24.180
And that's work.

02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:26.580
And so many people who meditate quite intensely

02:05:26.580 --> 02:05:28.260
feel more exhausted.

02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:30.180
Now, that doesn't mean that meditation

02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:31.620
doesn't have any utility,

02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:33.940
but it's distinctly different than NSDR.

02:05:33.940 --> 02:05:35.460
And I think that people are working,

02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:37.260
certainly the CEO of Google, I have to imagine,

02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:39.500
is working very hard and using his forebrain.

02:05:39.500 --> 02:05:42.220
If he's gonna have 20 or 30 minutes to take a break,

02:05:42.220 --> 02:05:44.420
he should, and I think this is what he's doing,

02:05:44.420 --> 02:05:46.940
he should go out for a jog and not listen to anything

02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:48.780
and just kind of let his mind wander,

02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:52.340
or sit there in a chair and just zone out or do NSDR.

02:05:52.340 --> 02:05:57.340
The problem is people are not that good at shifting states.

02:05:57.540 --> 02:05:59.300
We are all actually pretty good at,

02:05:59.300 --> 02:06:01.820
even people with severe ADHD,

02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:03.460
we had an episode about this,

02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:07.260
can become hyper-focused on things that they actually enjoy

02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:10.460
because dope and most of the drugs designed to treat ADHD

02:06:10.460 --> 02:06:12.660
are drugs that increase the levels of dopamine.

02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:13.500
So when you like something,

02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:15.300
there's dopamine release and you can focus.

02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:16.380
It's when you don't like something

02:06:16.380 --> 02:06:18.860
that's hard to focus, shifting states is hard.

02:06:18.860 --> 02:06:19.900
I'm sure you've experienced this

02:06:19.900 --> 02:06:21.460
if you've ever been in deep research

02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:22.660
or podcasting, podcasting,

02:06:22.660 --> 02:06:24.580
and then all of a sudden you go for a run,

02:06:24.580 --> 02:06:27.140
you probably spend the first third of that run thinking.

02:06:27.140 --> 02:06:28.420
And then in the middle third,

02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:30.860
you're kind of, that thinking is fractured a bit.

02:06:30.860 --> 02:06:32.100
And then in the final third

02:06:32.100 --> 02:06:34.280
is where you finally get to relax

02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:37.100
because the brain doesn't shift states very quickly.

02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:39.140
We can go from sleep to wakefulness quickly,

02:06:39.140 --> 02:06:41.700
we can go from wakefulness to sleep quickly,

02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:45.020
but we don't shift between different states of consciousness

02:06:45.020 --> 02:06:49.400
like a step function except in rare cases, right?

02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:50.420
Fear is one.

02:06:50.420 --> 02:06:51.980
All of a sudden we hear an explosion right now,

02:06:51.980 --> 02:06:52.860
it's a step function.

02:06:52.860 --> 02:06:55.640
We're in fear or we're in alertness, right?

02:06:57.020 --> 02:06:57.960
Heightened state of alertness.

02:06:57.960 --> 02:07:01.020
But NSDR is terrific at allowing people

02:07:01.020 --> 02:07:03.020
to learn to shift their state.

02:07:03.020 --> 02:07:05.500
And I actually would venture to argue that

02:07:07.420 --> 02:07:09.920
part of the value of meditation and exercise

02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:11.460
is the actual state that you get into

02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:13.400
in deep meditation or exercise.

02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:16.160
But just as valuable is the transition

02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:17.720
that you have to take yourself through

02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:20.960
from one state of mind to the other and then back again.

02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:23.960
When I look, David Goggins, he always seems to come up,

02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:25.960
because he represents so many important things,

02:07:25.960 --> 02:07:28.800
drive, determination, override of emotional state,

02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:31.600
going from being a 300 pound plus person

02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:32.800
to a fit person through,

02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:35.600
he's never revealed anything substantial

02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:36.800
about what he ate or what he didn't eat.

02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:39.800
He's basically says like, listen, run a lot, eat less, right?

02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:44.080
But what's remarkable is so much of what he says

02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:46.280
is about those transitions,

02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:49.000
about taking oneself from a state of, I don't want to,

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:52.360
to scruffing oneself and like, you're gonna do it anyway.

02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:55.440
And then being able to carry that into regular life,

02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:56.440
so to speak.

02:07:56.440 --> 02:08:00.160
So I think that NSDR is immensely powerful.

02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:01.280
It's zero cost.

02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:04.680
And one of the reasons I'm such a fan of people doing it

02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:08.240
is that most people don't stick to a meditation practice.

02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:09.400
There also been a few cases,

02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:10.320
you might find this interesting.

02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:13.120
There's a book by Scott Carney, I forget what it's called.

02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:15.240
I think it's called The Transcendence Trap or something.

02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:16.240
I'm gonna have that title wrong,

02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:20.120
but there have been a fair number of cases of people

02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:22.600
that go and do very extensive meditation,

02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:24.520
silent meditation retreats,

02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:28.080
who then return to normal life and end up killing themselves.

02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:31.360
There are states of mind inside of extended meditations

02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:34.040
or silent meditations that are very beneficial.

02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:37.040
And I'm certainly not suggesting people don't meditate,

02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:39.040
but I know at least one person who came back

02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:41.120
from one of these long extended meditation retreats

02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:43.720
and wasn't able to shift their state back

02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:45.680
into one that was functional in regular life.

02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:47.640
And that book includes a very dramatic story.

02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:51.000
I don't wanna give it away in case people check out the book,

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.360
but Scott told the story to me directly once,

02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:58.120
where someone feels they've reached enlightenment

02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:00.480
and then commit suicide.

02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:03.080
So these very unusual brain states

02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:06.320
are potentially hazardous if people can't return from them.

02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:11.040
So it's nice to focus not on those brain states,

02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:12.520
but instead on the shifting.

02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:13.600
Right, I do.

02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:15.240
This morning I woke up a little bit earlier

02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:16.080
than I would have liked.

02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:20.600
I use this Reveri app that's research-backed, r-e-v-r-i.com.

02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:23.360
There's a free version of it, or you can try it for free.

02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:24.760
So I feel comfortable. That's for hypnosis?

02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:27.760
For hypnosis, and I do a self-hypnosis

02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:29.120
to put me back into sleep.

02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:29.960
And if I can't sleep,

02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:31.960
just put me into a state of deep relaxation.

02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:35.280
I would put hypnosis under the category of NSDR,

02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:37.200
yoga nidra under the category of NSDR.

02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:39.480
There are now some NSDR scripts online

02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:42.080
if you just go to YouTube that you can just listen to.

02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:43.120
Do you like those?

02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:43.960
I do, yeah.

02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:45.360
I think the one from Made For is quite good.

02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:46.840
I have an affiliation with them, but it's free.

02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:48.520
So I feel comfortable mentioning it.

02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:50.840
I do, I really like the Reveri app.

02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:53.680
I can very, and the more you do them,

02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:55.000
the more quickly you can shift your brain

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:56.720
into a state of deep relaxation.

02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:00.600
I will sometimes stop mid-podcast if it's,

02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:02.440
sometimes our recordings go seven, eight hours,

02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:04.640
and I'll stop and I'll do a one-minute hypnosis.

02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:06.560
They have one-minute hypnosis inside Reveri.

02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:08.120
You're only going to,

02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:10.200
you're only going to find that one-minute hypnosis

02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:13.520
is effective if you are routinely doing 10

02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:16.960
and 15-minute hypnosis in addition to that.

02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:18.840
Meaning I do it every other day or so,

02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:19.680
a 10 or 15-minute hypnosis.

02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:22.960
So is there a YouTube one-minute hypnosis,

02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:23.800
or is this for the-

02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:25.440
There are, but inside of Reveri as well.

02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:26.560
You can find them online.

02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:27.400
A really good-

02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:28.560
Hold it up, sorry, guys, please.

02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:29.600
Yeah, so Reveri is good.

02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:32.960
And then Michael Seeley, S-E-A-L-E-Y,

02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:34.600
he has some long hypnosis scripts,

02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:36.440
but again, these are all free,

02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:39.240
and there's a lot of good research now

02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:40.440
on the neural networks,

02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:43.800
and it shifts your so-called default mode network.

02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:46.880
It shifts how much of your forebrain you're using,

02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:49.400
and it also is very, very good.

02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:51.840
I get so many questions about,

02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:53.080
hey, I'm really upset.

02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:55.880
I found out about my girlfriend's sexual past,

02:10:55.880 --> 02:10:57.120
or hey, I'm so upset.

02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:58.400
I found out that my boyfriend was cheating,

02:10:58.400 --> 02:10:59.960
or oh, so-and-so died.

02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:01.280
How do I get over these emotions?

02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:02.360
How do I deal with them?

02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:04.640
And hypnosis has shown to be very useful

02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:06.760
for people to learn to bring themselves

02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:08.600
into a state of deep relaxation,

02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:12.080
to literally project in their mind's eye

02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:15.400
these very intense things that they don't like,

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:17.960
and then for people to associate

02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:20.360
with other emotions in their body,

02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:23.640
to learn to be calm while feeling your feelings,

02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:26.880
to dissociate the mind-body communication to some extent.

02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:28.520
Just observe the feelings.

02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:30.360
Observe them and start to associate them

02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:31.840
with positive experiences.

02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:32.800
You're an Android guy,

02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:35.360
so soon it should be available on Android.

02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:36.720
Well, then it doesn't exist for me.

02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:37.560
Yeah, I know.

02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:38.400
It's only-

02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:39.240
You know, I don't get-

02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:40.840
Android is the device of the people,

02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:43.120
all you elitist people with your iPhones.

02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:44.520
Okay, but tell me this about Android.

02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:47.760
Now, you want to, this is the one thing that gets me.

02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:48.600
Yeah.

02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:49.440
Because I'm very close to someone

02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:50.760
who uses an Android phone.

02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:51.800
I feel like that-

02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:53.960
So you have great people in your life.

02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:54.800
That's good to know.

02:11:54.800 --> 02:11:56.760
No, their messages always look green to me,

02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:59.360
but I answer yours, despite that.

02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:02.280
But they, I feel like the Android phones

02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:03.520
are very trigger-happy.

02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:05.400
Like anything I touch does something,

02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:07.280
whereas the Apple phone is kind of built

02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:10.080
for like a macaque monkey to be able to operate,

02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:11.000
which is great for me,

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:12.520
because I'm more of a macaque monkey

02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:14.160
and you're a more sophisticated ape.

02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:15.880
Oh, I see, I see.

02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:16.880
I think like you have to be-

02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:17.720
They're more sensitive.

02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:18.720
Yeah, you have to have, you know,

02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:20.240
I mean, I've got fat fingers, you know?

02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:22.200
I've got clumsy fingers, you know, so.

02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:24.000
The Android is too,

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.480
well, maybe you need to soften your touch.

02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:29.480
What I would do is go into the sort by most popular,

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:32.160
because there's some older ones that I really like

02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:33.400
and it generally scales with that.

02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:35.520
So I'll do the, this one,

02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:38.920
the hypnosis for clearing subconscious negativity.

02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:40.040
That's an hour long one.

02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:41.840
The sleep and anxiety one, 40 minutes,

02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:44.080
but those you listen to as you fall asleep.

02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:44.920
As you fall asleep.

02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:45.760
Oh, we're gonna do this now?

02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:48.200
Yeah, yeah, let's listen to it.

02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:52.120
And I have created this hypnosis recording for you

02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:53.040
to help you-

02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:53.960
And this is the voice.

02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:55.880
How often does the voice pop up?

02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:57.120
And at the same time-

02:12:57.120 --> 02:12:58.240
You don't watch it.

02:12:58.240 --> 02:12:59.160
You just listen to it.

02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:00.320
Your anxiety.

02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:05.400
Now, one of the most important things

02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:07.400
to remember at the outset- It's a great voice.

02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:10.280
Of any self-hypnosis experience

02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:13.280
is to know and understand that hypnosis-

02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:16.880
People really should know that stage hypnosis

02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:18.560
is about the hypnotist getting you

02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:21.240
to do things you wouldn't normally do.

02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:23.400
Self-hypnosis, which is what we're talking about here,

02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:26.480
and this is about you getting your brain

02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:28.520
into the state that you want.

02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:32.080
And again, I mean, there's a ton of neuroimaging data

02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:34.280
and work on trauma and pain relief,

02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:36.960
and our labs are working on this with David Spiegel's lab.

02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:39.360
I really encourage people to explore NSDR,

02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:41.560
and if this feels a little too wacky and out there,

02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:44.640
then I would just put in NSDR into YouTube,

02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:46.480
and there's some good NSDR scripts.

02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:49.720
Yeah, by the way, Sondar is a fan of your podcast.

02:13:49.720 --> 02:13:50.920
No, it's okay, we don't need to play.

02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:52.240
Yeah, so I don't know him,

02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:56.280
but I would, yeah, a lot of media outlets

02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:58.880
picked up on his love of NSDR,

02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:00.520
and I have to imagine running Google

02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:02.880
involves a lot of juggling a lot of-

02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:05.560
He's one of the great CEOs because everybody loves him.

02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:06.560
Everybody loves him.

02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:07.560
Have you interviewed him?

02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:10.320
No, but we'll do the interview eventually.

02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:12.000
So it's this annoying thing

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.360
about me being a stickler for three hours.

02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:17.480
CEOs don't seem to understand,

02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:20.400
like, not understand, but it's scheduling.

02:14:20.400 --> 02:14:22.480
So what happens is Sondar said,

02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:23.640
yes, definitely, let's do it.

02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:26.080
I'm a fan of the podcast, I'm a fan of yours,

02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:29.960
and then it goes to his executive assistant,

02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:32.160
like, oh, let's find a slot.

02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:33.720
And then they immediately think,

02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:35.440
all right, well, one hour is good.

02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:36.400
45 minutes.

02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:37.240
90 minutes.

02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:38.080
By Zoom.

02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:39.320
90 minutes, yeah, right.

02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:42.160
Well, no, they know in person, I'm a stickler on that.

02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:45.160
But it's like, no, we need more,

02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:47.520
and it's so hard to-

02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:49.600
Do you still travel to do your podcast, or generally?

02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:52.320
No, most people come down here, most people.

02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:56.040
But for certain situations, obviously,

02:14:56.040 --> 02:14:57.720
like if you're in prison.

02:14:57.720 --> 02:14:58.560
Right.

02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:00.480
Or you're ahead of-

02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:01.880
Imagine if you get out on work for a little bit,

02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:03.800
people have anklets so that they can go

02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:05.840
to an Alex Fridman podcast, it'd probably happen.

02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:07.400
Have you ever been in a prison?

02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:09.360
No.

02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:13.240
Either a visitation or on the inside.

02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:15.480
From my hike, I can see San Quentin.

02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:17.360
It's really weird that San Quentin and Alcatraz,

02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:18.680
Bay Area, beautiful, everyone thinks,

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.240
like there's the Bay and there's Alcatraz

02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:22.560
and San Quentin sitting right there.

02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:23.720
Does that make you feel?

02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:27.640
It's amazing how easy it is to overlook that they're there

02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:28.480
and forget that they're there.

02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:31.720
But when I drive by San Quentin, I think about it.

02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:33.080
I also think about the people who are in there

02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:34.720
who might be innocent.

02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:38.200
I've seen some of those episodes on Rogan and elsewhere.

02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:40.120
Amanda Knox talks a lot about this, right?

02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:42.560
Whether or not you believe her story or not,

02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:44.400
I happen to believe her story,

02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:46.000
personally, based on what I know.

02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:48.840
You know, I'm sure there are people disagree with me.

02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:52.800
I think to myself, what it must be like to be in a cell

02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:55.360
and know in your heart's heart, you didn't do it.

02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:01.120
You know, I mean, I can't think of many things worse.

02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:02.800
I can't think of many things worse.

02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:05.240
That's so clearly unjust,

02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:09.520
but life is full of unjust things like this.

02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:12.520
Cruel things happen all the time.

02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:16.640
You lose a loved one for no good reason.

02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:17.880
You lose your job.

02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:21.680
You lose your home.

02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:24.520
Yeah, I've been talking to a lot of refugees now,

02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:27.040
and the war in Ukraine has really focused my mind

02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:29.400
to how much suffering there is in the world.

02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:32.200
And so just cruel things happen all the time.

02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:36.440
And people kind of, there's this suffering

02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:38.760
and you kind of go on.

02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:41.200
You stick to the people really close to you.

02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:44.440
There's still love all around you.

02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:46.840
Traumatic events kind of focus your mind

02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:50.800
on like very practical, like, okay,

02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:51.920
how do we solve the problem?

02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:52.800
How do we escape?

02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:56.920
Let's solve like survival, food, shelter, focus.

02:16:56.920 --> 02:16:59.360
Remember that book All's Quiet

02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:01.040
on the Western Front by World War I.

02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:01.880
There's this line in there.

02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:04.040
I forget what it is about how war

02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:06.120
is like the smell of a skunk.

02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:09.880
Like a little bit is actually a little bit is slightly,

02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:12.720
there's something slightly delicious of it

02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:15.040
is what it says in the book.

02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:16.840
I happen to like the smell of like ferrets

02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:17.680
and skunks and things.

02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:19.440
I had a pet ferret when I was a kid.

02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:21.600
And I like that musky scent.

02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:23.720
People, most people just, it's repulsive to them.

02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:25.560
It's actually a gene, believe it or not.

02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:26.960
Some people have the gene that makes

02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:29.360
that the musky scent repulsive.

02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:30.360
Some people love it.

02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:33.400
Let me ask you this, there's another gene.

02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:34.840
This is a fun one.

02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:37.240
Microwave popcorn, smells good, neutral,

02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:38.200
or disgusting to you?

02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:39.280
Good, very good.

02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:42.280
There are people who have a gene that leads them

02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:44.800
to the perception that the smell of microwave popcorn

02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:46.120
that you find is good.

02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:48.320
It smells like putrid vomit to them.

02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:51.120
It's a particular gene variant.

02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:52.520
And they can smell certain elements

02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:54.560
within the microwave popcorn.

02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:59.800
It's pretty, it's prominent in France, this gene.

02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:03.400
And so in laboratories where you have a lot

02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:05.200
of French people, it's often said like,

02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:06.600
you're not allowed to make microwave popcorn.

02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:09.400
It smells putrid, disgusting, you know?

02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:12.880
So a lot of it's in the perception of the beholder, right?

02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:19.440
But okay, before I leave the NSDR is focus in general.

02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:23.600
As you said, it's for shifting mind states.

02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:28.600
Is there advice you have for how to achieve focus on a task?

02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:31.200
Yes.

02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:32.520
First of all, we have to distinguish

02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:34.760
between modulators and mediators.

02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:36.680
And I'll do this very briefly.

02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:38.320
There are a lot of things that will modulate

02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:41.200
your state of focus, but they don't directly mediate

02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:42.120
your sense of focus.

02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:44.960
So for instance, if right now a fire alarm went off

02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:48.040
in this building, it would modulate our attention.

02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:49.000
We would get up and leave.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:50.440
It would be very hard to do what we're doing

02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:53.200
with that banging in the background, at least at first.

02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:58.320
So it's modulating focus, but it's not really involved

02:18:58.320 --> 02:19:00.120
in the mechanisms of focus, right?

02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:04.440
In the same way, being well-rested when you sleep,

02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:06.560
your autonomic nervous system that adjusts states

02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:09.120
of alertness and focus and calm works better

02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:10.560
than when you're sleep deprived.

02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:12.560
So if you're sleeping better, you're gonna focus better.

02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:15.760
So I always answer this way to a question like this,

02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:18.440
because the best thing that anyone can do

02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:20.640
for their mental health, physical health and performance

02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:23.360
in athletic or cognitive endeavors or creative endeavors

02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:26.880
is to make sure that you're getting enough quality sleep,

02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:28.360
enough of the time for you.

02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:29.200
And that's gonna differ.

02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:30.400
We could talk about what that means.

02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:33.360
Now, in terms of things that mediate focus,

02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:35.120
without getting into description of mechanisms,

02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:36.920
because we have podcasts about that,

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:42.040
it's very clear that mental focus follows visual focus,

02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:43.920
provided that you're a sighted person.

02:19:45.160 --> 02:19:47.680
Much of the training that's being done now in China

02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:49.560
to teach kids to focus better,

02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:52.960
literally has them stare at a target,

02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:55.720
blinking every so often, but really training themselves

02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:59.480
to breathe calmly and maintain a tight visual aperture.

02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:03.240
When you read, you have to maintain a tight visual aperture.

02:20:03.240 --> 02:20:04.960
You're literally scrolling like a highlighter

02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:06.600
in your mind's eye, right?

02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:08.160
It's kind of obvious once you hear it.

02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:10.920
So for people that have problems focusing sleep well,

02:20:12.760 --> 02:20:17.040
learn to dilate and contract your visual field consciously.

02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:19.640
This can be done if you practice it a little bit.

02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:21.440
And then as I said before,

02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:23.320
it is very hard to get into a state of focus

02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:26.000
like a step function immediately, like snapping your fingers.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.280
What you can do is you can pick any object,

02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:31.560
but ideally an object at roughly the same distance,

02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:32.920
placed at roughly the same distance

02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:35.840
to which you're going to do that work and stare at it.

02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:37.120
You're allowed to blink.

02:20:37.120 --> 02:20:39.480
And as your mind starts to drift every once in a while

02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:40.960
to understand that's normal,

02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:43.400
but try and narrow your visual aperture

02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:46.000
and bring that into your visual field

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:47.440
so that that's the most prominent thing,

02:20:47.440 --> 02:20:49.320
kind of like portrait mode in your phone.

02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:51.000
This would look very different in portrait mode

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.560
than it would in just a standard photograph mode.

02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:57.160
And then after doing that for 30 to 60 seconds,

02:20:57.160 --> 02:20:58.880
moving into the work that you're about to do

02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:01.280
and really encourage yourself to do that.

02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:03.480
If you're somebody who's low vision or no vision,

02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:05.160
you're going to use your ears to do this.

02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:08.400
Braille readers have trouble focusing sometimes

02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:11.680
because they feel other stuff and they hear other stuff.

02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:15.160
So you learn to adjust that aperture consciously.

02:21:15.160 --> 02:21:17.480
And then of course the pharmacologic tools,

02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:20.800
just enough caffeine, but not too much, right?

02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:22.440
We've talked about white noise, brown noise,

02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:24.720
music or no music, really varies,

02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:28.840
but it's very clear that binaural beats of 40 Hertz

02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:31.320
can shift the brain into a heightened state

02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:32.600
of focus and cognition.

02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:34.040
So if you're going to use binaural beats,

02:21:34.040 --> 02:21:37.080
which should definitely be used with headphones

02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:40.000
and there are a number of free apps out there in sources,

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:43.200
40 Hertz seems to be the frequency

02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:45.760
that best supports the brain shifting

02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:46.600
into a particular mode of focus.

02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:49.600
So can you give us some binaural beats?

02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:51.040
Yeah, so you're going to look for,

02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:54.920
you'd want to find an app that offers 40 Hertz.

02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:59.920
I think BrainWave allows you to slide bar

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.520
up to the particular frequency that you want.

02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:05.240
And I should say that there are other frequencies

02:22:05.240 --> 02:22:08.000
that are interesting, but 40 Hertz binaural beat

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.600
seems to be the one that there's the most quality

02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:11.440
research on.

02:22:11.440 --> 02:22:14.920
So it's like a beat, but you're saying

02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:18.680
there's a lot of mixed science on the white noise

02:22:18.680 --> 02:22:19.520
and brown noise.

02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:21.560
You really should be doing this with headphones

02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:23.160
because binaural beats are best accomplished

02:22:23.160 --> 02:22:26.200
by feeding two different frequencies to the two ears.

02:22:26.200 --> 02:22:28.200
And then you have what's called this brainstem area

02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:30.280
that reads out what are called interaural time differences

02:22:30.280 --> 02:22:33.160
and then it extracts the delta essentially.

02:22:33.160 --> 02:22:34.000
Turn it up.

02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:41.280
And then in other things that can enhance focus.

02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:44.120
So the pharmacology around this is pretty interesting.

02:22:44.120 --> 02:22:45.640
Things that tickle the dopamine pathway

02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:47.680
and the acetylcholine pathway, they work.

02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:50.920
There's your ritalin, your aderals, your modafinils,

02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:51.880
which are prescription.

02:22:51.880 --> 02:22:54.160
And there's a lot of non-prescription use

02:22:54.160 --> 02:22:55.720
of those prescription drugs.

02:22:55.720 --> 02:22:57.440
Not so much in my generation,

02:22:57.440 --> 02:22:59.520
but in people 35 and younger.

02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:03.200
I hear all the time from day traders and programmers

02:23:03.200 --> 02:23:04.760
and stuff and kids that play video games,

02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:07.040
a lot of ritalin aderall use.

02:23:07.040 --> 02:23:08.960
I think that unless it's prescribed by a doctor

02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:10.840
for its specific purpose of ADHD,

02:23:10.840 --> 02:23:13.000
I don't think people should go that route, frankly.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.040
Hits the dopamine system way too hard.

02:23:15.040 --> 02:23:19.640
Also has a number of negative effects on sexual side effects,

02:23:19.640 --> 02:23:21.560
all sorts of things that you just wouldn't want.

02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:25.000
There are a few compounds like alpha GPC,

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.760
300 milligrams to 600 milligrams of alpha GPC

02:23:27.760 --> 02:23:28.960
with a cup of espresso.

02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:32.720
If you're well rested, you're like a laser for 90 minutes,

02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:35.240
maybe two hours, but then it's gonna taper off

02:23:35.240 --> 02:23:37.040
and you have to just recognize that.

02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:39.840
And then there's this whole world of nootropics now

02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:43.240
and people trying to figure out the racetams, paracetams

02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:45.560
and phenolphthaleamine combined with this.

02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:48.360
And it's not quite in the place where you'd like it to be.

02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:49.200
There are a few companies

02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:50.480
that are doing this better than others.

02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:51.960
We talk about some of these on the podcast,

02:23:51.960 --> 02:23:55.240
but I would always start with behavioral tools

02:23:55.240 --> 02:23:57.400
and then consider pharmacology.

02:23:57.400 --> 02:24:00.600
And then I suppose the other thing for focus

02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:03.120
is this is a little more esoteric,

02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:06.280
but we cover this in an episode on workplace optimization.

02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:09.960
Where you place your screen is important.

02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:12.840
Staring down at a screen is not going to be as effective

02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:15.120
as placing it at eye level or above you.

02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:16.200
When the eyes are up,

02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:18.660
literally when your eyes are directed forward or up,

02:24:18.660 --> 02:24:21.020
the brainstem centers for alertness are activated.

02:24:21.020 --> 02:24:22.260
When your eyes are down,

02:24:22.260 --> 02:24:24.180
it's actually you're sort of,

02:24:24.180 --> 02:24:25.860
it's like being pulled underwater a little bit

02:24:25.860 --> 02:24:27.780
in the autonomic arousal sense.

02:24:27.780 --> 02:24:32.460
It's you're closing your eyes is one,

02:24:32.460 --> 02:24:35.380
it reflects the brainstem centers that are active

02:24:35.380 --> 02:24:38.220
becoming less or for alertness, excuse me,

02:24:38.220 --> 02:24:39.860
becoming less active.

02:24:39.860 --> 02:24:41.020
But there's a really cool effect

02:24:41.020 --> 02:24:42.580
that's active in this room right now,

02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:45.260
which is that there've been some really interesting studies

02:24:45.260 --> 02:24:48.140
that when people work in small compact spaces

02:24:48.180 --> 02:24:49.780
or wear a hoodie or a hat,

02:24:49.780 --> 02:24:53.340
that can also improve focus like blinders on a horse

02:24:53.340 --> 02:24:55.660
for obvious reasons now based on what I said before,

02:24:55.660 --> 02:24:59.660
but also analytic work or the kind of work

02:24:59.660 --> 02:25:02.260
where there's a correct answer that you're seeking

02:25:02.260 --> 02:25:05.500
is best supported by these kind of low ceiling environments.

02:25:05.500 --> 02:25:07.940
Whereas there's something called the cathedral effect,

02:25:07.940 --> 02:25:09.820
which is when you work in an outdoor environment

02:25:09.820 --> 02:25:11.180
or a high ceiling environment,

02:25:11.180 --> 02:25:14.700
it lends itself to kind of pun intended,

02:25:14.700 --> 02:25:17.620
kind of loftier ideas and more creativity.

02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:19.180
And that probably has to do with the fact

02:25:19.180 --> 02:25:21.300
that there's a natural tendency, a reflex,

02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:23.220
to expand your visual field

02:25:23.220 --> 02:25:25.140
in these high ceiling environments.

02:25:26.260 --> 02:25:28.500
Expansion of the visual field

02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:31.820
changes the way the brain works in the time domain.

02:25:31.820 --> 02:25:35.100
Your engineering and biology oriented listeners

02:25:35.100 --> 02:25:37.700
will understand this and music.

02:25:37.700 --> 02:25:39.940
For those that don't, the best way to think about it

02:25:39.940 --> 02:25:42.820
is when you have a narrow focus, portrait mode on your phone

02:25:42.820 --> 02:25:47.540
or you're very alert, you are fine slicing life in time.

02:25:48.540 --> 02:25:50.660
Think of it as a high frame rate,

02:25:50.660 --> 02:25:52.740
like you're shooting in slow motion.

02:25:52.740 --> 02:25:55.980
When you have a, when you dial it your view,

02:25:55.980 --> 02:25:57.980
you're taking bigger time bins.

02:25:57.980 --> 02:26:00.980
And that one way to just let this hopefully land home

02:26:00.980 --> 02:26:04.540
is that if you've ever had a really exciting day

02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:08.260
or podcast interview or experience of any kind,

02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:11.500
your system is flooded with dopamine and norepinephrine,

02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:13.780
alertness and motivation, all this excitement.

02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:15.860
It seems like it goes by very, very fast.

02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:17.540
And yet when you think back to that,

02:26:17.540 --> 02:26:19.820
it seems like a lot happened.

02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:20.860
This happened and that happened.

02:26:20.860 --> 02:26:23.180
Now think about waiting in the doctor's office

02:26:23.180 --> 02:26:26.740
in a blank waiting room with no interesting art on the walls.

02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:29.060
It feels like it goes by very, very slow.

02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:31.860
Dopamine and norepinephrine are all time low.

02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:33.940
And yet when you think back on that experience,

02:26:33.940 --> 02:26:35.380
it's as if nothing happened

02:26:35.380 --> 02:26:39.220
because you were parsing time differently.

02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:41.220
So those are roughly the tools

02:26:41.220 --> 02:26:43.700
and the neurochemicals around time perception

02:26:43.700 --> 02:26:44.900
and the time domain.

02:26:44.900 --> 02:26:45.740
There's a wonderful book

02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:48.180
it's so wonderful I forget the title

02:26:48.180 --> 02:26:51.140
by Dean Buotomano from UCLA.

02:26:51.140 --> 02:26:53.420
I think it's called The Brain is a Time Machine

02:26:53.420 --> 02:26:56.100
that talks about this expansion and contraction

02:26:56.100 --> 02:26:58.860
of the time domain and what you can do to leverage it

02:26:58.860 --> 02:27:01.020
for work and creativity focus.

02:27:01.020 --> 02:27:03.700
Yeah, it's fascinating that I think one way

02:27:03.700 --> 02:27:07.700
to define focus for me is the experience,

02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:11.460
the feeling of focus is losing track of time,

02:27:11.460 --> 02:27:14.100
is getting to a place where you're no longer up

02:27:15.740 --> 02:27:17.980
operating in time.

02:27:17.980 --> 02:27:20.820
Well, and you mentioned being kind of cramming

02:27:20.820 --> 02:27:24.140
for something where you'll release a lot of adrenaline

02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:27.660
and it is true you can get a lot done under pressure

02:27:27.660 --> 02:27:29.940
because of the way that you're slicing time.

02:27:29.940 --> 02:27:32.060
You don't actually have more time.

02:27:32.060 --> 02:27:34.020
It's that you're finally in a brain state

02:27:34.020 --> 02:27:36.860
that lends itself well to parsing information

02:27:36.860 --> 02:27:37.700
really quickly.

02:27:37.700 --> 02:27:40.100
Now, if we ramp up your level of stress enough,

02:27:40.100 --> 02:27:44.380
it's definitely, it's a more or less normal distribution.

02:27:44.380 --> 02:27:45.460
We get you stressed enough,

02:27:45.460 --> 02:27:46.500
it's hard to remember anything,

02:27:46.500 --> 02:27:47.580
you're not parsing time well.

02:27:47.580 --> 02:27:49.140
But in that middle range,

02:27:49.140 --> 02:27:50.900
almost every study shows that the higher levels

02:27:50.900 --> 02:27:53.060
of autonomic arousal, meaning norepinephrine,

02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:54.700
adrenaline in your system,

02:27:54.700 --> 02:27:57.540
the more effective you are at things.

02:27:57.540 --> 02:27:59.700
And we always hear stress and adrenaline,

02:27:59.700 --> 02:28:00.780
it's just bad, bad, bad.

02:28:00.780 --> 02:28:02.540
But my colleague Ali Krum at Stanford

02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:04.220
has done these beautiful studies where

02:28:04.220 --> 02:28:07.180
if you just educate people on how adrenaline

02:28:07.180 --> 02:28:10.060
makes them sharper thinkers,

02:28:10.060 --> 02:28:11.460
they become sharper thinkers.

02:28:11.460 --> 02:28:13.260
If you educate them on the fact that stress

02:28:13.260 --> 02:28:14.980
makes your cognition worse,

02:28:14.980 --> 02:28:16.700
their cognition gets worse.

02:28:16.700 --> 02:28:18.300
This is why I don't wear a sleep tracker.

02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:19.700
If you tell people they slept poorly,

02:28:19.700 --> 02:28:21.340
your recovery score sucks,

02:28:21.340 --> 02:28:23.900
they naturally perform less well the next day

02:28:23.900 --> 02:28:26.660
than if you tell them your recovery score is high.

02:28:26.660 --> 02:28:28.740
And so I don't have anything against those companies,

02:28:28.740 --> 02:28:31.460
but I, in fact, we use some of their technology,

02:28:31.460 --> 02:28:32.980
can be very useful in certain contexts,

02:28:32.980 --> 02:28:37.740
but you want to determine your mindset around these things.

02:28:37.740 --> 02:28:38.580
And if you tell yourself,

02:28:38.580 --> 02:28:40.660
hey, deadlines make me sharp,

02:28:40.660 --> 02:28:43.420
pressure makes me sharp, you will perform better.

02:28:43.420 --> 02:28:45.060
So stress and anxiety,

02:28:47.620 --> 02:28:48.540
what is that?

02:28:48.540 --> 02:28:51.180
And can it be leveraged for good?

02:28:51.180 --> 02:28:53.260
Absolutely, stress and, look,

02:28:53.260 --> 02:28:55.020
whether or not you get into a cold ice bath

02:28:55.020 --> 02:28:58.060
or a hot sauna so hot you want to get out,

02:28:58.060 --> 02:29:02.620
or you get hit square in the face with something over text

02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:05.620
that you really didn't want to hear or see,

02:29:05.620 --> 02:29:07.780
it's adrenaline, it's just adrenaline.

02:29:07.780 --> 02:29:09.660
And so your subjective readout of that

02:29:09.660 --> 02:29:11.620
and what it means is really important.

02:29:11.620 --> 02:29:13.060
And you can just channel that.

02:29:13.060 --> 02:29:14.060
Well, you can.

02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:17.140
If you agree with the following statement,

02:29:17.140 --> 02:29:18.780
which I do, and many people do,

02:29:18.780 --> 02:29:20.060
because the data support it,

02:29:20.060 --> 02:29:22.340
which is Ali Krum's statement, not mine,

02:29:22.340 --> 02:29:24.740
which is she directs the mind body lab at Stanford.

02:29:24.740 --> 02:29:27.300
She's brilliant, by the way, brilliant Harvard trained,

02:29:27.300 --> 02:29:30.300
Yale trained, trained licensed clinical psychologist,

02:29:30.300 --> 02:29:31.500
also tenure professor at Stanford.

02:29:31.500 --> 02:29:34.940
She's an Olympian, no, excuse me,

02:29:34.940 --> 02:29:39.500
a division one athlete in gymnastics and martial arts

02:29:39.500 --> 02:29:42.340
and her dad is a longtime martial arts trainer,

02:29:42.340 --> 02:29:43.580
he's done work with special forces

02:29:43.580 --> 02:29:45.660
and he's an amazing human being and a very humble,

02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:50.300
very kind, lovely woman and professor, scientist.

02:29:50.300 --> 02:29:53.340
She says, anything that you do and experience,

02:29:53.340 --> 02:29:58.340
but especially stress, is the consequence of that thing

02:29:58.340 --> 02:30:01.020
and what you believe about that thing.

02:30:01.020 --> 02:30:04.140
And so if you consume a lot of information

02:30:04.140 --> 02:30:06.580
about the powers of stressful states

02:30:06.580 --> 02:30:09.140
to bring out your best, you will perform better.

02:30:09.140 --> 02:30:10.660
If you consume a lot of information

02:30:10.660 --> 02:30:13.140
about the power of stress to cripple you,

02:30:13.140 --> 02:30:15.260
you will perform worse.

02:30:15.260 --> 02:30:18.460
There's absolutely no question, the data are striking

02:30:18.460 --> 02:30:20.500
and this is not growth mindset.

02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:22.540
This is just simply what sorts of,

02:30:22.540 --> 02:30:25.020
what do you believe about stress based on

02:30:25.020 --> 02:30:28.940
the dominant knowledge that you're consuming about it?

02:30:28.940 --> 02:30:31.660
So that's why it's fun to watch David Goggins,

02:30:31.660 --> 02:30:35.060
here we go again, David or Jocko or Joe or someone put,

02:30:35.060 --> 02:30:37.660
or Kam Haines, you know, put out this information about,

02:30:37.700 --> 02:30:39.580
or Ryan Hall who ran for Stanford

02:30:39.580 --> 02:30:41.500
and then now is like into the powerlifting thing

02:30:41.500 --> 02:30:45.020
and running, you know, and there are others too, of course.

02:30:45.020 --> 02:30:48.300
When you start to consume a lot of that information,

02:30:48.300 --> 02:30:51.580
it's not just inspiring, it actually changes your perception

02:30:51.580 --> 02:30:53.740
of what your own stressful states mean.

02:30:54.940 --> 02:30:56.900
You can actually get better from stress

02:30:56.900 --> 02:31:00.980
if you're in the ocean of knowledge that stress grows you.

02:31:00.980 --> 02:31:03.780
If you're living in the ocean of knowledge,

02:31:03.780 --> 02:31:05.540
I was thinking like a pool in the summer,

02:31:05.540 --> 02:31:07.860
you got the kiddie pool, the kids all peeing in it,

02:31:07.860 --> 02:31:09.580
presumably, you got the diving thing,

02:31:09.580 --> 02:31:10.620
you got the high dive and all that.

02:31:10.620 --> 02:31:13.940
If you believe that the experience of belly flopping

02:31:13.940 --> 02:31:17.060
off the high dive is gonna make you a better diver,

02:31:17.060 --> 02:31:20.620
in some sense, at least in this analogy, it will.

02:31:20.620 --> 02:31:22.940
Whereas if you feel that it's just the most embarrassing

02:31:22.940 --> 02:31:25.500
thing ever and it's gonna cripple your ability

02:31:25.500 --> 02:31:28.780
to get out in the dive in front of anybody ever again,

02:31:28.780 --> 02:31:31.180
well, you're right about that too.

02:31:31.180 --> 02:31:34.180
Yeah, we actually talked with Carl about depression

02:31:34.180 --> 02:31:38.820
and all those kinds of things that there could be these,

02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:41.580
what are commonly seen as negative journeys

02:31:41.580 --> 02:31:46.300
that could be, when reframed, can be used.

02:31:46.300 --> 02:31:48.140
One of the reasons I enjoy our friendship so much

02:31:48.140 --> 02:31:50.460
is that you bring this Russian thing,

02:31:50.460 --> 02:31:52.820
which I don't really understand it at a deep level,

02:31:52.820 --> 02:31:54.060
how could I, I'm not Russian,

02:31:54.060 --> 02:31:58.660
but this mindset that there's pain in life.

02:31:58.660 --> 02:32:02.220
When I watched that Hedgehog in the Fog cartoon,

02:32:02.220 --> 02:32:05.100
I thought, no wonder Russians call it the way they do.

02:32:05.100 --> 02:32:06.820
This is the most, it's so sad.

02:32:06.820 --> 02:32:08.780
It's beautiful in Sabbath, so sad.

02:32:08.780 --> 02:32:11.100
Whereas out here, it's like Sesame Street

02:32:11.100 --> 02:32:13.940
and my mother would not let me watch Sesame Street

02:32:13.940 --> 02:32:15.020
when I was a kid.

02:32:15.020 --> 02:32:17.060
She thought it was too chaotic.

02:32:17.060 --> 02:32:17.900
Too chaotic.

02:32:17.900 --> 02:32:19.700
Too chaotic, she was like, it's too chaotic.

02:32:19.700 --> 02:32:20.540
Too many things going on.

02:32:20.540 --> 02:32:22.180
Captain Kangaroo, we were allowed

02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:24.260
and then Mr. Rogers, we were allowed.

02:32:24.260 --> 02:32:25.420
I never really liked shows.

02:32:25.420 --> 02:32:28.340
I liked doing things outside in the yard.

02:32:29.340 --> 02:32:30.700
I was trying to trap all the animals.

02:32:30.700 --> 02:32:32.100
I didn't wanna watch stuff on TV,

02:32:32.940 --> 02:32:35.420
but Hedgehog in the Fog is enough to turn any kid

02:32:35.420 --> 02:32:38.860
into a thinker and a philosopher and a poet.

02:32:38.860 --> 02:32:40.260
Here we go.

02:32:40.260 --> 02:32:42.260
I fell in love with this when you showed,

02:32:42.260 --> 02:32:44.540
look, it even walks with its arms behind its back.

02:32:44.540 --> 02:32:45.780
So for people who don't know

02:32:45.780 --> 02:32:48.820
and we're watching little clips here to get into,

02:32:48.820 --> 02:32:53.820
and it's a Hedgehog that is wandering about

02:32:54.220 --> 02:32:57.780
in this fog at night and-

02:32:57.780 --> 02:32:59.340
Can't even see a lamp.

02:32:59.340 --> 02:33:00.900
The fog is so dense.

02:33:00.900 --> 02:33:03.540
There's a feeling of searching.

02:33:03.540 --> 02:33:08.180
And then there's a horse that speaks from a distance,

02:33:08.180 --> 02:33:09.100
words of wisdom.

02:33:09.100 --> 02:33:10.660
Some people actually told me

02:33:10.660 --> 02:33:14.460
that they believe that's God that's supposed to represent.

02:33:14.460 --> 02:33:18.860
God, I always thought was a motherly voice or a voice,

02:33:18.860 --> 02:33:23.220
a voice of conformity that wants you to return to safety.

02:33:23.220 --> 02:33:27.180
And here's the Hedgehog is searching

02:33:27.180 --> 02:33:31.060
for something that's in him for the unknown,

02:33:31.060 --> 02:33:32.860
to explore the unknown.

02:33:32.860 --> 02:33:37.860
And ultimately, as the cartoon unrolls,

02:33:39.860 --> 02:33:43.480
he discovers a friend in a bear,

02:33:43.480 --> 02:33:46.140
and he also discovers a lifetime passion

02:33:46.140 --> 02:33:47.820
for looking up at the stars

02:33:47.820 --> 02:33:50.780
and the curiosity of exploring what is up there.

02:33:50.780 --> 02:33:55.460
And I see that as science, as exploring the mystery.

02:33:55.500 --> 02:33:59.100
And also I see that as brave to explore the mystery,

02:33:59.100 --> 02:34:01.900
given all the uncertainty all around you.

02:34:01.900 --> 02:34:04.540
But there is a melancholy, the whole sound of it,

02:34:04.540 --> 02:34:06.100
the feel of it, the look of it.

02:34:08.260 --> 02:34:12.140
It just captures both the melancholy

02:34:12.140 --> 02:34:14.660
and the wonder of childhood,

02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:17.740
which is like there's a loneliness to it.

02:34:17.740 --> 02:34:19.760
Like nobody understands me.

02:34:20.600 --> 02:34:25.600
And that's there, that children can feel,

02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:27.160
because you're trying to figure out-

02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:28.600
That's my favorite character right there.

02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:31.000
I love the owl, I love the owl.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.040
The owl shows up every once in a while, I love the owl.

02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:35.200
Sorry, I interrupted you.

02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:36.020
Again.

02:34:36.020 --> 02:34:37.080
There's non sequitur,

02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:39.560
it means you're interested 70% of the time.

02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:41.760
The other 30%, you're just an asshole.

02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:43.160
So you have to figure out-

02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:44.000
So I'm told.

02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:47.280
There's non sequitur parts in this cartoon.

02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:49.960
It's voted as one of the greatest cartoons of all time,

02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:52.840
short little films, documentary filmmakers.

02:34:52.840 --> 02:34:56.480
So it is, you know, in the Soviet Union,

02:34:56.480 --> 02:35:01.280
in a lot of sort of authoritarian regimes,

02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:07.160
there's channels to communicate difficult ideas to people

02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:09.880
and you figure out those channels and in the Soviet Union,

02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:13.520
one of those channels was children's cartoons.

02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:16.400
So you're actually there very much for adults.

02:35:17.240 --> 02:35:21.000
I like that in some countries, not so much in the US,

02:35:22.300 --> 02:35:24.420
children are treated with more respect

02:35:24.420 --> 02:35:29.100
for their intelligence and not constantly getting

02:35:29.100 --> 02:35:32.480
this drivel of just kind of moronic explosions

02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:37.280
and whistles and bells and the voices that just kind of,

02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:39.680
children obviously are children and need to be,

02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:41.200
their brains are young and plastic

02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:45.240
and need to be treated and nurtured as such,

02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:48.600
but they have an intelligence.

02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:51.600
And I think that you treat them like morons

02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:53.840
and they're gonna behave like morons.

02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:58.560
You treat them as people who can consume information

02:35:58.560 --> 02:36:00.680
and make sense of it in their own way

02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:02.560
and that's what they're gonna do.

02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:05.280
They have a seriousness of looking at the world.

02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:10.080
I love people that talk with children like they're adults.

02:36:10.080 --> 02:36:13.640
Well, like here's if you're talking to Minnie Einstein

02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:16.000
because you're like really,

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.720
they're asking some big questions and I think,

02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:23.240
I mean people sometimes speak of me in this way,

02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:26.200
like how dumb is this childlike person?

02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:28.280
But like no, there's intelligence

02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:32.360
in these dumb simple questions that a child asks

02:36:32.360 --> 02:36:35.440
and I always love those questions, the simplicity,

02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:39.000
but also the depth of those questions.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.920
The reason I started watching your podcast

02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:45.400
was you did an episode early on with Ray Dalio

02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:47.880
and the first, maybe the first,

02:36:47.880 --> 02:36:50.000
but a question that you definitely asked him

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:53.320
was you just said, what is money?

02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:54.720
And his answer was fantastic.

02:36:54.720 --> 02:36:58.800
It's a superb question and he gave a superb answer

02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:02.520
and I never would have thought to ask that question.

02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:05.000
But it's the question and it was the question

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:06.280
to tee things off with.

02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:10.520
So simple questions that get right

02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:12.400
to the heart of the matter.

02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:16.680
And kids aren't often putting the same cultural filters

02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:21.080
and kids generally aren't concerned

02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:23.320
about getting canceled either.

02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:24.800
So they'll ask the question

02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:26.080
that no one else is willing to ask.

02:37:26.080 --> 02:37:30.360
And they're not concerned about how dumb the question sounds.

02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:31.800
I find the most fascinating questions

02:37:31.800 --> 02:37:33.560
is just really, really simple.

02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:37.800
And it is a bit embarrassing to ask those simple questions

02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:40.480
of like, what is anything?

02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:43.800
You're asking them for all of us, so please ask them.

02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:46.800
I think that question, what is money, is crucial

02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:48.880
and I think the simple questions

02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:51.120
are the most, obviously, the most interesting.

02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:53.480
I gotta ask you about, you had awesome podcasts.

02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:54.600
I mean, I can ask you questions

02:37:54.600 --> 02:37:55.840
about basically all your podcasts.

02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:57.480
People should definitely listen to the Huberman Lab,

02:37:57.480 --> 02:38:00.960
but with Andy Gap and the conversation,

02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:02.640
you talked about strength and muscle building

02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:03.600
and all that kind of stuff.

02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:04.840
He's an encyclopedia.

02:38:04.840 --> 02:38:05.680
Yeah.

02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:08.440
And he also works with a lot of UFC fighters

02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:11.720
and he works with, he has a lab that includes a gym.

02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:14.520
And so he works on endurance and powerlifting

02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:16.400
and also hypertrophy training, et cetera,

02:38:16.400 --> 02:38:19.160
but he also does muscle biopsy.

02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:21.360
So he runs the full spectrum

02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:23.800
and he's a full tenured professor

02:38:23.800 --> 02:38:25.680
and he does all this stuff.

02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:29.080
So he's a really unique person

02:38:29.080 --> 02:38:31.120
in this whole fitness landscape

02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:33.000
because there are a lot of PTs out there.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:34.520
There are a lot of kinesiologists.

02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:36.680
There are a lot of people studying nutrition

02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:37.520
and sports training.

02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:40.320
But I think he has the, among the people out there,

02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:42.760
he's at least in the top five,

02:38:42.760 --> 02:38:44.800
probably within the top three,

02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:46.840
of people that really have their arms around

02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:50.640
the full extent of what's possible with training.

02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:53.480
And he works with the UFC Performance Center.

02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:55.640
Well, I mean, he's just at a very systematic way

02:38:55.640 --> 02:38:56.480
of describing things.

02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:00.320
There was really nice skill, speed,

02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:03.120
power, strength, hypertrophy,

02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:06.680
so muscle mass, endurance, all kinds of,

02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:08.960
and then the philosophical of adaptation,

02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:11.040
how to overload stuff, all that very,

02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:14.680
is there stuff, I'll ask you about ice bath and sauna,

02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:16.680
which was surprising to me there.

02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:20.280
Is there stuff you took away from that conversation,

02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:25.960
like principles about how to get strong,

02:39:25.960 --> 02:39:28.040
how to build muscle mass,

02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:32.400
that broadened and deepened your understanding of that task?

02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:34.280
Definitely, and I'll do these in bullet points,

02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:36.120
because if people want the logic behind them

02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:37.920
and the mechanism, they can listen to that episode.

02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:39.200
Yeah, it's a really good episode.

02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:40.800
I'll start with heat and cold really quickly,

02:39:40.800 --> 02:39:44.040
and just say that avoid cold immersion,

02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:47.800
so ice baths and being in cold water up to the neck,

02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:50.200
uncomfortably cold, within the four hours

02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:53.800
after a training session that's designed

02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:55.080
to evoke an adaptation,

02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:57.480
either endurance, hypertrophy, or strength,

02:39:57.480 --> 02:39:59.920
because the inflammation that you experience

02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:01.440
from a hard endurance workout,

02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:04.200
or from a hard strength or a hard hypertrophy workout,

02:40:04.200 --> 02:40:07.200
is the stimulus that you're going to adapt to.

02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:10.120
The cold water immersion reduces inflammation

02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:12.880
and can short circuit some of that.

02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:14.560
After four hours, you're probably okay,

02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:16.240
but if you can do it a different day,

02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:18.800
or you can do it before those sessions, that's better.

02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:21.880
Heat, however, can be done immediately after training,

02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:22.840
and it's probably beneficial

02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:25.240
because of the way that it dilates the vascular system

02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:28.400
and perfuses the muscles and ligaments,

02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:29.760
et cetera, with more nutrients.

02:40:29.760 --> 02:40:30.960
And as you just mentioned,

02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:33.480
that was a crucial piece of information.

02:40:33.480 --> 02:40:34.880
It's a little bit surprising.

02:40:34.880 --> 02:40:36.040
Was it surprising to you?

02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:37.720
Absolutely, because I actually,

02:40:37.720 --> 02:40:39.920
the way I posed the question to him about cold was,

02:40:39.920 --> 02:40:41.680
I hear that getting into an ice bath

02:40:41.680 --> 02:40:43.240
or a cold water immersion after training

02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:44.160
can reduce hypertrophy,

02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:45.720
but I'm guessing it's not that big of a deal.

02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:47.080
And he said, no, it is a big deal.

02:40:47.080 --> 02:40:48.880
It will short circuit your progress.

02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:51.400
Now, for people that are only interested in performance,

02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:52.520
who are doing a lot of workouts

02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:53.360
and trying to recover,

02:40:53.360 --> 02:40:54.720
but not trying to grow muscle, get stronger,

02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:56.200
or build endurance,

02:40:56.200 --> 02:40:57.640
then it makes sense to do cold.

02:40:57.640 --> 02:40:58.800
Like skill development or something.

02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:01.840
Skill development, or you're an athlete in season.

02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:04.040
So you have to, what's so great about Andy

02:41:04.040 --> 02:41:06.840
is he really points out the specific ways to train

02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:08.040
given your specific goals.

02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:09.440
So for getting swole,

02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:12.000
stay out of the ice bath after a workout.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:12.840
There you go.

02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:14.560
Lex is always making fun of the meatheads.

02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:15.600
I love it.

02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:16.960
I put myself in the meathead category

02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:19.320
only because I don't do a real sport now.

02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:21.440
I work out and I run, which is working out.

02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:22.960
I'm an aspiring meathead.

02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:24.000
Okay, so.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:25.680
One of these days I'm gonna get back to jujitsu

02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:27.160
or I'm gonna get to jujitsu.

02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:28.320
Now, in terms of training,

02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:31.680
he has this beautiful three by five concept for strength.

02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:33.960
Pick three exercises, compound exercises,

02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:35.960
multi-joint movements.

02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:40.440
Do them for, do three to five exercises

02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:45.240
for three to five repetitions per set.

02:41:45.240 --> 02:41:46.960
Rest three to five minutes

02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:48.960
and do that three to five times per week.

02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:51.040
And for details, you can again, look to the episode.

02:41:51.040 --> 02:41:51.880
It's timestamped.

02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:53.160
But what's interesting about this

02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:55.360
is three to five times a week is a lot for a muscle group.

02:41:55.360 --> 02:41:58.040
Squatting five times a week for five reps,

02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:00.320
meaning you're working pretty heavy,

02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:01.480
meaning you're close to failure,

02:42:01.480 --> 02:42:03.600
but not failure for strength generally.

02:42:04.680 --> 02:42:07.800
What Andy taught me is that

02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:10.280
people who are training mostly for strength

02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:13.880
can do these low rep type regimens frequently

02:42:13.880 --> 02:42:16.640
because most of the adaptation is neural.

02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:20.440
And because you're not pushing to failure in most cases,

02:42:20.440 --> 02:42:21.800
you don't get that sore.

02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:24.200
And so it's the motor neurons

02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:27.960
getting the muscle fibers to contract more intensely

02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:30.840
or with more efficiency in other ways

02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:32.320
that's leading to these strength gains.

02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:34.600
And this is why power lifters can train every day

02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:37.280
or five days a week or four days a week.

02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:41.000
For hypertrophy, I learned from Andy

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.240
that the repetition range can be pretty broad.

02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:47.800
You're thinking anywhere from six to 30 repetitions.

02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:52.200
You should do 10 sets per muscle group per week,

02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:53.560
maybe even a bit more.

02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:54.400
So high volume.

02:42:54.400 --> 02:42:59.400
High volume, but you have to go to failure or beyond

02:42:59.760 --> 02:43:01.320
in order to stimulate growth.

02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:03.680
Why does it work at such a great range of repetitions?

02:43:03.680 --> 02:43:06.160
Well, there apparently are three ways

02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:08.400
that you stimulate hypertrophy and maybe more.

02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:11.320
One is micro damage to the tissue.

02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:14.560
The other is through some sort of tension-based changes

02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:17.320
in the molecular gene programs of cells

02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:19.040
that lead to protein synthesis

02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:21.000
that are distinct from damage.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:22.520
And the other are metabolic effects

02:43:22.520 --> 02:43:23.720
of like high repetition work

02:43:23.720 --> 02:43:25.960
of super fusion of the muscle with blood.

02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:27.640
We know that third category exists

02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:29.920
because people are now doing this blood restriction training

02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:31.080
where they cuff off a muscle

02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:32.560
and they'll use a really light weight.

02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:33.400
I've done these before.

02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:35.440
You can use a five pound weight and do curls with this

02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:37.160
and you are in pain

02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:38.560
and the muscles are swelling up with blood.

02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:40.320
It does lead to hypertrophy,

02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:42.880
but in general, you're not sore.

02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:44.640
You're not doing tissue damage.

02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:46.640
And by the way, don't just turn the kid off a muscle

02:43:46.640 --> 02:43:48.760
because you have to use the proper cuffs

02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:50.720
because you need the blood still to flow in one direction.

02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:51.920
You can't just cinch it off

02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:55.320
or you'll potentially kill yourself if you get a clot

02:43:55.320 --> 02:43:56.800
or you do it wrong.

02:43:56.800 --> 02:43:58.320
So get the appropriate cuffs.

02:43:58.320 --> 02:43:59.440
They're out there.

02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:01.560
And then for endurance, I learned something really cool.

02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:02.880
So I work out basically,

02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:06.280
I go to the gym every other day on average,

02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:07.480
three or four days a week I do that,

02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:09.200
but generally not two days in a row.

02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:11.160
It's workout, next day I'll do cardio.

02:44:11.160 --> 02:44:14.160
And the cardio for me is always a 30 to 45 minute jog,

02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:15.480
kind of zone two cardio.

02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:18.800
Andy informed me that to build endurance

02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:22.200
while building strength and maintaining some muscle size

02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:23.640
or even building muscle size,

02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:27.000
I would be wise to take one day a week

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:32.000
and add to that all out max heart rate work

02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:34.560
for 90 seconds at least.

02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:36.120
So do 90 seconds then rest

02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:38.760
and then maybe do another 90 second all out sprint.

02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:41.480
I almost missed my flight going from Los Angeles to Austin.

02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:44.800
I did that all out sprint in the airport yesterday.

02:44:44.800 --> 02:44:47.600
So I actually think it's done for me.

02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:51.880
So there was a sprinting Dr. Huberman throughout.

02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:52.840
With three backs.

02:44:52.840 --> 02:44:53.680
That's awesome.

02:44:53.680 --> 02:44:57.760
Cause I travel, generally I'll travel with too much stuff.

02:44:57.760 --> 02:45:00.160
I love how you were probably running late for a flight

02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:02.080
and used that as an opportunity to explain.

02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:03.720
Well, as I was doing it, I was thinking to myself,

02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:05.880
okay, Andy, that's a 90 second sprint.

02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:07.800
Cause I got to the security line.

02:45:07.800 --> 02:45:08.640
I finally got TSA.

02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:11.360
But that's for better, that's for extending endurance?

02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:12.320
That's for, yeah.

02:45:12.320 --> 02:45:15.080
It actually has some carryover effects on endurance

02:45:15.080 --> 02:45:16.080
if you're doing the other stuff.

02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:18.240
And then he also said one day a week to do this workout

02:45:18.240 --> 02:45:19.080
and I haven't done it yet.

02:45:19.080 --> 02:45:20.560
Maybe we do it tomorrow, it'd be fun.

02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:22.720
Which is you run a mile.

02:45:24.160 --> 02:45:26.400
You ask yourself, how long did that take?

02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:28.400
Let's say it took eight minutes.

02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:30.640
Then you walk or rest for eight minutes.

02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:33.360
Then you run another mile as fast as you can.

02:45:33.360 --> 02:45:34.840
And then you rest for the equivalent period.

02:45:34.840 --> 02:45:37.720
And you do that one to three times once per week.

02:45:38.880 --> 02:45:41.560
And so as an all around fitness program,

02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:44.120
you could collapse this into something where you say,

02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:45.680
okay, you're going to work out with the weights

02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:48.000
for about an hour every other day.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:49.920
Maybe take two days off every once in a while, maybe not.

02:45:49.920 --> 02:45:53.480
You're going to do six to 15 repetitions.

02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:56.040
You're going to push to failure on some of those, not all,

02:45:56.040 --> 02:45:58.680
because some of those are designed to build more strength.

02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:00.160
You're not going to failure in heavier.

02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:01.480
Some are designed for hypertrophy,

02:46:01.480 --> 02:46:03.840
higher rep and going to failure.

02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:04.880
And then on off days,

02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:07.360
you're going to jog for 30 to 45 minutes.

02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:09.200
But for two days a week,

02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:12.600
either at the end of your jog or whatever,

02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:15.480
you're going to do some all out sprints for 90 seconds

02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:17.600
and then rest and repeat.

02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:18.800
And for another day,

02:46:18.800 --> 02:46:22.720
you're going to do these mile repeats.

02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:27.120
That's a pretty large chunk of exercise movement.

02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:30.120
But if you kind of thread through the middle of all that,

02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:32.320
what you end up with is some decent strength,

02:46:32.320 --> 02:46:34.840
building protocols, some decent hypertrophy,

02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:37.640
some cardiovascular training that establishes

02:46:37.640 --> 02:46:40.080
the so-called A base or a so-called base.

02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:42.040
So you're not going to get really good at anything.

02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:44.040
You're not going to become a marathoner this way,

02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:45.680
an optimizing marathon.

02:46:45.680 --> 02:46:47.120
You're not going to optimize power lifting.

02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:48.720
You're not going to optimize hypertrophy.

02:46:48.720 --> 02:46:52.520
But for the typical person, 75% of people, 75% of the time,

02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:53.360
they want some muscle.

02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:54.180
They want some strength.

02:46:54.180 --> 02:46:55.020
They want some endurance.

02:46:55.020 --> 02:46:58.280
And they want the capacity of sprint to the security gate

02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:01.320
without leaving a lung in the terminal.

02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:03.120
So it's like functional stuff,

02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:05.800
like your life going up the stairs is easier,

02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:08.200
moving about, all the kinds, just regular life.

02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:12.040
And I should mention that cold showers after training

02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:17.040
don't seem to short circuit the training effect

02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:19.560
to the same extent that immersion in cold water does.

02:47:19.560 --> 02:47:21.640
And that really speaks to the fact that cold showers,

02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:23.640
even though they can provide some of the adrenaline

02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:25.040
for the mental effects of like,

02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:26.440
oh, I have a lot of adrenaline in my system

02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:28.200
from a cold shower and I can remain calm.

02:47:28.200 --> 02:47:30.080
There's utility to that.

02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:32.840
It's not going to have the same metabolic effects

02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:35.080
or other positive effects that cold water exposure

02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:36.560
has been shown to have.

02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:39.520
And that's unfortunate because most people have access

02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:40.360
to cold showers.

02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:42.880
Not everyone has access to a cold dunk or an ice dunk.

02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:45.920
But here in Austin, you have this place,

02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:47.060
and no, they don't pay me to say this,

02:47:47.060 --> 02:47:48.560
but I always like going to this place

02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:50.200
whenever I'm telling this place, Kuya.

02:47:50.200 --> 02:47:52.600
And they've got a sauna and a couple of ice baths.

02:47:52.600 --> 02:47:53.980
And they even have those salt tanks

02:47:53.980 --> 02:47:55.080
that you can float on the surface.

02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:55.920
They have ice baths there?

02:47:55.920 --> 02:47:58.080
They have cold water immersion.

02:47:58.080 --> 02:47:59.280
It's pretty cold.

02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:00.640
Still haven't done an ice bath.

02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:01.480
Really?

02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:02.320
I need to, yeah, I need to.

02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:03.140
You're rushing.

02:48:03.140 --> 02:48:04.520
You'll probably get in and you won't even have.

02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:05.800
Yeah, what is this?

02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:06.640
What's the big deal here?

02:48:06.640 --> 02:48:08.480
Exactly, or people pay for this?

02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:10.320
I did a post, right, of you as a baby.

02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:11.160
Yeah.

02:48:11.160 --> 02:48:14.520
You know, I had to go deep to get that photo of Lex

02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:18.420
in a bassinet in the snow because in Russia,

02:48:18.420 --> 02:48:20.760
they actually did this for a long time.

02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:22.080
They thought that it, and indeed,

02:48:22.080 --> 02:48:23.580
it does build the immune system

02:48:23.580 --> 02:48:25.760
to expose babies to the cold.

02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:27.760
I still don't know where you got that photo.

02:48:27.760 --> 02:48:29.840
I didn't know you were able to find exactly the right,

02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:31.560
it was great.

02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:32.400
It was great research.

02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:33.220
You didn't have a tie-on,

02:48:33.220 --> 02:48:36.260
you had all the look and seriousness that you do now.

02:48:36.260 --> 02:48:37.860
So it's clearly nature nurture,

02:48:37.860 --> 02:48:39.260
clearly you were born with that.

02:48:39.260 --> 02:48:40.260
What about sauna?

02:48:40.260 --> 02:48:42.500
He does say that it's good to do heat.

02:48:42.500 --> 02:48:44.020
So there are three ways you can do sauna

02:48:44.020 --> 02:48:46.060
that I can just toss out as like brief things.

02:48:46.060 --> 02:48:48.760
If you want to get a really big growth hormone release

02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:50.780
for sake of metabolism, fat loss,

02:48:50.780 --> 02:48:52.660
you're training really, really hard in jujitsu

02:48:52.660 --> 02:48:54.260
and you want to recover,

02:48:54.260 --> 02:48:56.380
you don't want a sauna too often

02:48:56.380 --> 02:48:59.940
because the study that identified this massive

02:48:59.940 --> 02:49:02.340
16-fold increase in growth hormone,

02:49:02.380 --> 02:49:04.580
they had people do this, it's crazy.

02:49:04.580 --> 02:49:07.580
They got into, okay, temperatures are 80

02:49:07.580 --> 02:49:09.500
to 100 degrees centigrade.

02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:13.580
So that's 176 degrees Fahrenheit to 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

02:49:13.580 --> 02:49:16.980
For five to 30 minutes is the typical ranges

02:49:16.980 --> 02:49:19.340
that people work in in these research studies.

02:49:20.300 --> 02:49:22.780
For maximum growth hormone release,

02:49:22.780 --> 02:49:24.960
don't do sauna more than once a week,

02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:27.980
but get into the sauna for 30 minutes,

02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:29.980
as hot as you can safely tolerate.

02:49:29.980 --> 02:49:31.620
So probably for you, that'll be 210

02:49:32.260 --> 02:49:34.900
because I suspect you'll be on the high end of things.

02:49:34.900 --> 02:49:38.580
Then get out for five to 10 minutes, no cold exposure,

02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:40.460
get back in the sauna for 30 minutes.

02:49:40.460 --> 02:49:42.980
Then they had them do it again, out for five minutes,

02:49:42.980 --> 02:49:45.020
back for 30 minutes, out for five minutes,

02:49:45.020 --> 02:49:45.860
back for three minutes.

02:49:45.860 --> 02:49:48.640
They had them do two hours of sauna exposure

02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:51.220
to get that growth hormone release.

02:49:51.220 --> 02:49:54.520
Now for the reduction in likelihood of dying

02:49:54.520 --> 02:49:57.060
of a cardiovascular event, stroke or otherwise,

02:49:57.060 --> 02:49:59.240
the more often you do sauna, the better.

02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:02.320
So if you look at all cause mortality or death

02:50:02.320 --> 02:50:03.920
due to cardiovascular events,

02:50:03.920 --> 02:50:06.160
and you look at sauna use frequencies

02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:09.240
using the same parameters, 80 to 100 degrees centigrade,

02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:10.880
one to seven times per week,

02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:12.800
basically the more often you get into the sauna

02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:15.240
for 30 minutes across the week,

02:50:15.240 --> 02:50:17.920
so 30 minutes a day is better than four times a week.

02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:19.720
Four times a week is better than two times a week,

02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:21.400
and two times a week is better than one.

02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:25.180
And the reductions in mortality are really impressive.

02:50:25.180 --> 02:50:29.200
27, if you get into a sauna the way I just described,

02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:31.760
not the two hours a day, but 30 minutes,

02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:34.000
twice a week or three times per week,

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
you reduce the likelihood of dying

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:39.000
of a cardiovascular event by 27%.

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.240
If you do it four or more times per week,

02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:42.940
you reduce the probability of dying

02:50:42.940 --> 02:50:46.180
by 50% of a cardiovascular event.

02:50:46.180 --> 02:50:49.080
And in these studies, they rule out other things

02:50:49.080 --> 02:50:50.320
that people are doing, smoking.

02:50:50.320 --> 02:50:52.480
They even ask them, do you live in an apartment?

02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:54.100
Are you in a happy relationship?

02:50:54.100 --> 02:50:57.080
They evaluate other potentially confounding variables.

02:50:57.080 --> 02:50:59.200
Now, for people that don't have access to a sauna,

02:50:59.200 --> 02:51:03.020
a hot water bath or hot tub is gonna be your next best bet.

02:51:03.020 --> 02:51:04.240
And if you don't have access to that,

02:51:04.240 --> 02:51:07.440
do like the wrestlers do, which is put on two sets

02:51:07.440 --> 02:51:11.400
of sweats and a hoodie and a stocking cap

02:51:11.400 --> 02:51:13.740
and wrap yourself in plastics underneath all that

02:51:13.740 --> 02:51:14.580
and go for a run.

02:51:14.580 --> 02:51:16.800
But please, nobody die of hypothermia.

02:51:16.800 --> 02:51:18.760
I mean, you can die of warming up too much.

02:51:18.760 --> 02:51:23.760
Is this experience pleasant or stressful in the way,

02:51:23.960 --> 02:51:27.360
so is it as stressful as an ice bath, for example?

02:51:27.360 --> 02:51:28.960
Okay, great question.

02:51:28.960 --> 02:51:31.320
People always ask how cold to make the ice bath

02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:33.160
or the cold water or the shower.

02:51:33.160 --> 02:51:35.480
You want it to be uncomfortably cold,

02:51:35.480 --> 02:51:38.200
meaning you want to feel like I really wanna get out,

02:51:38.200 --> 02:51:39.320
but you can safely stay in.

02:51:39.320 --> 02:51:42.360
And that's gonna vary by person and experience with it.

02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:43.520
Experience, yeah.

02:51:43.520 --> 02:51:45.660
With the sauna, it's the same thing.

02:51:46.520 --> 02:51:47.600
How hot to make it?

02:51:47.600 --> 02:51:50.200
Well, don't kill yourself, obviously.

02:51:50.200 --> 02:51:51.040
Be smart.

02:51:51.040 --> 02:51:53.400
If you're pregnant, you shouldn't be doing this anyway.

02:51:53.960 --> 02:51:56.300
But it's very clear that what you need

02:51:56.300 --> 02:51:58.560
is the release of something called dinorphin.

02:51:58.560 --> 02:52:00.760
We have endorphin, which makes us feel good.

02:52:00.760 --> 02:52:04.280
It binds to these mu-opioid receptors in the body.

02:52:04.280 --> 02:52:07.120
You have dinorphin, which is the terrible feeling

02:52:07.120 --> 02:52:09.420
that you get when you're in really hot temperatures.

02:52:09.420 --> 02:52:12.320
It's also the terrible effect that alcoholics feel

02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:14.160
when they are in withdrawal.

02:52:14.160 --> 02:52:15.920
You feel agitated, you wanna get out.

02:52:15.920 --> 02:52:16.760
It's really unpleasant.

02:52:16.760 --> 02:52:20.440
It's dinorphin binding to the so-called kappa-opioid receptor

02:52:20.440 --> 02:52:22.300
is that's what you're trying to trigger.

02:52:22.300 --> 02:52:24.260
When you do that, a number of things happen.

02:52:24.260 --> 02:52:25.560
You set off heat shock proteins

02:52:25.560 --> 02:52:29.660
that go repair broken proteins and misfolded proteins.

02:52:29.660 --> 02:52:31.620
It also makes it so that later,

02:52:31.620 --> 02:52:34.540
endorphin binds its receptor more strongly.

02:52:34.540 --> 02:52:38.180
So when you have this uncomfortable experience in the heat,

02:52:38.180 --> 02:52:40.460
you literally feel better in real life

02:52:40.460 --> 02:52:42.900
when pleasurable events come on

02:52:42.900 --> 02:52:44.340
when you experience them.

02:52:44.340 --> 02:52:45.860
In the same way, I like to say this,

02:52:45.860 --> 02:52:48.640
that when you get into a cold ice bath or cold shower,

02:52:48.640 --> 02:52:53.640
the increase in epinephrine and dopamine is two to 300%.

02:52:54.600 --> 02:52:57.140
These are huge increases and they last many hours.

02:52:57.140 --> 02:53:00.000
This is shown, because lately I've been getting

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.720
a little bit of pushback on Twitter,

02:53:02.720 --> 02:53:04.880
which is an interesting place.

02:53:06.180 --> 02:53:07.440
People say, well, that's just in mice.

02:53:07.440 --> 02:53:08.960
No, all the studies I just referred to

02:53:08.960 --> 02:53:11.320
are all done in humans, men and women,

02:53:11.320 --> 02:53:12.920
fairly broad age ranges.

02:53:12.920 --> 02:53:15.280
So you want to be uncomfortable in the cold.

02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:17.120
You wanna be uncomfortable in the heat.

02:53:17.120 --> 02:53:19.440
This is why I'm not a big fan of infrared saunas,

02:53:19.440 --> 02:53:22.860
because they only go up to about 160, 170 degrees.

02:53:22.860 --> 02:53:26.040
Infrared light and far red light of all kinds

02:53:26.040 --> 02:53:28.000
has been shown to be beneficial for wound healing,

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:29.800
acne, skin, eyes.

02:53:29.800 --> 02:53:31.480
There are even guys now putting on their testicles

02:53:31.480 --> 02:53:34.800
because it can increase testosterone and sperm production.

02:53:34.800 --> 02:53:36.080
Yeah, hormone release.

02:53:36.080 --> 02:53:37.100
Hormone release.

02:53:37.100 --> 02:53:39.000
But in terms of the sauna,

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.560
you want that strong heat stimulus.

02:53:41.560 --> 02:53:44.880
Yeah, and that's when you crawl up to the 200 mark

02:53:44.880 --> 02:53:45.720
and so on.

02:53:45.720 --> 02:53:46.560
Whenever I'm in New York

02:53:46.560 --> 02:53:47.720
and there's also one in San Francisco,

02:53:47.720 --> 02:53:49.960
although the one in San Francisco is clothing optional,

02:53:49.960 --> 02:53:50.800
just to warn people.

02:53:50.800 --> 02:53:52.960
There's a place called Archimedes Banya.

02:53:52.960 --> 02:53:54.840
Is there any scientific evidence

02:53:54.840 --> 02:53:57.460
that being naked is beneficial in the sauna?

02:53:57.460 --> 02:54:01.060
Well, in certain contexts, it leads to childbirth.

02:54:01.060 --> 02:54:03.040
Okay, well, I'll have to read up on that.

02:54:03.040 --> 02:54:03.880
I read that somewhere.

02:54:03.880 --> 02:54:07.460
But I suppose it's not required for childbirth.

02:54:07.460 --> 02:54:10.600
But in all seriousness, in New York,

02:54:10.600 --> 02:54:12.360
I'll go to a place called Spa 88.

02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:14.600
And actually, Khabib's picture is on the wall.

02:54:14.600 --> 02:54:15.440
He goes there.

02:54:15.440 --> 02:54:18.080
And that one, it's clothing.

02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:19.160
They require clothing.

02:54:19.160 --> 02:54:20.040
I only just say that

02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:21.880
because it can be a little bit of a shock to people sometimes

02:54:21.880 --> 02:54:22.720
if they kind of walk in,

02:54:22.720 --> 02:54:23.680
they're a bunch of naked people,

02:54:23.680 --> 02:54:25.360
the one in San Francisco.

02:54:25.360 --> 02:54:26.520
If I go, I'm clothed,

02:54:26.520 --> 02:54:29.720
mostly because I run into coworkers or things like that.

02:54:30.840 --> 02:54:33.720
Sort of more old fashioned in that way, I suppose.

02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:34.560
But-

02:54:34.560 --> 02:54:36.440
Do you like to wear clothes around coworkers?

02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:38.480
Yes, very old fashioned.

02:54:38.480 --> 02:54:40.920
To me, it just seems like, just be aware.

02:54:40.920 --> 02:54:44.400
But nonetheless, the Banyas have very hot saunas

02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:46.160
because they're Russian owned.

02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:48.040
And in New York, there's one on the Lower East Side,

02:54:48.040 --> 02:54:51.240
but the Spa 88 place, they have some saunas

02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:53.920
that the moment I get into those,

02:54:53.920 --> 02:54:55.600
I have a hard time catching a full breath.

02:54:55.600 --> 02:54:56.720
It burns.

02:54:56.720 --> 02:54:59.320
They've got a cold dunk that's like a shock.

02:54:59.320 --> 02:55:00.440
And then they've got a sauna,

02:55:00.440 --> 02:55:02.680
a wet sauna steam room that's a little mellower.

02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:03.920
So the nice thing about a Banya

02:55:03.920 --> 02:55:05.760
is you can kind of find your place.

02:55:05.760 --> 02:55:06.840
And then they do the plaza

02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:08.880
where they take the eucalyptus leaves

02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:10.440
and you can pay someone.

02:55:10.440 --> 02:55:12.200
And you basically, you cover your groin

02:55:12.200 --> 02:55:15.680
and then they beat you with the leaves.

02:55:15.680 --> 02:55:17.640
And it's supposed to bring the vasculature to the surface.

02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:18.840
I've only done it once.

02:55:18.840 --> 02:55:22.400
And frankly, I found it to be a little bit unnerving.

02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:24.120
I didn't really like the experience.

02:55:24.120 --> 02:55:28.040
But I'll try and get into a sauna as often as I possibly can,

02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:30.400
which is once or three times per week.

02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:34.880
And I try and do the cold exposure shower or immersion,

02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:37.800
but early in the day, because it really wakes you up.

02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:40.320
One of my favorite things I've listened to,

02:55:40.320 --> 02:55:42.080
I wish there was a video,

02:55:43.040 --> 02:55:45.120
is listening to a bunch of stuff with Rick Rubin.

02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:47.760
And he did a thing with Tim Ferriss,

02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:49.040
like the Tim Ferriss podcast.

02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:50.520
I don't know if you've ever heard it,

02:55:50.520 --> 02:55:55.520
but he forced them to do, they did the podcast in a sauna.

02:55:56.640 --> 02:56:00.800
And I don't think at the time Tim Ferriss was adapted.

02:56:00.800 --> 02:56:01.960
Yeah, if you're not heat adapted,

02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:03.160
it can be pretty stressful.

02:56:03.160 --> 02:56:05.720
And I mean, obviously the whole experience is stressful

02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:09.320
as somebody with microphones, like what is happening?

02:56:09.360 --> 02:56:12.920
But I just love that Tim was vulnerable enough

02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:15.520
to kind of give themselves over

02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:17.240
to whatever the hell this experience is.

02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:22.240
And I am just so happy that Rick pushed that kind of idea.

02:56:23.480 --> 02:56:25.720
And just let's do it.

02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:27.760
That's a very Rick Rubin kind of thing to do.

02:56:27.760 --> 02:56:31.640
And we must, like we must do this, this has to be done.

02:56:31.640 --> 02:56:34.760
A podcast that was done from a sauna continuously

02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:35.680
would be really interesting.

02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:37.680
Like you could call it like the pressure cooker or something.

02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:38.920
Oh, I mean like a regular podcast.

02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:42.160
You have to sit with your guests in the sauna

02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:43.680
or they have to sit in the sauna.

02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:45.720
That was one of the interesting things is,

02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:48.200
it was a sad thing because I believe

02:56:48.200 --> 02:56:50.240
there's no video of that podcast,

02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:53.760
but you could tell there was a kind of,

02:56:53.760 --> 02:56:56.720
there was suffering and especially on Tim's part.

02:56:56.720 --> 02:56:58.240
It was like a degradation.

02:56:58.240 --> 02:57:01.360
He started over time not being able

02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:05.600
to put words together correctly, which he's very eloquent.

02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:08.520
And so you could see there's like,

02:57:09.600 --> 02:57:10.600
there's a struggle.

02:57:10.600 --> 02:57:12.760
Heat and cold pull you down from the inside.

02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:14.160
You have to, I mean, there's a reason why

02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:17.960
the screening process for make, you know, sealed, sealed,

02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:18.840
they call it sealed training,

02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:21.440
but it's really screening and training involves cold waters.

02:57:21.440 --> 02:57:23.320
Cause you know, if you're in the heat too long,

02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:25.080
you'll die or damage tissue.

02:57:25.080 --> 02:57:27.160
In cold, you can do it quite extensively

02:57:27.160 --> 02:57:30.240
before you die or damage tissue, but it is stressful.

02:57:30.240 --> 02:57:32.480
I was going to say one thing that

02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:35.080
I sometimes enjoy seeing these social media posts

02:57:35.080 --> 02:57:36.800
where people will get into the ice bath

02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:37.880
and they'll look really stoic.

02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:39.280
Like they're really tough,

02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:43.000
but actually that's the wimpy way to go through it.

02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:47.360
When you get into cold water, if you stay very still,

02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:51.400
you develop a thermal sheath around you

02:57:51.400 --> 02:57:53.280
that you're warming yourself.

02:57:53.280 --> 02:57:55.760
The really bold way is to get in

02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:57.760
and continue to sift your arms and legs.

02:57:57.760 --> 02:58:00.960
And it ends up feeling miserably colder.

02:58:00.960 --> 02:58:02.000
And then there's no sheath

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.600
cause you're breaking up that thermal layer.

02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:05.840
And then when you get out,

02:58:05.840 --> 02:58:07.640
you'll notice a lot of people huddle

02:58:07.640 --> 02:58:09.640
or they'll grab the towel.

02:58:09.640 --> 02:58:10.480
In general, that's me.

02:58:10.480 --> 02:58:12.560
I'll get back, I'll get into the sauna.

02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:14.360
But if you really want to stimulate

02:58:14.360 --> 02:58:16.280
the big increases in metabolism,

02:58:16.280 --> 02:58:18.080
you stand out there and you dry off

02:58:18.080 --> 02:58:20.760
with arms extended in open air.

02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:23.680
And as that water evaporates off you, it is really cold,

02:58:23.680 --> 02:58:25.800
but your body is forced to activate a number

02:58:25.800 --> 02:58:28.480
of the warming programs related to metabolism.

02:58:28.480 --> 02:58:31.120
This is the beautiful work of a woman named Susanna Soberg

02:58:31.120 --> 02:58:32.440
who's Scandinavian.

02:58:32.440 --> 02:58:33.840
She published this paper last year

02:58:33.840 --> 02:58:35.000
in Cell Reports Medicine.

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:36.800
And so I call this the Soberg principle,

02:58:36.800 --> 02:58:40.280
which is if you're doing ice and heat for whatever reason,

02:58:40.280 --> 02:58:41.920
it doesn't matter if you end on heat or cold,

02:58:41.920 --> 02:58:44.800
but if you're using cold specifically to stimulate

02:58:44.800 --> 02:58:47.840
an increase in metabolism, end with cold.

02:58:47.840 --> 02:58:49.960
That's the Soberg principle.

02:58:49.960 --> 02:58:52.320
And with cold, if you're alternating,

02:58:52.320 --> 02:58:55.400
and then if you want to do it the tough way,

02:58:55.400 --> 02:58:56.680
you let the shivering,

02:58:56.680 --> 02:58:59.200
so you just stand out and let the water evaporate.

02:58:59.200 --> 02:59:01.600
Yeah, I mean, if you ever waded into a cold ocean,

02:59:01.600 --> 02:59:03.760
everybody's kind of like holding themselves

02:59:04.680 --> 02:59:06.880
if you let yourself extend your limbs

02:59:06.880 --> 02:59:08.400
and move them around a bit so you break up

02:59:08.400 --> 02:59:12.000
that thermal layer, that's the tough way to do it.

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:13.560
So when I see people on social media getting in

02:59:13.560 --> 02:59:16.400
and they're like really tough and trying to look hard.

02:59:16.400 --> 02:59:17.800
Yeah, you want to be moving around.

02:59:17.800 --> 02:59:22.600
Yeah, smiling, talking, moving around is way, way colder.

02:59:22.600 --> 02:59:23.800
Are you able to talk?

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.840
So you suggest the podcast in the sauna.

02:59:27.840 --> 02:59:28.680
How about this?

02:59:28.680 --> 02:59:29.680
I proposed this since I got choked.

02:59:29.680 --> 02:59:31.240
You want to do the next podcast?

02:59:32.120 --> 02:59:33.960
So the folks from the plunge,

02:59:33.960 --> 02:59:35.760
maybe you could bring Lex a plunge.

02:59:35.760 --> 02:59:37.720
He certainly deserves one.

02:59:37.720 --> 02:59:40.200
And we can go side by side coffin style

02:59:40.200 --> 02:59:42.160
or we can face one another when we're doing it.

02:59:42.160 --> 02:59:44.040
Well, we said we should do each other's podcast

02:59:44.040 --> 02:59:44.880
and maybe next human lab podcast.

02:59:44.880 --> 02:59:46.280
Well, I can't wait to have you back on.

02:59:46.280 --> 02:59:47.520
I mean, we only scratched the surface.

02:59:47.520 --> 02:59:48.600
Well, let's do at least part

02:59:48.600 --> 02:59:51.360
of the next human lab podcast either or not.

02:59:51.360 --> 02:59:52.640
I have a sauna and a cold plunge,

02:59:52.640 --> 02:59:55.040
so we could do, yeah, we could do.

02:59:55.040 --> 02:59:57.160
We do a sauna and a cold plunge version.

02:59:57.160 --> 02:59:59.560
I wonder how the recording works.

03:00:00.080 --> 03:00:01.520
A bit of an echo in the sauna,

03:00:01.520 --> 03:00:04.040
but I'm sure we can take out the reverb.

03:00:04.040 --> 03:00:08.720
So Sergey wants to ask you about sex performance.

03:00:09.800 --> 03:00:12.360
Very journalistic, very hardcore hitting questions

03:00:12.360 --> 03:00:13.200
that we have here in the podcast.

03:00:13.200 --> 03:00:15.160
Generally or a specific experience?

03:00:15.160 --> 03:00:18.240
No, he has a certain problem he needs help with, no.

03:00:18.240 --> 03:00:21.560
Generally, you haven't done an episode on sex.

03:00:21.560 --> 03:00:25.240
Well, we did an episode early on on sexual development.

03:00:25.240 --> 03:00:27.640
We've done them on optimizing testosterone and estrogen

03:00:27.720 --> 03:00:31.320
and we touched a little bit on libido

03:00:31.320 --> 03:00:34.920
and somewhat on sex performance, but not much.

03:00:34.920 --> 03:00:38.440
We did an episode on relationships, love and desire

03:00:38.440 --> 03:00:40.760
where we touched on libido specifically.

03:00:40.760 --> 03:00:43.120
So just as a quick mention of something,

03:00:43.120 --> 03:00:46.080
a lot of people take SSRIs or antidepressants

03:00:46.080 --> 03:00:47.920
that can disrupt sexual function.

03:00:47.920 --> 03:00:50.720
There are a few compounds like maca root

03:00:50.720 --> 03:00:52.480
and ponga ali and things like that,

03:00:52.480 --> 03:00:54.640
that at least in a few studies in humans have been shown

03:00:54.640 --> 03:00:57.280
to offset some of the sexual side effects.

03:00:58.720 --> 03:01:01.320
Now, in terms of sexual, and then the, sorry,

03:01:01.320 --> 03:01:03.440
the episode on sexual development was about

03:01:03.440 --> 03:01:06.400
how the brain and body become organized in certain ways,

03:01:06.400 --> 03:01:08.360
how the brain becomes organized

03:01:08.360 --> 03:01:11.120
if you have X chromosomes or Y chromosomes or et cetera.

03:01:11.120 --> 03:01:12.160
So early, early development.

03:01:12.160 --> 03:01:13.280
Early development mainly

03:01:13.280 --> 03:01:16.560
and the effects of hormones later on that template.

03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:21.040
We will be doing a, I'm actually putting together a series

03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:22.960
on sexual health.

03:01:22.960 --> 03:01:26.080
Everything from the menstrual cycle,

03:01:26.080 --> 03:01:29.000
which both men and women should understand, of course,

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:32.120
understanding arousal, understanding, for instance,

03:01:32.120 --> 03:01:33.200
a lot of people don't realize this,

03:01:33.200 --> 03:01:37.080
but that orgasm is actually the consequence of activity

03:01:37.080 --> 03:01:40.280
in the sympathetic, meaning the stress arm

03:01:40.280 --> 03:01:42.680
of the autonomic nervous system.

03:01:42.680 --> 03:01:45.960
Whereas arousal is the consequence

03:01:45.960 --> 03:01:47.840
of the activity of the parasympathetic,

03:01:47.840 --> 03:01:51.400
the calming aspect of the autonomic nervous system.

03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:52.760
It's counterintuitive, right?

03:01:52.760 --> 03:01:55.080
It's counterintuitive and it kind of works like a seesaw.

03:01:55.080 --> 03:01:56.880
I mean, there's arousal, then there's relaxation,

03:01:56.880 --> 03:01:57.720
then there's arousal.

03:01:57.720 --> 03:02:01.640
But the, and then immediately after orgasm

03:02:01.640 --> 03:02:03.600
and in male's ejaculation, what ends up happening

03:02:03.600 --> 03:02:05.040
is there's a rebounding

03:02:05.040 --> 03:02:07.040
of the parasympathetic nervous system,

03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:09.600
which it leads to oftentimes people feeling very relaxed

03:02:09.600 --> 03:02:11.400
or falling asleep.

03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:15.120
So I'm gonna do a short series on sexual health

03:02:15.120 --> 03:02:17.960
that will include stuff about sexual performance,

03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:22.960
but also some, I'm working on getting an expert guest

03:02:24.080 --> 03:02:26.840
who can talk about some of the neurologic changes

03:02:26.840 --> 03:02:30.400
that happen as a consequence of sexual activity.

03:02:30.400 --> 03:02:33.920
And we did an episode with a guy from UT Austin here,

03:02:33.920 --> 03:02:36.320
David Buss, who's evolutionary psychologist,

03:02:36.320 --> 03:02:41.240
talking about, it went pretty deep into some of the typical

03:02:41.240 --> 03:02:44.920
and unusual dynamics of mating relation,

03:02:44.920 --> 03:02:46.200
whether or not people have kids or not

03:02:46.200 --> 03:02:47.040
and what impacts that.

03:02:47.040 --> 03:02:49.640
But we're gonna do an episode on menopause, andropause.

03:02:49.640 --> 03:02:52.480
What's very surprising is I get a lot of questions

03:02:52.480 --> 03:02:55.480
about sexual health from the young male audience,

03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:00.240
which tells me that, well, here's what I think it reflects.

03:03:00.240 --> 03:03:03.460
I think that women, because of their menstrual cycles,

03:03:03.460 --> 03:03:05.680
early on start to talk to one another

03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:08.000
about changes in physiology and psychology

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:09.640
as a function of this 28-day cycle

03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:11.800
that they all experience sooner or later.

03:03:11.800 --> 03:03:14.120
Males, there's less of a conversation

03:03:14.120 --> 03:03:15.680
and it usually arrives in code.

03:03:15.680 --> 03:03:16.880
People will say, hey, what should I take

03:03:16.880 --> 03:03:18.280
to increase my testosterone?

03:03:18.280 --> 03:03:20.280
And I'll say, well, maybe nothing.

03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:23.600
What are you specifically concerned about?

03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:27.160
And then over time, if you pull on those threads a little bit,

03:03:27.160 --> 03:03:28.200
you get your answer.

03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:30.720
Sometimes I'll just get a direct question.

03:03:30.720 --> 03:03:33.760
But I think that the psychology of all this

03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:36.880
in terms of jealousy and the terms of notions

03:03:36.880 --> 03:03:40.480
of roles in relationships is very dynamic right now.

03:03:40.480 --> 03:03:41.680
And I'm fascinated by this.

03:03:41.680 --> 03:03:43.720
So we're gonna do a four-episode series.

03:03:43.720 --> 03:03:45.200
What about sexual fantasy?

03:03:47.600 --> 03:03:48.880
To get Freudian for a second,

03:03:48.880 --> 03:03:52.820
what role does sexual fantasy have in the human condition?

03:03:52.820 --> 03:03:56.080
There's a book called The Erotic Imagination.

03:03:56.080 --> 03:03:57.320
It's a very psychoanalytic book

03:03:57.320 --> 03:04:01.240
written by a psychoanalyst that talks about how,

03:04:01.240 --> 03:04:03.200
well, here's the uncomfortable reality.

03:04:03.200 --> 03:04:05.280
Freud was at least right about one thing,

03:04:05.280 --> 03:04:09.040
which is that the brain circuitry that you used

03:04:09.040 --> 03:04:11.200
to develop attachments to your caregivers,

03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:13.360
mother and father or other caregivers,

03:04:14.320 --> 03:04:16.740
do not disappear when you hit puberty.

03:04:16.740 --> 03:04:20.440
They are repurposed for romantic and sexual relations.

03:04:20.440 --> 03:04:23.800
And so this is why the whole notion of anxious attached

03:04:23.800 --> 03:04:27.240
and secure attached stems from childhood attachment patterns,

03:04:27.240 --> 03:04:29.840
but it carries over to romantic relationships.

03:04:29.840 --> 03:04:32.620
So that the relationship with your mother has a-

03:04:32.620 --> 03:04:33.460
And father.

03:04:33.460 --> 03:04:37.020
And father has a, and probably other close people to you

03:04:37.020 --> 03:04:41.340
in your young age has a secondary tertiary,

03:04:41.340 --> 03:04:44.420
some kind of ripple effect on how your sexuality developed,

03:04:44.420 --> 03:04:46.180
like what fantasies you might have, all that.

03:04:46.180 --> 03:04:47.180
Oh, without question.

03:04:47.180 --> 03:04:48.980
And of course, early experiences too,

03:04:48.980 --> 03:04:51.760
and traumatic or positive or neutral.

03:04:51.760 --> 03:04:53.540
The thing that's really important to remember though

03:04:53.540 --> 03:04:57.140
in this transfer of circuitry from one role to another

03:04:57.140 --> 03:05:00.840
is that, and it's certainly consistent with psychoanalysis,

03:05:00.840 --> 03:05:04.780
that gender is interchangeable, sex is interchangeable.

03:05:04.780 --> 03:05:07.620
So for instance, let's say you had a wonderful relationship.

03:05:07.620 --> 03:05:10.820
Let's say this, let's take a hypothetical person, okay?

03:05:10.820 --> 03:05:12.060
I'm truly not referring to myself.

03:05:12.060 --> 03:05:15.660
Let's take a young woman who has a wonderful relationship

03:05:15.660 --> 03:05:18.660
to her father and a just absolutely terrible

03:05:18.660 --> 03:05:20.340
abusive relationship to her mother,

03:05:20.340 --> 03:05:21.620
just for sake of example.

03:05:22.620 --> 03:05:24.500
She then goes into adulthood

03:05:24.500 --> 03:05:29.500
and she is drawn to very abusive men, not always,

03:05:29.500 --> 03:05:31.220
but let's just use in this example.

03:05:32.160 --> 03:05:34.260
And the dynamic is exactly the same

03:05:34.260 --> 03:05:36.080
as the dynamic she had with her mother.

03:05:36.080 --> 03:05:37.900
That's actually a common occurrence,

03:05:37.900 --> 03:05:40.580
even though in this context, she's heterosexual,

03:05:40.580 --> 03:05:41.980
she's romantically attracted to men.

03:05:41.980 --> 03:05:44.660
What is seen over and over again is that the dynamic

03:05:44.660 --> 03:05:47.620
with one parent can be transferred onto a romantic dynamic,

03:05:47.620 --> 03:05:51.100
but it doesn't have to be that if it was with the mother,

03:05:51.100 --> 03:05:53.400
then it only has to do with relationships to women.

03:05:53.400 --> 03:05:54.940
So gender is interchangeable

03:05:54.940 --> 03:05:58.300
because these circuitries are presexual.

03:05:58.300 --> 03:06:00.020
They're laid down in our brain

03:06:00.020 --> 03:06:04.220
before the brain has any concept of sexual interactions.

03:06:05.220 --> 03:06:06.620
It's pre-pervertal, excuse me.

03:06:06.620 --> 03:06:09.860
And so there are a lot of interesting examples

03:06:09.860 --> 03:06:11.100
and data to support this.

03:06:12.060 --> 03:06:14.720
The book Attached is a pretty interesting book

03:06:14.720 --> 03:06:16.260
by two psychologists.

03:06:16.260 --> 03:06:18.140
One I think is at Columbia University

03:06:19.140 --> 03:06:22.700
that talks about how childhood dynamics carry over

03:06:22.700 --> 03:06:25.640
to adult romantic attachment.

03:06:25.640 --> 03:06:27.820
So as you can tell, I get pretty alert

03:06:27.820 --> 03:06:29.140
in response to these questions.

03:06:29.140 --> 03:06:32.140
I get a lot of them in this domain.

03:06:32.140 --> 03:06:33.620
They have a lot of impact on people

03:06:33.620 --> 03:06:35.500
and they were wondering about, they wanna learn.

03:06:35.500 --> 03:06:37.900
No one knows what other people are doing or what's normal.

03:06:37.900 --> 03:06:40.120
We kind of know deviancy, we know perversion,

03:06:40.120 --> 03:06:43.140
we know the extremes, we know the rules.

03:06:43.140 --> 03:06:44.460
Hopefully people know the rules,

03:06:44.460 --> 03:06:49.460
but there are a lot of people in the academic community,

03:06:51.660 --> 03:06:54.780
in particular at certain East Coast schools not to be named

03:06:54.780 --> 03:06:57.580
that are in open relationships.

03:06:57.580 --> 03:06:58.880
This is more common now.

03:06:59.880 --> 03:07:03.320
It's not very common, but it's more common.

03:07:03.320 --> 03:07:06.880
And obviously that's a way of bypassing

03:07:06.880 --> 03:07:09.280
some of these more primitive emotions about jealousy,

03:07:09.280 --> 03:07:12.280
et cetera, and leveraging them towards

03:07:12.280 --> 03:07:13.880
maybe even ongoing relationships.

03:07:13.880 --> 03:07:16.040
I'm not passing judgment one way or the other.

03:07:16.040 --> 03:07:18.380
I always say four conditions have to be met

03:07:18.380 --> 03:07:21.960
for any discussion about sex and sexuality or sexual health.

03:07:21.960 --> 03:07:25.020
Age appropriate, context appropriate,

03:07:25.020 --> 03:07:27.300
consensual and species appropriate.

03:07:28.300 --> 03:07:31.600
Well, that's weird because the thing I'm trying to figure out

03:07:31.600 --> 03:07:36.600
is why my sexual fantasy is to go to furry orgies

03:07:36.600 --> 03:07:41.180
and have sex with others dressed as squirrels

03:07:41.180 --> 03:07:43.380
and me, the other animals.

03:07:43.380 --> 03:07:48.380
So that could be, I'll see a therapist about that one.

03:07:48.700 --> 03:07:51.100
I'm not gonna respond to that except to say

03:07:51.100 --> 03:07:54.940
that as long as those four conditions are met,

03:07:54.940 --> 03:07:56.900
consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate,

03:07:56.900 --> 03:07:57.860
species appropriate.

03:07:57.860 --> 03:08:00.860
So there's a bunch of questions on Instagram.

03:08:00.860 --> 03:08:05.260
One of them on this topic, on relationships,

03:08:05.260 --> 03:08:08.540
somebody suggested to do a part three of why Lex is single.

03:08:08.540 --> 03:08:10.700
There's a running joke about this.

03:08:12.300 --> 03:08:14.600
But I can answer it in part, right?

03:08:14.600 --> 03:08:17.340
Because, well, partially because you're very busy,

03:08:17.340 --> 03:08:22.340
partially because you've decided that until it's time,

03:08:22.980 --> 03:08:26.700
you're gonna wait until it's time, it's time, right?

03:08:26.700 --> 03:08:28.140
I mean, until it's time you're waiting.

03:08:28.140 --> 03:08:31.100
And then, I mean, not saving yourself for marriage,

03:08:31.100 --> 03:08:34.680
I don't think, but in some sense, yeah,

03:08:34.680 --> 03:08:37.700
your future wife is out there.

03:08:37.700 --> 03:08:39.820
Oh yeah, yeah, she's being programmed.

03:08:39.820 --> 03:08:43.060
No, I mean, I definitely believe that.

03:08:43.060 --> 03:08:45.140
I mean, first of all, I just love people

03:08:45.140 --> 03:08:47.060
and I fall in love very easily with people,

03:08:47.060 --> 03:08:50.140
with objects, with things, with life, with every moment.

03:08:50.140 --> 03:08:51.940
And that way you're like Oliver Sacks.

03:08:51.940 --> 03:08:53.660
He would fall in love with minerals

03:08:54.820 --> 03:08:56.580
and concepts and things like that.

03:08:56.580 --> 03:08:58.780
And so like to me, this kind of,

03:09:01.100 --> 03:09:04.060
so relationship is more like a commitment

03:09:04.060 --> 03:09:09.060
to one particular kind of object of your love.

03:09:10.420 --> 03:09:12.820
Like, it's almost like a,

03:09:12.820 --> 03:09:14.980
it's like a journey that you take on together

03:09:14.980 --> 03:09:18.060
because also the interesting thing about humans

03:09:18.060 --> 03:09:20.940
is they're moment by moment, a different person,

03:09:20.940 --> 03:09:23.300
day by day, week by week, month by month,

03:09:23.300 --> 03:09:24.860
they change, they evolve.

03:09:24.860 --> 03:09:26.740
There's an ups and downs and stuff like that.

03:09:26.740 --> 03:09:29.180
So what you're doing is you're saying,

03:09:29.180 --> 03:09:31.420
well, I'm going to explore all the ways

03:09:31.420 --> 03:09:34.540
that this human gets morphed and changed

03:09:34.540 --> 03:09:38.540
and what makes them cry, what makes them excited,

03:09:38.540 --> 03:09:43.540
what makes them lonely, like the habits,

03:09:44.500 --> 03:09:47.220
like when they form certain habits,

03:09:47.220 --> 03:09:49.320
how they feel when those habits are broken.

03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:52.760
Like the stupid minute things that make everyday life,

03:09:52.760 --> 03:09:54.920
you're going to be on that journey together,

03:09:54.920 --> 03:09:55.760
figuring that out.

03:09:55.760 --> 03:09:58.000
Just the way we're trying to figure ourselves out

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:00.040
when we're like optimizing these things

03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:01.520
about diet and health and so on.

03:10:01.520 --> 03:10:04.440
You're kind of doing this computation together

03:10:04.440 --> 03:10:07.000
because neither person really understands themselves

03:10:08.320 --> 03:10:11.280
at all and you're together, both confused about each other.

03:10:11.280 --> 03:10:14.800
And you get to almost like a relationship

03:10:14.800 --> 03:10:19.240
is a chance to understand yourself

03:10:20.080 --> 03:10:23.120
and to understand another person together.

03:10:23.120 --> 03:10:25.880
That process is some kind of iterative.

03:10:25.880 --> 03:10:27.200
You know the dynamics, right?

03:10:27.200 --> 03:10:29.320
I mean, you're merging two nervous systems.

03:10:29.320 --> 03:10:30.720
This was once described to me very well

03:10:30.720 --> 03:10:34.280
by an ex-girlfriend who's truly brilliant.

03:10:34.280 --> 03:10:35.480
She's really brilliant.

03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.520
She said, you know, there's four arrows.

03:10:39.520 --> 03:10:43.000
This is maybe to an engineer or like a, so it makes sense.

03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:45.360
There's how you feel towards the other person.

03:10:45.360 --> 03:10:47.420
There's how they feel towards you.

03:10:47.420 --> 03:10:50.140
But then there's an arrow that comes back to you

03:10:51.020 --> 03:10:54.940
which is how you feel about how they feel.

03:10:54.940 --> 03:10:56.700
And then they have an arrow of how they feel

03:10:56.700 --> 03:10:57.940
about how you feel, right?

03:10:57.940 --> 03:10:59.460
This is why if someone else is moody

03:10:59.460 --> 03:11:00.740
or somebody else is upset,

03:11:01.900 --> 03:11:05.020
there's one version of ourselves where we respond to that

03:11:05.020 --> 03:11:06.340
or they respond to us.

03:11:06.340 --> 03:11:09.580
But there's another version where we respond to that

03:11:09.580 --> 03:11:12.660
but it's also, there's a processing of what it means for us

03:11:12.660 --> 03:11:15.460
that they're behaving that way or feeling that way.

03:11:15.460 --> 03:11:17.780
And this, again, leads us back

03:11:17.780 --> 03:11:19.300
to that early attachment circuitry

03:11:19.300 --> 03:11:22.900
because if a parent was stressed,

03:11:22.900 --> 03:11:25.860
the child's role is not to soothe the parent.

03:11:25.860 --> 03:11:27.500
In fact, healthy models of parenting say

03:11:27.500 --> 03:11:30.840
that children shouldn't actually know how their parents feel

03:11:30.840 --> 03:11:32.860
for like the first eight years of their life.

03:11:32.860 --> 03:11:34.420
They're not supposed to be in that mindset

03:11:34.420 --> 03:11:35.900
of empathizing for the parent.

03:11:35.900 --> 03:11:37.780
This is often not the case.

03:11:37.780 --> 03:11:40.080
But maybe the cutoff isn't exactly eight

03:11:40.080 --> 03:11:41.240
but you get the idea.

03:11:41.240 --> 03:11:44.060
So the dynamics of a relationship are where the learning is

03:11:44.060 --> 03:11:46.860
because we learn how we react to other people reacting.

03:11:46.860 --> 03:11:49.060
It's not just a two arrow system.

03:11:49.060 --> 03:11:51.140
It's at least this four arrow thing.

03:11:52.320 --> 03:11:54.900
But there's also the element of nurturing, right?

03:11:54.900 --> 03:11:57.860
I mean, I think that going through life with somebody

03:11:57.860 --> 03:12:00.140
is so much better than going through it alone.

03:12:00.140 --> 03:12:02.700
And I never thought I'd make that statement.

03:12:04.180 --> 03:12:05.860
So it wasn't always obvious to you?

03:12:05.860 --> 03:12:07.340
No, it wasn't always obvious to me.

03:12:07.340 --> 03:12:10.380
I mean, I've really enjoyed wonderful relationships

03:12:11.260 --> 03:12:12.540
and some have been hard

03:12:12.780 --> 03:12:14.500
and there's certainly been a lot of growth.

03:12:14.500 --> 03:12:18.540
I'm on good terms with almost all my former girlfriends

03:12:18.540 --> 03:12:21.940
and close with some enough that I know their spouses

03:12:21.940 --> 03:12:23.380
and I'm close with their families.

03:12:23.380 --> 03:12:25.740
And, but no, it wasn't.

03:12:25.740 --> 03:12:29.660
And I think that when people say relationship is hard

03:12:29.660 --> 03:12:32.960
the only really hard part of a good relationship

03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:34.340
is just dealing with oneself

03:12:34.340 --> 03:12:35.540
and making sure that you're staying

03:12:35.540 --> 03:12:38.000
in that mode of caretaking.

03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:40.800
Cause I do believe that if one is mainly focused

03:12:40.800 --> 03:12:42.680
on taking good care of the other person

03:12:42.680 --> 03:12:46.400
provided they're also focused on taking good care of you

03:12:46.400 --> 03:12:49.040
to some extent and we're good at taking care of ourselves

03:12:49.040 --> 03:12:51.040
everybody flourishes, everything gets better.

03:12:51.040 --> 03:12:52.920
But no, I don't think I experienced that

03:12:52.920 --> 03:12:54.880
until fairly recently.

03:12:54.880 --> 03:12:58.360
What do you think is the secret

03:12:58.360 --> 03:12:59.920
to a successful relationship?

03:13:02.880 --> 03:13:07.360
There isn't just one, but at least in the top five

03:13:07.360 --> 03:13:12.360
is master or at least be good

03:13:12.640 --> 03:13:16.280
at autonomic self-regulation.

03:13:16.280 --> 03:13:18.700
Know how to calm yourself down.

03:13:18.700 --> 03:13:21.680
Don't expect the, like looking to anything external

03:13:21.680 --> 03:13:24.480
to soothe yourself is it puts you in a terrible position

03:13:24.480 --> 03:13:27.700
to be a caretaker of yourself and other people, right?

03:13:27.700 --> 03:13:29.200
So learn how to self-soothe, right?

03:13:29.200 --> 03:13:32.440
Learn how to calm your mind, steady your actions

03:13:32.440 --> 03:13:33.500
steady your voice.

03:13:33.500 --> 03:13:34.420
There are tools to do that.

03:13:34.420 --> 03:13:35.340
We talked about on the podcast

03:13:35.340 --> 03:13:36.900
but elsewhere have that in place.

03:13:36.900 --> 03:13:41.900
I also think that if your main focus is on

03:13:42.220 --> 03:13:43.860
you wanna have a good boundaries, et cetera

03:13:43.860 --> 03:13:46.420
but on tending to the relationship

03:13:46.420 --> 03:13:48.560
doing a little bit more than you think you ought to do.

03:13:48.560 --> 03:13:50.740
If everyone does that, it goes great.

03:13:50.740 --> 03:13:52.880
I mean, I'm sometimes so positively struck

03:13:52.880 --> 03:13:57.860
by how supported I feel because for many years

03:13:57.860 --> 03:13:59.620
I was just kind of doing everything on my own.

03:13:59.620 --> 03:14:02.780
So any little thing I'm like, oh my goodness, this feels huge.

03:14:02.780 --> 03:14:04.700
And also I think the dynamics have to be right.

03:14:04.700 --> 03:14:05.860
Let's be really honest.

03:14:05.860 --> 03:14:07.500
This is a little bit of a tricky topic

03:14:07.500 --> 03:14:12.500
but there is a power dynamic in relationships.

03:14:13.460 --> 03:14:16.400
Sometimes not all, but in some relationships

03:14:16.400 --> 03:14:18.500
it works much better if one person leads

03:14:18.500 --> 03:14:21.100
and the other person follows.

03:14:21.100 --> 03:14:24.820
In other relationships, it's more mutuality works best.

03:14:24.820 --> 03:14:26.880
People need to know what they need.

03:14:26.880 --> 03:14:29.420
And so knowing what you need and what you crave

03:14:29.420 --> 03:14:30.260
is really important.

03:14:30.260 --> 03:14:31.100
And then once you do that

03:14:31.100 --> 03:14:33.400
you can create the relationship you want.

03:14:33.400 --> 03:14:34.760
I've seen that over and over again.

03:14:34.760 --> 03:14:36.020
And people are different.

03:14:37.220 --> 03:14:41.420
But I think that ultimately, I mean, right,

03:14:41.420 --> 03:14:44.720
there's the dopamine phase of a relationship

03:14:44.720 --> 03:14:46.160
and then there's the serotonin phase,

03:14:46.160 --> 03:14:49.020
the kind of more mutuality, coziness and sweetness.

03:14:49.020 --> 03:14:52.220
There's a great book about how to make sure

03:14:52.220 --> 03:14:56.460
that the dopamine component and the serotonin component,

03:14:56.460 --> 03:14:58.520
so to speak, go on forever.

03:14:58.520 --> 03:14:59.800
And it has to do with, you know,

03:14:59.800 --> 03:15:01.400
when you first meet someone and you're attracted to them

03:15:01.400 --> 03:15:04.180
you're essentially objectifying them.

03:15:04.520 --> 03:15:07.120
Meaning, not in the way people might think,

03:15:07.120 --> 03:15:09.520
you are not dependent on them

03:15:09.520 --> 03:15:11.680
for emotional stability or survival.

03:15:11.680 --> 03:15:12.880
As you get close to somebody

03:15:12.880 --> 03:15:14.800
you really come to depend on them

03:15:14.800 --> 03:15:16.520
and then you tend to objectify them less.

03:15:16.520 --> 03:15:18.820
And so this book, the book is, the name is kind of corny

03:15:18.820 --> 03:15:20.280
but it's written by an analyst again,

03:15:20.280 --> 03:15:21.600
it's called Can Love Last?

03:15:21.600 --> 03:15:26.260
And it's a book about how really good strong relationships

03:15:26.260 --> 03:15:28.560
are the consequence of people constantly moving

03:15:28.560 --> 03:15:33.280
through this dependency objectification dynamic.

03:15:33.300 --> 03:15:37.100
And I use those words in the true, in the psychological sense

03:15:37.100 --> 03:15:39.140
not in the way they're typically thrown around nowadays.

03:15:39.140 --> 03:15:43.380
So, you know, in some cultures men and women

03:15:43.380 --> 03:15:46.940
will only touch for two weeks out of the month.

03:15:46.940 --> 03:15:48.600
And then for the other two weeks,

03:15:49.540 --> 03:15:52.580
the excitement and the sensuality and all,

03:15:52.580 --> 03:15:54.700
and the sexuality is very heightened.

03:15:54.700 --> 03:15:56.500
And then they go back to this kind of distancing.

03:15:56.500 --> 03:15:58.700
Now, I don't think that's feasible for most people

03:15:58.700 --> 03:16:00.240
but if you look statistically,

03:16:00.240 --> 03:16:02.940
those relationships tend to last a very long time

03:16:03.560 --> 03:16:05.920
with at least reported mutual feelings

03:16:05.920 --> 03:16:10.500
of intense attraction for many, many, many decades.

03:16:10.500 --> 03:16:14.640
So human beings need to learn how to at least understand

03:16:14.640 --> 03:16:16.040
and control these dynamics.

03:16:16.040 --> 03:16:17.880
And there's a lot of divorce, there's a lot of cheating,

03:16:17.880 --> 03:16:18.840
there's a lot of stuff out there.

03:16:18.840 --> 03:16:20.920
It'd be great if people could resolve some of this stuff

03:16:20.920 --> 03:16:23.080
inside of the relationship, in my opinion.

03:16:24.280 --> 03:16:26.840
Yeah, and this kind of intense attraction,

03:16:27.100 --> 03:16:30.100
there's actually one of the poems

03:16:30.100 --> 03:16:32.980
that Carl Deisseroth introduced me to,

03:16:32.980 --> 03:16:35.300
I think it's Two English Poems is the name.

03:16:35.300 --> 03:16:38.820
But one of the things I find myself

03:16:38.820 --> 03:16:42.140
for prolonged periods being attracted to

03:16:42.980 --> 03:16:46.980
is like you notice some kind of magic

03:16:47.780 --> 03:16:50.780
and you keep wanting to dig to the depths

03:16:50.780 --> 03:16:53.180
like of that magic.

03:16:53.180 --> 03:16:55.180
You need to really, really, really, really, really,

03:16:55.280 --> 03:16:56.280
of that magic.

03:16:56.280 --> 03:16:57.800
You need to really know that person.

03:16:57.800 --> 03:17:00.360
To really know a person deeply, yeah.

03:17:00.360 --> 03:17:03.400
You notice something early on,

03:17:03.400 --> 03:17:04.500
I don't know what that is,

03:17:04.500 --> 03:17:06.640
but you just notice something special

03:17:06.640 --> 03:17:09.080
and you wanna keep pulling at that thread

03:17:09.080 --> 03:17:10.640
and you never really do.

03:17:10.640 --> 03:17:12.040
Well, you also have to be careful,

03:17:12.040 --> 03:17:13.600
I get a lot of questions from guys,

03:17:13.600 --> 03:17:14.680
you have to be careful of the questions

03:17:14.680 --> 03:17:16.400
you ask in a relationship too.

03:17:16.400 --> 03:17:18.400
You have to make sure you really want that information.

03:17:18.400 --> 03:17:20.080
And it's not just about people's past, right?

03:17:20.080 --> 03:17:21.800
If you ask somebody how they really feel

03:17:21.800 --> 03:17:24.680
about something about you and they tell you,

03:17:24.680 --> 03:17:27.900
that may be soothing, it may be intensely stressful.

03:17:27.900 --> 03:17:31.260
You have to be, here's one thing I know for sure,

03:17:31.260 --> 03:17:34.020
for a relationship to work, you have to be brave.

03:17:34.900 --> 03:17:37.480
You can't go in there fully protected

03:17:37.480 --> 03:17:39.660
and yet you also can't go in there with no boundaries

03:17:39.660 --> 03:17:42.260
because you'll end up beat up.

03:17:42.260 --> 03:17:43.260
What's that quote?

03:17:43.260 --> 03:17:45.140
If you wanna be a warrior, prepare to get hurt.

03:17:45.140 --> 03:17:47.260
If you wanna be an explorer, prepare to get lost.

03:17:47.260 --> 03:17:50.660
And if you wanna be both, and if you become a lover,

03:17:50.660 --> 03:17:52.900
prepare to be both or something like that.

03:17:52.900 --> 03:17:55.080
I forget, this is one of these Instagram type things

03:17:55.080 --> 03:17:57.280
that you see passing by and you go, oh, that's pretty true.

03:17:57.280 --> 03:17:59.920
Love's scary because it takes us back

03:17:59.920 --> 03:18:03.000
to that primitive circuitry that is as primitive

03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:05.820
and basic as hunger, thirst, the desire for heat

03:18:05.820 --> 03:18:10.060
when we're cold, the desire for cold when we're overly warm.

03:18:10.060 --> 03:18:11.940
It's a, it's dinorphin.

03:18:11.940 --> 03:18:14.600
I mean, when somebody leaves, like the, you know,

03:18:14.600 --> 03:18:17.880
when somebody you are attached to leaves by death

03:18:17.880 --> 03:18:20.680
or by decision, or you're forced apart,

03:18:20.740 --> 03:18:23.180
the dinorphin release is massive.

03:18:23.180 --> 03:18:24.500
It is true discomfort.

03:18:24.500 --> 03:18:27.740
People feel anxiety and discomfort.

03:18:27.740 --> 03:18:30.220
And moving through that is a hell of a process.

03:18:30.220 --> 03:18:32.820
I mean, if I knew how to best break up

03:18:32.820 --> 03:18:35.500
at the neurological level, or if you could just plug yourself

03:18:35.500 --> 03:18:39.400
into a wall and reset, I mean, I'd do that episode tomorrow,

03:18:39.400 --> 03:18:41.380
but we don't have that knowledge.

03:18:41.380 --> 03:18:44.100
Come on, I think we've covered this before

03:18:44.100 --> 03:18:45.820
and it's even been memeified.

03:18:45.820 --> 03:18:49.540
I think losing love is part of the magic of love.

03:18:49.540 --> 03:18:51.480
It means you've felt something.

03:18:51.480 --> 03:18:52.320
I agree.

03:18:52.320 --> 03:18:54.720
But at some point, like if you've done it enough times,

03:18:54.720 --> 03:18:57.480
you know, life is finite, you know?

03:18:57.480 --> 03:18:59.820
It is beautiful to see these couples

03:18:59.820 --> 03:19:04.820
that seem very much in love despite many years,

03:19:04.960 --> 03:19:06.640
despite having been together many years.

03:19:06.640 --> 03:19:08.400
Yeah, the way they look at each other.

03:19:08.400 --> 03:19:09.240
Yeah, they'll say-

03:19:09.240 --> 03:19:10.200
They still see the magic.

03:19:10.200 --> 03:19:11.920
Yeah, and they'll say, we got lucky,

03:19:11.920 --> 03:19:14.120
or it was, it's been hard, or this and that.

03:19:14.120 --> 03:19:18.560
I think external conditions being a little tougher

03:19:18.580 --> 03:19:20.660
is helpful for a couple.

03:19:20.660 --> 03:19:21.500
Hardship.

03:19:21.500 --> 03:19:24.740
I do, I do, because I think that you rally, you know,

03:19:24.740 --> 03:19:26.580
and you bond with people, you know,

03:19:26.580 --> 03:19:29.180
obviously you want to survive those conditions,

03:19:29.180 --> 03:19:31.620
but yeah, I do.

03:19:31.620 --> 03:19:32.460
I think that-

03:19:32.460 --> 03:19:33.780
Bonnie and Clyde.

03:19:33.780 --> 03:19:34.620
So, and you-

03:19:34.620 --> 03:19:35.740
Well, they were a little-

03:19:35.740 --> 03:19:37.460
Oh, a little too much.

03:19:37.460 --> 03:19:38.820
Well, a little too much.

03:19:38.820 --> 03:19:41.100
They were sociopaths, but the,

03:19:41.100 --> 03:19:41.940
well, when two sociopaths-

03:19:41.940 --> 03:19:44.100
Love can make you do crazy things.

03:19:44.100 --> 03:19:45.060
Well, normally, it's interesting,

03:19:45.060 --> 03:19:47.580
normally sociopaths don't team up

03:19:47.580 --> 03:19:50.080
because they manipulate each other.

03:19:50.080 --> 03:19:53.520
Sociopaths, sadly, are usually only interested

03:19:53.520 --> 03:19:56.920
in manipulating the highly pliable or unsuspecting,

03:19:58.480 --> 03:20:01.860
but when romantic attraction is woven in,

03:20:01.860 --> 03:20:05.440
then it gets really diabolical.

03:20:05.440 --> 03:20:09.440
Any advice on finding the love of your life, of my life?

03:20:09.440 --> 03:20:13.640
This is, why Lex's single response, any advice?

03:20:15.460 --> 03:20:17.340
Yeah, actually, this comes from a friend of mine

03:20:17.340 --> 03:20:19.660
who's in a really excellent marriage

03:20:19.660 --> 03:20:23.360
with great kids and family and high demand life.

03:20:24.420 --> 03:20:25.620
It's a decision.

03:20:25.620 --> 03:20:28.580
Like at some point you just prioritize it as,

03:20:28.580 --> 03:20:33.340
okay, I'm going to make this happen one way or another.

03:20:33.340 --> 03:20:36.580
And you don't force the discovery of that person.

03:20:36.580 --> 03:20:38.780
But I mean, I've occasionally said,

03:20:38.780 --> 03:20:41.020
hey, I think you should meet this person or that person.

03:20:41.020 --> 03:20:45.180
And well, it wasn't, maybe my judgment might've been off,

03:20:45.180 --> 03:20:47.180
but the timing wasn't right or something.

03:20:47.180 --> 03:20:49.960
But I think that, yeah, it's a decision

03:20:49.960 --> 03:20:52.160
and it also has to do with life structure.

03:20:52.160 --> 03:20:53.000
I mean, there were years.

03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:54.900
So when I was in graduate school,

03:20:54.900 --> 03:20:56.380
I didn't want a girlfriend.

03:20:56.380 --> 03:20:57.580
I just wanted to be in lab.

03:20:57.580 --> 03:21:00.620
And sure, I had romantic dating interests,

03:21:00.620 --> 03:21:01.700
but I wasn't going to meet them

03:21:01.700 --> 03:21:04.420
through a committed live together situation.

03:21:04.420 --> 03:21:05.700
It wasn't where I was at.

03:21:05.700 --> 03:21:07.340
And as a postdoc, things are a little different,

03:21:07.340 --> 03:21:08.180
et cetera, et cetera.

03:21:08.180 --> 03:21:09.900
So, but at some point it's sort of like,

03:21:09.900 --> 03:21:12.420
what do I want my daily routine to look like?

03:21:12.420 --> 03:21:15.240
Because ultimately a relationship,

03:21:15.240 --> 03:21:16.260
however one structures it,

03:21:16.260 --> 03:21:18.140
is going to be part of your daily routine.

03:21:18.140 --> 03:21:19.180
So at the point where you're like,

03:21:19.180 --> 03:21:21.740
you know, I'd really love to wake up next to somebody

03:21:21.740 --> 03:21:23.940
and do blank and blank together.

03:21:23.940 --> 03:21:26.340
And then I'd love to work.

03:21:26.340 --> 03:21:27.620
And then we meet for dinner.

03:21:27.620 --> 03:21:29.280
And then we, you know, take the dog for a walk

03:21:29.280 --> 03:21:31.660
or take kids out or whatever it happens to be,

03:21:31.660 --> 03:21:32.940
take a trip or do it.

03:21:32.940 --> 03:21:35.700
You have to be, one has to be in the mindset

03:21:35.700 --> 03:21:38.740
of wanting to do couple like things, people.

03:21:38.740 --> 03:21:40.500
And a lot of people don't think about it that way.

03:21:40.500 --> 03:21:43.220
They either fall into something

03:21:43.220 --> 03:21:48.220
or they don't see the benefits of coupling up.

03:21:48.460 --> 03:21:52.260
I think that the pandemic tuned people's awareness

03:21:52.260 --> 03:21:57.020
to the fact that some things are indeed easier on your own.

03:21:57.940 --> 03:21:59.720
It depends on finances, et cetera, et cetera.

03:21:59.720 --> 03:22:03.780
But a lot of things are made better

03:22:03.780 --> 03:22:05.700
done with other people.

03:22:05.700 --> 03:22:10.600
100%, but I also, so I was very deliberately,

03:22:10.800 --> 03:22:13.360
it's an interesting way to put it.

03:22:13.360 --> 03:22:15.440
What do you want your day to look like?

03:22:15.440 --> 03:22:17.280
I think what do you want your day to look like?

03:22:17.280 --> 03:22:18.720
What do you want your life to be?

03:22:18.720 --> 03:22:23.040
I was very deliberately always, first of all,

03:22:23.040 --> 03:22:27.320
happy to be alone, like a conscious thinking.

03:22:27.320 --> 03:22:31.240
I know a lot of friends who are just unable to be alone.

03:22:31.240 --> 03:22:34.380
I'm able to be alone, but I'm much happier

03:22:34.380 --> 03:22:35.800
with another person.

03:22:35.800 --> 03:22:39.640
Like I'm able to share joy with other humans.

03:22:39.640 --> 03:22:43.560
I look forward to the day that our kids are rolling jiu-jitsu

03:22:43.560 --> 03:22:47.160
and my kids are hanging out with your kids.

03:22:47.160 --> 03:22:52.160
And if that notion sounds even remotely interesting

03:22:52.520 --> 03:22:56.240
and fun, then it's sort of like you kind of backpedal

03:22:56.240 --> 03:22:57.720
from that and you go, what has to happen?

03:22:57.720 --> 03:22:59.560
How do you get there?

03:22:59.560 --> 03:23:04.000
First engineer and think from first principles about love.

03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:07.040
Andrew, thank you for being my friend.

03:23:07.040 --> 03:23:08.600
Thank you for being an amazing human being

03:23:08.600 --> 03:23:11.680
who's so inspiring to so many people for constantly.

03:23:11.680 --> 03:23:13.640
I told this to Carl, like one of the things

03:23:13.640 --> 03:23:18.640
that was really refreshing about you is that

03:23:21.840 --> 03:23:24.000
when I tell you an idea and I tell you a thought,

03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:25.800
when I tell you something,

03:23:25.800 --> 03:23:29.360
you don't shut it down as a first step.

03:23:29.360 --> 03:23:31.360
I was saying that that's common in a scientific community.

03:23:31.360 --> 03:23:32.960
That's common in people around you.

03:23:32.960 --> 03:23:34.760
You're seeing what's the goal there.

03:23:34.760 --> 03:23:37.040
You get excited, you get excited together.

03:23:37.160 --> 03:23:40.560
And that's how you can really have a great friendship

03:23:40.560 --> 03:23:43.560
and a great stuff together.

03:23:43.560 --> 03:23:45.360
So I'm deeply grateful for that.

03:23:45.360 --> 03:23:50.240
And just for connecting so many interesting people together.

03:23:50.240 --> 03:23:51.880
You're doing an amazing job, man.

03:23:51.880 --> 03:23:54.080
And thank you for existing.

03:23:54.080 --> 03:23:54.960
Thank you for being you.

03:23:54.960 --> 03:23:56.320
Thank you for talking today.

03:23:56.320 --> 03:23:58.680
And next time I'll see you in the sauna.

03:23:58.680 --> 03:24:01.240
Yeah, well, I wanna say several things.

03:24:01.240 --> 03:24:03.080
First of all, thank you for having me on again.

03:24:03.080 --> 03:24:04.560
It's an honor and a pleasure.

03:24:04.560 --> 03:24:05.600
I don't say that formally.

03:24:05.600 --> 03:24:08.120
I'd really truly mean it.

03:24:08.120 --> 03:24:10.960
The Huberman Lab Podcast, as I always say, only exists

03:24:10.960 --> 03:24:12.680
because you gave me the suggestion

03:24:12.680 --> 03:24:14.960
and I'm so grateful that you did.

03:24:14.960 --> 03:24:16.000
So thank you.

03:24:16.000 --> 03:24:18.360
And for doing what you do.

03:24:18.360 --> 03:24:20.800
You are brave and you're a first man in

03:24:20.800 --> 03:24:22.720
and you're just continue to do it.

03:24:22.720 --> 03:24:24.760
As my postdoc advisor used to say,

03:24:24.760 --> 03:24:27.520
whatever you're doing, just keep going.

03:24:27.520 --> 03:24:29.440
And then in terms of our friendship,

03:24:29.440 --> 03:24:33.000
I think you know and if you don't,

03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:34.320
I'm gonna just keep telling you anyway

03:24:34.320 --> 03:24:37.280
by texting in person, you're an amazing friend.

03:24:37.280 --> 03:24:40.600
There's deep trust, there's immense respect

03:24:40.600 --> 03:24:42.960
and I love you, brother.

03:24:42.960 --> 03:24:44.520
I love you too, man.

03:24:44.520 --> 03:24:46.080
We did it.

03:24:46.080 --> 03:24:47.480
Thanks for listening to this conversation

03:24:47.480 --> 03:24:48.760
with Andrew Huberman.

03:24:48.760 --> 03:24:50.040
To support this podcast,

03:24:52.600 --> 03:24:54.440
And now let me leave you with some words

03:24:54.440 --> 03:24:57.040
from Ralph Waldo Emerson.

03:24:57.040 --> 03:24:59.640
It is one of the blessings of old friends

03:24:59.640 --> 03:25:02.480
that you can afford to be stupid with them.

03:25:02.480 --> 03:25:04.840
I look forward to doing just that

03:25:04.840 --> 03:25:06.640
in the many years to come

03:25:06.640 --> 03:25:09.680
of friendship and fun conversations with Andrew.

03:25:09.680 --> 03:25:12.840
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
