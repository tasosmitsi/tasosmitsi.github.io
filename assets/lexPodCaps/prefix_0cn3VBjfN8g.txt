The person who controls the algorithm controls the world, right?

00:04.380 --> 00:10.920
And if you are committed to one specific platform as your singular source of

00:10.920 --> 00:15.700
information or affiliated platforms, then whoever controls the algorithm or

00:15.700 --> 00:17.780
the programming there controls you.

00:20.280 --> 00:23.980
The following is a conversation with Mark Cuban, a multi-billionaire

00:23.980 --> 00:28.660
businessman and investor and star of the series Shark Tank, longtime principal

00:28.660 --> 00:34.240
owner of the Dallas Mavericks and is someone who is unafraid to get into

00:34.240 --> 00:39.740
frequent battles on X, most recently over topics of DEI, wokeism, gender,

00:39.940 --> 00:44.320
and identity politics with the likes of Elon Musk and Jordan Peterson.

00:44.940 --> 00:47.740
This is the Lex Fridman podcast to support it.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.840
Please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:50.240 --> 00:53.620
And now dear friends, here's Mark Cuban.

00:54.620 --> 00:59.440
You've started many businesses, invested in many businesses, heard a lot of

00:59.440 --> 01:01.580
pitches privately and on Shark Tank.

01:02.120 --> 01:06.040
So you're the perfect person to ask what makes a great entrepreneur?

01:07.040 --> 01:08.620
Somebody who's curious.

01:08.740 --> 01:11.140
They want to keep on learning because business is ever changing.

01:11.140 --> 01:12.120
It's never static.

01:12.800 --> 01:17.100
Somebody who's agile because as you learn new things and the environment

01:17.100 --> 01:20.560
around you changes, you have to be able to adapt and make the changes.

01:21.400 --> 01:27.360
Um, and somebody who can sell because no business has ever survived without sales.

01:27.760 --> 01:32.240
And as an entrepreneur who's creating a company, whatever your product or service

01:32.240 --> 01:36.680
is, if that's not the most important thing and you're just dying and excited to

01:36.680 --> 01:40.160
tell people about it, then you're not going to succeed, but it's also a skill thing.

01:40.200 --> 01:40.920
How do you sell?

01:41.320 --> 01:42.200
What do you mean by selling?

01:42.200 --> 01:43.200
Selling is just helping.

01:43.360 --> 01:48.120
I've always looked at it about putting myself in the shoes of another person

01:48.120 --> 01:49.380
and asking a simple question.

01:49.600 --> 01:50.540
Can I help this person?

01:50.800 --> 01:54.240
Can my product help them from the time I was 12 years old, selling garbage bags

01:54.240 --> 01:58.000
door to door and just asking a simple question, do you use garbage bags?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.160
Do you need garbage bags?

01:59.160 --> 02:00.440
Well, let me save you some time.

02:00.680 --> 02:04.080
I'll bring them to your house and drop them off to, you know, streaming.

02:04.160 --> 02:07.120
Um, why do we need streaming when we have TV and radio?

02:07.120 --> 02:10.280
Well, you can't get access to your TV and radio everywhere you go.

02:10.600 --> 02:14.760
So we kind of break down geographic and physical barriers and, you know, cost

02:14.760 --> 02:18.200
plus drugs, you know, what's the product that we actually sell?

02:18.240 --> 02:23.080
We sell trust, um, in a simplistic approach, we buy drugs and sell drugs,

02:23.080 --> 02:28.000
but we add transparency to it and bringing transparency to an industry is,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.400
is a differentiation and it helps people.

02:30.520 --> 02:33.600
Trust in an industry that's highly lacking in trust.

02:33.840 --> 02:34.400
Exactly.

02:35.000 --> 02:35.400
Okay.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.760
So what's, what's the trick to selling garbage bags?

02:37.760 --> 02:39.200
Let's go back there at 12 years old.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.520
What, I mean, is it just your natural charisma?

02:41.560 --> 02:45.400
I guess a good question to ask, are you born with it or can you develop it?

02:45.520 --> 02:46.720
Oh, you can definitely develop it.

02:46.960 --> 02:47.240
Yeah.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.520
I mean, because selling garbage bags door to door was easy.

02:49.560 --> 02:49.800
Right.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.960
It was like 12 year old Mark going, hi, my name is Mark.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.440
Do you use garbage bags?

02:54.800 --> 02:56.080
You know what the answer is going to be.

02:56.120 --> 02:56.520
Right.

02:56.560 --> 02:57.800
Can I just drop them off for you?

02:57.800 --> 03:00.480
You know, once a week, whenever you need them, you just call and I'll bring them

03:00.480 --> 03:00.880
down.

03:00.920 --> 03:01.320
Sure.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.200
So that was easy, but I'm sure you've been rejected.

03:04.680 --> 03:05.400
Oh yeah, of course.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.400
Not everybody says yes.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.880
What's your, what was your percentage?

03:08.200 --> 03:10.480
I don't remember, but it's pretty close to a hundred percent.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.480
So that's why you don't remember.

03:13.280 --> 03:13.600
Right.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.560
Cause he's going to say no to a 12 year old kid.

03:15.560 --> 03:19.360
He's going to save time and money, but you know, typically my career, where I've

03:19.360 --> 03:24.200
started companies, it's to do something that other people aren't doing, whether it

03:24.200 --> 03:29.440
was connecting PCs and to local area networks and at micro solutions and you

03:29.440 --> 03:34.760
know, the salesmanship was walking into a company and just saying, look, talk to me

03:34.760 --> 03:37.600
and I can help you improve your productivity and your profitability.

03:37.800 --> 03:38.760
Is that important to you?

03:39.120 --> 03:40.640
And the answer is obviously always yes.

03:40.640 --> 03:43.880
And then the question is, can I do the job and can I do it cost effectively?

03:44.200 --> 03:48.560
And so you didn't have to be a born salesperson to be able to ask those

03:48.560 --> 03:52.640
questions, but you have to be able to be willing to put in the time to learn that

03:52.640 --> 03:55.120
business and that's the hardest part.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.600
I'm sure there's a skill thing to it too.

03:57.600 --> 04:01.440
And like how you solve the puzzle of communicating with the

04:01.440 --> 04:02.840
person and convincing them.

04:03.560 --> 04:03.800
Yeah.

04:03.800 --> 04:07.280
I mean, there's skill from the perspective that I read like a maniac.

04:07.640 --> 04:12.080
Then like now you can give me an example of any type of business and it'll take

04:12.080 --> 04:14.840
me two seconds to figure out how they make money and how I can make them more

04:15.320 --> 04:15.920
productive.

04:15.920 --> 04:20.600
And I think that's probably my biggest skill, being able to just drill down to

04:20.640 --> 04:22.360
what the actual need is, if any.

04:22.760 --> 04:26.480
And then, you know, from there being able to say, well, if this is what this

04:26.480 --> 04:31.280
company does and this is what their goal is, how can I introduce something new

04:31.280 --> 04:32.560
that they haven't seen before?

04:32.800 --> 04:35.320
And is that a business that I can create and make money from?

04:35.640 --> 04:39.040
So figure out how this kind of business makes money in the present and then

04:39.320 --> 04:42.680
figure out, is there a way to make more money in the future by introducing a

04:42.680 --> 04:43.600
totally new kind of thing?

04:43.640 --> 04:44.040
Correct.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.360
And you can just do that with anything.

04:46.440 --> 04:46.880
Pretty much.

04:46.880 --> 04:47.080
Yeah.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.840
And you think you're born with that?

04:50.160 --> 04:53.400
No, I worked at it because, you know, going back to what I said earlier about

04:53.400 --> 04:57.640
curiosity, you have to be insanely curious because the world is always changing.

04:57.640 --> 05:01.480
My dad used to say, we don't live in the world we were born into, you know, which

05:01.480 --> 05:02.400
is absolutely true.

05:02.480 --> 05:07.840
If you're not a voracious consumer of information, then you're not going to be

05:07.840 --> 05:11.320
able to keep up and no matter what your sales skills or ability are, they're

05:11.320 --> 05:12.040
going to be useless.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.720
What'd you learn about life from your dad?

05:14.960 --> 05:15.920
You mentioned your dad.

05:16.360 --> 05:20.560
My dad did upholstery on cars, you know, got up, went to work every morning at

05:20.560 --> 05:24.280
seven o'clock, came back five or six, seven o'clock exhausted.

05:24.560 --> 05:27.200
And I learned to be nice.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.880
I learned to be caring.

05:28.920 --> 05:35.240
I learned to be accepting just, you know, qualities that I think he really tried

05:35.240 --> 05:39.720
to pass on to myself and my two younger brothers were just be a good human, you

05:39.720 --> 05:42.160
know, and I think, you know, he didn't have business experience.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.360
So as I got into business, he would just, you know, say, sorry, Mark, I can't

05:45.360 --> 05:47.640
help you, you know, I don't understand what you're doing.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.840
You never went to, neither one of my parents had gone to college.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.440
Um, you've got to figure it out for yourself.

05:52.440 --> 05:56.800
But he was also very insistent that, um, he, you know, he worked at a company

05:56.800 --> 06:00.400
called Regency Products where they did upholstery on cars and he would bring me

06:00.400 --> 06:03.920
there to sweep the floors, not because he wanted me to learn that business, because

06:03.960 --> 06:06.320
he wanted me to learn how backbreaking that work was.

06:06.720 --> 06:10.040
I mean, he lost an eye in an accident at work, um, a staple broke.

06:10.480 --> 06:15.520
Um, and he, the only thing he wanted from my brothers and I was for us to never

06:15.520 --> 06:17.880
have to work like that, to go to college, to figure it out.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.080
You said to be nice.

06:19.120 --> 06:23.320
That said, you also said that you, when you were first starting a business, you

06:23.320 --> 06:25.840
were a bit more of an asshole than you wish you would have been.

06:25.840 --> 06:26.360
Absolutely.

06:26.360 --> 06:26.720
Yeah.

06:26.760 --> 06:27.080
Yeah.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.040
Because I was more of a yeller.

06:29.040 --> 06:33.720
I was, you know, I didn't know really what you see on the

06:33.720 --> 06:36.120
sidelines, you know, with me at a Mavs game, maybe a little bit.

06:36.160 --> 06:41.280
But I also didn't have any patience for somebody I thought wasn't using

06:41.280 --> 06:43.280
my kind of common sense, right?

06:43.280 --> 06:47.960
Because I was always on the go, go, go, go, go when I, particularly when I was

06:47.960 --> 06:52.760
younger, just trying to be successful, trying to get to the point where I had

06:52.800 --> 06:56.160
independence and I would tell this to people, you know, either you're speeding

06:56.160 --> 06:59.520
up and getting on the train or, you know, we'll stop and drop you off at the

06:59.520 --> 07:01.760
next station, but let's go where you go.

07:02.440 --> 07:06.280
Did you have trouble with the hire fast, fire fast part of running a business?

07:06.360 --> 07:07.000
Yeah, always.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.280
Cause I hated firing people.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.920
Cause it meant one, it was an admission of a mistake in the hiring.

07:10.920 --> 07:16.800
And two, the salesperson to me always wanted to come out ahead and I

07:16.800 --> 07:19.760
was always horrible at firing, but I always partnered with people who had

07:19.760 --> 07:23.280
no problem with it, so I always delegated that.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.120
Well, that's the tricky thing.

07:24.120 --> 07:27.120
When you, when you're working with somebody and they're not quite there

07:28.120 --> 07:31.960
and you have to decide, are they going to step up and grow into the person

07:31.960 --> 07:33.920
that that's the right or they're not?

07:34.760 --> 07:37.720
And in that gray area is probably where you have to fire.

07:37.840 --> 07:38.360
It was hard.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.000
Yeah, for sure.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.840
Because, you know, there is obviously a failure somewhere in the process, you

07:43.840 --> 07:45.000
know, what did we do wrong?

07:45.120 --> 07:51.720
And when I would interview people for jobs, I think 99% of the people I've

07:51.720 --> 07:56.120
ever interviewed, I've wanted to hire because in my mind it was like, okay, I

07:56.120 --> 07:57.640
can figure out how to make this person work.

07:57.960 --> 07:58.240
Right.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.280
And then they wouldn't.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.640
And then, you know, people at the company would be like, Mark, you suck at this.

08:02.920 --> 08:06.080
You know, and so I always delegated the hiring.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.680
Yeah, I mean, I'm the same.

08:07.680 --> 08:08.800
I see the potential in people.

08:08.800 --> 08:12.560
I see the beauty in people and which is, which is a great way to live life.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.360
But when you're running a company is a different thing.

08:14.360 --> 08:14.800
It's different.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.600
And you got to know what you're good at when you're bad at.

08:16.600 --> 08:16.960
Right.

08:17.280 --> 08:22.280
I was good at, you know, I was a ready fire aim guy and I always partnered

08:22.280 --> 08:25.600
with people who were very anal and perfectionist because where I could

08:25.600 --> 08:27.000
just go, go, go, go, go, go.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.120
They would keep me in, keep me inside the baselines.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.160
They would do the due diligence.

08:31.240 --> 08:31.600
Yeah.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.480
Or just, yeah, the detail work, the dot, the I's and the cross the T's.

08:34.920 --> 08:38.480
Uh, what does it take to take that first leap into starting a business?

08:38.520 --> 08:39.400
That's the hardest part.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.800
It really depends on your personal circumstances.

08:41.800 --> 08:42.680
Like I got fired.

08:42.800 --> 08:45.880
I mean, I was sleeping on the floor, six guys in a three bedroom apartment.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.760
So I couldn't go any lower.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.560
So there was no downside.

08:50.800 --> 08:51.040
Yeah.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.960
There was no downside for me starting a business.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.440
And it was just like, you know, I was 25 when we started micro solutions and.

08:57.920 --> 09:02.680
You know, I just gotten fired and it was like, look, I'm a lousy employee.

09:03.120 --> 09:07.960
Um, I'm going to just start going to some of my prospects that I had at my job

09:07.960 --> 09:12.520
and ask them to front the money that I needed to install some software and

09:12.880 --> 09:16.080
found this company, architectural lighting, who put up $500 for me.

09:16.360 --> 09:19.560
That allowed me to buy software and have 50% margins.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.880
And, you know, that's how I started my company.

09:22.080 --> 09:25.120
But like by way of advice, would you say, I mean, it's a terrifying thing.

09:25.240 --> 09:25.520
Yeah.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.560
I mean, you've got to be in a position where you're confident.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.520
You know, I get emails and approached by people all the time.

09:30.760 --> 09:33.320
You know, what kind of business should I start that tells me you're

09:33.320 --> 09:34.840
not ready to start a business, right?

09:34.840 --> 09:38.040
Either you're prepared and you know what you don't, you know, in the

09:38.040 --> 09:44.280
United States with the American dream, everybody kind of always looks at

09:44.280 --> 09:47.240
themselves and say, okay, you know, I have this idea, right?

09:47.480 --> 09:51.120
And then you go through this process of saying, okay, you know, you talk to

09:51.120 --> 09:52.520
your friends or family, what do you think?

09:52.760 --> 09:54.960
And then almost always, oh, it's a great idea, right?

09:54.960 --> 09:58.560
Then you go on Google and you say, oh my God, no one else is doing it

09:58.560 --> 10:01.240
without thinking, you know, 10 companies have gone out of business

10:01.240 --> 10:04.000
trying the same thing, but okay, it's on Google.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.280
And then people stop, right?

10:06.280 --> 10:10.960
Because that next step means, okay, I have to change what I'm doing in my life.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.960
And that's not easy for 99% of the people.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.920
Some people look at that as an opportunity and get excited about it.

10:17.160 --> 10:20.440
Some people get terrified because it's okay.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.800
Maybe I'm comfortable.

10:21.840 --> 10:23.640
Maybe I have responsibilities.

10:24.080 --> 10:28.600
And so whatever your circumstances are, if you want to take that next step, you

10:28.600 --> 10:32.360
have to be able to deal with the consequences of changing your circumstances.

10:32.760 --> 10:35.760
And that's the first thing, you know, do you save money?

10:35.800 --> 10:38.680
You know, so you have, you know, if you have a job, do you have a mortgage?

10:38.680 --> 10:39.480
Do you have a family?

10:39.480 --> 10:40.280
You've got to save money.

10:40.280 --> 10:43.520
You can't just walk, you know, I mean, they've got to eat and they've got to

10:43.520 --> 10:46.800
have shelter, but on the other side of the coin, if you've got nothing,

10:47.160 --> 10:49.080
it's the perfect time to start a business.

10:49.120 --> 10:49.240
Yeah.

10:49.240 --> 10:52.880
Desperation is a good catalyst for starting a business, but in many cases,

10:53.240 --> 10:56.440
the decision, as you're talking about, you're going to have to make is to leave

10:56.440 --> 11:00.480
a job that's providing some degree of comfort already.

11:00.480 --> 11:04.120
So I suppose when you're sleeping on the floor and there's six guys,

11:04.280 --> 11:05.320
it's a little bit easier.

11:05.320 --> 11:06.200
It's really easy, right?

11:06.240 --> 11:08.920
Particularly when you get fired and you don't have a job, you know, and you're

11:08.920 --> 11:11.280
looking at bartending at night to try to pay the bills.

11:11.280 --> 11:16.760
And so it wasn't hard for me, but to your point, it really comes down to

11:16.760 --> 11:20.640
preparation, you know, if it's important enough to you, you'll save the money.

11:20.640 --> 11:25.080
You'll give up, you know, whatever it is you need to give up to put the money

11:25.080 --> 11:30.840
aside, if you have obligations, you'll put in the work to learn as much as

11:30.840 --> 11:34.960
you can about that industry so that when you start your business, you're prepared.

11:35.400 --> 11:39.560
And you can always, you know, at night on weekends, whenever you find time

11:39.560 --> 11:43.080
lunch, start making the calls to find out if people will write you a check,

11:43.080 --> 11:46.040
you know, or transfer you the money to buy whatever it is you're selling.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.720
And by doing those things, you can put yourself in a position to succeed.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.400
It's where people just think, okay, you know, Geronimo, I'm

11:53.400 --> 11:56.240
leaving off the edge of a cliff and I'm starting a business.

11:56.360 --> 11:57.120
That's tough.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.280
But sometimes that's like the way you do it though.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.040
There's always examples of any situation or scenario, right?

12:02.680 --> 12:04.840
But I mean, total evidence for everything.

12:04.920 --> 12:05.320
Yeah.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.880
But if you're, if you're going into a new business, you're going to have competition

12:07.880 --> 12:09.800
unless you're really, really, really, really, really lucky.

12:10.120 --> 12:13.600
And that competition is not going to just say, okay, that Lex or Mark just kick our

12:13.640 --> 12:13.960
ass.

12:14.360 --> 12:17.640
And so you've got to be prepared to how you're going to deal with that competition.

12:18.520 --> 12:24.360
Well, what do you think that is about America that has so many people who have

12:24.360 --> 12:27.280
that dream and act on that dream of starting a business?

12:28.000 --> 12:34.360
You know, I think we've just got a culture of consumption and more, you

12:34.360 --> 12:41.080
know, and to get more, um, you've got to, you know, creating a business gives you

12:41.120 --> 12:44.040
the greatest potential upside and the greatest leverage on your time.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.160
Um, but it also creates the most risk.

12:47.680 --> 12:52.960
So that capitalist machine, there's a lot of elements by contrast, uh, the

12:52.960 --> 12:57.760
respect for the law, like an entrepreneur can trust that if they pull it off, the

12:57.760 --> 12:58.760
law will protect them.

12:58.760 --> 12:59.640
There won't be a government.

12:59.640 --> 13:00.520
Hopefully that's still the case.

13:00.520 --> 13:00.760
Yeah.

13:00.960 --> 13:04.680
Well, yeah, there's always, uh, other countries, right?

13:04.680 --> 13:04.880
Right.

13:04.880 --> 13:09.080
So us versus other countries, like Joe Biden, of all people said to me, um, it

13:09.080 --> 13:13.000
was at an entrepreneurship conference that when he was vice president, he had

13:13.000 --> 13:18.120
put together and we had gone up there from a bunch of us from Shark Tank to

13:18.120 --> 13:20.400
talk to young entrepreneurs from around the world.

13:20.840 --> 13:24.200
And he said to me, Mark, you know, the one thing that separates, I've been to

13:24.200 --> 13:25.400
every country around the world.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.800
And the one thing that separates us is entrepreneurship.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.400
We're the most entrepreneurial country in the world.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.080
And there's no one else who's even close.

13:33.520 --> 13:38.080
And when you look at the origin of our biggest, you know, the biggest companies

13:38.080 --> 13:42.440
in the world, for the most part, there's an American origin story somewhere behind

13:42.440 --> 13:42.720
there.

13:43.120 --> 13:47.200
And I think, you know, that just gets perpetuated on itself.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.640
We see those Horatio Alger stories.

13:49.640 --> 13:54.280
We see, um, examples of the Jeff Bezos, other world, the Steve jobs in the world.

13:54.280 --> 13:58.120
And those are the types of people we, we want to copy.

13:58.640 --> 13:58.960
Yeah.

13:58.960 --> 14:02.840
We want to be really careful and try to really figure out what that is because we

14:02.840 --> 14:04.920
don't want to lose that for sure.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.960
We want to protect the whatever, you know, and that's a lot of the

14:07.960 --> 14:11.200
discussions about what's the right way to do government, big government, small

14:11.200 --> 14:14.840
government, what's the right policies, what, but also culture, like who we

14:14.840 --> 14:15.320
celebrate.

14:15.320 --> 14:20.400
One of the things that troubles me is that we don't enough celebrate the, uh,

14:20.680 --> 14:24.120
the entrepreneurs that take risks and the entrepreneurs that succeed.

14:24.120 --> 14:29.880
It seems like success, especially when it comes to wealth is, uh, immediately

14:29.880 --> 14:32.400
matched with distrust and criticism, all that kind of stuff.

14:32.440 --> 14:36.560
It's changing for sure because, you know, you can go back just 12 years, right?

14:36.920 --> 14:42.000
Traditional media dominated, let's just say through 2012, you know, that was the

14:42.000 --> 14:45.920
peak of linear television, you know, newspapers weren't as strong, but they

14:45.920 --> 14:48.560
still had some, some breadth and depth to them.

14:48.880 --> 14:52.720
Um, and then social media comes along and everybody gets to play in their own

14:52.720 --> 14:56.640
sandbox and share opinions with people who think just like them.

14:57.040 --> 15:02.800
And that, and it also gives them the opportunity to amplify, um, those feelings.

15:03.280 --> 15:08.920
I think that's where celebrating entrepreneurs really started to subside

15:08.920 --> 15:12.360
some, there were always people who were progressive that were like billionaires

15:12.360 --> 15:16.360
are bad or millionaires are bad, depending on the time period, but you

15:16.360 --> 15:19.360
didn't really see it on an ongoing basis, right?

15:19.560 --> 15:21.120
It wasn't going to be on the evening news.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.000
It wasn't going to be in the front page of the newspaper.

15:24.080 --> 15:27.440
Um, it was going to be, if you read a book and someone talked about it or you

15:27.440 --> 15:31.240
read a magazine and there was an article, um, talking about, you know, this

15:31.240 --> 15:35.080
progressive movement or that progressive move, whatever it may be, um, you know,

15:35.080 --> 15:40.600
and then, or political parties, but now all of that is front and center on

15:40.600 --> 15:44.520
social media and we're trying to figure it out how we deal with the, with the

15:44.520 --> 15:46.720
mobs of people and the virality of it all.

15:47.440 --> 15:51.080
Um, I think we'll find our footing and start celebrating greatness again.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.760
Well, I mean, that's the whole reason I do shark tank.

15:52.800 --> 15:53.320
That's true.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.720
That's that show celebrates the entrepreneur.

15:56.240 --> 16:00.240
It's the only place where every single minute of every single episode, we, you

16:00.240 --> 16:02.160
know, we celebrate the American dream.

16:02.480 --> 16:06.320
And the reason I do it is we tell the entire country and it's shown around

16:06.320 --> 16:10.040
the world, even we, you know, we're, we're amazing advertising for the American

16:10.040 --> 16:14.360
dream and I don't even know how many countries, but every time somebody walks

16:14.360 --> 16:19.680
onto that carpet from Dubuque, Iowa or Ketchum, Idaho, you know, that sends a

16:19.680 --> 16:23.640
message to every kid who's watching seven, eight, nine, 10, 12 year old kid

16:23.960 --> 16:27.240
that if they can do it from Ketchum, Idaho, you can do it.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.760
If they can have this idea and get a deal or even present to the sharks and

16:30.760 --> 16:33.200
have all of America see it, you can do it.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.080
And that, I mean, I'm proud of that.

16:35.480 --> 16:39.280
Um, the 15 years of that is just, it's just been insane.

16:39.360 --> 16:43.120
You know, now kids walk up to me and go, yeah, I started watching you when I was

16:43.120 --> 16:47.200
five or 10 and I started a business cause I learned about it from shark tank.

16:47.200 --> 16:51.840
And so, you know, I think, you know, we're being, it celebrates it and we

16:51.840 --> 16:56.400
convey it and I don't think it's going away, but there are different battles

16:56.400 --> 16:57.800
we have to fight to support it.

16:57.880 --> 16:58.120
Yeah.

16:58.120 --> 17:02.000
I love even when the business idea is obviously horrible, just, just,

17:02.040 --> 17:08.200
just the guts to step up, to believe in yourself, to really reach.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.520
I mean, that's what matters.

17:09.520 --> 17:15.040
I mean, cause like some of the best business ideas are probably, uh, maybe

17:15.040 --> 17:17.040
even you and shark tank will laugh at.

17:17.160 --> 17:17.800
Oh, for sure.

17:18.000 --> 17:18.320
Yeah.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.760
Without question, the good ones, we're not going to recognize every good one.

17:21.760 --> 17:24.720
And then sometimes we'll just motivate people to work even harder to get it

17:24.720 --> 17:25.960
done because of what we say to them.

17:26.280 --> 17:28.960
And that's fine too, you know, there's been great success

17:28.960 --> 17:30.080
stories that we said no to.

17:30.480 --> 17:34.360
What stands out as like a memorable business on, uh, you've been pitched on

17:34.520 --> 17:37.160
shark tank, what's the best one that stands out in my memory?

17:37.160 --> 17:38.320
There's no best one, right?

17:38.320 --> 17:39.080
They're all different.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.560
Um, they're all best in their own way.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.280
I guess the stupid ones.

17:42.320 --> 17:48.480
And, you know, we haven't had any, you know, world or world changing earth

17:48.480 --> 17:49.720
shattering ones, right?

17:49.840 --> 17:53.520
Because those aren't going to apply to shark tank.

17:53.560 --> 17:54.240
They don't need us.

17:54.440 --> 17:54.920
Right.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.680
Don't, you know, so we typically get businesses that need some help

17:57.680 --> 17:58.760
at some level or another.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.480
Um, but there's ones I've passed that I wish like spike ball.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.520
Do you know what spike ball is?

18:02.920 --> 18:06.520
So it's just rebounding net that you can put on the beach and you have these

18:06.520 --> 18:10.080
yellow balls and you play a game of, you know, it's just a competitive game,

18:10.080 --> 18:10.760
but they're killing it.

18:10.760 --> 18:16.040
So if you go to beaches in New York or LA, you'll see kids playing it all the time.

18:16.040 --> 18:20.480
And it was a fun game, um, that I wish I had done a deal with there's, and

18:20.480 --> 18:24.600
there's been others and I passed, they were getting some traction and they

18:24.600 --> 18:27.720
wanted to create leagues, spike ball leagues, and they wanted me to be the

18:27.720 --> 18:31.000
commissioner and I don't want to be a commissioner of a new spike ball league.

18:32.440 --> 18:36.760
So you have to kind of have this gut feeling of will this scale?

18:36.760 --> 18:38.840
Will this click with the course?

18:39.040 --> 18:39.280
Yeah.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.160
Can it be protected?

18:40.160 --> 18:41.160
Is it differentiated?

18:41.440 --> 18:44.000
Is it something that makes me think, you know, why didn't I think of that?

18:44.320 --> 18:50.000
Um, or is it just a good, um, solid business that's going to pay a return

18:50.040 --> 18:55.640
to the founder and may not be enough of a business to return to, um, an investor.

18:56.040 --> 18:56.280
Yeah.

18:56.280 --> 19:02.920
And I guess the question you're trying to see, will this scale, this promise,

19:03.440 --> 19:06.400
will the promise materialize into a big thing?

19:06.440 --> 19:09.040
Well, see, I don't even care if it's going to be a big thing, right?

19:09.080 --> 19:11.120
It, cause it's all relative to the entrepreneur.

19:11.520 --> 19:15.320
We had a 19 year old from Pittsburgh, Laney, who came on with a simple sugar

19:15.320 --> 19:19.360
scrub and there was nothing outrageously special about it.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.040
I didn't see it becoming a hundred million dollar business.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.560
I thought it could become a two, three, five million dollar

19:24.560 --> 19:26.320
business that paid the bills for her.

19:26.640 --> 19:27.760
And that was good enough.

19:27.760 --> 19:31.520
And, you know, six months after the show aired, she called me up.

19:31.520 --> 19:34.720
She goes, Mark, I've got a million dollars in the bank.

19:34.720 --> 19:35.720
What am I going to do?

19:36.000 --> 19:39.880
I'm like, enjoy it, put aside money for your taxes and go back to work.

19:40.480 --> 19:40.880
You know?

19:40.880 --> 19:42.600
And so it doesn't have to be a huge business.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.520
It's just got to be one that makes the entrepreneur happy.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.360
But then there's the valuation piece.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.800
Do, do a lot of the entrepreneurs overvalue business?

19:52.000 --> 19:52.360
Yeah.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.880
I mean, that's, that's the nature of it.

19:53.880 --> 19:54.160
Right.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.960
I mean, and that, that's really where the biggest conflicts

19:56.960 --> 19:59.240
in Shark Tank happen is that's an evaluation.

19:59.560 --> 20:02.200
They, you know, they, they think this is the best business ever.

20:02.480 --> 20:06.960
You know, there, we had one lady, um, couple that came on and they had

20:06.960 --> 20:09.960
this scraper for cat's tongues, right?

20:10.440 --> 20:10.840
Nice.

20:10.880 --> 20:11.200
Bizarre.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.960
Most one of the most bizarre pitch ever.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.200
You know, and they had this insane valuation.

20:17.200 --> 20:20.800
And it was on because it was corny and fun TV, not because it was a good business.

20:20.880 --> 20:21.360
Oh, really?

20:21.400 --> 20:21.800
Okay.

20:22.240 --> 20:22.360
Yeah.

20:22.360 --> 20:23.360
You didn't see the potential.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.800
No, none.

20:25.800 --> 20:26.920
There's a lot of cats in the world.

20:27.040 --> 20:27.720
Yes, there are.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.800
They'll go to very well without me.

20:30.880 --> 20:34.080
So how do you determine the value of a business, whether it's on

20:34.080 --> 20:35.440
Shark Tank or just in general?

20:35.480 --> 20:36.480
It's actually really easy.

20:36.560 --> 20:36.920
Right.

20:37.120 --> 20:41.160
So if you take just to use an example of business that's valued at $1 million.

20:42.160 --> 20:48.040
And I want to buy 10% of that company, um, for a hundred thousand dollars.

20:48.720 --> 20:52.360
Then in order for me to get my money back, they've got to be able to generate

20:52.560 --> 20:56.240
a hundred thousand dollars in after-tax cashflow that they're able to distribute.

20:57.240 --> 20:58.360
Can they do it or can they not?

20:58.800 --> 20:59.120
Right.

20:59.400 --> 21:04.200
And if it's a $2 million value, whatever the valuation is, that's how much cash

21:04.320 --> 21:08.320
after-tax cash they have to generate to return that money to investors.

21:08.960 --> 21:12.400
Or the other option is, do they, you know, do I see this as business

21:12.400 --> 21:14.240
potentially having an exit, right?

21:14.240 --> 21:18.480
Do they have some unique technology or do they have, um, something specific

21:18.480 --> 21:22.280
about them that some other company would want to acquire, then the cashflow

21:22.280 --> 21:27.360
isn't as, as, um, not, I don't want to say important, but isn't going to

21:27.360 --> 21:28.400
guide the valuation.

21:28.640 --> 21:31.360
And how do you know if a company is going to be, uh, acquired?

21:31.360 --> 21:34.080
So it's the technology, like the patents, but also the team is it?

21:34.080 --> 21:35.600
Yeah, it could be any of the above, right?

21:35.640 --> 21:40.320
It could be, it could be a super products company that, um, I

21:40.320 --> 21:41.640
think is going to take off.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.640
And how do you know if they can generate the money?

21:43.760 --> 21:45.920
What's, what's the, you made it sound easy.

21:45.920 --> 21:46.200
Yeah.

21:46.240 --> 21:46.520
Yeah.

21:46.520 --> 21:50.600
I mean, is, can the person sell, you know, and if not them, can I do it?

21:50.640 --> 21:52.720
Or someone on my team do it for them.

21:52.880 --> 21:53.960
So you're looking at the person.

21:54.120 --> 21:54.800
Yeah, for sure.

21:54.840 --> 21:55.200
Yeah.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.880
That's where Barbara Corker is the best.

21:57.080 --> 22:00.600
She can look at a person and hear them talk for 20 minutes and know, can

22:00.600 --> 22:02.280
that person do the job and do the work?

22:02.560 --> 22:04.800
Can you tell if they're full of shit or not?

22:05.520 --> 22:08.480
So one of the things with entrepreneurs, they're kind of, like we said,

22:08.560 --> 22:14.520
overvaluing, so they're maybe overselling themselves, but also they might be full

22:14.520 --> 22:18.680
of shit in terms of their understanding of the market or also like, or exaggerating

22:18.680 --> 22:20.120
what they're thinking, do all that kind of stuff.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.000
Can you see through that?

22:21.040 --> 22:21.600
Yeah, for sure.

22:21.640 --> 22:27.960
Just by asking questions, you know, so if they are, um, delusional at some level

22:28.560 --> 22:32.000
or misleading at another level, I'm going to, I'm going to call them on it.

22:32.280 --> 22:35.720
You know, so you get people trying to sell supplements that come on there and it's

22:35.720 --> 22:37.600
a cure for cancer or whatever it may be.

22:37.840 --> 22:42.760
Or there's this latest fad that, you know, increases your core strength

22:43.040 --> 22:46.080
without doing any exercises, you know, the shit like that.

22:46.080 --> 22:46.920
I'm just going to bounce.

22:46.960 --> 22:47.960
I'm going to pound on them.

22:47.960 --> 22:48.240
Right.

22:48.280 --> 22:49.160
See, I still love that.

22:49.160 --> 22:52.760
I still love the trying to, you know, give them credit, right?

22:52.760 --> 22:56.000
Because they know all of America is going to see it and they're deluded themselves

22:56.000 --> 22:58.560
to believe this story so strongly.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.320
I mean, there's a delusional aspect to entrepreneurship, right?

23:01.560 --> 23:04.280
I can just see that.

23:04.280 --> 23:05.200
That's a great question.

23:05.320 --> 23:11.240
Um, do you have to be ambitious and, you know, set aside reality at some level to

23:11.240 --> 23:15.040
think that you can create a company that could be worth 10, a hundred, a billion

23:15.040 --> 23:16.280
dollars, right?

23:16.640 --> 23:20.800
Um, yeah, at some level, cause you don't know it's all uncertainty, but I think

23:20.800 --> 23:25.480
if you're delusional, that works against you, um, you, because everything's

23:25.480 --> 23:30.040
grounded in reality, you've got to execute, you've got to produce, you know,

23:30.200 --> 23:31.960
you can have a vision, right?

23:31.960 --> 23:35.280
And you can say, this is where I want to get to and that's my mission or this is

23:35.280 --> 23:38.560
my driving principle, but you still got to execute on the business plan.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.480
And that, that's where most people fail.

23:40.680 --> 23:40.960
Yeah.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.360
You have to be kind of too brained.

23:42.360 --> 23:46.160
I guess you have to be able to dip into reality when you're thinking about like

23:46.160 --> 23:49.560
the specifics of the product, how to design things, how to like the, you know,

23:49.560 --> 23:52.400
the first principles, the basics of how to build the thing, how much it's going

23:52.400 --> 23:53.320
to cost all of that.

23:53.560 --> 23:53.800
Yeah.

23:53.840 --> 23:56.160
I mean, cause if you can't do the basics, you're not going to be able to do the

23:56.160 --> 23:56.680
bigger things.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.880
And at the same time, you've got to be one of the things that entrepreneurs

23:59.880 --> 24:04.360
do that I always try to remind any of that I work with on is we all tend to

24:04.360 --> 24:05.280
lie to ourselves.

24:05.640 --> 24:11.520
Our product is bigger, faster, cheaper, this or that, as if that is a finite

24:12.240 --> 24:13.960
situation that's never going to change.

24:13.960 --> 24:14.360
Right.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.920
And there's always somebody, I call them leapfrog businesses.

24:17.920 --> 24:22.720
There's whoever's competing against you, you know, if you do A, B or C, they're

24:22.720 --> 24:24.520
going to try to do C, D and E, right.

24:24.520 --> 24:28.160
And you better be prepared for that to come because otherwise they're out of

24:28.200 --> 24:28.720
business too.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.000
So you're never in a vacuum.

24:30.240 --> 24:33.400
You're always competing against sometimes an unlimited number of

24:33.400 --> 24:36.520
entrepreneurs that you don't even know exist who are trying to kick your ass.

24:36.960 --> 24:41.800
And the tricky part of all this too, is you might need to frequently pivot,

24:42.360 --> 24:43.480
especially in the beginning.

24:43.840 --> 24:44.400
Hopefully not.

24:45.080 --> 24:50.000
So you think like in the beginning, the product you have should be the thing

24:50.000 --> 24:51.240
that carries you a long time.

24:51.280 --> 24:51.600
Yeah.

24:51.600 --> 24:54.800
Because I mean, that's, that's your riskiest point in time, right.

24:55.000 --> 25:00.440
And so if you've done your homework, which includes going out there and testing

25:00.440 --> 25:04.440
product market fit, you should have confidence that you're going to be able

25:04.440 --> 25:04.880
to sell it.

25:04.880 --> 25:10.280
Now, if you didn't do your homework and you go out there and you sell whatever

25:10.280 --> 25:17.040
it is, then, and you've raised money or whatever, just to pivot, you've already

25:17.040 --> 25:19.720
shown that you haven't been able to read the market.

25:19.720 --> 25:23.120
And so it's not that pivots can't work and always don't work.

25:23.120 --> 25:25.520
They can, but more often than not, they don't.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.440
You pivot for a reason.

25:26.440 --> 25:27.800
That's because you made a huge mistake.

25:28.040 --> 25:32.240
Well, I also mean like the, the, the micro pivots, which is like iterative

25:32.240 --> 25:33.040
development of a thing.

25:33.040 --> 25:33.400
Oh yeah.

25:33.440 --> 25:33.880
Oh yeah.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.120
That's not, but yeah, just iterations.

25:35.120 --> 25:35.360
Yeah.

25:35.760 --> 25:39.520
You know, entrepreneurship being, having any business is just continuous

25:39.520 --> 25:44.200
iteration, continuous, your product, your sales pitch, your advertising, you

25:44.200 --> 25:45.840
know, introducing new technology.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.680
How do you use AI or not use AI?

25:47.880 --> 25:48.720
Where do you use it?

25:48.720 --> 25:50.040
What person is the right person?

25:50.440 --> 25:54.640
There's, there's just a million touch points, you know, that you're always

25:54.640 --> 26:00.120
reevaluating in real time that you have to be agile and adapt and change.

26:00.480 --> 26:04.960
But especially in software, it feels like business model can evolve really quickly

26:04.960 --> 26:08.720
too, like how are you going to make money on this software for sure.

26:08.720 --> 26:12.760
Because, you know, anything digital, because it can change in a millisecond.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.120
Speaking of which, how did you make your first billion?

26:16.520 --> 26:23.080
So my partner, Todd Wagner and I, um, would get together for lunches and we

26:23.080 --> 26:28.800
were at California pizza kitchen and Preston Hollow in Dallas, and he was

26:28.800 --> 26:34.320
talking about, um, how we could use this new thing called the internet.

26:34.320 --> 26:39.120
This is late 94, early 95 to be able to listen to Indiana university basketball

26:39.120 --> 26:44.360
games, cause that's where we went to school and he was like, look, when we

26:44.360 --> 26:47.680
would listen to games, we would have somebody in Bloomington, Indiana have a

26:47.680 --> 26:51.280
speaker phone next to a radio, and then we would have a speaker phone in Dallas

26:51.280 --> 26:53.360
and you know, six pack or 12 pack of beer.

26:53.560 --> 26:56.640
And we sit around listening to the game because there was no other way to listen

26:56.640 --> 26:56.960
to it.

26:57.360 --> 27:00.480
So I was like, okay, my first company, microsolutions, you know, I'd written

27:00.480 --> 27:02.840
software done network integration.

27:02.840 --> 27:05.120
And so I was comfortable digging into it.

27:05.680 --> 27:08.640
And so I was like, okay, let's give it a try.

27:08.640 --> 27:14.040
So we started this company called audio net and effectively became the first

27:14.160 --> 27:16.720
streaming content company on the internet.

27:17.160 --> 27:22.520
And it, we're like, okay, we're not sure how we're going to make this work, but

27:22.520 --> 27:23.840
we were able to make it work.

27:23.880 --> 27:27.840
And we started going to radio stations and TV stations and, you know, music

27:27.840 --> 27:33.080
labels and everything and, um, evolved audio net.com, which was only audio at

27:33.080 --> 27:40.240
the beginning to broadcast.com in 1998, which was audio and video and became the

27:40.240 --> 27:45.320
largest multimedia site on the internet, took it public on in July of 1998.

27:45.680 --> 27:49.720
It had the largest first day jump in the history of the stock market at the time.

27:50.080 --> 27:55.080
And then a year later, we sold it to Yahoo for $5.7 billion in Yahoo stock.

27:55.520 --> 28:00.040
And I owned, you know, right around 30% of the company, give or take.

28:00.320 --> 28:02.080
And so after taxes, that's what got me there.

28:02.440 --> 28:03.560
Well, there's a lot of questions there.

28:03.560 --> 28:07.720
So the technical challenge of that, you're making it sound easy, but, uh, you

28:07.720 --> 28:13.000
wrote code, but still in the early days of the internet, how do you figure out

28:13.000 --> 28:18.360
how to create this kind of, uh, product of, of, of just audio at first and then

28:18.360 --> 28:20.040
video for a lot of iterations, right?

28:20.040 --> 28:24.080
Like you talked about, um, we started in the second bedroom of my house, set up

28:24.080 --> 28:30.400
a server, I got an ISDN line, which was 128 K line and set up, downloaded

28:30.760 --> 28:36.840
Netscape server and then started using different file formats that were

28:36.840 --> 28:42.120
progressive loading and allowing people to connect to the server and do a

28:42.120 --> 28:45.960
progressive download so that the audio, you can listen to the audio while it was

28:45.960 --> 28:47.320
downloading onto your PC.

28:47.360 --> 28:47.520
Yeah.

28:47.520 --> 28:48.560
It was a super choppy.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.280
So you were trying to figure out how to do it for sure.

28:50.280 --> 28:50.920
It would buffer.

28:50.920 --> 28:53.920
It was, yeah, it was, it wasn't good, but it was a start, but it was good

28:53.920 --> 28:57.120
enough because it's the first kind of, yeah, because there was no other competition,

28:57.120 --> 28:57.360
right?

28:57.360 --> 28:58.400
There was nobody else doing it.

28:58.680 --> 29:01.440
And so it was like, okay, I can get access to this, this, or this.

29:01.800 --> 29:05.840
And then there were some third party software companies, Zing and, um, progressive

29:05.840 --> 29:09.040
networks and others that were, that took it a little bit further.

29:09.040 --> 29:14.560
So we partnered with them and I started going to local radio stations where

29:14.840 --> 29:18.720
literally we would set up a server right next to it.

29:18.760 --> 29:23.520
I had a $49, um, radio, the highest FM radio that I could find.

29:23.880 --> 29:28.520
And we take the output of the audio signal from the radio with these two

29:28.520 --> 29:33.840
analog cables, plug it into the server, encode it, and make it available

29:33.840 --> 29:35.240
from audio net.com.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.800
Then I would go on UU net bulletin boards.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.240
I would go on CompuServe.

29:39.280 --> 29:40.640
I would go on prodigy.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.400
I would go on AOL.

29:42.440 --> 29:46.640
I'd go wherever I could find bodies and I'd say, okay, we've got this radio

29:46.640 --> 29:52.680
station, KLIF in Dallas, it's got Dallas sports and Dallas news and politics.

29:52.960 --> 29:58.200
And if you're in an office or you're outside of Dallas, connect to audio net.com.

29:58.560 --> 30:01.080
And now you can listen to these things on demand.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.040
And that's how we started.

30:03.040 --> 30:07.000
And it started with one radio station and then it was five, then it was 10,

30:07.000 --> 30:08.400
then it was video content.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.160
Then the laws were different then.

30:10.160 --> 30:14.480
So we could literally go out and buy CDs and host them and just let people

30:14.480 --> 30:15.600
listen to whatever music.

30:16.040 --> 30:21.240
And we went from, you know, 10 users a day to a hundred, to a thousand, to

30:21.240 --> 30:25.040
hundreds of thousands, to a million over those next four years.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.040
How did you find the users?

30:26.040 --> 30:27.080
Is it word of mouth?

30:27.080 --> 30:27.600
Word of mouth.

30:27.880 --> 30:28.680
Just word of mouth.

30:28.720 --> 30:29.840
Didn't spend a penny on advertising.

30:29.840 --> 30:32.640
So the thing you were focusing on is getting the radio stations and all that.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.720
Radio and TV, anything, any content at all.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.520
To pick up the phone?

30:35.520 --> 30:35.880
What'd you do?

30:35.880 --> 30:36.560
How'd you?

30:36.760 --> 30:40.040
I would, I would, wherever I could, like everything that was public domain, I'd

30:40.040 --> 30:44.520
go out and buy a video or a cassette, whatever it was, you know, um, and this

30:44.520 --> 30:49.320
was before the, the DMs, the digital minimum copyright act of 90 set whenever

30:49.320 --> 30:49.840
it kicked in.

30:49.840 --> 30:54.320
So literally anything that was audio we would put online so people could listen

30:54.320 --> 30:54.640
to it.

30:54.640 --> 30:54.960
Yeah.

30:55.040 --> 30:58.760
And if you think about somebody at work, they didn't have a radio most likely.

30:58.760 --> 30:59.960
And if you did, you couldn't get reception.

30:59.960 --> 31:05.160
Definitely didn't have a TV, but you had a PC and you had bandwidth available to

31:05.160 --> 31:09.080
you and the companies weren't up on firewalls or anything at that point in

31:09.080 --> 31:09.360
time.

31:09.360 --> 31:14.320
So our in office listening, you know, during the day, what just exploded

31:14.600 --> 31:16.880
because whoever's sitting next to you, what are you listening to?

31:16.880 --> 31:17.280
Right.

31:17.560 --> 31:18.800
And that was the start of it.

31:18.800 --> 31:23.840
And then, you know, in early 98, um, we started adding video and just other

31:23.840 --> 31:27.040
things and we had ended up with thousands of servers, you know, there was

31:27.120 --> 31:31.160
cloud back then, um, and just pulling together all those pieces to make it work.

31:31.320 --> 31:37.920
But where we really made our money was by taking that network that we had built

31:38.240 --> 31:44.480
and then going to corporations and saying, look, you know, it's 1996, 97, 98.

31:44.880 --> 31:49.320
And to communicate with your worldwide employees, what they would do is they

31:49.320 --> 31:54.720
would go to an auditorium that had a satellite uplink and then they would have

31:54.720 --> 31:59.720
people go to like theaters or ballrooms, um, and hotels that had satellite

31:59.880 --> 32:03.640
down links and then would broadcast, you know, the product introductions, whatever.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.760
And so we said to them, look, you're paying millions of dollars to reach all

32:06.760 --> 32:08.400
your employees when you can do it.

32:08.800 --> 32:13.120
Um, pay us a half a million dollars and we'll do it just on their PCs at work.

32:13.400 --> 32:18.120
So we did, you know, when Intel announced the P 90 PC, we, you know,

32:18.120 --> 32:20.480
charged them $2 million or whatever to do that.

32:20.640 --> 32:23.880
When Motorola announced a new phone or a new product, we would charge them.

32:24.120 --> 32:28.560
And so we use the consumer side to do a proof of concept for the network.

32:28.800 --> 32:33.440
Um, and then we would take that knowledge and go to corporations.

32:33.440 --> 32:34.640
And that's how we made our revenue.

32:34.840 --> 32:36.920
And there's some selling there with the corporations.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.600
A lot of selling there, but we were saving them so much money and they

32:39.600 --> 32:40.720
were technology companies.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.920
They wanted to be perceived as being leading edge.

32:43.280 --> 32:44.160
And so it was win-win.

32:44.680 --> 32:47.320
Uh, how much technical savvy was required?

32:47.720 --> 32:51.040
You said a bunch of servers, like at which point do you get more engineers?

32:51.200 --> 32:54.160
How much did you understand could do yourself?

32:54.520 --> 32:59.760
And then also once you can't do it all yourself, how much technical

32:59.760 --> 33:02.240
savvy is required to understand enough to hire the right people to

33:02.240 --> 33:03.440
keep building this innovative?

33:03.440 --> 33:07.000
I did all the technology and then we hired engineer after engineer

33:07.000 --> 33:08.480
after engineer to implement it.

33:08.960 --> 33:15.320
And so, yeah, um, from putting together a multicast network to, um, software

33:15.360 --> 33:17.560
to just all these different things.

33:17.600 --> 33:18.760
Was this like a scary thing?

33:18.760 --> 33:19.880
Like it's terrifying.

33:20.240 --> 33:20.560
Right.

33:20.560 --> 33:24.600
Because as we were growing, trying to keep up the scale and literally we're

33:24.600 --> 33:29.080
buying off the shelf PCs and then, you know, server cards as the technology

33:29.080 --> 33:33.440
advanced and hard drives and things would fail and we would have to, you

33:33.440 --> 33:36.920
know, we didn't have machine learning back then to do an analysis of, you

33:36.920 --> 33:39.760
know, how to distribute server resources.

33:40.040 --> 33:45.960
So, you know, like there was, there was a time when, um, Bill Clinton and all

33:46.000 --> 33:52.360
the Monica Lewinsky stuff happened, they released the audio of, um, their

33:52.360 --> 33:53.880
interviews of him or something like that.

33:53.880 --> 33:54.120
Right.

33:54.640 --> 33:59.040
And we literally, we, I knew at that point in time when that was released,

33:59.320 --> 34:01.160
everybody at work was going to want to listen to it.

34:01.160 --> 34:01.480
Right.

34:01.800 --> 34:06.480
So we had to take down servers that were doing Chicago Cubs baseball, right.

34:06.760 --> 34:10.080
You know, and just make all these on the fly decisions because there was no, we

34:10.080 --> 34:13.720
didn't have the tools to analyze or predict, be predictive, but yeah, it was,

34:13.760 --> 34:16.160
it was all technology driven and marketing.

34:16.840 --> 34:18.840
Um, the acquisition by Yahoo.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.000
Can you tell the story of that?

34:20.160 --> 34:24.520
But also in the broader context of this internet bubble, this is

34:24.520 --> 34:26.840
a fascinating part of human history.

34:27.520 --> 34:31.840
So on the acquisition side, we were the largest media site on the internet.

34:31.840 --> 34:32.600
It wasn't close.

34:32.840 --> 34:34.080
There was nobody close.

34:34.080 --> 34:38.760
We were YouTube and relatively speaking, we would be 10 X YouTube relative to the

34:38.760 --> 34:40.240
competition because there was nobody there.

34:40.760 --> 34:46.000
Um, and so it became obvious to Yahoo, AOL and others that they needed a

34:46.000 --> 34:50.120
multimedia component and we had the infrastructure sales, all that stuff.

34:50.720 --> 34:58.280
Um, and so Yahoo, when we went public at 98 or right before, I think it was, they

34:58.280 --> 35:02.440
made an investment of like $2 million, which gave us a connection to them.

35:02.880 --> 35:07.720
And then after we went public, they decided they needed to have multimedia.

35:07.720 --> 35:15.400
And so in April of 99, we made a deal and then July of 2000 is when it closed.

35:16.200 --> 35:22.920
And, uh, can you explain to me the trickiness of what you did after that?

35:22.960 --> 35:24.760
Oh, the collar.

35:25.160 --> 35:25.560
Yeah.

35:25.720 --> 35:26.000
Okay.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.760
So when we sold to Yahoo, we sold for $5.7 billion in stock, not cash.

35:31.480 --> 35:39.280
And so I looked at, you know, after micro solutions, um, when I sold that, um, I

35:39.280 --> 35:43.560
took that money and initially I told my broker, I wanted to invest like a 60 year

35:43.560 --> 35:45.120
old man, cause I wanted to protect it.

35:45.520 --> 35:50.000
Um, but then he started asking me all kinds of questions about all these

35:50.000 --> 35:53.680
technologies that I understood, like networks I had installed, we had become

35:53.680 --> 36:00.000
one of the top 20, let's say, um, systems integrators in the country at one point

36:00.000 --> 36:03.560
time, we're the largest IBM token ring, um, installer in the country.

36:03.560 --> 36:04.560
It was crazy, right?

36:04.920 --> 36:07.440
Banion blast from the past.

36:07.440 --> 36:12.480
I mean, so anyway, so these wall street bankers, um, or analysts rather, um, that

36:12.480 --> 36:16.640
were the big analysts of the time would call me up because they would ask my

36:16.640 --> 36:18.120
broker, what does he know about this product?

36:18.600 --> 36:20.600
And I knew them all what was working and not working.

36:20.600 --> 36:20.880
Right.

36:21.160 --> 36:24.160
And so the ones that work, you know, I say that it's working.

36:24.160 --> 36:26.600
I'd see the stock, they say something, the stock would go up 20 bucks.

36:26.600 --> 36:26.840
Right.

36:27.120 --> 36:30.280
So I'm like, well, and my broker was like, you need to, you know, this

36:30.280 --> 36:31.800
better than they do, you need to invest.

36:31.800 --> 36:37.720
So I started buying and selling stocks and this was in 1990 and was just killing it.

36:37.720 --> 36:42.520
I was making 80, 90, a hundred percent a year, um, over those next four years to

36:42.520 --> 36:48.240
the point where guy came in and asked to use my trading history to start a hedge

36:48.240 --> 36:52.560
fund, which we did, and I sold within nine months, it was great, right.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.080
But the point being, as it goes forward.

36:54.120 --> 36:59.000
So when, um, we sold to Yahoo, I already had a lot of experience trading stocks

36:59.360 --> 37:04.400
and I had seen different bubbles come and go, the bubble for PC manufacturers,

37:04.640 --> 37:06.840
a bubble for networking manufacturers.

37:07.120 --> 37:08.360
They went up, up, up, up, up.

37:08.360 --> 37:13.480
And then they came straight down after the hype or somebody just leapfrogged.

37:13.960 --> 37:19.040
And so when we sold to Yahoo, um, I was like, I've got to be next to my name.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.080
That's all I need or all I want.

37:21.080 --> 37:22.160
I don't want to be greedy.

37:22.160 --> 37:27.040
And I'd seen this story before where stocks get really frothy and go straight

37:27.040 --> 37:31.520
down and I knew that because all of what I had was in stock, I needed to find a

37:31.520 --> 37:32.880
way to collar it and protect it.

37:33.320 --> 37:37.160
So understanding stocks and trading and options and all that.

37:37.360 --> 37:41.680
My broker and I, we went and shorted an index that had Yahoo in it.

37:41.960 --> 37:46.760
And so the law at the time was you couldn't short any indexes that had more

37:46.760 --> 37:48.680
than 5% of that stock in it, right.

37:49.280 --> 37:51.320
Of any one of the Yahoo stock.

37:51.800 --> 37:56.240
And so, um, I took pretty much 20 some million dollars, everything I had at

37:56.240 --> 37:58.200
the time, and I shorted the index.

37:58.240 --> 38:01.000
This is fascinating by the way, because it's based on your

38:01.000 --> 38:02.480
estimation that this is a bubble.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.560
Or just mind not wanting to be greedy.

38:04.720 --> 38:05.040
Sure.

38:05.120 --> 38:09.000
So you're the foundation of this kind of thing is, uh, you don't want to be greedy.

38:09.040 --> 38:09.440
Yeah.

38:09.560 --> 38:10.840
I mean, how much money do I need?

38:10.840 --> 38:11.200
Right.

38:11.520 --> 38:14.280
You know, where other people were saying, Oh, I think can go up higher, higher,

38:14.280 --> 38:14.640
higher.

38:14.640 --> 38:19.840
I was like, I went on CNBC and, um, I told them what I had done.

38:20.440 --> 38:24.200
And they were like, and Yahoo stock had gone up significantly from

38:24.200 --> 38:25.680
the time I had collared.

38:26.160 --> 38:28.160
And one of the guys, Joe Kernan was on there.

38:28.160 --> 38:29.360
Don't you feel stupid?

38:29.360 --> 38:32.720
Now that Yahoo stock has gone up, um, you know, X percent more.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.880
I'm like, yeah, I feel real stupid sitting on my jet.

38:36.440 --> 38:40.760
But, so you, I mean, there is some fundamental way in which bubbles

38:40.760 --> 38:42.120
are based on this greed.

38:42.200 --> 38:42.680
Oh, for sure.

38:42.680 --> 38:43.040
For sure.

38:43.040 --> 38:43.560
Yeah.

38:43.600 --> 38:44.840
And I'd seen it before, right.

38:44.840 --> 38:45.400
Like I just said.

38:45.720 --> 38:49.120
And so what I did was we put together a collar where I sold calls and bought

38:49.120 --> 38:54.200
puts, and as it turned out, when the market just cratered, I was protected.

38:54.600 --> 38:59.400
And you know, over the next two, three years, whatever it was, it, it converted

38:59.400 --> 39:01.240
to cash, paid my taxes, et cetera.

39:01.560 --> 39:03.400
But, um, it protected me.

39:03.400 --> 39:07.480
And as it turns out, it was called one of the top 10 trades of all time.

39:07.800 --> 39:11.640
And what was even more interesting out of that period, um, my broker at that

39:11.640 --> 39:16.880
time was at Goldman Sachs and I had asked him to see if there was a way to

39:16.880 --> 39:18.360
trade Vic, the VIX, right.

39:18.360 --> 39:19.560
The volatility index.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.400
And there, there wasn't, right.

39:21.760 --> 39:26.000
And so one of the, the people that Goldman that we were working with

39:26.000 --> 39:30.040
to try to create this actually left Goldman and created indexes that

39:30.040 --> 39:32.160
allowed you to, to trade the VIX.

39:32.640 --> 39:35.160
Well, it's not trivial to understand that it's a bubble.

39:35.520 --> 39:40.120
I mean, you're kind of lessening your insight into all of this by saying

39:40.120 --> 39:43.360
you just didn't want to be greedy, but you still have to see that it's a bubble.

39:43.520 --> 39:43.800
Yeah.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.560
I mean, yeah, obviously if I thought it was going to keep on going up and it

39:46.720 --> 39:50.760
there was intrinsic value there, I would have stayed in it, but it wasn't so much

39:50.760 --> 39:52.600
Yahoo, it was just the entire industry.

39:52.840 --> 39:56.560
You would back then, you know, like we're looking at the, the magic seven

39:56.560 --> 40:00.160
or whatever is stocks now, and people were asking, is it a bubble?

40:00.200 --> 40:05.200
And when I would get into cabs and people would just start talking about internet

40:05.200 --> 40:08.800
stocks, there were people creating companies with just a website and going

40:08.800 --> 40:11.080
public, you know, that's a bubble, right?

40:11.080 --> 40:13.080
Where there's no intrinsic value at all.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.880
And people aren't even trying to make operating cap profits.

40:16.160 --> 40:18.840
They're just trying to leverage the frothiness of the stock market.

40:19.160 --> 40:19.960
That's a bubble.

40:20.120 --> 40:21.120
You don't see that right now.

40:21.120 --> 40:23.560
There's not companies, you don't see hardly, you don't see any

40:23.560 --> 40:25.040
IPOs right now for that matter.

40:25.440 --> 40:28.880
So, you know, I don't think we're in a bubble now, but back then, yes, I

40:28.880 --> 40:31.800
thought we were in a bubble, but that wasn't really the motivating factor.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.200
Do you think it's possible we're in a bit of an AI bubble right now?

40:35.840 --> 40:39.920
No, because we're not seeing funky AI companies just go public.

40:40.040 --> 40:44.000
If all of a sudden we see a rush of companies who are skins on other

40:44.000 --> 40:49.080
people's models or, or just creating models to create models that are going

40:49.080 --> 40:51.640
public, then yeah, that's probably the start of a bubble.

40:52.720 --> 40:57.400
But that said, my, my 14 year old, it was bragging about buying Nvidia, you

40:57.400 --> 41:00.960
know, with me and in his Robinhood account, he tells me the order I placed

41:00.960 --> 41:04.480
it and he was like, oh yeah, it's going up, up, up, you know, and I'm like,

41:05.040 --> 41:08.280
yeah, we're not quite there yet, but that's, you know, that's one thing to pay

41:08.280 --> 41:08.760
attention to.

41:08.760 --> 41:09.600
Yeah, we're flirting with it.

41:09.680 --> 41:09.960
Yeah.

41:10.360 --> 41:13.880
Um, you said that becoming a billionaire requires luck.

41:14.120 --> 41:14.280
Yeah.

41:14.280 --> 41:15.000
Can you explain?

41:15.320 --> 41:15.640
Yeah.

41:15.640 --> 41:19.560
I mean, there's no business plan where you can just start it and say, yeah,

41:19.680 --> 41:21.160
I'm definitely going to be a billionaire.

41:21.560 --> 41:25.240
You can, you know, if I had to start all over, could I start a company that made

41:25.240 --> 41:26.040
me a millionaire yet?

41:26.040 --> 41:29.240
Cause I know how to sell and I know technology and I've learned enough over

41:29.240 --> 41:30.240
the years to do that.

41:30.600 --> 41:31.880
Um, could I make 10 million?

41:31.880 --> 41:33.000
Probably a hundred million.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.360
I hope so.

41:34.720 --> 41:39.320
Um, but a billion, just something good has got to happen, you know,

41:39.520 --> 41:43.400
timing, timing, you know, internet stock market was going nuts right when we

41:43.400 --> 41:48.320
started, you know, and that certainly I couldn't predict or control.

41:48.720 --> 41:54.680
Um, you know, it's like AI right now, AI has been around a long, long, long,

41:54.680 --> 42:01.720
long time and the Nvidia processors, your GPUs rather, you couldn't predict

42:01.720 --> 42:04.800
that now's the time that they were going to be, get to that cost effectiveness

42:04.800 --> 42:08.760
where, you know, you could do, you could create models and train them.

42:08.800 --> 42:11.560
And although it's expensive, it's still doable.

42:11.960 --> 42:15.920
You know, we didn't really even, we had ASICs right for custom applications and

42:15.920 --> 42:20.760
we had CPUs that were leading the way, but GPUs were more for gaming and

42:20.760 --> 42:22.080
then crypto mining.

42:22.320 --> 42:26.720
And now then all of a sudden they were the foundation for AI models.

42:26.960 --> 42:33.200
So I think luck being essential to becoming a billionaire is a beautiful

42:33.200 --> 42:34.960
way to see life in general.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.440
First of all, I personally think that everything good that's ever happened to

42:38.440 --> 42:39.680
me is because of luck.

42:40.040 --> 42:41.600
I think that's just a good way of being.

42:41.720 --> 42:43.240
It's like, uh, you're grateful.

42:43.760 --> 42:48.120
That said, there's some examples of people that you're like, they seem to

42:48.120 --> 42:51.960
have done a lot of, they seem to have gotten lucky a lot, you know, we'll

42:51.960 --> 42:58.080
mention Jeff Bezos, it seems like he did a lot of really interesting, powerful

42:58.080 --> 43:02.720
decisions for many years of Amazon to make it successful, but he was really

43:02.720 --> 43:04.560
able to raise money, right?

43:04.600 --> 43:08.760
A lot of money and people were really dismissive of him because they

43:08.760 --> 43:11.520
weren't, um, making, they weren't profitable.

43:11.760 --> 43:16.360
And we, we were in an environment where it was possible to raise that money.

43:16.640 --> 43:20.480
I mean, what about somebody you get sometimes, uh, feisty

43:20.480 --> 43:22.760
with on the internet, Elon, but we couldn't even look at

43:23.200 --> 43:25.160
Zuck and Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.

43:25.440 --> 43:26.800
Look, Zuck was just trying to get laid.

43:27.200 --> 43:27.600
Right.

43:27.800 --> 43:29.240
And it took off and you wrote some good stuff.

43:29.240 --> 43:32.440
Aren't we all, isn't that the foundation of human civilization?

43:32.760 --> 43:35.040
But, um, yeah, so more power to them, right?

43:35.040 --> 43:39.760
You can't take anything away from them, but yeah, Snapchat, same thing took off.

43:40.400 --> 43:44.640
Apps didn't take off in 2007 when the iPhone came out, apps took off in 2011,

43:44.640 --> 43:49.040
2012, and if you were there with the right app at the right time, and even

43:49.080 --> 43:55.960
Facebook, um, you know, in 2004, the bubble had burst and, you know, the price

43:55.960 --> 44:00.280
for computers had fallen enough in kids in school, all needed computers or laptops.

44:00.600 --> 44:04.880
If he had tried to do something like that, you know, five years early, I mean,

44:04.880 --> 44:08.600
he was too young, but, you know, five years earlier or five years later, you know,

44:08.920 --> 44:11.960
or Friendster might've been the ultimate or MySpace.

44:12.440 --> 44:14.120
Friendster, I remember Friendster.

44:14.200 --> 44:14.840
Or MySpace.

44:14.840 --> 44:17.560
I had a MySpace account that was before Facebook.

44:17.840 --> 44:18.320
Yeah.

44:18.720 --> 44:21.480
The timing is important, but there's like the details of how the product is

44:21.480 --> 44:23.640
built, the fundamentals of the product.

44:23.640 --> 44:24.280
Like what?

44:24.600 --> 44:27.880
Well, so, but that's what gets you to, when the opportunity is there, right?

44:28.040 --> 44:31.680
That's what allows you to take advantage of that opportunity and the kismet of it

44:31.680 --> 44:32.160
all, right?

44:32.400 --> 44:35.880
You've got to be, cause it wasn't like any of the people I mentioned, there

44:35.880 --> 44:38.120
weren't others trying the same thing, right?

44:38.120 --> 44:39.280
You had to be able to see it.

44:39.640 --> 44:43.960
You had to be able to visualize it and put together a plan of some sort, or at

44:43.960 --> 44:48.840
least have a path, and then you had to execute on it and do all those things at

44:48.840 --> 44:52.640
the same time and have the money available to you because it wasn't like,

44:52.840 --> 44:57.000
whether it was Google or Facebook, you know, they raised a shitload of money.

44:57.040 --> 44:59.080
It wasn't bootstrapping it that got them there.

44:59.200 --> 45:01.480
And raising money is not just about sales.

45:01.480 --> 45:07.440
It's about the general feeling of the people with money at that time.

45:07.480 --> 45:08.240
And proximity.

45:09.360 --> 45:10.320
Oh yeah, sure.

45:10.320 --> 45:14.880
Duck wasn't at Harvard and he was at Miami of Ohio university, or he was at

45:14.880 --> 45:19.440
Richland community college, same idea, same person, same execution and nothing.

45:20.120 --> 45:27.720
I believe in the power of individuals to find their, to realize their potential

45:27.720 --> 45:28.840
no matter where they come from.

45:28.880 --> 45:29.640
But I agree.

45:29.640 --> 45:30.720
I agree a hundred percent with that.

45:30.720 --> 45:30.960
Right.

45:30.960 --> 45:31.840
But luck is required.

45:31.880 --> 45:32.200
Yeah.

45:32.240 --> 45:35.080
I mean, scale is the only Delta scale, right?

45:35.080 --> 45:39.160
Where, you know, we're not all blessed with the access to the tools that you

45:39.160 --> 45:41.960
need to, to hit that grand slam.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.880
But then also billion is not the only measure of success, right?

45:45.160 --> 45:45.920
Absolutely not.

45:45.960 --> 45:46.240
Right.

45:46.240 --> 45:49.040
There's a, everybody defines the success in their own way.

45:49.160 --> 45:50.840
How do you define success?

45:50.880 --> 45:54.720
Mark Cuban, waking up every day with a smile, excited about the day.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.040
You know, I was, you know, people say, well, when you get that kind of

45:58.040 --> 45:59.640
money, does it make you happy?

46:00.040 --> 46:01.920
And my answer always is it.

46:02.480 --> 46:05.440
If you are happy when you were broke, you're going to be really, really,

46:05.440 --> 46:06.680
really happy when you're rich.

46:08.040 --> 46:11.000
But you got to work on being happy when you're broke, I guess.

46:11.080 --> 46:12.480
Well, you're just being happy, right?

46:12.480 --> 46:16.320
If you were miserable, you know, in your job before there's a good chance

46:16.320 --> 46:17.480
you're still going to be miserable.

46:17.480 --> 46:18.880
If that's just who you are.

46:19.200 --> 46:21.200
That's a pretty good definition of success, by the way.

46:21.720 --> 46:26.320
How do you reach a success by way of advice to people?

46:26.800 --> 46:32.080
You know, we talked about my dad, my parents, I never looked at my dad

46:32.080 --> 46:34.400
and said, okay, you're not successful.

46:34.600 --> 46:35.600
He busted his ass.

46:35.600 --> 46:43.040
And when he came home, you know, he, we enjoyed our time together, right?

46:43.360 --> 46:47.360
There was nothing at any point in time where I felt like, oh, this is

46:47.360 --> 46:49.720
miserable, we're awful, we're, you know, we don't have this.

46:49.720 --> 46:50.520
We don't have that.

46:51.040 --> 46:55.160
You know, we, we celebrated the things we did have and, um, never knew

46:55.160 --> 46:57.200
about the things we didn't have, you know?

46:57.200 --> 47:03.840
And so I think, you know, you have to be able to find your way to whatever it

47:03.840 --> 47:05.680
is that puts a smile on your face every day.

47:05.680 --> 47:07.280
And some people can do it and some people can't.

47:07.520 --> 47:10.280
It's not always about the smile or the smile on the outside.

47:10.280 --> 47:11.440
It could be a smile on the inside.

47:11.440 --> 47:12.200
Whatever it is, right?

47:12.200 --> 47:13.240
Whatever makes you feel good.

47:13.240 --> 47:17.160
Yeah, the struggle, even the struggle with your dad, the, the really,

47:17.160 --> 47:23.560
really hard work can be, can be a fulfilling experience because, uh, the

47:23.560 --> 47:27.280
struggle leading up to then seeing your kids.

47:27.560 --> 47:28.280
Exactly right.

47:28.480 --> 47:28.720
Right.

47:28.720 --> 47:31.680
Because that's, that, that was my dad's grand slam, right?

47:31.680 --> 47:36.880
Seeing three kids go to college, be successful, you know, spend time, be

47:36.880 --> 47:37.840
able to spend time with them.

47:37.840 --> 47:41.720
And that was the other thing, you know, he really made me realize is the, the

47:41.720 --> 47:43.480
most valuable asset isn't the money.

47:43.840 --> 47:44.600
It's your time.

47:45.080 --> 47:48.280
That's why, you know, from a young age, I wanted to retire because I wanted

47:48.280 --> 47:51.800
to experience everything that I possibly could in this life.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.960
And, you know, he got joy from us.

47:53.960 --> 47:55.240
I get joy from my kids.

47:55.720 --> 48:00.000
Um, and that's the most special thing you ever can have.

48:00.800 --> 48:01.640
Beautifully said.

48:01.960 --> 48:05.400
You have made some mistakes in your life.

48:05.480 --> 48:06.160
Yeah, a lot of them.

48:07.280 --> 48:11.800
One of the bigger ones in the financial side, uh, we could say is Uber.

48:12.160 --> 48:12.400
Yeah.

48:12.400 --> 48:13.800
We call that not doing something.

48:13.800 --> 48:14.000
Yeah.

48:14.000 --> 48:14.760
Wasn't a mistake.

48:14.760 --> 48:21.880
It was just, I mean, it was a mistake, but I always try to look at mistakes

48:21.880 --> 48:24.800
that things you did that didn't turn out as opposed to things you did to, you

48:24.800 --> 48:28.600
know, um, the negative, but, um, but what can you tell the story of that?

48:28.600 --> 48:33.360
And maybe it's just interesting because it is illustrative of like how to know

48:33.360 --> 48:37.680
when a thing is going to be big and not, and what are the fundamentals of it and

48:37.680 --> 48:39.840
how to take the risk and not, and all this kind of stuff.

48:39.840 --> 48:40.160
Right.

48:40.320 --> 48:44.720
So the backstory of that is Bill Gurley came to me and said, um, Mark, there's

48:44.720 --> 48:49.440
this guy, Travis that has this company Red Swoosh, which is a peer to peer

48:49.440 --> 48:53.080
networking company that, um, I think you can help.

48:53.600 --> 48:57.560
And so I invested and would spend a lot of time with Travis.

48:57.880 --> 49:01.520
And it's funny because back then that was like 2006, I was an investor

49:01.520 --> 49:04.880
at, um, box.net with Aaron Levy.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.320
And I was, there's one other company, but there were three of them where

49:09.320 --> 49:12.000
there'd be emails between, you know, where I'd introduce them and we'd

49:12.000 --> 49:17.480
all talk in these emails and they'd all gone to be have astronomical success.

49:17.480 --> 49:17.760
Right.

49:18.240 --> 49:23.280
Um, but so Red Swoosh had its issues, you know, cause I was looking at peer

49:23.280 --> 49:27.360
to peer is kind of stealing bandwidth from the internet providers when

49:27.360 --> 49:29.040
bandwidth was a scarce commodity.

49:29.400 --> 49:34.240
Um, and so, you know, what Travis did with that though, was great.

49:34.480 --> 49:38.640
You know, he convinced gaming companies who wanted to do downloads of the

49:38.640 --> 49:41.440
clients for those games to use his peer to peer and Red Swoosh.

49:41.760 --> 49:45.800
And you know, he busted his ass and I think he sold it for $18 million.

49:46.080 --> 49:46.920
So he did well.

49:47.240 --> 49:51.120
And so it was natural for him to come to me and I still have the emails, you

49:51.120 --> 49:53.720
know, and asked me about Uber cab.

49:54.200 --> 49:56.280
And I thought, okay, this is a great idea.

49:56.400 --> 49:57.640
I really, really like it.

49:58.080 --> 50:02.640
I said, you're going to, and he showed me his budgets and I think they were

50:02.640 --> 50:05.640
raising money at 10 or $15 million or whatever.

50:06.200 --> 50:09.160
And, um, I'm like, your biggest challenge is going to be, you're going

50:09.160 --> 50:12.080
to have to fight all the incumbent taxi commissions, they're going to

50:12.080 --> 50:13.200
want to put you out of business.

50:13.480 --> 50:14.520
That's going to be a challenge.

50:14.520 --> 50:17.360
And I think you don't have enough money designated for

50:17.360 --> 50:18.840
marketing to get all that done.

50:19.520 --> 50:23.040
And I said, I'd invest, but not quite at that valuation, right?

50:23.680 --> 50:24.640
Never came back to me.

50:26.640 --> 50:26.960
Yeah.

50:26.960 --> 50:30.160
I mean, there's some lessons there connected to, uh, what you're doing.

50:30.160 --> 50:31.120
Now we'll talk about it.

50:32.000 --> 50:38.240
It's like looking at an industry that seems like there's a lot of complexity

50:38.240 --> 50:43.400
involved, but it's like hungry for revolution and give the cabs or that.

50:43.520 --> 50:44.120
Yeah, for sure.

50:44.120 --> 50:44.360
Right.

50:44.360 --> 50:47.960
They were, they were dominated by an insulated few.

50:47.960 --> 50:49.320
They were not very transparent.

50:49.320 --> 50:50.560
You didn't know the intricacies.

50:50.840 --> 50:56.120
They were very, very politically driven, um, and old boy insensuous network.

50:56.120 --> 51:00.360
And to trap, you know, and like I told him, Travis, the best thing about you

51:00.360 --> 51:02.320
is you'll run through walls and break down barriers.

51:02.520 --> 51:06.400
The bad thing about you is you'll run through walls, even if you don't have to.

51:06.760 --> 51:07.800
You know, yeah.

51:07.840 --> 51:11.240
And there you kind of have to see, is it possible to raise enough money?

51:11.240 --> 51:12.640
Is it possible to do all this?

51:12.640 --> 51:13.440
Is it possible?

51:13.760 --> 51:15.040
Is it possible to break through?

51:15.040 --> 51:18.360
And it's kind of a fascinating success story with Uber is.

51:18.840 --> 51:20.240
I think he tried to go too big.

51:20.320 --> 51:24.960
He had too big an ambition, which cost him in the end, not financially

51:24.960 --> 51:27.960
personally, but just, you know, in terms of being able to stick it out with them.

51:28.360 --> 51:31.920
Um, but, you know, that's what makes them a great entrepreneur.

51:31.960 --> 51:33.960
Well, it's a fascinating success story.

51:33.960 --> 51:38.880
You have like certain companies like Airbnb, just kind of go into this

51:38.880 --> 51:42.880
thing that we take completely for granted and change it all, just change it.

51:42.880 --> 51:43.320
Yeah.

51:43.720 --> 51:47.880
Linda Johnson, who worked as our general counsel at broadcast.com was, you

51:47.880 --> 51:51.120
know, was Brian's, um, GC and chief operating officer.

51:51.440 --> 51:54.400
So yeah, they, they had a smart, smart, smart, smart team.

51:55.120 --> 51:56.160
And they believed in it.

51:56.440 --> 52:00.360
I mean, it's just, it's a, it's a beautiful story because you're like, all right.

52:00.440 --> 52:03.640
All the things that annoy you about this world, like they're an inefficient

52:03.640 --> 52:06.000
and it just seemed like a pain in the ass.

52:06.000 --> 52:10.440
No, like a lot of people did to Airbnb because I'm like, I don't want people

52:10.440 --> 52:11.960
sitting in my sleeping in my bed.

52:12.000 --> 52:12.720
I would have too.

52:12.800 --> 52:14.120
I was like, this is not going to work.

52:14.400 --> 52:15.840
I've done like couch surfing and stuff.

52:15.840 --> 52:18.560
And it was always, it didn't seem right.

52:18.600 --> 52:21.520
It didn't seem like you could do this to monetize it.

52:21.520 --> 52:25.520
Yeah, but he did more power to him in 2000.

52:25.600 --> 52:31.240
I think January, you purchased a majority stake in, uh, the NBA team, Dallas

52:31.520 --> 52:35.320
Mavericks, uh, for 285 million.

52:36.080 --> 52:39.120
So at this point, maybe you can correct me, but it was one of the worst

52:39.120 --> 52:40.960
performing teams in franchise history.

52:41.440 --> 52:45.560
Uh, how did you, how did you help turn it around?

52:45.920 --> 52:49.480
Um, I had this big tall guy named Dirk Nowitzki and I let him be Dirk

52:49.480 --> 52:50.440
Nowitzki, right.

52:50.760 --> 52:51.840
And I got out of the way.

52:51.920 --> 52:55.360
Um, but I think more than anything else, um, there was the turnaround on

52:55.360 --> 52:59.600
the business side and then there was the turnaround, the basketball side.

52:59.880 --> 53:02.560
And on the basketball side, I just went in there immediately said, whatever

53:02.560 --> 53:04.040
it takes to win, that's what we're going to do.

53:04.440 --> 53:08.480
Um, you know, back then they had three or four coaches that

53:08.480 --> 53:09.680
were responsible for everything.

53:10.160 --> 53:15.040
And I was like, okay, we spend more money training people on PC software

53:15.320 --> 53:18.480
than we do developing the most important assets of the business.

53:18.480 --> 53:23.640
So I made the decision to go out there and hire like 15 different development

53:23.640 --> 53:25.000
coaches, one for each player.

53:25.520 --> 53:29.760
And everybody thought I was just insane, but you know, it sent the

53:29.760 --> 53:33.280
message that we were going to do whatever it took to win.

53:33.760 --> 53:39.880
And once the guys believe that, you know, winning was the goal as

53:39.880 --> 53:44.160
opposed to just making money, attitudes change, effort went up and, you

53:44.160 --> 53:45.160
know, the rest is history.

53:45.320 --> 53:48.480
So the assets of the business here are the players, the players.

53:48.520 --> 53:49.120
Yeah, for sure.

53:49.480 --> 53:54.840
And then on the business side, the first question I asked myself is

53:54.840 --> 53:55.880
what business are we in?

53:56.240 --> 54:00.320
And I really didn't know the answer immediately, but within the first few

54:00.320 --> 54:04.360
months, it was obvious that, you know, the entire NBA thought we were in

54:04.360 --> 54:05.520
the business of basketball.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.080
We were not, we were in the experience business.

54:08.400 --> 54:11.400
When you think about sporting events that you've been to, you

54:11.400 --> 54:12.520
don't remember the score.

54:12.520 --> 54:14.160
You don't remember the home runs or the dunks.

54:14.360 --> 54:16.840
You remember who you're with and you remember why you went.

54:17.040 --> 54:21.120
I was my first date with a girl who's now my wife, or I went with my buddies

54:21.160 --> 54:23.440
and he threw up on the person in front of us.

54:23.600 --> 54:25.720
You know, my dad took me, my aunt, my uncle took me.

54:25.720 --> 54:27.400
Those are the experiences you remember.

54:27.720 --> 54:32.920
And once, um, I conveyed to our people that this is what we were selling, that

54:32.920 --> 54:36.920
what happened in the arena, um, off the court was just as important with what

54:36.920 --> 54:40.600
happened on the court, if not more so, because if, you know, mom or dad are

54:40.600 --> 54:43.480
bringing the 10 year old, you have to keep them occupied because they have

54:43.480 --> 54:44.400
short attention spans.

54:44.400 --> 54:47.720
And so, you know, I would get into fights with the NBA, you know, put

54:47.720 --> 54:51.400
aside the refs, but getting the side in fights in the NBA, I would say NBA,

54:51.440 --> 54:53.000
nothing but attorneys, right?

54:53.000 --> 54:55.120
Because they had no marketing skills whatsoever.

54:55.120 --> 54:58.360
And to their credit, you know, they realized that was a problem and started

54:58.360 --> 55:00.280
bringing in better and better, better marketing people.

55:00.440 --> 55:05.440
So part of the selling is you're selling the team, selling the sport, selling

55:06.200 --> 55:09.880
the people, the idea, the, all of it, like just the, well, yeah, the experience.

55:09.880 --> 55:13.440
So if you, have you ever been to an NBA game, uh, Miami heat, do you remember

55:13.440 --> 55:16.720
walking into the arena and you feel the energy, right?

55:17.040 --> 55:18.320
That's what makes it special.

55:18.360 --> 55:18.520
Yeah.

55:18.520 --> 55:21.000
The energy is everything, especially playoff games, right?

55:21.000 --> 55:21.400
For sure.

55:21.400 --> 55:21.680
Right.

55:21.920 --> 55:23.400
And even a regular season game, right?

55:23.400 --> 55:27.720
Even against the worst team, you know, that's where we get, you know, because

55:27.720 --> 55:30.480
the tickets are, tend to be a little bit cheaper on the resale market.

55:30.680 --> 55:32.080
That's where parents will bring their kids.

55:32.320 --> 55:36.200
And so you hear kids screaming the entire game and the parents are thrilled

55:36.200 --> 55:36.800
to death, right?

55:36.800 --> 55:38.160
They got to do something with your kids.

55:38.360 --> 55:41.840
The kids are thrilled to death because they got to see basketball and NBA

55:41.840 --> 55:43.880
game and scream at the top of their lungs.

55:44.200 --> 55:47.440
And, you know, if it turns out to be a close game and that ball's in the air,

55:47.680 --> 55:51.520
and if it goes in, you know, everybody's hugging and high-flying people you've

55:51.520 --> 55:52.880
never seen before in your life.

55:53.120 --> 55:55.720
And if it misses, you're commiserating with people you've never seen before.

55:55.880 --> 55:57.600
That's such a unique experience.

55:57.600 --> 56:00.240
That's unique to sports and we never sold that.

56:00.280 --> 56:01.600
And that's exactly what we started.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.960
I have to say, like, just going to that game, turn me around on

56:03.960 --> 56:05.840
basketball because I'm more of a football guy.

56:05.840 --> 56:08.080
So basketball wasn't like the main sport.

56:08.200 --> 56:09.360
I was like, oh, wow.

56:09.360 --> 56:09.600
Okay.

56:09.600 --> 56:10.040
It's fun.

56:11.560 --> 56:11.760
Yeah.

56:11.760 --> 56:15.720
The energy in a, in a stadium is completely different than the energy in an arena.

56:16.040 --> 56:18.640
You know, you can, you know, in the stadium, particularly if it doesn't have

56:18.640 --> 56:21.200
a roof, it's hard to bottle that energy.

56:21.200 --> 56:24.600
You feel it and you see, like I'm from Pittsburgh, so there's a terrible towels

56:24.600 --> 56:28.360
and people screaming defense and everything at Steelers games, but in an

56:28.360 --> 56:32.680
arena, the energy level is just indescribable.

56:32.880 --> 56:35.760
So how much of it is the selling the tickets in person, but also

56:36.600 --> 56:39.200
versus what you see on TV.

56:39.640 --> 56:43.800
So when you're owning a team, do you get any other cut for the, what's shown on TV?

56:43.920 --> 56:44.400
Yeah, yeah.

56:44.640 --> 56:44.880
Yeah.

56:44.880 --> 56:49.920
So there's a TV deal that's done with either a local TV broadcaster and we get

56:49.920 --> 56:56.040
all of that or, um, a network broadcaster like ABCC, um, ESPN, TNT, whatever.

56:56.240 --> 56:57.840
And then we get one 30th of that.

56:57.960 --> 57:01.440
So what role does the TV play in like turning a team?

57:01.440 --> 57:02.520
Keeps fans connected.

57:02.760 --> 57:05.360
Look, when the team is doing really well, it's easy, right?

57:05.440 --> 57:07.360
There's more viewers, everybody's more excited.

57:07.720 --> 57:11.240
Um, and when you're not, it's, you know, there's still going to be hardcore fans

57:11.240 --> 57:14.880
and, and, you know, general fans and kids that like to watch the game.

57:15.720 --> 57:18.960
What about like the personality of the people in the, in the stands?

57:19.040 --> 57:25.200
Like, I mean, clearly you're part of the legend of the team because

57:25.360 --> 57:26.960
you're literally there going wild.

57:27.320 --> 57:27.520
Yeah.

57:27.520 --> 57:28.480
The whole game, right?

57:28.760 --> 57:29.040
Yeah.

57:29.080 --> 57:29.760
It's funny.

57:29.760 --> 57:33.560
You know, you, the way I am here is how I am, you know, 24 hours a day, unless

57:33.560 --> 57:37.240
there's a Mavs game, you know, and, and for whatever reason, that's where I let

57:37.240 --> 57:38.960
out all that stress and frustration.

57:39.360 --> 57:43.680
Um, but yeah, I mean, it's not so the fans, you know, the sixth man, right?

57:43.880 --> 57:47.760
We need fans to bring that energy and, you know, amplify that as much

57:47.760 --> 57:48.720
as we can is important.

57:49.480 --> 57:55.800
You've had a beef recently on Twitter on X with Elon over DEI programs.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.320
What to you is the essence of the disagreement there?

57:59.600 --> 58:01.040
I wouldn't call it a beef, right?

58:01.040 --> 58:02.960
I it's just, it's a bit of fun.

58:03.120 --> 58:03.520
Yeah.

58:03.560 --> 58:04.800
It's fun for me, right?

58:05.640 --> 58:10.760
Um, I just, you know, it's his platform.

58:11.320 --> 58:12.720
He gets to run it any way he please.

58:12.720 --> 58:13.440
He pays for that.

58:13.440 --> 58:13.840
Right.

58:14.200 --> 58:18.640
And so I have total respect for whatever choices he makes, even if I don't agree

58:18.640 --> 58:26.560
with them, but because it's his platform, people are less likely to, um, disagree

58:26.560 --> 58:32.120
with him, but really somebody who's of, who's got a platform themselves.

58:32.520 --> 58:37.320
And so when we start talking about DEI and it's just de facto racist and this

58:37.320 --> 58:41.680
stuff, stuff that I just think is nonsense, I have no problem, you know,

58:41.680 --> 58:48.840
sharing my opinion, um, and you know, if he disagrees, okay, he can disagree.

58:48.840 --> 58:54.040
I don't care, you know, and it's fun to engage, but he doesn't really engage,

58:54.040 --> 58:57.200
you know, he just comes back with snark comments, which is, you know, his choice.

58:57.760 --> 58:58.000
Yeah.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.960
You in your comments, or you do a bit of snark too, but

59:01.640 --> 59:09.120
yeah, a little bit, but you're pretty, um, let's say rigorous in your response.

59:09.120 --> 59:10.800
So there is some exchange of ideas.

59:10.800 --> 59:13.400
There's some snark, there's some fun, all that kind of stuff.

59:13.400 --> 59:17.800
And, uh, you do voice the opinion that represents a large number of people.

59:17.800 --> 59:18.360
And it's great.

59:18.400 --> 59:20.600
I mean, that's what's, it's really beautiful.

59:21.320 --> 59:27.200
Uh, but just lingering on the topic, what to use the good and the bad of DEI

59:27.200 --> 59:29.280
programs, really simple, right?

59:29.280 --> 59:34.440
D is diversity, and that means you just expand your pool of potential applicants

59:34.440 --> 59:39.240
to people who you might not otherwise have access to, you know, to look where

59:39.240 --> 59:42.360
you didn't look before, to look where other people aren't looking for quality

59:42.360 --> 59:50.040
employees, um, that simple and the E in equity means when you hire somebody,

59:50.440 --> 59:52.200
you put them in a position to succeed.

59:52.920 --> 59:58.960
The I inclusion is when you've hired somebody and they may not be typical,

59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.840
if you will, right, you show them some love and give them the support they

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.520
need so they can do their job as best they can and feel comfortable and

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.520
confident going to work.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.320
It's that simple.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:13.640
So that's a beautiful ideal when it's implemented, implemented poorly perhaps,

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.720
or in a way that doesn't reach that ideal.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:23.440
Do you see maybe when it's a quota based, do you see that it can result in a

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:27.560
century of racism towards Asian people and white people, for example?

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.280
There's a lot to unpack there, right?

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.600
Um, so first you can't do quotas.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:35.440
They're illegal unless you're, um, and I'm not the lawyer on this subject, but

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.120
unless you're, you're trying to repair something that's happened in the past,

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.880
like some discrimination that's happened in the past.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.120
So it's not quota based.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:50.400
And I think that's really just kind of a, a straw man that, that people put out there.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:53.840
Now, does that mean that there aren't DEI programs that are implemented poorly?

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.280
Of course not.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:58.800
There are everything that's implemented poorly in one company to another, right?

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:03.000
Sales, marketing, um, human resources.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:06.760
You can pick any element of business and find companies that implement it poorly.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:12.880
Um, but that's the beauty of capitalism and a free market or mostly free market

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:17.760
where if you make these choices and they are the wrong choices, you're going

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.000
to lose your best people.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.160
You're not going to be able to hire the best people.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:24.400
You're not going to execute on your business plans in the way that we

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.040
discussed, regardless of the size of the company.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:32.600
And it also, I think, depends on where you're having the discussion.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:37.480
So when I'm in a different group of people off of X, the feedback's

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.320
completely different, right?

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:46.960
Um, but to your question of reverse racism, yes, it happens.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.600
There's, I mean, cause people are people.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:54.680
There's no, you know, there's no human being that is a hundred percent objective.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:04.000
And it's also, there's very, very, very few jobs that can be determined on a

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.320
purely quantitative, quantitative basis, right?

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.880
How do you tell one good janitor from the other who's the best, right?

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:14.520
How do you tell one salesperson that you're hiring versus another you're hiring?

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.920
Cause they haven't sold your product yet.

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:16.480
So you don't know.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:20.760
We talked earlier about firing people because you made mistakes and you know,

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:28.000
yes, there's discrimination against any group, white, Asian, black, green,

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:32.560
orange, whatever it may be, but I truly believe that there's far more

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:36.800
discrimination against people of color than there are people who are white.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:42.160
And I think it's, it's become a straw man that reversed discrimination

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:46.680
because of DEI is, is prevalent or near ubiquitous.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:55.240
Well, much of American history was defined by intense radical racism and sexism.

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.400
But in the recent years, there was a correction.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.120
And I think the nature of the criticism is that there's an overcorrection

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:10.080
where DEI programs, the universities, the companies are often when they're

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:15.520
not doing their job well are often hard to criticize because when you criticize

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:21.120
them within the company or so on, you can, they have a very strong immune system

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:26.480
where that you could, they could, if you criticize a DEI program, it seems like

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.000
it's very easy to be called racist.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.760
And if you're called racist or sexist, that's, that's a sticky label.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:36.240
So you're getting into the culture of organizations, right?

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.280
And leadership within organizations.

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:46.000
And accepting any type of criticism, put aside DEI, when I criticized the

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.480
referees and the MVA, I got fined, right?

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.000
That was their option.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.360
I knew what I was getting into, right?

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.720
Not that they're completely analogous, but it's cause and effect.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:01.000
If I'm in a major company and I'm publicly criticizing or even internally

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.960
criticizing a sales plan or a product, our product sucks, right?

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:10.440
Where like there was a Google engineer that got fired for saying, you know,

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.240
Google had AGI, right?

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.440
And nobody believed they did.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.840
And they knew that created problems.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:19.080
It wasn't DEI related, but it was, you know, saying something publicly that

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:23.080
was to the, in the CEO's eyes to the detriment of the company, right?

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.440
So I think those are all analogous.

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.760
If you're trying to accomplish something within an organization, because you

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.280
think there's a problem and there's people speaking out saying, look,

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.080
you were getting it wrong.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.920
I think I'm a victim of all this and the company, right?

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.360
Then, you know, leadership has got to make a decision.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.520
Do they agree or not agree?

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.120
Are they right or are they wrong?

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:48.320
Is it to the positive, is it positive or negative to the company?

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:49.320
And you decide.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:54.960
So, you know, this conversation that conservatives are being silenced

01:04:54.960 --> 01:05:02.280
in organizations now, I just, I haven't seen it, you know, I've talked to, and

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:10.320
then the other side of your question, I think I'm packing it is what's driving

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:13.720
all this, put aside universities for one in corporate America.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:21.720
When I talk to people in corporate America about DEI, they always start

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.840
talking about ideology, right?

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.960
And like I've talked to Bill Ackman, who you've had on, right?

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.320
And when I asked him, well, Bill, you run your own companies.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.480
Who's telling you what to do?

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:32.840
They are.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.360
Who's they?

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:40.280
Well, it's the universities, you know, the people who have this ideology of DEI.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.080
I'm like, did they force you?

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.280
Did they coerce you?

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.440
Did you lose control of your company?

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:48.520
No, it's not me.

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.680
It happens to other people.

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.040
Then I talked to other people.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.240
Same thing.

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.840
So I get, you know, try not to go one-on-one and tip Twitter

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.160
conversations on this topic.

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:01.480
So in the DMs, I'll talk to people who are really conservative.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.080
And I'll ask the same question and be like, well, who's forcing you to do this?

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.960
Well, it's the ideology that's everywhere.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.600
You see it, don't, didn't you see the Harvard thing, you know, in

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:11.640
University of North Carolina?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.480
I'm like, I've never had anybody try to push me in this direction to do this.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.960
This was my business choice.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.800
I'm not trying to tell other people you have to do this.

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.920
You make your own business choices.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.680
And so we're companies that made their business choices.

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:29.000
And if somebody doesn't feel confident or comfortable with it, they may feel

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.600
they're being discriminated against.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.040
There was something I just read in the wall street journal where the wall

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:38.360
street journal had a company interviewed 2 million people, right?

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:44.800
And the difficulty in firing and how people, when they were fired, 40% of the

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:49.320
people who were fired felt like it was wrong that they were doing a great job.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:55.560
Yet they then have talked about the HR person going through the hassle of trying

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:58.640
to explain to this person through performance reviews that they

01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.800
weren't doing a good job.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:03.080
Yet the people still thought they were doing a great job despite being told

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:04.080
they're not doing a good job.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:04.640
Right.

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:09.320
So I see that as being an analogous to all this, you know, this huffing and puffing

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:14.080
about, um, reverse discriminations and conservatives not being able to speak up

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:19.400
because at 40% of people who have been fired, don't believe they should have

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.040
been fired.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.160
There's, there's a disconnect somewhere in how you think you're doing your job.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:30.840
And, um, if you just feel like I can't speak up because of it, um, because of

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:38.040
your white and that doesn't comport well with DEI programs, a lot of things are

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.360
going to happen, right?

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:43.680
Either you're going to, that's going to come up in your performance review, HR

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:46.600
or your, your boss is going to have to address it in some way.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:50.280
It's going to get to HR at some level and then decisions are going to have to be

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:53.720
made and commute and you can't just fire somebody because they spoke up.

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:54.400
Right.

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.800
Somebody's going to have to communicate with you.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:04.240
And so I think a lot of, I just, I, I just don't trust the supposed volume that

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:07.720
people say is happening at versus everything I've read and seen.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:12.120
And when I talk to people in positions of authority within organizations and ask

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:16.400
them who's forcing them, you know, to implement these ideologies, nobody says,

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.520
nobody says yes, that there is somebody.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.800
But on Twitter, it sounds great.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.840
It is true for conservatives, but in general, you can sell books, you can get

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.920
likes when you talk about this ideology.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.640
And there's a degree to which is, is this woke ideology in the room with us right

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:39.080
now, uh, meaning like it's this boogie monster that we're all kind of, or is it

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:43.360
a positive, I guess another way to say that is they don't highlight a lot of the

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:48.440
positive progress that's been made in the positive version of the word woke in

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.880
terms of correcting some of the wrongs done in the past.

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:57.280
So, but that said, you know, if you ask people in Russia, a lot of them will say

01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:00.640
there's no propaganda here, there's no censorship and all that kind of stuff.

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:05.880
It's sometimes hard to see when you're in it that this kind of is happening.

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:14.400
It does seem difficult to criticize DEI programs, not horribly difficult, terrible.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.080
There are this monster that infiltrates everything, but it is difficult

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.600
and requires great leadership.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:24.400
So where, where have you criticized it and been condemned, uh, academic or

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.160
academic, academic, let's two different worlds, companies and academic.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.000
Yeah, two different worlds.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.440
But I also think it's not, I really want to point my finger at the failure of

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:42.440
leadership of basically firing mediocre people, like people, they're not good

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.160
at their job.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:50.920
The problem to me is DEI defense mechanism, like immune system is so

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:55.000
strong that the shitty people don't get fired.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:59.040
So the vision, the ideal of DEI is, is a beautiful ideal.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:03.560
It's just like, well, maybe it's cause I'm an entrepreneur when I see an ideal

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:07.280
that, you know, you try to implement it and support it and get to that point.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.600
But universities and companies are night and day different, right?

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:14.440
I can see an argument for the ideology in a university.

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:18.040
I can see, you know, you look at the, the amount of money spent on it.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:24.680
And so while the goal is right, um, the way they implement it in universities,

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:28.360
the way they implement most things in universities is wrong, right?

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:33.760
There's a reason why tuition has gone up, you know, a multitude of, or a

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:40.120
multiple of inflation, um, they're not well run organizations across the board.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.120
So I'm not going to argue with that at all.

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.800
So when you've seen me argue with DEI, I haven't weighed it

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.440
into DEI in universities at all.

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.760
That's mostly focused on companies.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.440
A hundred percent, right?

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:49.880
Because that's where I exist.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:53.640
But at the same time, like I read Christopher Rufro's book where he talks

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:57.400
about the kind of the genealogy of wokeism and, and ideology, but then he

01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:01.440
gets to the point, and I hope I'm remembering this right, where he says

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:07.640
that the response to it is decentralized activism, if you will, that's not the

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:11.720
word he used to try to counter that DEI.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:18.360
And that seems to me to be counter to the whole conservative movement right

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.400
now, right, other than school boards, right?

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:26.040
Where it's centralized and, you know, the Republican candidate is all

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.960
about centralized power in him.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:33.640
And, you know, I, to me, that's just a conflict and a lot of the underpinning

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:38.800
of this, of the whole DEI conversation that a lot of it, and a lot of which

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.760
goes through Christopher Rufro right now.

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:44.480
Let's continue on a theme of fun exchanges on the internet.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:50.920
So Elon tweeted, the fundamental axiomatic flaw of the woke mind virus

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:56.320
is that the weaker parties always write in parentheses, even if they want you

01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:01.800
to die and you responded at length, but the beginning is the fundamental

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:07.040
axiomatic flaw of the anti woke mind is that it allows groups with historical

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:11.680
power to play the victim by taking anecdotal examples and packaging them

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:17.000
into conjured conspiratorial ideology that threatens to up and the power

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.280
structures they have been depending on.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.120
So, uh, well, there's a tension there.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:33.000
So yes, but both can be abused, right?

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.560
Both positions of power can be abused.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:42.120
There's power in DEI and there's shitty people that can crave power and hold

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.640
onto power and sacrifice their ideals.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:45.200
Okay.

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.280
Put aside universities.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:46.800
Okay.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:47.480
Damn it.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:48.400
Yeah.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.160
I mean, I, because I'm not going to argue that universities implement DEI

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.200
well, right?

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:57.680
And I'm not going to tell you that, um, you know, they need to be spending

01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:01.360
20 some million dollars a year on DEI positions.

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.000
To me, that's insane.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:10.200
Um, do I look at the Harvard and North Carolina decision and say it

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.080
was a great decision?

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:16.960
No, because, you know, I think having a diverse student body helps make for,

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.840
um, kids who are better prepared for the real world.

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:23.440
But I'm not running a university.

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:24.280
So it's not my choice.

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.600
Maybe at some point in the future, I will, but not now.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:35.560
Um, and in terms of the corporate side of it, who's telling anybody what to do?

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:41.000
Well, maybe you can give me some help.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:41.680
Sure.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:42.920
I'm here to help you.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:50.600
There's an example in the AI world of, uh, a system called Gemini.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.960
Yeah, I mean, everybody will black or whatever people of color, George

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.400
Washington was black Nazis were black.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:01.800
So why, why is it when that came out, it was a big uproar, but when somebody

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.680
re so who, who was it?

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.600
One of the people who are trying to fuck with me.

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.440
Um, I forget which one.

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:12.840
Um, there's so many, but, um, he probably, he probably, he probably

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:19.920
pointed out to, um, Elon that Grok, Elon's AI was woke when it answered

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:24.240
certain questions and other people have pointed out other things to Elon

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.440
about Grok, Grok, Grok, whatever they, however it's pronounced, um, that

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:31.200
was leaning left or woke, right?

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.040
And Elon's response was, Oh, it'll change.

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:34.720
It's a mistake.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:35.440
We're fixing it.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.880
When it happens to Gemini in Google, it's the end of the world.

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:40.880
Look how woke they are.

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.360
And it's a reflection of all their culture.

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.200
Now Google comes out and says it's a mistake.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.560
And then they docs the guy, um, who is the product manager or whatever

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:52.560
of AI of that product, um, who, and then they go back and look at

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.640
his old tweets, right?

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.640
And show that he's very left leaning and very, you know, DEI supportive.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.760
And that's the end of the world.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:07.280
It's not the end of the world, but, uh, Google is so much, uh, dependent on

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:14.840
trust that trust that Google search has as objective as possible, um, channel

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.640
into the world of information.

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.800
And so that brand is really important.

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.040
Yeah.

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.680
So you're, you're over, you're giving them too much power.

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:24.920
Um, and maybe I'm not recognizing the power, right?

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:33.760
So I'll tell you a personal experience, um, up until a month ago, maybe if you

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:41.800
put in keto gummies, shark tank, keto gummies into Google, it would show up

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:45.680
with scammy ads, scam ad after schema.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:52.400
And I would get emails, um, up until a month ago from elderly people asking me

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:57.360
why the gummies weren't working and why the companies were charging, um, all this

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:02.080
money on a month by month basis when they tried to cancel and they said it was the

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.800
number one deal on shark tank of all time, right.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:07.480
And all shark, it was a mistake.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:12.480
Well, there's fraud, there's mistakes, but the mistakes.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.000
No, but why didn't Google fix it?

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:14.720
Right.

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:17.640
The distance didn't happen once over one week over two weeks.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:17.960
Right.

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:22.400
And because it was hard to fix, as it turns out, I was working with

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:26.040
them to try to find a fix and we would both look at the same page.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:32.000
And if you were inside of Google within the do Google.com domain, it would show

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.360
one page, if you were outside of Google, it would show another, and it took us

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:39.240
looking at it at the same time for anybody to realize it, meaning that there's

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:41.400
a lot of technology problems that are hard to fix.

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:45.000
They're super complex and we could talk about it forever with social media.

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:48.640
The criticism towards Google, towards other companies, when they're based

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:54.840
in Silicon Valley, there could be an ideological drift into, um, a ideological

01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:58.800
bubble out of which the technology is created and they could be blind to

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.120
the obvious bias that's, that's.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:05.760
Billions of customers who are not going to, but so what you're saying is the

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:10.520
free market stops with artificial intelligence that people don't pay

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:14.960
attention and respond that Google doesn't listen to the responses that people

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:19.440
inside of Google will ignore their own best financial interest and even their

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.680
own best personal interest.

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:24.240
Cause they know they're going to get docs now on, on by Elon and others.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.480
And so I just don't see that.

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.560
And, and, and Elon's not allowed to make those same mistakes, but

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.160
allowed to make those mistakes.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:32.880
But Google isn't.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:33.400
Oh, I know.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.800
Elon is 100% should be criticized for, for the ridiculousness of overstatements

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.320
that he makes about various products.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:43.480
He's having a bit of fun like you are also.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:48.320
Uh, but, and I also believe in the free market, but it's not, it's not always

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.400
efficient, you know, there's like a delay.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:50.960
It just takes time.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:51.880
Yeah, it's fine.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.800
So which is why Elon is important when calling out, I think, overstating

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:59.640
the criticism of Gemini, but Elon and others are just Gemini wasn't even

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:02.360
a fully available, um, public product yet.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:07.840
It's still a bias that resonates with people's neural networks work though.

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:08.320
Right.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:12.360
That's why there'll be millions of models because weights and biases

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:17.480
putting together, you know, a neural network, but no.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:23.080
So like the, the, the black George Washington is an, is a correction on

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:28.200
top of the foundation model to keep it quote unquote, sort of safe.

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:33.040
One of the big criticisms of all of the models, frankly, uh, probably even

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:37.320
grok a little bit less so is there, they're like trying to be really

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:42.000
conservative in this, in the sense of trying to be careful not to say crazy

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.680
shit because, because you don't know how to think brand new and we know what

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:46.600
happens, right.

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:50.120
And they do it on the front end with prompts and they try to do it on the

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:53.520
backend with the neural networks that are underneath them, right.

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:55.600
And it doesn't always work.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.360
And that's why there's going to be millions of models rather than just,

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:02.400
you know, four foundational models that ever five that everybody uses.

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:06.840
Well, I guess the main criticism is you want to have some transparency of all

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:11.000
the teams that are involved and that this kind of, to the degree there's a

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:16.520
left leaning ideology within the companies, it doesn't affect the product.

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.440
But that's the beauty of the free market.

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:18.840
Yeah.

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.240
That's where the market corrects it.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:20.600
Right.

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:25.520
And not only from the outside, because everybody, you know, is going to test

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:29.280
it, like when YouTube first came out, we're not first came out when after

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:34.120
Google bought them used to be able, there used to be, um, different commands

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:34.880
you could give it, right.

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.200
There were line, um, prompt commands that you could give it.

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:42.800
And you could find all the nasty porn that got loaded before the, they,

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:43.880
they kicked it off.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:44.240
Right.

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:47.360
And it was just the nastiest shit ever.

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.920
And even now to this day, if there's some horrific tragic event, somebody's

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.040
loading it up, right.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:53.640
Nope.

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:57.960
I know that's not direct to your point of internal influence to the output.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:58.280
Right.

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:01.800
But people on the outside are going to check for that now, right.

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.000
It's almost like the new bug contest, right.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.520
To try to find bugs and software.

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:10.280
And then on the inside, if it's all left leaning and all you have is left

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:14.200
leaning employees, because you know, most conservatives won't want to work there

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.440
then again, that's self-correcting as well.

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:20.000
That's the hope, but it can self-correct in different kinds of ways.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.640
You can have a different company that competes and becomes more conservative.

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:27.160
I mean, my worry is that it's kind of becomes like two different worlds where

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.520
there's like already is the left.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:29.680
No, come on.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:31.480
Don't give up.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:32.360
Oh, I'm not giving up.

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.000
So where does this go is the question.

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:35.480
Yeah.

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:35.840
Right.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.440
What, what happens next?

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:43.160
And I mean, going back, I mean, I've been in so many PC revolutions, right.

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:48.120
Or evolutions, um, where porn was the big issue, right.

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:52.120
Now we don't even talk about porn being an issue, even though, you know, if every,

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:59.160
every post on Twitter now has, you know, Lincoln bio for, for a porn post, right.

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.200
We don't even think that's, that's a negative anymore.

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.720
That's just a, an accepted thing.

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:07.520
And now it's, it's become very, um, where your politics on, on Twitter.

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:16.560
But again, as you extend that and, and things grow as AI models become more

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:21.960
efficient and trainable on less for a lot less money or even locally on a PC or a

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:26.320
phone, we're all going to have our own models and there's going to be millions

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:29.560
of millions of millions of models and not just foundational models.

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:31.840
Now maybe opens, maybe they're built some on open source.

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:36.840
Maybe, you know, um, it'll be copy pasta where you can just cut and paste and

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:39.360
create your own model and train it yourself.

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:42.840
Maybe it'll be mixed mixture of experts where, you know, maybe it'll be a

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:47.560
meta front end, like we're working on a project where we take 30 different AI

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:51.720
models and there's just a meta search engine where it searches all of them and

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:55.520
you can compare all the outputs and see what you think is the best kind of like a

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:56.400
search engine, right?

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.960
Because you might get is DEI good, right?

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:02.480
You know, is the COVID vaccine good, right?

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:07.480
You're going to get a variety of, of, of, um, outputs and you have to

01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:08.760
make that decision yourself.

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:12.520
That's what I think is going to happen with AI as well, because I think brands,

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:18.080
there's no way the Mayo clinic and the Harvard medical school are just going to

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:24.040
contribute all their IP to chap GPT or Gemini or whatever they're going to, it's

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.920
going to have to be licensed or they're going to do their own.

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:27.080
Yeah.

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:33.280
I mean, that's a very hopeful message, but that said, you know, uh, human

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:37.960
history doesn't always auto correct really quickly, self-correct really quickly.

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:41.240
Sometimes you get into this very painful things.

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:44.760
You have, you have Stalin, you have Hitler.

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:48.480
You can get to places very quickly where the ideological

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.680
thing just builds on itself.

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:52.520
And like, Twitter is not real world.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.480
You know, there's, there's 27, it's not real world.

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:55.920
That's true.

01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:56.520
Yes.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:00.400
But you could still have a nation captured by an ideology.

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:06.880
I think America has been really good at having these two blue and red, always

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:12.800
at attention with each other, dividing the populace and in the process of doing

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:16.720
that, figuring stuff out, like almost like, uh, playing devil's advocate,

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:17.760
but like in real life.

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:19.640
You know, and that's, that's fair.

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:20.320
And that's right.

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:22.960
You know, as opposed to Pravda telling you everything you want to know.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:23.320
Right.

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:25.840
And, and everybody believe in it because there's control of everything.

01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:26.160
Right.

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:29.680
And so going back to what you said earlier, people in Russia don't

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:33.360
think that, you know, invading Ukraine, it's, it's, you know, a lot of

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:34.880
them see it as a positive, right.

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:39.080
Um, I'm sure you have relatives and friends who think, you know, it's the

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.320
best thing to ever happen, right.

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:42.160
Cause they believe in Putin.

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.240
They're denazifying Ukraine.

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.760
They're removing the Nazis.

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:46.080
Right.

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:46.320
Right.

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.720
Cause that's exactly what Putin said.

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:55.040
And, you know, we don't have one uniform, um, media outlet.

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:58.520
That's the difference, even though people like to talk about mainstream

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:01.520
media as being the source of a lot of the friction, there is no such

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.000
thing as mainstream media anymore.

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:09.000
You know, Fox is the biggest, um, cable news channel with the biggest audience

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:13.320
and they call everybody else mainstream media, you know, it's insane.

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:17.040
The things that we accept from our sources of information, to me,

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.240
that's the bigger problem.

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:23.280
The bigger problem is trying to figure out what is free speech and what is

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:27.960
the line of tolerance for free speech and at what point does hateful free

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:30.040
speech crowd out other, other people.

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:30.560
Right.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:31.720
Putin's the master of that.

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:35.080
He, you're going to jail or you're going to be dead if you disagree.

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:35.720
Right.

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:40.280
No, God help us if we ever get to that point here, but the person who

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:42.760
controls the algorithm controls the world.

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:43.800
Right.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:50.000
And if you are committed to one specific platform as your singular

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.720
source of information or affiliated platforms, then whoever controls the

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:58.800
algorithm or the programming there controls you in a lot of respects.

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:01.200
And I think that's where our biggest problem has been.

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:08.600
We get people attached to specific platforms and apps and media outlets,

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:14.640
and they become part of that team and they identify as such, and either

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.360
you're part of the team or you're not.

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.600
And that to me is the fundamental problem.

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:23.040
It's not woke ideology because I never felt any pressure to make the choices

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:27.320
that I've, that I've chosen and, you know, including diversity, equity and

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:31.360
inclusion, and I've never forced anybody or told anybody to do it.

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.840
I just said, here's my experiences.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.720
Whenever I've talked to people who talk about the woke ideology,

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.200
no one ever got forced.

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:40.320
I mean, if you look at Dylan McDermott, right.

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:46.440
If there was a way to gauge the number of impressions that she had, right.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:50.960
And where they source from, I'd be willing to bet any amount of money that 90%

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:55.800
plus of the impressions and discussions of Dylan McDermott were on right

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:56.520
leaning media.

01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:59.760
Several things actually, let's even go there.

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:03.640
You've gotten a bit of a beef with, again, fun with Jordan Peterson about this.

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:05.000
That's the guy whose name I couldn't think of.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:05.280
Yeah.

01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:10.120
So the topic there was the gender transition and Dylan Mulvaney.

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.480
Hugh, can you explain the nature of the beef?

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:16.880
I mean, the, it's an interesting claim you're making that most, most of the

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.680
people who are concerned, concerned about this are conservatives.

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:24.880
Yeah, I just, the point is that if you looked at impressions, like when you run

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.400
an ad, you're curious about impressions and who sees them, right.

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:33.520
Um, but if you look at the impressions related to Dylan McDermott, um, I would,

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:37.160
like I just said, I bet 90% or more were in conservative media.

01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:41.880
And, you know, I don't know how many followers she had 250,000 followers or

01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:43.480
whatever when the Bud Light ad came out.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.960
And if it weren't for Kid Rock shooting, you know, gun, um, shooting at Dylan

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:52.640
McDermott Bud Light cans, she'd be long forgotten.

01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:53.440
Yeah.

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:57.040
But most of the people that care about censorship are going to be free speech

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:57.520
advocates.

01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:02.560
So like most people that care about Putin suppressing speech or anybody else

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:05.480
suppressing speech are going to be like libertarian.

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:08.040
So again, there's, there's probably an explanation of that.

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:13.360
The, the, the criticism that Jordan Peterson could provide, I guess he said

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:20.320
that, uh, Dylan Mulvaney popularized the kind of mutilation in his view.

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:26.200
Um, they can affect, there's a very serious life changing process that a

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.320
person goes through.

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:31.600
And when that's applied to a child, it can do a lot of harm to a person.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.640
But my point still holds.

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:38.120
I don't know how many kids were following and you can look at the followers list.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.280
It's not like it's hidden, right?

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:44.400
Back then, if they had 250,000 followers and now we're on TikTok, um, you know,

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:47.600
where he might get 50 some thousand views or likes, right?

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:48.960
I don't know how many views, but likes.

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:55.920
I don't, I've never seen any evidence that Dylan McDermott influenced people

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.880
to transition their gender as he transitioned to her.

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:03.120
It was documented on TikTok over the course of a year.

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:09.960
And again, when you go back and look at the views on those TikToks, it was, you

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:13.480
know, it wasn't like enormous.

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.520
Yeah, but the trends start, right?

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:24.680
It could be, uh, what, what is people's for young kids there to be a trend of

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:28.120
we, especially when you feel like an outsider, you feel not yourself less

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:33.480
than yourself, all this kind of stuff that kids feel like that if it's because

01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:40.600
popular enough as a trend, you would gender transition, uh, without meaning

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.520
to do that is just part of a trend.

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:45.640
That's the worry that has a big stretch, right?

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:51.320
To think that all the things that have to happen before you transition gender.

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:52.080
Right.

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:58.320
And I'm not saying kids, um, might identify, you know, find it cool or, you

01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:03.080
know, in the moment, um, expedient, if you will, um, to dress up as the other gender.

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:03.760
Great.

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:04.440
Who cares?

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:04.920
Right.

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:09.400
But to go through the actual physical transition, I don't remember what

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:14.160
the numbers were that I read, but I do remember that the latest numbers that

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:18.840
came out in terms of transitioning were from JAMA, which is a medical

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:26.960
association that said, um, 20 from 2021 to 2022, the numbers went down.

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:32.160
But the bigger point is there are no numbers for 2023 when post Dylan McDermott.

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:37.000
So there's no way to know if the assertion is true, even marginally true.

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:40.920
Now you can, you can easily suggest it, right?

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:44.680
But you can say, say that about any social media influencer, right?

01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:50.360
You know, people are kids are dying because, you know, I mean, it's just

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:56.160
like when people accuse Trump of potentially influencing people to, you

01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:58.040
know, inject bleach into their veins.

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:03.200
You can't, you know, that's a big old leap to say that because the, you know,

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:06.920
Trump says it, that people are going to start invest, you know, injecting, and

01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:08.720
then they find somebody who actually did.

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.080
And it's like, Oh, it must be true.

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.880
You know, this is a trend now.

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:18.160
I just, I'm just not buying it that there aren't enough roadblocks in the way.

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.600
Now I'm not saying it never happens, right?

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:25.320
And I, and for me, to me, you should have to wait until you're 18 to

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:27.600
actually have any surgery to transition.

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:32.040
Um, and if your parents approve it earlier, then you can have

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.320
a conversation with your doctor.

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:39.360
But you're suggesting that everybody in that process to go to transition

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:46.080
a minor is corrupt that the doctor, the sociologist, the psychologist, all the

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:50.200
people involved, the hospital where the surgery is happening, the insurance

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:54.120
company that's paying for it, they all have been corrupted by this trend.

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:55.000
I just don't see that.

01:30:55.320 --> 01:31:00.280
Well, it's not corrupted, but you know, people, uh, it's back to the DEI thing.

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:03.720
There could be pressure and we are pressure to operate.

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:07.640
So think about all the people who have to be complicit to do an operation.

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:09.480
It's not complicit like evil complicit.

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:11.400
It's no, it is evil complicit, right?

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:16.640
Because somebody docked in hospitals right now, they won't perform

01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:21.960
abortions because of state law and Alabama, they stopped IVF treatment

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.760
immediately after that, um, ruling by that judge, right?

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:30.440
The Q Anon judge, the same thing that they're not going to pay attention

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:34.840
to the possible consequences of being the hospital that does transgender

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.480
that, uh, that gives doctors operating rights there and not be, um, aware of

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:44.000
the risks associated with it and double check to me, that's just insane.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.480
They're risking their entire business and livelihood and personal relationships

01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:53.800
for not checking that this 14 year old, you know, boy who wants to be a girl or

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:58.320
vice versa is there waiting for, for surgery that I just don't see that

01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:59.080
in America.

01:31:59.440 --> 01:31:59.960
Yes.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:06.640
But if we look at humans in general and Jordan Peterson, I think unjustly

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:08.520
incorrectly brought up Auschwitz.

01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:10.400
Yeah, that was, that was ridiculous.

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:16.560
But if we look to me, world war two is a very interesting time.

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:21.240
It does reveal a lot about human nature and that humans are able to commit

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:24.000
atrocities without really speaking up.

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:29.320
The point I want to make is that when you're in this situation where

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:33.400
everybody is around, around you is committing an atrocity.

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:38.840
You can be sort of the, the good German and yeah, but I mean, human

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.760
nature is such that you can do that.

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:43.360
That is in a time of war.

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:46.480
Yeah, but it's still human nature.

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:50.840
It's interesting to remember that war when you feel like there's

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:53.960
nationalism, patriotism, everything that comes up in Russia, right?

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.400
You know, the moms of the kids sent to be, you know, sent to Ukraine who

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:02.080
didn't come back in Russia feel certainly different than the, the

01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:05.600
everyday Russian who's just taking, you know, whatever information that's

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:07.760
available from a unified controlled media.

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:08.200
Yeah.

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:11.480
But you know, we should remember human nature.

01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:12.120
It's interesting.

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:15.120
I'm not just missing human nature at all, but there's a difference.

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:19.960
I think that human nature, self-preservation influences those decisions.

01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:25.640
There's nothing about self-preservation involved in DEI, wokeness, you know,

01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:28.320
transgenderism to compare it to Auschwitz.

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:29.000
That's insane.

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:29.760
Yeah.

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:34.640
Well, that comparison is almost always, probably always is insane comparison

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:37.000
between anything and the Holocaust.

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:40.320
I think there's a name for that role, but once you bring up

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:42.440
Hitler, the conversation goes away.

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:46.160
I do appreciate you bringing up Trump and bleach as an example.

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:52.600
So continuing on fun exchanges between you and Elon, you said if they were

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:57.320
having Biden's last wake and it was him versus Trump and he was being given

01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:01.600
last rights, I would still vote for Biden to which Elon replied,

01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:07.640
caricaturing you if Biden were a flesh eating zombie with five seconds to live

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:13.160
or upon being reelected, earth would plunge into a 1000 years of darkness.

01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:14.840
I would still vote for him.

01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:20.800
That's basically quoting you, but in a caricature and you responded.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.400
Well, I have your attention.

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:25.480
Wanted to say thank you.

01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:30.240
Your consultants at Tesla followed up about using cost plus drugs,

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:34.480
but which we'll talk about to save the company money, truly appreciate it.

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:39.040
And in parentheses, my limit is 300 years of darkness.

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:40.720
Very well done, Mark.

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.720
What's your intuition?

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:46.560
If we just stick on Biden and Trump for a sec, what's your intuition?

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:48.520
Why Biden would make a better president than Trump?

01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.920
Look at it at the basics, right?

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.080
If you look at the people he's hired, there hasn't been any

01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:57.840
turnover in his cabinet at all.

01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:02.360
If you look at the people he's hired, um, over the course of his career,

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:06.800
or while he was vice president in particular, there's nobody who's turned

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:10.880
on him and came out and written books and made public statements about

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.160
how he's bad for the country.

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:19.840
Now compare that to Trump, the people closest to him, almost all of them turn

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:22.480
unless there's a financial relationship involved.

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:25.840
And to me, that says everything.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.800
The dynamics of the team is important to you.

01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:30.560
If you're going to be the most powerful person in the world, you better know

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:32.520
how to manage and lead, right?

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:37.280
And that's not to say Biden hasn't made a lot of mistakes.

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:40.840
I mean, immigration, the border is a horrific mistake.

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:44.240
Um, and hopefully he recognizes that.

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:47.320
And I don't like the fact that he doesn't admit his mistakes and just say,

01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:48.680
okay, I got to fix it.

01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:50.760
Or I made a mistake in Afghanistan or whatever it may be.

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:51.360
Right.

01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:58.320
The position of commander in chief and, um, president, you're going to make mistakes.

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:03.800
Then I look at the other guy, never miss a mistake and the list is long.

01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:06.520
Well, what do you think about the immigration situation?

01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:15.360
A lot of conservatives are using that, uh, sort of the, the theory is that the

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:20.600
reason it's happening is because they would be able to illegally vote for

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:21.240
Biden. Yeah.

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.160
You can't be an illegal immigrant and vote.

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:27.520
And now in a lot of States, because of the conservatives, they've passed

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.280
laws saying you have to show identification.

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:34.120
When I voted in Texas, you had to show, you know, state identification.

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:35.160
They can't vote.

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:38.640
You can't register as an illegal alien that I'm aware of to vote.

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:39.400
Yeah.

01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:46.240
But of course that story really worries me, um, enables or serves as a catalyst

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:48.440
for questioning the legitimacy of an election.

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:55.000
I remember going to the debate with Trump, um, in 2016 and he was debating Clinton.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.840
And one of the things he said was, we don't even know if this election will

01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:04.640
be legitimate if I lose this was in 2016 before he was even elected.

01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:05.960
And that was where he was going.

01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:07.360
That's just what he does.

01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:09.240
He's never admitted a mistake.

01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:11.040
The guys failed a zillion times.

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.640
Most people say, okay, I learned from them.

01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:17.920
You know, read, I read a book about Roy Cohen and, you know, Roy Cohen was the

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:19.360
ultimate deny, deny, deny.

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:20.840
And that was one of Trump's mentors.

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:25.880
And you can see almost everything of Roy Cohen ever did in the same way

01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:27.440
that Donald Trump approaches things.

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:32.200
But given how drastic the immigration situation is, it, that story

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:33.160
becomes more believable.

01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:34.160
Yeah, of course it does.

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:34.360
Right.

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:35.920
But the facts are still the facts.

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:36.520
Right.

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:40.400
And in red States, they're going to be checking every identity ID.

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.400
They're going to be making sure that's not the case.

01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:45.320
And, you know, you can also make the argument, well, in the blue

01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:47.600
state, it doesn't matter in the, the swing States.

01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.000
They're still going to be checking because they know Trump is going to

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.560
sue the shit out of them when he loses, you know?

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:59.160
And so again, that's where, you know, people will take those self preservation

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:01.480
steps to keep their job and do the right thing.

01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:05.560
There's still enough people who believe in this country and how amazing

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:07.360
it is to do the right thing.

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:11.880
And a lot of the premise of what some conservatives are saying and doing,

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:17.760
the underpinning of it is that their fellow citizens will not do anything.

01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:22.520
Not some things, anything that serves the best interest of this country.

01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.040
And to me, that's just wrong.

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:26.800
You know, that is just misleading and wrong.

01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:30.360
I just worry about, I don't care about Trump or Biden.

01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:32.280
I care about democracy.

01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:34.080
I just worry.

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:38.520
I worry about the viral nature of the idea of this illegal immigrants.

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:41.480
But it's just, it's very functional, right?

01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:46.680
Either they get across, there's a thousand different ways to, an unlimited

01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:50.200
number of ways to enter the United States of America undetected, right?

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:53.000
And the South border where it's the easiest and the worst.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.440
And Biden needs to take steps to reduce that.

01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.280
Remember when Biden was vice president and Obama was president, they called

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:02.120
Obama the deporter in chief.

01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:05.080
He had no problem deporting people.

01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:10.240
And I think if I had to guess, and this is just a guess that when they looked at

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:14.200
the initial statistics for immigration, when Biden took over, they thought there

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:18.720
was room for more immigrants, not because they would vote, but, you know, you can

01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:25.000
make a fiscal argument that in a, in a world where the birth rate is flat to

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.720
declining, we need immigrants, right?

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:35.000
And immigrants typically don't, you know, don't have a higher crime rate or anything

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.840
than, you know, indigenous American citizens, indigenous isn't the right word,

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:39.760
but American citizens.

01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:43.680
Um, and so they made a calculated mistake.

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:47.200
They made a decision that was wrong and now they have to fix it or it's

01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:51.000
going to hurt them severely, but I don't buy, you know, like what Elon's pushing

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.440
that, um, the whole reason is they are voters and will become voters.

01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:03.560
And we should say the obvious, you're a descendant of immigrants and the

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:06.960
immigrants is what makes this country great in many parts of the diversity of

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:07.640
this nation.

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:11.440
And we should probably keep the people that are like already been in this

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:13.800
country for a while and are killing it.

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:15.760
Like PhD students and all this.

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.760
It's like, that's not what Donald Trump wants though.

01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.760
He wants to ship them all out, right?

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:23.640
There's just a whole lot of hyperbole when it comes to talking to all about

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:28.040
talking about all of these things we're talking about when there it's right

01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:31.800
versus left, my team versus your team, my tribe versus your tribe.

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:34.200
The only way to stand out is hyperbole.

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:37.960
The hard part and why I like this conversation is how do you distinguish

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:40.040
hyperbole versus reality?

01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:46.600
And I get where you're going Lex, where it's like what the smallest spark

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:50.600
sometimes can cause people to change.

01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:55.800
And then that spark becomes bigger and then it becomes, um, more widespread.

01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:58.320
And then all of a sudden your country has changed.

01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.600
It's not what you thought it was.

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.640
I get that completely right.

01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:05.080
And yes, you always have to be on top of that to make sure.

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:08.080
But a lot of that comes from lack of leadership, right?

01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:13.320
And lack of trust because there's nobody who's saying, all right, the Republicans,

01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:15.560
that's all hyperbole and you're wrong for that.

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:18.680
Democrats, you fucked up on immigration, right?

01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:20.960
You fucked up in Afghanistan, right?

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:23.240
Here's where you made these mistakes, own it.

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:27.720
There's nobody who says, right, um, we're not going to just bring in

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:29.400
Republicans if the Republicans win.

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:32.280
And then, you know, and there's nobody who says, we're not going to just bring

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:34.360
in Democrats, we're going to bring in a mix, right?

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:36.760
We're going to try to get balanced on the Supreme court.

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:39.440
There's just, there's no leadership that's doing it.

01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:40.840
That's the fundamental problem.

01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:42.800
It's not about the ideology of woke.

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:44.520
It's not the, no leadership.

01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:45.960
Yeah, leadership.

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:49.560
And yeah, there's, it's, it's whatever systems we've created.

01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:54.520
It's, it's really frustrating that, uh, if you don't like Trump, it's, it's really

01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:55.800
is Trump derangement syndrome.

01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:57.960
Like he's the, he's definitely Hitler.

01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:04.920
If you don't like Biden, he's seen a lizard person, um, that everybody gets

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:05.680
labeled, right?

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:10.480
And because that works on social media that look, if, if Elon changed the

01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:16.440
algorithm, just by taking himself out of it, seriously, I'm not saying don't post,

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:16.680
right?

01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:22.440
Post all you want, but he, you know, if you look at his followers, um, they're

01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:23.520
almost all right leaning.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.320
If you look at the people he engages with positively, they're almost all

01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:28.040
right leaning.

01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:31.600
And if you look at the people he engages with negatively, like me, right.

01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:37.280
I consider myself an independent, but it's, I lean left on the DEI topic.

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:37.680
Right.

01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:40.320
Um, that influences the algorithm.

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:43.800
And so you see what you see because of what he says.

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:44.280
Yeah.

01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:48.960
Well, I mean, for sure, but the, the, there could be a lot of influential

01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:53.120
people on Twitter that influence the algorithm and all that kind of stuff.

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:57.320
I do feel it's not even about ideology where you lean.

01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:04.240
It's about like the algorithm, not prioritizing drama, like the, the, the

01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:10.640
attention grabbing thing or the lower lizard version of that, or like people

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:12.840
just want the drama they want to tear it out.

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:16.440
When I last read through all the stuff on, on, on their algorithm, right?

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:17.200
Maybe it's changed.

01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:24.320
Whoever has the biggest account and gets engagement on that account influences

01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:25.760
what people see the most.

01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:26.840
Yeah.

01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:27.560
I mean, that's interesting.

01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:29.000
I don't know if that's to a degree.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:29.480
That's true.

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:37.160
They they've pretty rigorous description of what's, um, of the way the algorithm

01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:38.640
works is actually kind of fascinating.

01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:41.160
There's a clustering of people based on the interest, right?

01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:43.880
But I think they're called the nearest neighbor, right approach.

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:44.880
And I think that's what they do.

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:48.960
And so whoever has the biggest account has the most neighbors who in turn have

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:51.960
their neighbors, who in turn have their neighbors, and that's how they

01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:53.440
discern what comes next.

01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:54.760
But there's a clustering still.

01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:58.680
So like, if you don't give a shit about Elon, you're not following him.

01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:00.600
Yeah, you're not, you're not going to have an influence.

01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:05.800
When you get a break, just create a burner account on Twitter and see

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:06.840
what, who they recommend to you.

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:12.720
And not just Elon, I mean, the people that Elon likes, and I'm saying that's

01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:16.440
not Elon saying add this person, add this person and suggest this person,

01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:17.400
this person, this person.

01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:19.760
I'm saying that's what the algorithm.

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:21.600
Yeah, there should be transparency around that for sure.

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:22.840
There is, there is.

01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:23.880
That's the whole point, right?

01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:26.480
He knows there's transparency and he knows the impact.

01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.840
That's why when I say take yourself out of the algorithm, right?

01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:32.320
Don't include his account that changes.

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:33.960
I think the output of the algorithm.

01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:37.400
Well, when he wasn't owning Twitter, he was one of the biggest accounts.

01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:40.920
If not the biggest account already, it wasn't, but still like even like the

01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:43.720
the Kim Kardashian accounts, whatever, right?

01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:48.240
I don't, it wasn't open source to Elon's credit.

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:48.680
It is now.

01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:50.920
So I couldn't see it to know, right?

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:54.120
So I didn't get the sense one way or the other of one, one element being

01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:58.080
dominant over the other, but obviously conservators felt that that left

01:44:58.080 --> 01:44:59.600
leaning was more dominant back then.

01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:00.160
Yeah.

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:02.080
I would love to see numbers on all of this.

01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:02.680
Yeah, you'll be fine.

01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:05.600
DEI, everything like this.

01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:09.320
Sometimes anecdotal data really frustrates me.

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:13.000
It frustrates me primarily because of how sexy it is.

01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:17.800
People just love a story and I'm like, God damn it.

01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:18.800
This is not science.

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:21.640
This is, it's not even common sense.

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:26.240
Well, no, I, I think anecdotal stories often have a wisdom in them.

01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:27.800
Like no doubt, right?

01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:29.600
There's something to be gained from it.

01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:33.600
There's a signal there, but like how representative is that

01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:35.000
signal of the broader thing?

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.280
There's a whole lot more noise than signal more often than not.

01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:37.920
All right.

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:41.400
So as I mentioned, cost plus drugs, there's so many

01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:45.360
questions I can ask here, but, uh, what's the big question?

01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:47.600
What's broken about our healthcare system?

01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:48.600
There's no transparency.

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:51.880
And when the lack of transparency leads to lack of trust.

01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:55.200
And when you can't trust the healthcare system other than maybe

01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:57.600
your doctor, that's a broken system.

01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:04.120
So what aspect of, uh, the system does cost plus drugs is trying to solve?

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:07.160
So the thing we're trying to solve for is trust.

01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:10.640
And the way we feel we get there is through complete transparency.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.680
So when you go to cost plus drugs.com and you put in the name of the medication,

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:19.440
if it's one of the 2,500 and growing that we carry, we will first show you

01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:21.240
our costs, what we actually pay for it.

01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:23.600
Then we'll show you our 15% markup.

01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:28.000
Then we'll show the pharmacy fill fee and shipping and that's your total price.

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:33.760
And that alone, that transparency alone is completely revolutionizing

01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:36.800
how drugs are priced in America today.

01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:43.800
And it's led to, you know, research being done, comparing our pricing to CMS.

01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:48.920
Um, and ours being cheaper, you know, than even the government is negotiating,

01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:49.960
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:55.760
And so just that transparently transparency alone has, has had an impact

01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:59.280
and saved millions of people, hundreds of millions of dollars or more.

01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:02.280
And maybe it results in more transparency in other parts of the

01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:03.880
system to seeing the business of it.

01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:09.640
But, uh, what do the so-called middlemen companies, so the, the PBMs,

01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:10.840
the pharmacy benefit managers.

01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:11.280
Thank you.

01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:18.520
CVS Caremark, Cygnus Express Scripts and UnitedHealth OptumRx.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.880
They control majority of the market.

01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:21.120
Right.

01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:22.320
What do they do wrong?

01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:23.960
They put profits over everything.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:24.360
Right.

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:29.760
And they know in an, in an industry that's completely opaque, they can

01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:33.680
pretty much do what they want and nobody gets to see what they're doing in detail.

01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:39.880
And so, you know, the first thing when you, um, sign a contract with one

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:43.840
of those big PBMs, it says, you can't disclose any of this.

01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:48.480
And the fact that you can't be disclosed means they could tell Lexus

01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:53.200
company that, um, they're being, you know, they're getting a great price

01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:56.800
and they're only being charged X and they can call, tell Mark's company.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.480
Oh, you're getting a great price and we're charging Mark X plus, right.

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:02.320
But Mark doesn't know any better.

01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:03.280
Cause there's no way to know.

01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:05.120
The markup is not transparent.

01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:06.360
The cost isn't transparent.

01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:07.520
The markup isn't transparent.

01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:11.120
You know, and you know, there's different things, you know, like I was just

01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:16.120
talking to a company, um, in a presentation a couple of days ago, and they took the

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:21.400
step to leave the big three PBMs to go to a rebate free PBM that was smaller.

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:24.480
Um, and what they said led to the decision.

01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:28.440
They had a contract with the PBM for these things called rebates, right?

01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:31.560
Where depending on the volume of medications you buy, they'll kick

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.880
back to you, um, a percentage of them.

01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:38.240
And as it turns out, when they compared what was contracted for, to what they

01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:41.360
actually got, they were getting underpaid every single year.

01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:43.840
They just don't care, right?

01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:44.960
They'll take products.

01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:47.160
There's, there's a drug called humira, right?

01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:51.480
And it is the number one revenue drug, um, in the country.

01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:55.520
And there's also a biosimilar multiple biosimilars, but one

01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:57.200
we carry called eusimery.

01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:04.440
And humira, the, the pre rebate price is about $8,000 per month.

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:08.760
And after rebates, depending on the size of the company, it'll be anywhere

01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:10.520
from three to $6,000 a month.

01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:16.320
You can go to get your doctor to prescribe that biosimilar eusimery and you pay $594.

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:22.840
But those big three PBMs won't allow their clients to, um, get eusimery

01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:25.680
because they don't get a rebate on eusimery.

01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:31.120
So they'd rather keep a drug on their formulary, even though their patients

01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:35.880
would save, their customers would save a lot of money, they'd rather keep a drug

01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:38.520
and exclude another because they'll make a lot more money.

01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:45.680
So the CVS Caremark spokesperson, I think, responded to you, Phil Blando

01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:53.520
with, with the usual language that so deeply exhausts me, but I was wondering

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:55.080
if there's any truth to it.

01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:59.640
Employers, unions, health plans, and government programs work with CVS

01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:04.760
Caremark precisely because we deliver for them lower drug costs, better

01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:10.680
health outcomes, and broad pharmacy access through our true costs, cost

01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:14.040
vantage and choice formulary initiatives.

01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:18.360
We are the leading agent of change, innovation and transparency in the market.

01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:19.720
That's a whole lot of nothing.

01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:22.680
So they, they are not transparent.

01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:24.320
No, don't call them up.

01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:28.200
You go to Cost Plus Drugs, we'll give you our price list of every, all

01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:32.120
2,500 plus drugs, the actual cost, the actual cost and what we sell it for.

01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:33.880
Because it's just a plus 15%.

01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:37.360
Call up any of the big three companies and ask them for the same thing.

01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:38.600
They're going to laugh at you.

01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:39.480
It's so bad.

01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:44.080
In fact, if you do business with them right now and you just ask for your claims

01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:47.520
data, meaning, you know, how many people use Humira that we're paying?

01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:48.360
What are we paying for it?

01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:52.320
They won't even give it to you unless you really, really scream and yell at them.

01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:54.480
And then they'll charge you and take six months to get it.

01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:58.440
So like when we moved away from them, we wanted to get what our claims data was

01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:00.720
to understand what we were going to be facing.

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:04.320
They wouldn't give it to us until like six months later.

01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:07.360
I forget the exact month, but, and then we, they charge us for it as well.

01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:12.000
Our own data on the CEO front, you said that CEOs don't understand

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.560
healthcare coverage and it's costing them big.

01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:19.520
What's, what's the connection between, uh, Cost Plus Drugs and companies?

01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:24.080
So I can speak for my own companies and this applies to all companies, you

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:28.920
know, bigger companies that self-insure because we self-insured, um, when I

01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:31.640
finally, when we started Cost Plus, I finally said, okay, it's time for me

01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:34.760
to understand how I'm paying for my healthcare, for my employees and their

01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:35.280
families.

01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:38.520
And the first thing I looked at was a lot of these companies use

01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:39.800
employee benefits consultants.

01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:45.400
And turns out I was getting, I was paying $30 per employee per month,

01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:48.080
which was millions of dollars a year.

01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:52.880
And they were just sending us to the companies that paid them

01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:53.800
the biggest commissions.

01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:56.360
I'm like, how fucking dumb am I?

01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:57.800
Right.

01:51:57.920 --> 01:51:59.000
So I'm like, okay, we're cutting that.

01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:05.600
And then I looked at our, um, medication, our prescription deal that goes through

01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:09.240
the PBMs that we were using and that the consultant connected us with.

01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:15.000
And I took a list of, this was early on in Cost Plus Drugs list of the

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.840
generic drugs that we sold that cost more than $30 that the Mavericks

01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:20.320
also had purchased, right?

01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:21.640
We were able to get that claims data.

01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:28.280
And it turns out we spent $169,000 with that PBM, one of the big three

01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:32.320
PBMs, and it would have cost us buying from Cost Plus Drugs $19,000.

01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:36.040
And that's just a simple example.

01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:38.240
Then I looked at the insurance side of things, right?

01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:39.040
We self-insure.

01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:44.680
Um, so there weren't premiums per se, but we were getting charged $17.15 per

01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:49.160
employee per month, just to use the network that they put together for us.

01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:50.760
You know, providers, hospitals, whatever.

01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:53.720
And I'm like, all right, are there companies that won't charge us

01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:54.920
to put together these networks?

01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:56.640
It turns out there's a lot of them.

01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:01.920
And those, that those insurance companies and those PBMs are also responsible

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:08.720
for determining what claims, what, what, um, what to authorize and what to deny.

01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:09.200
Right.

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:13.760
So for a drug, it may be, all right, this is an expensive drug, but

01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:17.760
before they'll allow, before they'll say they'll pay for the drug that your

01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:20.760
doctor wants to prescribe for you, you have to try these three other drugs

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.360
in what's called step-up therapy, right?

01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:25.960
To see if these other cheaper drugs work or they're not even necessarily cheaper.

01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:31.200
They may be, um, being pushed because they're getting a higher rebate.

01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:33.520
And so I'm like, that's insane.

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:38.400
I want my employees to get the medication that the doctors say is best.

01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:44.280
And so I didn't realize those were the intricacies of how my health or

01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:45.720
where my healthcare dollars went.

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:50.520
There's not a single CEO who does because that's not a core competency that they

01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:55.680
need and the CFOs that's not their core competency and the HR people, they

01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:58.720
contribute and they understand it some because they're dealing with the claims,

01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:02.720
but they spend most of their prescription drug related time or healthcare related

01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:05.840
times trying to get preauthorizations approved.

01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:10.760
So, you know, your kid breaks their arm or you have, you, you get sick and you go

01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:15.760
to the doctor and before the doctor will do a surgery or do whatever, they have

01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:19.480
to go to the insurance company and get preauthorized and then they always say

01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:20.520
no, right?

01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:22.960
And then you have to go back and somebody has to argue for you.

01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:26.680
And that just eats up employee time because, you know, I'm sick or my kid's

01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:30.640
sick and you're wasting my time, eats up HR time, the CEOs don't know any of this.

01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:31.720
Right?

01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:35.560
So what I'm saying is one, the smartest thing to do is to get a healthcare

01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:39.760
CEO at every company with over, let's say 500 employees that focuses on all

01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:41.840
these things, you'd save a shitload of money.

01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:47.800
And two, healthcare is your second largest line item expense after payroll.

01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:51.960
And in some companies there's hundreds, billions of dollars, right?

01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:56.200
And you don't understand it and you're letting these guys rip you off and it's

01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:02.160
because these big CEOs don't understand it and are getting ripped off that the

01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:07.160
industry is the way it is because that allows the opacity to continue.

01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:08.560
That's fascinating.

01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:16.680
So most companies outsource offload, sort of the expertise on the healthcare side

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.280
when they really should be internally, there should be an expert that figures out.

01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:22.400
Yes, because it's the wellness of your employees and their families.

01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:23.600
And it costs a lot of money.

01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:26.720
Yeah, but if your employees aren't healthy or if they're worried about their

01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:32.560
kids, and what is more worrisome and detrimental to the performance of a

01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:33.920
company, right?

01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:41.680
A DEI program or having to go to HR and scream and yell and explain, and your

01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:46.280
doctor wasting their time doing the same thing to get authorization for a

01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:47.800
surgery or a medication.

01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:48.720
It's insane.

01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:55.160
What made you decide to step into this cartel-like situation where so much is

01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:55.840
opaque?

01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:58.200
So I got a cold email from a Dr.

01:55:58.200 --> 01:55:59.920
Alex Oshmianski, who's my co-founder.

01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:03.440
He's a radiologist by trade and a physicist and a smart motherfucker.

01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:08.760
And he had a pharmacy that he wanted to create a compounding pharmacy that would

01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:12.680
manufacture generic drugs that were in short supply because it happens all the

01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:14.040
time that things aren't available.

01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:16.240
I'm like, you're thinking too small.

01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:18.360
We should do something on a much bigger scale.

01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:21.840
And then it was right around the time they were sending the pharmacy bro,

01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:23.320
Martin Shkreli, to jail.

01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:28.120
And so I was reading up on that and he increased the price of this drug,

01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:28.760
Daraprim.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.920
I think it was like 7,500% or increased a low cost drug to $7,500, one of those.

01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:38.320
And I'm like, well, if he can just jack up the price of this drug and charge more

01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:41.440
and get away with it, this has to be an incredibly inefficient market.

01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:45.360
And so the question is, why is he able to do it?

01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:48.880
And it was immediately apparent that it was a lack of transparency.

01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:53.120
And so can we start a company that is fully transparent with our costs, our

01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:56.600
markup and our selling price and see if it works?

01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:59.840
And so we went for it and it took off immediately.

01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:03.760
I mean, you, you know, you read a press release from a company saying, you know,

01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:08.000
they were creating a cost advantage program, basically pretending to replicate us.

01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:08.280
Yeah.

01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:10.640
We haven't been in business two years.

01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:13.160
How insane is that?

01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:14.480
Did you get a lot of pressure?

01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:18.240
I mean, I'm sure they're very good at playing games, like so cartel type

01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:22.480
situations, they protect, it feels like healthcare, like it's very difficult to

01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:23.040
get in there.

01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:24.200
It does.

01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:27.320
I mean, and the whole industry is an arbitrage, but we don't work inside

01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:28.840
the system, we work outside the system.

01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:31.920
And so we don't work with those biggest companies, the biggest companies with

01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:35.640
the most dominant control, you know, it's very insulated and very controlled.

01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:37.760
Like you said, we work outside them.

01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:38.680
We won't work with them.

01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:43.800
And so because of that, we don't have access to every medication because they've

01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:47.800
told a lot of the big brand manufacturers that if they work with us, they'll take

01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:51.840
them off their formularies or change the rebate structure so that they won't be

01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:52.560
prescribed as much.

01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:55.200
Yeah, it is dark, but we'll get past that, right?

01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:59.560
Because there's a downstream impact of all this in the rebates and the

01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:01.640
greediness of those big three PBMs.

01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:05.840
When you go to a local pharmacy here in Austin, right?

01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:09.040
And let's just say you have, you have a friend here, right?

01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:11.200
That is on Medicare or Medicare Advantage.

01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:15.880
And they go to a local pharmacy and they get a drug that costs $600.

01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:20.000
Well, and the insurance company, that's $600.

01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:25.200
The pharmacy first buys that drug for probably that price minus 5%.

01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:26.520
So $570.

01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:30.280
Then there's probably a copay by the patient and that's probably $20.

01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:35.480
So now the net investment that the pharmacy, the local pharmacy has for

01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:38.480
that brand medication is $550.

01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:45.080
Where it gets really fucked up is those big three PBMs, they're not

01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:47.800
reimbursing them $550 or more.

01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:52.200
They're reimbursing them $500 or less.

01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:58.040
And literally those community pharmacies are eating that loss.

01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:01.200
And as a result, they're going out of business left and right.

01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:05.920
And the most insane part of it is yes, with corporate employer

01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:11.120
insurance, that happens, but it happens more with Medicare Part D and Medicare

01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:14.560
Advantage happens all the time with those almost with every script.

01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:20.280
So the government is complicit in these community pharmacies going out of business.

01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:24.520
So how does that, how does that connect to cost plus drugs and what we're

01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:29.160
doing and the big brands, the big brands know that if all these community

01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:32.440
pharmacies are going, tens of thousands of them are going to go out of business

01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:36.080
because of the way this pricing is, they're going to lose a connection

01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:40.960
between their brand medications and grandma and grandpa and aunt Sally.

01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:44.440
And all those, all that business is going to get transferred to the big companies

01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:46.440
and they're going to have even less leverage.

01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:50.320
So they're working with us to come up with programs that are very supportive

01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:51.760
of independent pharmacies.

01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:56.400
And that's going to allow us to break the cartel because it's in their best

01:59:56.400 --> 02:00:00.600
interest not to allow them to be so vertically integrated that they destroy

02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:03.040
the entire community and independent pharmacy industry.

02:00:03.640 --> 02:00:07.840
Is there other aspects of the healthcare industry that could use this kind of

02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:10.120
transparency and revolutionizing?

02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:10.880
Yeah.

02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:13.840
So what we're going to do with our own healthcare, right?

02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:16.520
We're not going to be in the business of selling healthcare or anything

02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:21.280
like that to operate, but the things we do for my companies, we're only going

02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:25.880
to do deals with providers, healthcare providers that allow us to be completely

02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:29.640
transparent so that whatever contracts we do, we're going to post them all.

02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:33.240
Whatever pricing we get, we're going to post them all so that every company

02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:37.800
who's our size or even bigger will have a template that they can work on, which

02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:43.160
will take it away from the, the big three insurance companies and the big three

02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:47.640
PBMs, because now without that transparency, they have to use consultants

02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:51.280
who are getting paid by those big three, you know, those big companies and aren't

02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:53.880
giving them the best response.

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:56.640
And so now that transparency will overcome that.

02:00:56.680 --> 02:00:59.760
And you're using your, how should I say it?

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:02.440
Celebrity, your name to kind of push this.

02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:03.840
It's the only company I've ever put my name on.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.280
It's weird that people aren't getting into the space.

02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:11.640
Like, well you public people, you know, like big, there's not like a big, you

02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:17.040
know, you look at tech, there's like these like, like CEOs are open and public

02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:20.280
and public and they're pushing the company and they're selling everything.

02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:22.000
It's like all transparent.

02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:25.360
Uh, but you don't see that in healthcare.

02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:27.120
No, because it's a big business.

02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:30.800
And most people, like if I was 25 trying to start a company, I'd work in the

02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:34.480
system because if I can build it up big enough, they would just buy me and I'd

02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:37.800
make, you know, money and buy a sports team, but I don't need that money now.

02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:39.520
Uh, let me ask you about AI.

02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:42.880
You got a little bit of an argument about open source.

02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:47.600
I think you stepped in between, uh, Vanilla Coastland, uh, Mark Andreessen.

02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:49.640
You think AI should be open source?

02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:50.840
Yeah, for sure.

02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:54.880
So like all that discussion we've been having about like Google and so on.

02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:59.840
One of the two different things, meaning that, um, Meta is doing open source.

02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:00.120
Yes.

02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:00.400
Right.

02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:01.520
That's a good choice for them.

02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:02.640
I think that's a smart choice.

02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:03.240
Right.

02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:05.280
But it's just a business decision for everybody else.

02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:07.480
I don't think it should be forced forced.

02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:07.720
Yes.

02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:07.960
Yeah.

02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:08.440
Right.

02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:12.440
And even Google is open, open sourcing some of the models and because they're

02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:17.680
all, that's a very incestuous industry where, you know, the people all work

02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:21.480
together at some level, they read the same papers, they go to the same conferences.

02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:24.800
You know, it's like the early days of streaming and the internet where people

02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:26.520
use the same technology everywhere.

02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:30.040
And now they just try different things and you get one smarter to a couple

02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:33.280
of smart people in one company like Anthro, Anthropic, right.

02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.400
And they do things a little bit better and efficient model efficiency gets better.

02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:39.720
So, you know, it's just a business choice, but I don't, I don't think it should be

02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:41.640
forced, but I think it's a smart business decision.

02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:43.840
Open sourcing is a smart business decision.

02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:44.080
Yeah.

02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:45.600
It's a tricky one.

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:49.480
I mean, Google is a pioneer in that with TensorFlow in the AI space.

02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:51.560
That's a tricky decision.

02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:52.320
It really, really is.

02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:52.560
Right.

02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:57.160
But go back to historically, you know, there was digital computing, which

02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:03.680
was a dominant player and they thought, and IBM to a certain extent, thought

02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:07.680
that they wouldn't be subject to a problem with the PC industry.

02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:13.000
And then all of a sudden, and with their, their mainframes and everything,

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.400
they had captive software, they wouldn't use off the shelf software.

02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:17.240
Right.

02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:21.480
So for a digital equipment mainframe or an IBM mainframe, you needed

02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:22.760
software that was written for it.

02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:23.800
There was nothing off the shelf.

02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:27.520
And when the PC industry came along, it was the exact opposite.

02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:30.680
There was, you know, MS-DOS and then Windows, things that were off the

02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:32.200
shelf that every PC could use.

02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:34.800
And that changed how people thought about software.

02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:39.880
And I think the same thing will happen here where it's going to be, um, as

02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:44.800
models become more efficient and easier and less expensive to train, um, I

02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:48.200
think there'll be more, more reasons to open source.

02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:49.360
Yeah.

02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:52.040
That's the whole, it creates more competition and a lot of different

02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:57.440
diversity of approaches, uh, in how they're implemented, deployed, what

02:03:57.440 --> 02:03:58.920
kind of products they create, all of that.

02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:03.800
Uh, Vinod compared it, the danger of that to the Manhattan project.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.240
Yeah, I, I, yeah, I'm not buying that.

02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:08.480
You don't see the parallels between nuclear weapons and.

02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:12.840
No, no, I think I'm not an AI fatalist at all.

02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:13.440
Right.

02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:18.640
I'm an, I'm an AI optimist and, but, but it's not to say that there

02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:22.360
isn't a lot of scary shit that can happen with it militarily.

02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:26.560
Um, you know, like I said earlier, I'm a big believer that there's going

02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:32.560
to be millions and tens of millions of models and people will take their

02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:38.440
expertise and either get hired for it, um, and contribute or create their

02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:43.000
own models and license so that, you know, you see now with this thing

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.520
called mixture of experts, right?

02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:50.600
Where you, you connect things and, and, um, people can take their expertise

02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:54.680
and we'll be able to take that expertise and retain it in a way

02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:56.160
that they want to retain it.

02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:59.440
So, you know, I don't think there's going to be one medical database.

02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:02.520
I told this to people at a couple of big companies that were

02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:03.800
doing healthcare initiatives.

02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:08.480
I, there's branding is so important in the healthcare space.

02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:11.720
If, you know, for hospitals, you know, the Mayo clinics, the MD

02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:13.280
Anderson's they're huge brands.

02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:16.600
And I don't think they're just going to give up their expertise to some,

02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:22.880
you know, may singular model, you know, and say, okay, you know, whatever

02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:27.440
expertise we have is available to you in Gemini or chat to you PT or, you

02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:30.040
know, so-and-so's version of, of med is open source.

02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:33.040
I just don't, I, there's just, that would be business suicide.

02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:37.480
Um, and so I think you're going to see each of them have their own models

02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:40.080
and update them as they go and license them.

02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:40.720
Yeah.

02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:43.040
And the app make money from the expertise.

02:05:43.240 --> 02:05:43.800
Don't give away.

02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:44.640
You have to, yeah.

02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:45.680
Yeah.

02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:46.000
Yeah.

02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:48.280
And the expertise evolves and grows and all that kind of stuff.

02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:49.440
And you want to own that growth.

02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:53.000
Uh, what advice would you give to young people?

02:05:53.040 --> 02:05:55.200
You have an exceptionally successful career.

02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:57.320
You came from little made a lot.

02:05:57.760 --> 02:05:59.040
What advice would you give them?

02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:00.960
Love your life, right?

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.480
You know, find the things that you can enjoy.

02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:04.480
Be curious.

02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:09.040
You don't have to have all the answers when you're 12, 15.

02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:11.520
I get emails from 13, 15 year old kids, right?

02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:12.320
What do I do?

02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:13.040
What do I do?

02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:13.440
Right.

02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:15.720
I, you know, I feel like I'm being held back.

02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:16.600
I'm like a 15.

02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:17.880
You feel like you're being held back.

02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:21.600
Um, but just be curious because you don't have to have the answers.

02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:23.320
You don't have to know what you're going to be when you grow up.

02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:29.480
I I'm a hardcore believer that everybody has something that they're

02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:31.640
really, really, really good at.

02:06:31.960 --> 02:06:33.400
That could be world-class, great.

02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:35.040
Every single human being on this planet.

02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:37.680
And the hard part is just finding what that is.

02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:41.120
And in some places having resources to enable it.

02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:44.920
Um, but be curious so you can find out what it is.

02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:46.480
I didn't take a technology.

02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:51.120
I took one technology class in, in college, Fortran programming

02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:52.480
and I cheated on it, right?

02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:56.320
I mean, it wasn't until I got a job at Mellon bank and I started learning

02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:59.720
how to program in this thing called Ramus, this, this script in computing

02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:02.760
language that I realized, oh, this is interesting to me and I like it.

02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:06.480
And that's what got me, you know, a job selling software and, and, you

02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:10.000
know, going on from there, you just don't know what that's going to

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.480
be until you go out and experience different things.

02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:16.600
So for anybody young out there listening, you know, enjoy your life,

02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:22.480
find things to smile about, be curious, read, watch, you know, expose

02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:26.160
yourself to as many different ideas as you can, because something's

02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:27.160
going to click at some point.

02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:32.360
You may be 15, you may be 25, you may be 55, but it can happen.

02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:37.040
One thing to mention is sometimes it's difficult or your parents, people

02:07:37.080 --> 02:07:45.040
around you might not be conducive or might not be a, of help in finding

02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:45.880
the thing you're good at.

02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:50.840
In fact, like in my own life, you know, the society was such that I don't

02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:54.520
know if they've helped much at the thing I was good at.

02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:57.680
I'm still not sure what that is, but I think they interviewed, done

02:07:57.680 --> 02:07:58.280
pretty well for you.

02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:04.880
Well, it's not even, it's, uh, there was a thing where I saw the beauty in

02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:07.760
people, like I, it's very intensely.

02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:09.720
So you can call that empathy, all that kind of stuff.

02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:14.280
And we call it wokeness, super woke.

02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:15.960
I guess you could say just super woke.

02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:17.400
That's me.

02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:23.960
Uh, and you know, but in the education system, I came up in as it was a very

02:08:23.960 --> 02:08:28.400
hard mathematics, you know, science and so on, and it didn't notice that

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:32.800
whatever that was in, in me, but you know, you have to keep the flame going.

02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:35.000
You have to try and find your way and see what that's useful.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.680
And, and the others around you might not always notice it.

02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:39.520
So it might take time.

02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:41.440
So it could be lonely.

02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:44.760
You can really have to find the strength to believe in yourself.

02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:45.440
Oh, for sure.

02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:47.480
You know, and I'll tell you one quick story.

02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:55.160
Um, 1992, I went to Moscow state university, um, to teach kids how to start

02:08:55.160 --> 02:09:01.120
businesses because I had sold, um, micro solutions and I wanted to travel.

02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:02.880
And I took Russian in high school.

02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:04.320
My risky is like not how to show.

02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:08.960
Good enough to remember that.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:09.200
Yeah.

02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:09.560
Right.

02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:09.960
Yeah.

02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:15.200
Um, but it was interesting to me and I bring it up because just they didn't,

02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:17.600
uh, they didn't know what the word profit meant.

02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:18.400
Right.

02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:24.800
But at the same time, I would go around and meet people and.

02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:29.360
There were, it was as entrepreneurial, like right after the, the, the Soviet

02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:31.920
union fell entrepreneurship went through the roof.

02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:36.720
I mean, a lot of it was mafia driven, but you know, it was, people found that

02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:39.600
spark, you know, because I think that that is natural.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:45.640
Um, and so you just never know when and how and when the circumstances will come

02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:47.760
together for you to be able to take advantage.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:52.040
That spark is really important to comment on is in Russia and Ukraine.

02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:57.120
Uh, I think the system kind of suppresses that spark somehow.

02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:03.000
As you said, you saw the natural entrepreneurship, but there's not the

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.120
entrepreneurial spirit.

02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:07.120
Once you grow up in both of the nations, I mentioned there is.

02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:08.680
No, I believe it right.

02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:12.600
I mean, but there's something about the system that kind of, you know, be

02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:16.600
reasonable, be, you know, there would be no reason for me to go over to do what I

02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:21.560
was doing if it was otherwise, but that's the thing that really can help a country

02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:24.480
flourish, you know, it's going to be interesting with Ukraine if they're able

02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:25.920
to survive this, right?

02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:30.440
Because as horrific as it is, you know, as you saw across Europe after world war

02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:36.280
two, um, the rebuilding creates opportunities, rebuilding creates

02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:39.600
opportunities, but you know, first the war has to end how that ends.

02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:42.160
I don't know either as a really complex path.

02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:45.040
What gives you hope about the future of humanity?

02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:51.960
Um, just looking in my kid's eyes, just, you know, talking to them and seeing

02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:56.680
their spirit, their friend's spirit, and obviously we're blessed as can be, right?

02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:00.600
And it's not the same for every kid, but I do, you know, I get emails that I

02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:04.600
respond, don't respond to all of them, but from 13, 14, 15 year old kids around

02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:09.040
the world, you know, cause shark tank shown everywhere, asking me business

02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:13.760
questions and it's just like they took the time, they were that curious and

02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:20.360
that interested and I see it when I talk to schools, you know, when I go to

02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:26.320
different groups, um, that spark in kid's eyes that there's something

02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:28.080
bigger and better and exciting out there.

02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:32.680
And that's not to say there's not fear, you know, climate and any other number

02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:35.880
of things, but that's the beauty of, of kids.

02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:40.320
And, and I think Gen Z really embodies that.

02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:43.040
And to me, that's just really exciting.

02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:45.480
They dream, they dream big.

02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:48.000
They see the opportunity for making the world better.

02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:48.800
That's cool.

02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:53.200
It's cool to see young people and that in their eyes, that dream that, and

02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:56.880
now I could be the one to do it too, which is, you know, and that it's funny

02:11:56.880 --> 02:12:00.800
because I, when I go talk to like elementary school kids, right?

02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:03.120
One of the things I do, I said, okay, let's look around.

02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:04.840
You see that light there.

02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:06.680
One day that light didn't exist.

02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:08.240
Then somebody had the idea.

02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:10.160
Then somebody created a product of it.

02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:11.720
And now your school bought that.

02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:14.640
You see that chair chairs didn't always look like that.

02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:15.960
Somebody had that idea.

02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:17.480
Why not you?

02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:21.400
So when you walk out and what to make them do, ask yourself, why not me?

02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:23.520
Why can't I be the one to change the world?

02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:26.720
Thank you for that beautiful, hopeful message.

02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:28.240
And thank you for talking today, Mark.

02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:31.680
You're, you're fun, uh, to follow.

02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:35.120
I'm a big fan of yours, but you're also an important person in this world.

02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:36.640
I really appreciate everything you do.

02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:37.320
Well, I appreciate it.

02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:39.360
Thanks for saying that Lex and keep on doing what you're doing.

02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:39.920
This was great.

02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:40.760
I really enjoyed this.

02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:44.080
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Mark Cuban.

02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:47.840
To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:51.160
And now let me leave you with some words from Oscar Wilde.

02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:56.000
Imagination was given to man to compensate him for what he is not.

02:12:56.760 --> 02:13:01.720
And a sense of humor was provided to console him for what he is.

02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:05.800
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
