00:00.000 --> 00:01.440
For me, cooking is an art.

00:01.440 --> 00:03.480
What's your favorite ingredient to cook with?

00:03.480 --> 00:04.300
There isn't one.

00:04.300 --> 00:07.600
It's more like when there is one, it really is one.

00:07.600 --> 00:10.700
You know, like there's peaches on the cover of this cookbook.

00:10.700 --> 00:12.680
Those peaches, those were in August.

00:12.680 --> 00:16.040
Colorado peaches, it just doesn't get any better than that.

00:16.040 --> 00:18.480
On that day, at that moment, that was the best ingredient.

00:18.480 --> 00:21.080
That was the best, but that only lasts for a week.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.260
And then they don't taste so great.

00:22.260 --> 00:23.100
Yeah.

00:23.100 --> 00:26.360
But damn, they were so good in that moment

00:26.360 --> 00:31.360
and you just can't stop wanting to use that ingredient.

00:56.440 --> 00:57.760
In the description.

00:57.760 --> 01:01.120
And now, dear friends, here's Kimbo Musk.

01:02.040 --> 01:05.160
Growing up in South Africa, you said it was a violent place.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.120
What are some formative moments

01:07.120 --> 01:09.160
that you remember from that time?

01:09.160 --> 01:13.440
South Africa was, so I grew up in apartheid South Africa,

01:13.440 --> 01:16.800
but more specifically, the fall of apartheid.

01:16.800 --> 01:20.600
So it was the 80s, I was a teenager in the 80s

01:20.600 --> 01:23.920
and our community would,

01:26.400 --> 01:27.440
part of our social life, frankly,

01:27.440 --> 01:29.300
was the anti-apartheid protests

01:29.300 --> 01:32.600
and to go be with white people, black people,

01:32.600 --> 01:34.220
kind of mixing it all together.

01:35.240 --> 01:38.360
The most formative experiences, frankly,

01:38.360 --> 01:40.840
how much I appreciate a place like America

01:40.840 --> 01:43.960
where we have value for human life.

01:45.160 --> 01:49.960
So there was a country where human life was not valued.

01:49.960 --> 01:54.920
It was a, it's a weird thing to come from that to here

01:54.920 --> 01:57.880
where we think it's so seriously

01:57.880 --> 02:00.880
if someone dies in a war or something like that.

02:00.880 --> 02:05.880
And we just didn't take it seriously in South Africa.

02:06.880 --> 02:10.240
People died, people were killed.

02:10.240 --> 02:12.680
I saw someone killed in front of me

02:14.760 --> 02:17.160
with, I was getting off a train

02:17.160 --> 02:20.080
and it's a very violent train known for violence.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.640
We were stupid kids.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.200
We didn't really listen to our parents.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.780
We went on this train and the doors opened

02:26.780 --> 02:30.240
and I had people trying to get off the train.

02:30.240 --> 02:33.080
And in front of me, two black people,

02:33.080 --> 02:35.400
one black guy just stabbed this knife

02:35.400 --> 02:37.800
in the side of this other black guy's head.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.800
You're like, what the fuck?

02:40.800 --> 02:44.440
And you just, I'm, I gotta get off the train.

02:44.440 --> 02:45.680
How old were you at this time?

02:45.680 --> 02:48.640
Probably 16 or 17 and I gotta get off the train

02:48.640 --> 02:50.680
and everyone is trying to get me to get off

02:50.680 --> 02:52.880
because they're all behind me.

02:52.920 --> 02:56.160
So I step off and I step into the pool of blood,

02:56.160 --> 03:00.600
one foot and then I just walk for about 100 paces

03:00.600 --> 03:03.240
while the stickiness of the blood,

03:03.240 --> 03:05.720
just kind of for my sneakers, just on one foot,

03:05.720 --> 03:08.360
just like leaves a footprint behind me.

03:09.340 --> 03:12.040
And you just walk on, you just walk on.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.720
Did the others walk on as well?

03:13.720 --> 03:15.200
Everyone walked on.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.560
That's an interesting point you make.

03:16.560 --> 03:21.560
Underlying the violence is a kind of philosophy

03:21.560 --> 03:23.280
that human life is disposable.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.200
The individual life is disposable.

03:25.200 --> 03:28.240
I mean, that underlies many ideologies.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.960
I grew up in the Soviet Union.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.560
The value of human life was lower there

03:32.560 --> 03:34.360
than in the United States.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.800
The value of the individual in the United States

03:36.800 --> 03:37.760
is really high.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.480
There's probably an index you can put together.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.200
Yeah, right, exactly.

03:41.200 --> 03:46.040
Per nation, that's a really interesting way to put it

03:46.040 --> 03:50.360
because violence is much easier on a mass scale.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.960
Suffering, causing suffering on a mass scale

03:52.960 --> 03:56.400
is much easier when you don't value the human life.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.520
I've heard this before, which I think I agree with,

03:58.520 --> 04:03.520
is when someone is killed, someone is taken from our lives,

04:03.840 --> 04:06.840
the vacuum that it creates, the social vacuum,

04:06.840 --> 04:09.080
is extraordinarily painful.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.560
And it truly is true.

04:10.560 --> 04:14.000
I mean, if someone in my community passes away,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.240
it's very, very sad for me.

04:17.240 --> 04:21.040
And when you go to a place where you live,

04:21.040 --> 04:24.840
grow up in a place where that human life is not valued,

04:24.840 --> 04:26.640
there's something about the,

04:26.640 --> 04:31.080
there's a little bit less of the social vacuum created

04:31.080 --> 04:33.720
because everyone is kind of expecting everyone

04:33.720 --> 04:36.760
to potentially be taken out at any moment.

04:38.440 --> 04:39.680
But then there's also a beauty to it

04:39.680 --> 04:44.680
because there's a much more of a celebratory element.

04:45.040 --> 04:48.960
When my cousin Russ and I, we, again, we're stupid kids,

04:48.960 --> 04:51.400
we shouldn't be doing this, but we go into the townships

04:51.400 --> 04:53.800
where a lot of the violence would be happening.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.960
We really didn't see most of the violence there.

04:55.960 --> 04:59.160
It was in these more protests and so forth.

04:59.160 --> 05:03.880
But there's a joy that also comes

05:03.880 --> 05:08.080
from lower value of human life.

05:08.080 --> 05:08.920
There's a real joy.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.880
Like everyone is like, well, I mean, it's beautiful.

05:12.200 --> 05:15.680
We'd have dinner with black friends,

05:15.680 --> 05:18.120
friends with their family, we were still pretty young.

05:18.120 --> 05:21.360
And there was just a real joy to it.

05:21.360 --> 05:24.760
When you accept mortality, you can really enjoy life.

05:24.760 --> 05:25.600
You can really enjoy it.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.320
I mean, I think there's actually quite a nice insight.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.240
I've never really put it that way,

05:29.240 --> 05:30.360
but I think that's right, actually.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.800
I think you just chill out a bit,

05:32.800 --> 05:34.040
take things a little less seriously.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.680
Because life does end for everybody.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.040
It does, right.

05:37.040 --> 05:40.920
And if you just head on accept that fact,

05:40.920 --> 05:42.960
you can just enjoy every single moment

05:42.960 --> 05:45.920
and let go of this attachment

05:45.920 --> 05:47.560
and just enjoy the moment.

05:47.560 --> 05:51.000
I do love that we all live longer and so forth.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.040
But we should live longer with the goal of joy

05:54.040 --> 05:55.960
and the goal of happiness and peace,

05:56.840 --> 06:00.640
not some form of misery

06:00.640 --> 06:03.160
that you choose to attach yourself to.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.680
Maximize joy.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.600
Maximize joy, that's right.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.040
There's a story that Walter Isaacson writes about

06:09.040 --> 06:14.040
where Elon got beat up pretty bad and you were there.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.840
And then you also had to watch your dad

06:16.840 --> 06:18.960
yell at Elon for an hour,

06:18.960 --> 06:22.320
calling him worthless, all those kinds of things.

06:22.320 --> 06:26.120
You said it was the worst memory of your life.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.480
What do you make of such cruelty?

06:29.480 --> 06:31.280
What do you remember from that time?

06:33.040 --> 06:34.240
I mean, it was horrible.

06:35.280 --> 06:38.200
I think, coming back to the point of low value

06:38.200 --> 06:40.280
of human life, they tried to kill him.

06:41.520 --> 06:46.520
It wasn't, it was no holding back.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.000
So I just watched someone,

06:49.160 --> 06:51.200
I think it wasn't just one, but there was a main person

06:51.200 --> 06:54.480
and then there was a few others that piled in.

06:54.480 --> 06:59.200
They just, they tried to kill him in front of me.

06:59.200 --> 07:04.200
We were eating sandwiches on a staircase at the school,

07:04.960 --> 07:09.200
out of the staircase and I just had to,

07:09.200 --> 07:11.440
they were not coming up to me

07:11.440 --> 07:14.120
and then I just had to watch and I couldn't help.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
It was one of the saddest, most difficult experiences.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.880
It just was, it was just awful.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.000
Just like that, life can end.

07:25.000 --> 07:25.840
Yeah.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.520
It could have been you.

07:27.520 --> 07:32.520
Yeah, I think, so I've had a near death experience

07:33.040 --> 07:37.920
where I almost died, I was in 2010.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.320
And I think that, and I broke my neck

07:40.320 --> 07:41.840
and I can go into that story in a moment,

07:41.840 --> 07:43.440
but this was different.

07:43.440 --> 07:47.480
This was, this comes back to the low value

07:47.480 --> 07:52.240
of human life part where if someone had killed my brother,

07:52.240 --> 07:53.720
if that person had beat him to death,

07:53.720 --> 07:58.720
which he was trying to do, life would have gone on.

07:59.720 --> 08:03.440
That's like an insane thought in an American,

08:03.440 --> 08:04.640
maybe in some tough neighborhoods,

08:04.640 --> 08:07.680
but for the most part, it's another thing.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.880
Yeah, the brutality of that,

08:10.880 --> 08:13.680
the mundaneness of the brutality.

08:13.680 --> 08:14.520
Yeah.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.240
It makes you think of all the places in the world

08:17.240 --> 08:18.080
that that's happening.

08:18.080 --> 08:18.920
Exactly.

08:18.920 --> 08:22.080
And all the beautiful people that just disappear.

08:22.080 --> 08:26.160
I always say to people who have an opinion about America

08:26.160 --> 08:29.880
that this is a really bad country or whatever.

08:29.880 --> 08:33.200
And I say, look, please go try another country

08:34.960 --> 08:36.040
before you say that.

08:36.040 --> 08:38.160
Not to say that America can't get better,

08:38.160 --> 08:39.680
but please go try another country

08:39.680 --> 08:42.200
because not having that perspective

08:43.080 --> 08:44.960
or having a perspective that,

08:47.240 --> 08:48.520
I don't know, they'll catch up on their shoulder

08:48.520 --> 08:51.040
about the country that they're in.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.800
Okay, go try another country

08:52.800 --> 08:55.880
and then come back and tell me, pick any country

08:55.880 --> 09:00.360
it doesn't have to be some very violent country,

09:00.360 --> 09:01.640
you go pick any country.

09:01.640 --> 09:04.400
And you just realize that actually the world

09:04.400 --> 09:07.160
doesn't think the same way that America thinks.

09:07.160 --> 09:10.600
And you're gonna just learn a perspective

09:10.600 --> 09:14.640
that I think gives you a better way to critique

09:15.960 --> 09:16.960
where we live in America.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.480
Yeah, it's humbling.

09:18.480 --> 09:21.400
You said that your dad was a roller coaster of affection

09:21.400 --> 09:23.280
and then verbal abuse.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.400
Walter Isaacson quotes Barack Obama who said,

09:26.400 --> 09:29.160
someone once said that every man is trying to live up

09:29.160 --> 09:30.520
to his father's expectations

09:30.520 --> 09:32.440
or make up for his father's mistakes.

09:32.440 --> 09:36.880
And I suppose that may explain my particular malady.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.320
Is part of that ring true for you?

09:39.320 --> 09:41.120
What I thought you were gonna say was,

09:41.120 --> 09:42.360
we thought you were gonna end the sentence

09:42.360 --> 09:45.280
was live up to my father's expectations.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.160
This is what most people say.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.440
But then you said the second part

09:48.440 --> 09:50.280
which is make up for his mistakes.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.840
And I think that's actually,

09:53.840 --> 09:55.680
that one rings true for me.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.840
He was really, it's a liability

09:59.840 --> 10:01.600
but I don't connect, I'm not connected to him,

10:01.600 --> 10:06.440
but he's very, he taught me,

10:06.440 --> 10:10.200
the phrase I used to have was he taught me what not to do.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.840
So I still actually learned a lot.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.000
What kind of human not to be,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.960
what kind of actions not to take.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.720
And so that kind of closer to living up to his mistakes

10:21.720 --> 10:25.000
but it's, but my father's such a train wreck

10:25.000 --> 10:26.680
that it's not really mistakes.

10:26.680 --> 10:31.000
It's like intentional actions of what not to do.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.240
Okay, don't do that.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.960
But there's still the trauma of that.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.800
It has an effect on the human psychology

10:40.800 --> 10:42.240
and can permeate their time.

10:42.240 --> 10:47.240
So it has probably complex indirect effects on who you are.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.680
The good and the bad.

10:50.680 --> 10:54.680
Is a critique that my friends give me

10:54.680 --> 10:57.120
which is when they're talking to me,

10:57.120 --> 10:59.120
I kind of just drift away.

10:59.120 --> 11:03.720
That just, I'm still looking at them, still nodding,

11:03.720 --> 11:07.000
might even respond to their, to their,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.640
to them in their conversation,

11:08.640 --> 11:10.000
but I'm actually not there.

11:10.960 --> 11:14.280
And I've realized that actually that grew up

11:14.280 --> 11:17.440
because my father would just verbal,

11:18.360 --> 11:20.640
abuse is one way to say it, it is abuse,

11:20.640 --> 11:24.080
but it's more just verbal diarrhea for hours

11:24.080 --> 11:27.920
and constantly saying, do you understand?

11:27.920 --> 11:30.000
He wants to make sure that I'm paying attention.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.520
So I train myself to look like I'm paying attention

11:34.520 --> 11:35.680
but I'm not.

11:35.680 --> 11:37.080
To disappear to some place.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.360
Disappear to some place.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.320
Wherever that is.

11:39.320 --> 11:42.800
Yeah, and I do that less and less over time but I.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.360
But that path has been paved somewhere in your mind

11:45.360 --> 11:48.800
at childhood so it could be easy to walk down it.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.520
You and Elon were close growing up.

11:51.520 --> 11:52.640
You're still close.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.120
What did you learn from each other?

11:56.120 --> 11:58.240
How did you compliment each other?

11:58.240 --> 12:00.400
Yeah, I think we are a good compliment.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.840
I'll talk for myself first.

12:03.840 --> 12:07.520
My strength is definitely on the social side.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.640
I love the gathering place.

12:10.640 --> 12:13.600
And I love putting people together in person

12:13.600 --> 12:16.880
and I love to have vibrant debates

12:16.880 --> 12:19.080
and conversations between that forever

12:19.080 --> 12:21.200
and including some fun parties and stuff

12:21.200 --> 12:22.920
where I bring people together

12:22.920 --> 12:24.840
and I really kind of want people to have fun

12:24.840 --> 12:29.840
and be vulnerable in a, not just like silly partying

12:30.000 --> 12:32.320
just but actually like let's all connect.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.600
The definition for me of a good party

12:33.600 --> 12:36.120
is people laugh and cry.

12:37.080 --> 12:41.520
Like I want to have people have an emotional connection.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.360
I go to Burning Man every year

12:42.360 --> 12:43.960
and that is there's no question you will cry

12:43.960 --> 12:45.240
at some point during Burning Man.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.200
No small talk.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.240
No small talk, yeah, exactly, no small talk.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.080
You're totally right on.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.200
Like most parties, not parties,

12:51.200 --> 12:54.000
but most events you go to are like clubs,

12:54.000 --> 12:57.440
these sort of nightclubs and I never go to those

12:57.440 --> 13:01.920
and my joke is why would I want to go to a place

13:01.920 --> 13:04.760
where I pay to shout small talk in the dark?

13:05.600 --> 13:07.080
That's a good line.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.240
That's what it feels like.

13:09.240 --> 13:11.360
The only reason I enjoy those places

13:11.360 --> 13:13.960
is the full absurdity of exactly that.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.040
You're right, it's totally absurd.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.360
What are we doing?

13:17.360 --> 13:18.200
What is this?

13:18.200 --> 13:19.040
What is this life?

13:20.440 --> 13:21.840
So my compliment for my brother

13:21.840 --> 13:25.840
was just bringing joy and social connection

13:25.840 --> 13:29.200
and he's truly, he's an engineering genius.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.440
I've worked with him forever

13:30.440 --> 13:33.080
and we do compliment each other.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.240
You just came out with a cookbook.

13:35.240 --> 13:38.680
By the way, thank you for giving me my first cookbook.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.880
I feel legit.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.520
I love that it's your first cookbook.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.320
I'm gonna keep it on the counter

13:44.320 --> 13:48.000
and it's gonna give me legitimacy when anyone comes over.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.120
Hey listen, I'm basically a chef now.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.960
That's right, exactly.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.480
When did you first fall in love with cooking?

13:54.480 --> 13:56.760
I started cooking when I was 11 years old

13:58.160 --> 14:00.800
and my mom is just, she's wonderful

14:00.800 --> 14:05.520
but she's self-admittedly a bad cook.

14:05.520 --> 14:07.760
But at the time it was,

14:07.760 --> 14:10.240
and I think anyone with kids that goes through this,

14:10.240 --> 14:14.360
your kids just want something like spaghetti bolognese

14:14.360 --> 14:16.080
or a burger or something.

14:16.080 --> 14:20.640
And my mom would do brown bread, plain yogurt

14:20.640 --> 14:24.840
and boiled squash, the absolute most disgusting things

14:24.840 --> 14:26.760
that a child could imagine eating.

14:26.760 --> 14:28.920
And so I said, can I cook?

14:28.920 --> 14:32.240
And she said, yes, if you wanna cook, no problem.

14:32.240 --> 14:34.120
So I went to the grocery store and I,

14:34.120 --> 14:36.520
I'm back in those as a butcher,

14:36.520 --> 14:38.680
separate to the grocery store and I went to the butcher

14:38.680 --> 14:40.480
and I said, what can I cook?

14:40.480 --> 14:44.080
And he pulled out a chicken and he said,

14:44.080 --> 14:46.240
this is the easiest recipe for you.

14:46.240 --> 14:49.560
Just put it on a pan in an oven, a hot oven

14:49.560 --> 14:52.560
because back then the ovens weren't necessarily

14:52.560 --> 14:55.400
like 400 degrees or 450 or whatever

14:55.400 --> 14:58.200
and put it in a hot oven for one hour

14:58.200 --> 15:00.640
and enjoy, that was it.

15:00.640 --> 15:04.640
And so I went home and actually I also brought

15:04.640 --> 15:06.560
some French fries, I'll tell you that as well.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.880
So I was like, I'm a kid, of course I want French fries.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.040
So the roast chicken was French fries

15:12.040 --> 15:16.040
and the chicken came out and it was just fantastic.

15:16.040 --> 15:16.880
It was.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.080
Absolutely fantastic.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.520
That's incredible by the way.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.360
Yeah, yeah.

15:20.360 --> 15:21.240
You didn't screw it up the first time.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.640
First of all, I think that's also kicks off the magic.

15:23.640 --> 15:25.520
Like if you screw it up and you're like,

15:25.520 --> 15:27.200
oh, maybe this is not for me.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.400
So for me, it really did kick it off.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.040
Started out on a high note.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.160
Yeah, right, exactly.

15:33.160 --> 15:34.760
But I like to tell the French fry part,

15:34.760 --> 15:36.040
which was a disaster.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.520
So I cooked the French fries,

15:37.520 --> 15:39.160
but I didn't heat the oil first.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.080
So I just put the potatoes in the oil

15:41.080 --> 15:43.360
and I waited for it to heat up.

15:43.360 --> 15:47.000
And I just was throwing up later that night.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.960
Your body can't ingest that much

15:48.960 --> 15:50.040
because it sucks the oils in.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.040
Oh, wow.

15:51.040 --> 15:51.960
And so that was a disaster,

15:51.960 --> 15:53.560
but at the time it tasted good.

15:54.400 --> 15:58.960
The real magic, which I also found was wonderful,

15:58.960 --> 16:03.440
was when I cooked, a brother, my sister, my mom,

16:03.440 --> 16:06.680
all very, very busy, very intense people,

16:06.680 --> 16:10.560
would sit down and we would have a meal together.

16:10.560 --> 16:13.240
And I was like, wow, this is a powerful,

16:13.240 --> 16:15.920
it's a very powerful thing that I've now got

16:15.920 --> 16:19.760
where in no other way could I have that connection

16:19.760 --> 16:20.680
with my family.

16:20.680 --> 16:21.760
I mean, obviously we stay connected,

16:21.760 --> 16:23.240
we're very close to sector,

16:23.920 --> 16:24.920
but in no other way could we sit down

16:24.920 --> 16:26.720
and just talk about things

16:26.720 --> 16:27.960
or talk about whatever's on our mind

16:27.960 --> 16:29.480
or just to just, not even talk,

16:29.480 --> 16:33.680
just to be at the table together.

16:33.680 --> 16:36.880
And I've done that now through my whole life,

16:36.880 --> 16:40.840
my kids, still for my family,

16:40.840 --> 16:43.200
and we will do gratitudes at the beginning of our meal.

16:43.200 --> 16:47.960
And it's just, I think what kept me cooking

16:47.960 --> 16:50.320
what made my love of cooking so great

16:50.360 --> 16:53.400
was actually the fact that we would sit down

16:53.400 --> 16:54.240
together.

16:54.240 --> 16:56.240
And be present with each other.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.920
And I'm also just also hard with that too,

16:57.920 --> 17:00.160
so I also get to be present.

17:00.160 --> 17:05.080
What is that about food that brings people together

17:05.080 --> 17:08.000
and not just together, but really together

17:08.000 --> 17:10.040
where you're paying attention?

17:10.040 --> 17:10.880
Right.

17:10.880 --> 17:11.720
What is that?

17:11.720 --> 17:13.360
Why is it food?

17:13.360 --> 17:14.800
What else does that?

17:14.800 --> 17:17.080
Sometimes maybe alcohol can do that,

17:17.080 --> 17:18.400
which is a kind of food, I guess.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.800
Yeah, but I think alcohol is different

17:19.800 --> 17:22.520
because you usually standing when you're doing alcohol,

17:22.520 --> 17:24.120
so you're socializing,

17:24.120 --> 17:24.960
but it's kind of,

17:24.960 --> 17:26.640
you're just gonna stay more in the small talk zone.

17:26.640 --> 17:27.480
Yeah.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.960
Right, whereas if you sit down,

17:28.960 --> 17:32.600
and I see this in my restaurant in the kitchen in Boulder,

17:32.600 --> 17:35.360
where we have every viewpoint,

17:35.360 --> 17:37.520
or we go to Denver, every viewpoint,

17:37.520 --> 17:40.120
when we're in Chicago, every viewpoint.

17:40.120 --> 17:45.120
And the physical presence of someone being right there

17:46.000 --> 17:49.840
is people are just, they're just very different,

17:49.840 --> 17:52.480
absolutely different to what they are online.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.640
I think we all know the difference between,

17:54.640 --> 17:56.000
you know, you send an email to someone

17:56.000 --> 18:00.240
and they misunderstand the email, right?

18:00.240 --> 18:01.760
And you're, oh, if I just to talk to the person,

18:01.760 --> 18:02.880
it would have been fine.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.640
Well, this is now happening at scale,

18:04.640 --> 18:09.640
you know, with all of these trolling or whatever.

18:10.680 --> 18:14.440
And I've sat at the bar

18:14.440 --> 18:19.440
and I've had a hardcore Trump supporter.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.080
And I'm just, I'm just curious,

18:21.080 --> 18:23.520
just like, tell me what, I'm not a Trump supporter,

18:23.520 --> 18:25.600
but like, tell me more.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.000
And it actually draws the conversation out

18:28.000 --> 18:30.240
because you're there for an hour or longer.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.400
So there's no rush to get the answer.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.400
And I think that's a big difference.

18:36.360 --> 18:40.440
I've had one time where just a couple months ago,

18:41.360 --> 18:43.400
I had someone, I was sitting at the community table,

18:43.400 --> 18:45.600
we have a community table in the restaurant.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.240
And he was, I didn't know him too well,

18:48.240 --> 18:52.920
but he asked me, did I know that 9-11 was a conspiracy

18:52.920 --> 18:54.840
and it didn't really happen?

18:54.840 --> 18:56.360
It didn't happen, yeah.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.160
And I was like, huh.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.480
So I actually, I was at 9-11.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.560
I was, I mean, I was, I was four.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.520
I was like, I was there, physically there.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.360
So I was like, no.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.200
Allegedly.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.040
There's no doubt in my mind.

19:06.040 --> 19:06.880
Okay.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.720
But I didn't wanna,

19:08.720 --> 19:12.120
but I didn't wanna interrupt his,

19:12.120 --> 19:13.360
what he had to say.

19:13.360 --> 19:17.040
So I let him talk for five minutes, six minutes,

19:17.040 --> 19:18.480
seven minutes, and again, you're there for a while.

19:18.480 --> 19:22.520
So you're not in a rush to jump in and argue.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.120
And then I shared that I was there.

19:25.120 --> 19:29.160
And I think because I had been willing to listen to him,

19:30.480 --> 19:32.280
he was willing to listen to me.

19:33.720 --> 19:37.280
And he, I don't know if he changed his mind.

19:37.280 --> 19:38.400
Certainly he doesn't change my mind,

19:38.400 --> 19:41.160
but it was actually a pretty cool conversation

19:41.160 --> 19:43.440
to kind of get into each other's mind.

19:43.440 --> 19:46.640
Well, I think you connect on a different level,

19:46.640 --> 19:49.880
not on the level of like the conspiracy,

19:49.880 --> 19:51.560
but on the level of basic humanity.

19:51.560 --> 19:52.400
Yes.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.600
Like that's what you really connect on.

19:53.600 --> 19:57.680
And then it's almost becomes interesting and fun

19:57.680 --> 20:00.160
that you can exchange ideas, even crazy ideas,

20:00.160 --> 20:02.400
out there ideas and kind of play with them.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.240
Yeah.

20:03.240 --> 20:04.320
We humans are good at that.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.160
Yeah, exactly.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.560
I like the, I like the term play with them

20:06.560 --> 20:10.400
because what you're not trying to do

20:10.400 --> 20:13.200
is shut the conversation down.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.640
You're also not trying to-

20:14.640 --> 20:15.480
Talk down on them.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.400
Yeah, exactly.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.880
Like, oh, guys, let me just be nice

20:19.880 --> 20:22.240
while I totally disagree with this person.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.280
You can do that for a few minutes.

20:24.280 --> 20:25.480
You can't do that for two hours.

20:25.480 --> 20:30.080
And there's something like about food that completely,

20:30.080 --> 20:34.480
I don't know, it must be evolutionary.

20:34.640 --> 20:39.080
They, it makes us vulnerable in a way

20:39.080 --> 20:40.280
that even just standing there

20:40.280 --> 20:42.000
for a prolonged period of time doesn't.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.200
There's something about,

20:44.280 --> 20:46.240
you know, like when the animals gather to the water

20:46.240 --> 20:48.520
or whatever, like this kind of experience

20:48.520 --> 20:49.720
where you're just like, all right,

20:49.720 --> 20:54.720
let's just acknowledge together that we need sustenance.

20:55.120 --> 20:55.960
Yeah.

20:55.960 --> 20:59.640
And somehow that kind of grounds us to like,

20:59.640 --> 21:03.360
we're just a bunch of descendants of apes here,

21:03.360 --> 21:08.000
just kind of like grateful to be alive, frankly,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.160
and grateful to be consuming this thing

21:10.160 --> 21:12.080
which keeps us alive.

21:12.080 --> 21:16.200
And in that context, you can talk about all kinds of stuff.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.960
You can discuss flat earth and enjoy it.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.040
Absolutely.

21:19.040 --> 21:22.360
In fact, one of my favorite things to do

21:22.360 --> 21:26.520
is you do like a Jeffersonian style dinner,

21:26.520 --> 21:28.120
like let's say five or six people.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.760
Sometimes people will break off in individual conversations.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.800
That's actually when things break down.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.600
So that's when you kind of go back to small talk,

21:34.600 --> 21:35.800
like, oh, I'm stuck next to this guy.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.320
I'm just gonna do a little small talk.

21:37.320 --> 21:40.240
What you need to do to really create a great conversation

21:40.240 --> 21:43.000
is one conversation at the table.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.200
And that's where, you know,

21:45.200 --> 21:48.720
there'll be some simple questions that I'll say,

21:48.720 --> 21:51.000
I'll say, you know, what's your middle name?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.280
And you'll be amazed at the stories you get from that.

21:53.280 --> 21:56.080
But it's about creating vulnerability.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.760
So they're like, oh, no one's ever asked me that before.

21:57.760 --> 22:00.000
So then they become vulnerable.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.880
And then something as simple as

22:01.880 --> 22:04.440
what's the most fun thing you've done recently

22:04.440 --> 22:08.040
and what is the most fun thing you're looking forward to.

22:08.040 --> 22:11.680
And I have gotten into, with those prompts,

22:11.680 --> 22:15.880
I've gotten into hours long discussions on God.

22:15.880 --> 22:18.920
I've gotten into hours long discussions on love.

22:20.280 --> 22:24.320
I've gotten into hours long discussions on anger.

22:25.440 --> 22:30.160
It's actually amazing when people are just asked a question,

22:30.160 --> 22:31.360
like, what's the most fun thing you've done lately?

22:31.360 --> 22:32.520
Well, why would anger come up?

22:32.520 --> 22:35.560
Well, actually, they're in a vulnerable place

22:35.560 --> 22:37.600
so that it'll just kind of come out of them.

22:37.600 --> 22:38.640
So you get to see this.

22:38.640 --> 22:39.880
You get to see this at the kitchen

22:39.880 --> 22:42.440
and you said Boulder, Denver, Chicago.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.800
Yeah, and we're gonna open in Austin.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.200
In Austin, that's what I saw.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.040
When?

22:46.040 --> 22:47.160
In October is the goal.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.480
In October is the goal.

22:48.480 --> 22:51.600
Well, I mean, speaking of characters and human beings,

22:51.600 --> 22:52.760
Austin is fascinating.

22:54.920 --> 22:57.280
I forget how long ago, a couple months ago,

22:57.280 --> 22:58.840
I was just sitting at a bar

22:58.840 --> 23:01.680
and the two people were talking

23:01.680 --> 23:03.480
and they were talking about Marxism

23:03.480 --> 23:07.520
and it turns out that they're anarcho-communists,

23:07.520 --> 23:09.600
which is a thing, and I got into this conversation.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.040
Are communists the likes of drugs?

23:11.040 --> 23:13.800
That's a good question to ask.

23:15.240 --> 23:16.640
I think I know some of those.

23:18.120 --> 23:19.320
Anyway, they're beautiful people.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.760
I think they're local from Austin.

23:20.760 --> 23:25.760
I don't know the depth of their personal experience

23:25.800 --> 23:27.920
of the different kinds of communist-like systems,

23:27.960 --> 23:30.920
but it was fascinating to listen to and then get to know them

23:30.920 --> 23:34.120
and the humanity, the weirdness, like the characters.

23:34.120 --> 23:35.520
It's just, I mean, I love it.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.640
One of the reasons I really love Austin,

23:37.640 --> 23:42.640
I decided to be here is just the cliche thing

23:43.400 --> 23:44.680
of keep Austin weird.

23:44.680 --> 23:45.920
I mean, there's a lot of weird characters.

23:45.920 --> 23:46.840
I love it.

23:46.840 --> 23:50.280
I think that I've talked to a lot of Austinites

23:50.280 --> 23:51.480
who've been here forever and I'm like,

23:51.480 --> 23:53.560
man, you gotta hold us accountable.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.280
We gotta keep this place weird.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.760
100%, which makes the restaurant seem great

23:58.600 --> 23:59.720
because you have all these characters come in.

23:59.720 --> 24:00.560
It's great.

24:00.560 --> 24:01.880
So I look forward to that.

24:01.880 --> 24:04.680
But you were saying you get to see humans

24:04.680 --> 24:06.120
in real life interact.

24:06.120 --> 24:09.080
That's one of the beautiful things over food.

24:09.080 --> 24:12.160
In the book you write, Picasso once said,

24:12.160 --> 24:14.440
the meaning of life is to find your gift.

24:14.440 --> 24:17.120
The purpose of life is to give it away.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.880
Then you wrote that you believe food is a gift

24:19.880 --> 24:22.040
we give ourselves three times a day.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.400
Can you explain that?

24:23.400 --> 24:24.240
The gift nature of it?

24:25.120 --> 24:27.840
I think it's one of my most powerful life lessons

24:27.840 --> 24:31.240
is we have to eat.

24:31.240 --> 24:34.000
So it's not like you have a choice.

24:34.000 --> 24:34.920
You have to eat.

24:36.440 --> 24:39.000
So what I choose to do is I choose to make it a gift

24:39.000 --> 24:41.800
to myself for each meal.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.920
And most of the time, the best gift is with friends,

24:44.920 --> 24:46.080
with family.

24:46.080 --> 24:48.400
So we'll have to cook some scrambled eggs in the morning

24:48.400 --> 24:52.080
with my daughter or we'll have dinner with our family.

24:52.120 --> 24:56.240
To me, it's a gift we give ourselves three times a day,

24:56.240 --> 24:59.120
at least, but for the most part, three times a day.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.400
Let's make it a good one.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.680
What makes it a good one to you?

25:01.680 --> 25:03.640
Like what aspect of it makes it a good one?

25:03.640 --> 25:06.800
Well, first, definitely eating with people.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.520
So that makes it a good one.

25:08.520 --> 25:12.720
So eating in a restaurant or it doesn't have to be

25:12.720 --> 25:17.240
my restaurant, we have the energy of people around you,

25:17.240 --> 25:18.800
energy of the town, people you don't know,

25:18.800 --> 25:21.560
creates a little bit of a vibe.

25:21.560 --> 25:24.240
That you mentioned the watering hole analogy

25:24.240 --> 25:26.600
that animals like sipping at the water,

25:26.600 --> 25:29.640
but there's an energy to that because they're also

25:29.640 --> 25:33.560
like looking around going, am I just about to be eaten?

25:35.880 --> 25:39.640
So they're all in it together, but we need to have water,

25:39.640 --> 25:41.440
but there's also a little bit of tension as well

25:41.440 --> 25:42.440
in the background.

25:42.440 --> 25:43.880
And I think that's what restaurants do,

25:43.880 --> 25:46.440
is a very, very subtle version of that.

25:46.440 --> 25:48.760
You're in a room with strangers

25:49.720 --> 25:50.560
and you're a little cluster.

25:50.560 --> 25:51.400
Okay, fine.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.040
You guys are connected in it,

25:53.040 --> 25:54.280
but you're in a room with strangers

25:54.280 --> 25:57.840
and it's just something that adds that energy to the meal.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.280
Yeah, you're a little bit wondering like,

25:59.280 --> 26:02.440
what does everyone else think about our little cluster?

26:02.440 --> 26:06.320
Right, like are we too loud or just you also just,

26:06.320 --> 26:07.160
people are random.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.360
So something random could happen.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.120
And also depending on your personality,

26:10.120 --> 26:11.720
if you're an extrovert, maybe you wanna show off

26:11.720 --> 26:12.560
to the other clusters.

26:12.560 --> 26:13.400
You're right, exactly.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.240
Yeah, absolutely.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.080
Totally right.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.400
I mean, look at the cowboy hat.

26:16.560 --> 26:19.280
I mean, actually I'll take my hat off

26:19.280 --> 26:20.920
when I wanna have a quiet meal

26:20.920 --> 26:22.600
and I can leave my hat on when I'm.

26:22.600 --> 26:23.680
So you're aware of the law.

26:23.680 --> 26:26.200
I'm aware of the effect it has, yeah, absolutely.

26:26.200 --> 26:27.040
Everyone turns.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.800
That's right.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.280
And then it's back to the watering hole

26:30.280 --> 26:31.720
because when you wear a cowboy hat,

26:31.720 --> 26:33.640
you just might actually not.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.240
Yeah, I'm like, they're gonna get me first.

26:37.640 --> 26:39.120
At noon, I love it.

26:39.120 --> 26:40.040
I gotta tell the story.

26:40.040 --> 26:44.240
So this is, you talk to the craziness

26:44.240 --> 26:46.080
of being in the restaurant world

26:46.880 --> 26:47.960
where you're sitting at a table

26:47.960 --> 26:50.120
and anything can happen in the restaurant.

26:50.120 --> 26:52.520
So there's one time, it was like 15 years ago,

26:52.520 --> 26:55.040
this guy comes up to us and says

26:55.040 --> 26:58.360
we'd like to propose to his wife, his girlfriend.

26:58.360 --> 27:02.440
And so we said, okay, cool, we've done this before.

27:02.440 --> 27:04.800
We'll make sure it's all set up.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.840
6 p.m. kind of reservation.

27:06.840 --> 27:11.840
So she shows up and we give her a glass of champagne.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.720
We obviously didn't wanna spoil the surprise.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.280
We're just doing everything we can.

27:16.280 --> 27:18.640
But then he doesn't arrive.

27:18.640 --> 27:20.320
And then we're like, oh, man.

27:20.320 --> 27:21.680
Now we're like, don't leave.

27:21.680 --> 27:23.240
Can we get you another glass of champagne?

27:23.240 --> 27:24.440
We're doing everything we can

27:24.440 --> 27:26.400
because the guy was obviously earnest earlier.

27:26.400 --> 27:29.440
We're just, is he stuck in traffic or whatever?

27:29.440 --> 27:32.280
And coming through the back door of the restaurant,

27:32.280 --> 27:33.200
which is you're not allowed to come

27:33.200 --> 27:34.840
through the back door of the restaurant,

27:34.840 --> 27:38.840
a marching band from the school, the university

27:38.840 --> 27:40.920
comes through the restaurant,

27:40.920 --> 27:43.280
full on brass band and the whole thing.

27:43.280 --> 27:46.040
And he gets down and he proposes.

27:46.040 --> 27:50.680
And it's beautiful, sure, but it's also like,

27:50.680 --> 27:51.760
man, this is chaos.

27:51.760 --> 27:52.600
This is insane.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.960
And we would never have said yes to this

27:54.960 --> 27:56.520
if he had actually told us what he was gonna do.

27:56.520 --> 27:59.280
Well, sometimes in life you have to do it and apologize.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.400
You do it and apologize.

28:00.400 --> 28:01.680
But that talks to that kind of,

28:01.680 --> 28:04.040
what's the crazy thing that could happen in a,

28:05.200 --> 28:07.440
it's subtle, but it's still there.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.720
So in 2004, you opened the kitchen.

28:09.720 --> 28:12.000
It's an American bistro restaurant.

28:12.000 --> 28:12.840
What was it like?

28:12.840 --> 28:14.640
What's it like running a restaurant?

28:14.640 --> 28:16.400
The good, the bad and ugly?

28:16.400 --> 28:19.760
What's the easy, what's the fun and what's the hard?

28:19.760 --> 28:22.160
I think the thing that I absolutely love

28:22.160 --> 28:23.600
about running the restaurant, not eating it,

28:23.600 --> 28:24.800
but running the restaurant,

28:24.800 --> 28:29.800
is the tangible reaction from people.

28:30.720 --> 28:35.320
And you also kind of know when you screwed it up

28:36.400 --> 28:38.960
and you also know when you got it right.

28:38.960 --> 28:41.840
So even, it's kind of a weird way to say this,

28:41.840 --> 28:44.400
but even if the customer's unhappy,

28:45.360 --> 28:48.240
you know whether you got it right or wrong.

28:48.240 --> 28:50.640
It's not just about the food you're making,

28:50.640 --> 28:54.160
but it's about the person's psychological state.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.400
And you'll even, you'll do something that you're like,

28:57.400 --> 28:59.840
you know that was not well.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.440
And their psychological state is,

29:01.440 --> 29:04.280
they're just in a very happy place and they love it.

29:04.280 --> 29:06.520
And you're like, huh, interesting.

29:06.520 --> 29:09.120
That's not how I would have reacted to that dish.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.440
And then the other way around, you'd like,

29:10.440 --> 29:11.280
oh, I got that right.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.400
And that person's just like really unhappy today.

29:14.400 --> 29:17.000
Yeah, and it's so hard to read humans

29:17.000 --> 29:20.320
because you have to, if you got it right,

29:21.560 --> 29:24.920
that can look a million different ways

29:24.920 --> 29:27.640
depending on the emotional rollercoaster

29:27.640 --> 29:29.160
that human is living through.

29:29.160 --> 29:30.960
Like I've been in some very low points

29:30.960 --> 29:33.640
and I've gone to like a restaurant alone

29:33.640 --> 29:36.840
and just sitting there and be truly happy

29:36.840 --> 29:39.440
was just the Zen aspect of it.

29:39.480 --> 29:41.240
And it was just a great, like a great steak

29:41.240 --> 29:42.520
or something like this.

29:42.520 --> 29:46.800
And maybe to other people around me

29:46.800 --> 29:49.880
would look like I'm very unhappy just because I'm,

29:51.120 --> 29:51.960
within myself.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.400
Just struggling with your day.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.600
Yeah, within myself,

29:54.600 --> 29:56.760
but I'm truly happy within that struggle.

29:56.760 --> 29:59.840
So yeah, it's interesting, but you can kind of tell.

29:59.840 --> 30:00.760
Yeah, you can tell.

30:00.760 --> 30:03.120
And you mentioned being at the bar,

30:03.120 --> 30:05.040
one of the most gifts,

30:05.040 --> 30:08.880
the most gifts that bartenders really understand that.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.720
It goes beyond,

30:11.760 --> 30:12.960
but what's also great about a restaurant

30:12.960 --> 30:15.800
goes beyond the one-time experience that you walk in

30:15.800 --> 30:17.440
and have that experience

30:17.440 --> 30:19.920
is the good bartenders, they remember you.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.120
Oh, you were in a few months ago

30:21.120 --> 30:23.120
and this is kind of your thing.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.120
You might need a little time.

30:25.120 --> 30:29.200
And other people will come in, they want a conversation.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.480
Or other people come in and they're going through a divorce

30:31.480 --> 30:34.880
and they just want to be sad for a moment, have a scotch.

30:34.880 --> 30:38.720
And it's amazing what you learn in the restaurant world

30:39.560 --> 30:41.920
to just be connected to humanity.

30:41.920 --> 30:44.320
Yeah, what is that about bars?

30:44.320 --> 30:45.840
That's a different experience.

30:45.840 --> 30:48.680
You said the table, the communal.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.840
The table is when you connect with people,

30:50.840 --> 30:52.640
learn about each other.

30:52.640 --> 30:54.040
Bars, you can sometimes do that.

30:54.040 --> 30:55.160
You can talk left and right,

30:55.160 --> 30:57.920
but you have the freedom to always break free.

30:57.920 --> 30:58.760
Like you can say, oh, okay, great,

30:58.760 --> 31:00.640
I'm gonna go back to my meal.

31:00.640 --> 31:04.960
It's kind of like a friend you can turn on and off

31:04.960 --> 31:08.320
at any time because the bartender knows that.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.800
Like if you want attention, I'm gonna give it to you.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.880
If you don't, I'm gonna stay away.

31:13.880 --> 31:16.000
If you want to be chatty, I'm gonna be chatty.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.880
If you want to be completely in your head,

31:17.880 --> 31:18.720
I'll leave you in your head.

31:18.720 --> 31:20.560
But there's also strangers kind of next to you

31:20.560 --> 31:23.520
that you kind of, there's a feeling with a bar

31:23.520 --> 31:26.000
that you're kind of alone together.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.840
Yeah, and you can reach out.

31:27.840 --> 31:30.800
You can add some conversation or you can choose not to.

31:30.800 --> 31:31.680
And you can exit quickly.

31:31.680 --> 31:34.440
You can exit, exactly, it's a really good exit.

31:34.440 --> 31:35.840
So bars are wonderful.

31:35.840 --> 31:40.840
And I love going to a bar by myself after work.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.640
I might have a squash, might not even have alcohol,

31:44.640 --> 31:46.280
just have something.

31:46.280 --> 31:48.920
And I'll just maybe have a snack or something before dinner

31:48.920 --> 31:51.080
because I'm gonna go home and have dinner with the family.

31:51.080 --> 31:56.080
And that 20 minutes is just an amazing state change

31:56.760 --> 31:58.760
from daytime to nighttime.

31:58.760 --> 32:01.040
Whereas if I went straight home,

32:01.040 --> 32:02.760
I'm like still in my head

32:02.760 --> 32:06.320
and I'm just trying to get grounded.

32:06.320 --> 32:08.960
And I'm just, I'm not as pleasant of a person.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.320
So that's another powerful use of a bar.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.960
It's just like a transition time.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.520
Well, I mean, it would be remiss not to mention

32:16.520 --> 32:17.680
the other use of the bar,

32:17.680 --> 32:21.640
which is like when you're going through some shit in life

32:21.640 --> 32:24.200
and you just go, I mean, that's sort of the,

32:24.200 --> 32:25.320
it's the cliche thing.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.080
I've been, some of my little-

32:27.080 --> 32:27.900
Got it, you're sorry?

32:27.900 --> 32:28.740
Exactly.

32:28.740 --> 32:29.580
The real thing.

32:29.700 --> 32:33.300
But like the bar makes the melancholy somehow

32:33.300 --> 32:36.980
like rich and beautiful and like it's,

32:36.980 --> 32:39.700
you feel heard in the silence.

32:39.700 --> 32:42.260
Yes, you feel heard.

32:42.260 --> 32:46.340
Like I said earlier, the people going through a divorce,

32:46.340 --> 32:47.980
they don't know where else to go.

32:47.980 --> 32:48.820
Yeah.

32:48.820 --> 32:50.740
These are mostly men, sometimes women will do it,

32:50.740 --> 32:52.140
but mostly men will do this

32:52.140 --> 32:54.940
and women have other ways of processing it.

32:54.940 --> 32:58.620
But they just, they want a place to be sad

32:58.620 --> 33:00.500
and want a place where they could feel

33:01.340 --> 33:04.100
comfortable talking about it if they weren't,

33:04.100 --> 33:05.820
they're certainly not gonna go into too much detail,

33:05.820 --> 33:08.340
but they just wanna say something.

33:08.340 --> 33:09.180
Yeah.

33:09.180 --> 33:10.620
And the bartender is there for them.

33:10.620 --> 33:11.460
Yeah.

33:11.460 --> 33:12.500
You don't know where to go.

33:12.500 --> 33:13.340
You don't know where to go.

33:13.340 --> 33:14.180
Exactly.

33:14.180 --> 33:16.060
The bar, yeah, you're right.

33:16.060 --> 33:20.180
Like for men, especially as a place to just go

33:20.180 --> 33:22.380
and just, I don't know, what is that?

33:22.380 --> 33:24.440
I mean, I'll be honest, I still do it myself

33:24.440 --> 33:29.440
where if I'm at home and I don't have a work thing

33:29.600 --> 33:31.600
that I gotta deal with and I don't have kids

33:31.600 --> 33:34.800
and I don't have my wife or a family around,

33:37.440 --> 33:39.560
I don't often cook for myself.

33:39.560 --> 33:43.800
I actually love going to a bar by myself.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.440
I have a glass of red wine

33:45.440 --> 33:47.600
and I have, you know, you just don't have a starter,

33:47.600 --> 33:50.440
appetizer, just like the main meal.

33:51.320 --> 33:55.600
And I just take in the energy of the space.

33:55.600 --> 33:56.960
If it's my restaurant or someone else's restaurant,

33:56.960 --> 33:59.040
I just take in the energy.

33:59.040 --> 34:01.340
And it's so much better than being home

34:01.340 --> 34:02.780
and turning the TV on.

34:02.780 --> 34:04.040
No, no, no, no, no, no.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.280
I wanna be out in the restaurant.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.720
I wanna feel the energy of the town.

34:08.720 --> 34:10.760
The other thing that restaurants teach me

34:10.760 --> 34:14.760
is they're the front lines of the economy

34:16.740 --> 34:18.000
or what's a better word for it,

34:18.480 --> 34:23.480
the front lines of the energy of how things are going.

34:24.320 --> 34:26.000
Like of a people's in general,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.300
like it doesn't necessarily mean this part of town,

34:28.300 --> 34:30.080
but it could be the entire society.

34:30.080 --> 34:33.120
Exactly, so you can go into a restaurant

34:33.120 --> 34:34.880
and I'll use a simple example.

34:34.880 --> 34:37.280
And why is the restaurant empty?

34:37.280 --> 34:40.200
Ah, there's a football game going on.

34:40.200 --> 34:42.920
And there's such a large number of people

34:42.920 --> 34:46.280
who wanna watch that game that the restaurant is quiet

34:46.280 --> 34:49.600
or it might be like another World Series or something.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.040
And you're like, wow, that's so interesting.

34:51.040 --> 34:53.480
And you can actually watch in America,

34:53.480 --> 34:55.080
of course, American humanity,

34:55.080 --> 34:58.000
watch them move in their patterns

34:58.000 --> 34:59.760
just by being in the restaurant.

34:59.760 --> 35:00.720
Yeah, yeah.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.240
And then another time you might be in a restaurant

35:02.240 --> 35:04.200
and it's just jamming.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.240
It's a Monday night and you're like,

35:06.240 --> 35:11.240
what is the energy that created this on a Monday night

35:11.400 --> 35:14.720
and maybe even on a cold February Monday night, what is it?

35:14.720 --> 35:15.880
And sometimes you can't find out,

35:16.480 --> 35:17.880
but you can feel it.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.720
And it's my front lines of humanity

35:20.720 --> 35:24.040
that I also just really love about the restaurants.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.920
Yeah, it could be empty, it could be full.

35:25.920 --> 35:29.560
Empty bars, there's a magic to those too.

35:29.560 --> 35:30.400
Yeah.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.280
You could still feel that energy, I don't know.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.800
I actually prefer empty bars than full ones.

35:34.800 --> 35:35.920
It's just you and the bartender.

35:35.920 --> 35:37.600
I mean, some of my greatest experiences

35:37.600 --> 35:39.280
is just the quiet bar,

35:39.280 --> 35:40.480
it's just me and the bartender

35:40.480 --> 35:42.120
and they're doing their thing.

35:42.120 --> 35:43.440
And they've seen so many,

35:43.440 --> 35:46.360
I've almost like through osmosis somehow

35:46.360 --> 35:49.240
feel the stories that that bartender has seen,

35:49.240 --> 35:51.680
has felt, has heard and all that kind of stuff.

35:51.680 --> 35:56.680
I mean, it's not to be sort of spiritual about it,

35:57.200 --> 35:59.160
but it seems like it's in the walls or something.

35:59.160 --> 36:01.120
Like the history is felt.

36:01.120 --> 36:03.040
And some of these bars are actually very old

36:03.040 --> 36:04.560
and it's wonderful.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.040
There are many in Europe like this,

36:06.040 --> 36:07.720
but there's a couple in New York City,

36:07.720 --> 36:08.600
a few hundred years old

36:08.600 --> 36:11.960
and they're still operating nonstop for that long.

36:11.960 --> 36:14.000
And man, you feel it.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.560
Yeah.

36:15.560 --> 36:18.640
Let me ask you some questions about ingredients.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.680
What's your favorite ingredient to cook with?

36:20.680 --> 36:22.320
For me, cooking is an art, right?

36:22.320 --> 36:23.720
So it'd be like asking me,

36:23.720 --> 36:25.560
what's my favorite paint color to use?

36:25.560 --> 36:30.360
It's not that it isn't like there isn't one.

36:30.360 --> 36:33.760
It's more like when there is one, it really is one.

36:33.760 --> 36:34.720
You know, like there's peaches

36:34.720 --> 36:36.880
on the cover of this cookbook.

36:36.880 --> 36:39.720
Those peaches, those were in August,

36:39.720 --> 36:41.000
Colorado peaches.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.480
It just doesn't get any better than that.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.240
On that day, at that moment,

36:46.240 --> 36:47.480
that was the best ingredient.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.560
But that only lasts for a week

36:49.560 --> 36:50.720
and then they don't taste so great.

36:50.720 --> 36:51.560
Yeah.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.840
But damn, they're so good in that moment

36:54.840 --> 36:59.840
and you just can't stop wanting to use that ingredient.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.560
They look really good.

37:01.560 --> 37:02.680
They're so good.

37:02.680 --> 37:04.840
What's your favorite fruit?

37:04.840 --> 37:06.040
I love veggies and fruit.

37:06.040 --> 37:07.320
What's your favorite fruit?

37:07.320 --> 37:08.200
I love a smoothie bowl.

37:08.200 --> 37:11.360
So I do sort of berries, raspberries,

37:13.400 --> 37:16.360
but I use fruit more in the form of a smoothie bowl

37:16.360 --> 37:18.680
than I eat fruit that often.

37:18.680 --> 37:19.880
I like an apple or a banana,

37:19.880 --> 37:22.200
but for the most part, I prefer like the blended.

37:22.200 --> 37:23.040
Not me.

37:23.040 --> 37:26.320
I love the way you casually said I like an apple.

37:26.320 --> 37:28.200
A good apple is pretty great.

37:28.200 --> 37:30.840
For me, it's a problem, I think.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.520
Probably cherries, number one.

37:33.560 --> 37:35.880
Probably, what are they called?

37:35.880 --> 37:37.160
Granny Smith apples, number two.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.000
Oh yeah, those are great.

37:38.960 --> 37:41.360
Sometime, come to Colorado in August,

37:41.360 --> 37:42.920
when you try those peaches,

37:42.920 --> 37:47.920
it is like heaven has arrived in your mouth.

37:48.400 --> 37:51.400
It is so ridiculously good.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.520
But just for a week in August.

37:53.520 --> 37:56.120
Just for a week, you can't have it all year long.

37:57.440 --> 37:58.880
What about veggies?

37:58.880 --> 38:00.440
You wrote that Chef Hugo,

38:00.440 --> 38:03.080
that you worked with the co-founder of the kitchen with,

38:03.080 --> 38:05.840
taught you the power of a good vegetable.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.280
What's the power of a good vegetable?

38:07.920 --> 38:10.040
I've trained in New York as a French chef,

38:10.040 --> 38:12.160
but it wasn't very much ingredients focused.

38:12.160 --> 38:14.520
It wasn't very much sourcing focused.

38:14.520 --> 38:16.800
He came from the River Cafe in London,

38:16.800 --> 38:19.840
which is one of the OGs of the farm to table.

38:20.920 --> 38:23.040
Still going strong today.

38:23.040 --> 38:26.760
He taught me the value of getting to know farmers

38:26.760 --> 38:31.760
and getting to know vegetables from that farm

38:31.760 --> 38:33.640
versus vegetables from that farm.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.400
And they're actually different.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.880
Soil's a little different.

38:37.280 --> 38:38.400
The way they grow it, a little different.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.040
It's the opposite of the industrial machine

38:40.040 --> 38:42.640
where everything needs to look exactly the same.

38:42.640 --> 38:44.360
And sometimes you'll get carrots

38:44.360 --> 38:46.600
that are kind of ugly and deformed,

38:46.600 --> 38:49.520
but there's much sweeter than the carrots you'd get

38:49.520 --> 38:50.360
for other purposes.

38:50.360 --> 38:52.480
So you'd make a carrot puree out of that.

38:52.480 --> 38:53.840
And then you'd take carrots

38:53.840 --> 38:56.200
that are more typical in shape and size.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.720
You might roast them for dinner.

38:58.720 --> 39:03.720
So it's the appreciation for vegetables in general.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.480
I probably would say carrots is my favorite

39:07.440 --> 39:08.640
because that was an example of one

39:08.640 --> 39:11.160
where I really had to learn how to use

39:11.160 --> 39:14.080
the different types of carrots

39:14.080 --> 39:16.640
that come from all of our farms.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.200
And it's fun.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.040
It's a fun ingredient.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.560
If you just went to the Whole Foods

39:20.560 --> 39:21.600
or just went to a grocery store

39:21.600 --> 39:23.960
and you just got exactly the same carrot every time,

39:23.960 --> 39:27.280
less fun, but go to a farmer's market and see what you get.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.920
And you'll see they're quite different.

39:28.920 --> 39:30.960
Yeah, carrot for me is probably number one.

39:30.960 --> 39:34.920
I have rigorous detailed rankings for fruit and veggies.

39:34.920 --> 39:35.760
That's amazing.

39:35.960 --> 39:37.520
I'm just kidding.

39:37.520 --> 39:38.480
Well, I am the kind of person

39:38.480 --> 39:40.520
that would have like a spreadsheet for that.

39:42.520 --> 39:44.160
But I'm mostly just making fun of myself.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.920
I do love carrots.

39:47.280 --> 39:52.280
I wish they weren't so full of carbs, but.

39:52.360 --> 39:54.080
Yeah, I'm just not anti-carbs.

39:54.080 --> 39:55.120
I think the-

39:55.120 --> 39:56.120
Anti-carbs, yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:56.120 --> 39:58.120
Yeah, I think they play a role.

39:58.120 --> 40:00.800
I have a great friend who's an amazing doctor

40:00.800 --> 40:04.680
and he did some tests for me and everything

40:04.680 --> 40:07.520
and it turns out I have a gluten allergy.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.200
And I was like, okay.

40:09.200 --> 40:11.960
So what that means is I shouldn't eat gluten.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.320
It's like, yeah, it's like, okay.

40:13.320 --> 40:15.880
But I also have hay fever

40:16.840 --> 40:19.600
and that means I should not go out into nature.

40:20.680 --> 40:24.640
So it's like, nah, I think I'm gonna go out into nature.

40:24.640 --> 40:28.080
And maybe what I'll do on bread and pastas

40:28.080 --> 40:30.280
is I like the true carbs.

40:30.280 --> 40:33.080
I'll just have it when it's really good

40:34.000 --> 40:37.680
because when it's really good, it's really good

40:37.680 --> 40:39.160
and you don't wanna miss that.

40:39.160 --> 40:42.120
Most of the time, okay, find some crummy bread,

40:42.120 --> 40:43.960
whatever, I can skip that part.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.640
But I find all of these diets are like,

40:45.640 --> 40:48.720
no, none of this or super this, super that.

40:48.720 --> 40:51.480
I wonder if they're just like,

40:51.480 --> 40:54.360
people are just looking for something to hang on to.

40:54.360 --> 40:56.280
But these diets have been around forever

40:56.280 --> 40:58.680
and if they worked, then we would know that.

40:58.680 --> 41:01.680
Yeah, I think one of the biggest problems with diets

41:01.720 --> 41:06.720
is it adds stress when you do have that perfect bowl of pasta.

41:07.200 --> 41:12.000
If you have categorized yourself as a low carb eating person,

41:12.000 --> 41:15.320
you might be very stressed about enjoying this thing

41:15.320 --> 41:16.640
when you should just let go.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.000
Let go, that's just your cheat day or whatever.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.560
And I've heard that and actually I have friends

41:21.560 --> 41:23.720
who do that, their cheat day and I say to them,

41:23.720 --> 41:25.360
I'm only gonna hang out with you on your cheat day

41:25.360 --> 41:27.160
because that's when you're actually fun.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.560
Yeah, I mean, I would say like for me,

41:30.560 --> 41:33.440
there's things that make me feel really good.

41:33.440 --> 41:38.440
But they're not rules, they're like go-to favorites

41:41.680 --> 41:43.040
in terms of diet and so on.

41:43.040 --> 41:46.480
For example, I've mostly been eating once a day

41:46.480 --> 41:49.680
for the longest time, but that's not a rule.

41:49.680 --> 41:51.520
It's completely flexible

41:51.520 --> 41:54.040
and I've mostly been eating very low carb.

41:54.040 --> 41:56.400
Yeah, but you must be eating a lot of food in that one meal.

41:56.400 --> 42:00.280
Yeah, because it's usually very sort of meat heavy,

42:00.960 --> 42:02.960
portions are not that big.

42:02.960 --> 42:04.120
Your body needs food.

42:04.120 --> 42:04.960
Yeah, body needs food.

42:04.960 --> 42:07.240
So you're talking about like 2000 calories.

42:07.240 --> 42:10.760
What you find out is that dinner

42:10.760 --> 42:13.280
is the most social time of the day.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.720
Yeah, I mean, I have kids in the morning.

42:14.720 --> 42:17.520
So if you have kids, it's for sure a morning experience,

42:17.520 --> 42:18.880
but if you don't, then you're right.

42:18.880 --> 42:22.160
Yeah, but like you said, I deviate.

42:23.120 --> 42:27.680
I'm more afraid of missing the perfect dessert,

42:27.680 --> 42:31.800
the perfect breakfast, the perfect bowl of pasta,

42:31.800 --> 42:33.800
pizza, all that kind of stuff.

42:33.800 --> 42:35.280
I don't think of it as a cheat day.

42:35.280 --> 42:36.360
I think it's-

42:36.360 --> 42:37.360
Well, if you're only eating one meal a day,

42:37.360 --> 42:39.560
you can eat whatever you like.

42:39.560 --> 42:41.680
Well, like I wanna make clear

42:41.680 --> 42:43.480
that it's not one meal a day always

42:43.480 --> 42:45.400
and I'm like this very strict thing.

42:47.760 --> 42:50.280
You always have to be open to the experience,

42:50.280 --> 42:51.920
to the new experience.

42:51.920 --> 42:53.280
Otherwise you do miss out.

42:53.280 --> 42:55.240
Just like you said, hay fever.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.000
I think if you wanna be really safe,

42:57.000 --> 42:58.960
you should never leave your home.

42:58.960 --> 43:01.640
Yes, we learned during COVID,

43:01.640 --> 43:04.800
if you wrap yourself in cotton wool in your basement,

43:04.800 --> 43:07.120
you're not going to die from COVID.

43:07.120 --> 43:10.000
You might die from a lot of other things of pure misery.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.800
Yeah, well, you might live forever.

43:12.800 --> 43:15.600
Right, we don't know.

43:15.600 --> 43:18.120
But it certainly doesn't maximize the joy

43:18.120 --> 43:20.440
of whatever makes life worth living,

43:20.440 --> 43:21.920
it doesn't maximize that.

43:21.920 --> 43:23.440
Yeah, exactly.

43:23.440 --> 43:26.000
You wrote in a book that Anthony Bourdain

43:26.000 --> 43:27.360
was one of your heroes.

43:28.360 --> 43:33.040
Can you speak to what inspired you about him?

43:33.040 --> 43:34.440
Yeah, he wrote a book called

43:34.440 --> 43:37.200
Kitchen Confidential in the 90s.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.120
I was in cooking school at the time.

43:39.960 --> 43:44.080
It was so, he romanticized the kitchen,

43:44.080 --> 43:46.480
cooking in the restaurant so well.

43:46.480 --> 43:48.200
His writing is great.

43:48.200 --> 43:51.080
So he kind of got me into like, oh, that's cool.

43:51.080 --> 43:55.160
I wanna do that, it was cool.

43:55.200 --> 43:59.240
So I got into cooking school, got more engaged in it.

43:59.240 --> 44:01.680
And I was like this, had this FOMO feeling

44:01.680 --> 44:04.800
of I wanted to experience what it's like to be

44:04.800 --> 44:06.280
in the back, when you're in cooking school,

44:06.280 --> 44:08.760
you are in the back, they had a restaurant

44:08.760 --> 44:10.320
we would serve people, but it's not the same thing

44:10.320 --> 44:13.000
as actually being in a real restaurant.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.640
It's like you're in a submarine with your teammates

44:16.640 --> 44:18.280
and you gotta win tonight.

44:18.280 --> 44:20.400
Like it's a real, it's a real energy.

44:20.400 --> 44:23.000
And so that was a big inspiration.

44:23.040 --> 44:27.840
I followed him over there so sad that he chose to end his life.

44:27.840 --> 44:30.600
But I also had met with him a few times,

44:30.600 --> 44:32.440
not like one-on-one over dinner or anything,

44:32.440 --> 44:36.960
but just like met with him and I just felt this love

44:36.960 --> 44:41.400
for food and truly just love for food.

44:41.400 --> 44:43.160
He gave the advice of don't be afraid,

44:43.160 --> 44:45.600
get excited and cook with love.

44:45.600 --> 44:48.240
Yeah, I've used that phrase,

44:48.240 --> 44:50.680
especially the cook with love one.

44:50.720 --> 44:52.680
I mean, one of the things about,

44:52.680 --> 44:53.520
we talked about this earlier,

44:53.520 --> 44:56.360
where you get quick, tangible feedback from a customer

44:56.360 --> 44:57.760
when you're in the restaurant.

44:59.520 --> 45:02.920
I know when I didn't put love into that dish.

45:03.960 --> 45:06.360
I know when one of my line cooks did not put love

45:06.360 --> 45:08.000
into that part of the dish.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.280
I know when that expert person did not put love

45:10.280 --> 45:13.440
into double checking the dish before putting it

45:13.440 --> 45:15.720
on the table, you just know.

45:15.720 --> 45:20.280
And cook with love is when you do it for your family.

45:21.080 --> 45:23.760
Especially when you do it for your family,

45:23.760 --> 45:26.440
the food doesn't have to be perfect,

45:26.440 --> 45:27.760
but you're cooking with love.

45:27.760 --> 45:29.560
That's why you love scrambled eggs.

45:29.560 --> 45:30.880
I do that, it's-

45:30.880 --> 45:32.480
That's in the book, Kimball's scrambled eggs.

45:32.480 --> 45:33.320
Yes.

45:33.320 --> 45:34.600
You promised to make me scrambled eggs

45:34.600 --> 45:35.560
and I'm gonna hold you to it.

45:35.560 --> 45:36.400
That's great.

45:36.400 --> 45:40.680
A cooking school you mentioned,

45:40.680 --> 45:42.360
the French Culinary Institute.

45:42.360 --> 45:46.920
I heard it was a bit of a rough experience in parts.

45:46.920 --> 45:50.040
I would call it, it's not a rough experience in that-

45:50.760 --> 45:51.600
In a beautiful way.

45:51.600 --> 45:52.440
Yeah, it's exactly.

45:52.440 --> 45:53.280
It's not like I'm a victim of it.

45:53.280 --> 45:58.280
It's rough in that they intentionally make it rough.

45:59.680 --> 46:03.040
So the school costs the same price as Harvard to go to.

46:04.320 --> 46:08.360
You show up, it's an 18 month program.

46:08.360 --> 46:10.000
You are allowed to drop out at any time.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.240
You don't get your money back.

46:12.240 --> 46:16.200
25 people started, six people graduated.

46:17.200 --> 46:20.160
And the people who graduated, I graduated,

46:20.160 --> 46:21.960
but man, there were times where I'm like,

46:21.960 --> 46:23.480
I can't handle this.

46:23.480 --> 46:25.920
I would literally say to my friends,

46:25.920 --> 46:26.920
oh, I gotta go to cooking school.

46:26.920 --> 46:30.840
I'm gonna go get screamed at for the next six or seven hours.

46:30.840 --> 46:35.840
And I had this little French chef who was my nemesis.

46:35.840 --> 46:37.440
Does he still live in your head somewhere?

46:37.440 --> 46:39.280
He still lives in my head, exactly.

46:39.280 --> 46:40.120
He totally does.

46:40.120 --> 46:43.080
He's like five foot two or something.

46:43.080 --> 46:45.600
And I remember him screaming so much.

46:46.360 --> 46:50.440
At me, he's like the short guy, I'm six, five.

46:50.440 --> 46:52.800
The spittle would land on my face.

46:52.800 --> 46:53.920
Nice.

46:53.920 --> 46:57.240
And I would just have to sit there or stand there

46:57.240 --> 46:58.640
and take it.

46:58.640 --> 47:02.480
It was a very humbling experience.

47:02.480 --> 47:06.160
I did learn though that it's intentionally rough.

47:06.160 --> 47:10.120
So it took a little bit of the edge off it one day

47:10.120 --> 47:13.520
when that same chef had come over to me

47:13.520 --> 47:15.120
and said, move over a little bit.

47:15.440 --> 47:18.360
I moved over and he took my carrots or whatever

47:18.360 --> 47:22.160
and started just chopping everything perfectly.

47:22.160 --> 47:23.720
And then he said, okay, you can come back.

47:23.720 --> 47:25.840
And then he went over to someone else

47:25.840 --> 47:28.400
and started screaming at them saying that,

47:28.400 --> 47:32.840
look, even Kimball can do this and you can't do this.

47:32.840 --> 47:36.840
And I was like, this whole thing's like a psycho game.

47:37.760 --> 47:40.680
So it did take the edge off when I realized there was,

47:40.680 --> 47:43.680
the guy was intentionally trying to break you down.

47:43.680 --> 47:44.920
And they do this apparently in the army.

47:45.760 --> 47:49.920
I've not been in the army, but they need to break you down.

47:49.920 --> 47:52.080
Everything you know is worthless

47:52.080 --> 47:54.440
so that then we can teach you

47:54.440 --> 47:56.360
and you can come out of it with what actually

47:56.360 --> 47:57.880
we want you to know.

47:57.880 --> 48:00.840
Are there specific technical lessons you remember

48:00.840 --> 48:05.120
you learned from that sort of how to cut carrots

48:05.120 --> 48:10.120
or how to approach food, how to prepare food,

48:10.720 --> 48:12.200
how to think about food,

48:12.240 --> 48:15.040
how to carry yourself in the kitchen?

48:15.040 --> 48:16.360
All of those things.

48:17.280 --> 48:20.320
I think that the, one of the most beautiful lessons

48:20.320 --> 48:22.240
was actually scrambled eggs.

48:22.240 --> 48:24.160
So there's different layers of chefs.

48:24.160 --> 48:25.160
So they're all master chefs.

48:25.160 --> 48:26.840
They're all very well-known people and everything,

48:26.840 --> 48:31.840
but Alan Salter was one of the chief, main, main guys.

48:32.320 --> 48:35.560
And he just passed away, master chef.

48:35.560 --> 48:38.040
And everything kind of stopped

48:38.040 --> 48:40.160
when he would show up in the kitchen

48:40.160 --> 48:42.400
and he would teach very few things.

48:42.400 --> 48:44.440
And all of the other chefs who would,

48:44.440 --> 48:45.680
the same ones that were screaming at us,

48:45.680 --> 48:47.680
just like, it was like the Red Sea parting,

48:47.680 --> 48:51.680
like they have total respect for this human

48:51.680 --> 48:54.120
and he can do it every once.

48:54.120 --> 48:56.200
And the one of the things he wanted to teach

48:56.200 --> 48:59.280
was how do you make an omelet, a French omelet?

48:59.280 --> 49:01.240
And it's really fundamentally the same thing.

49:01.240 --> 49:03.920
It's the soft scrambled eggs that you fold.

49:03.920 --> 49:08.160
And the love that he put into the time with us,

49:08.160 --> 49:10.080
and of course he's a legend,

49:10.960 --> 49:13.040
there were moments like that where I'm like, wow, okay.

49:13.040 --> 49:16.080
He also, just like the other chefs,

49:16.080 --> 49:18.200
didn't have any concern berating anyone.

49:18.200 --> 49:21.720
So he berated our master chefs saying,

49:21.720 --> 49:24.400
I don't trust these people to teach you

49:24.400 --> 49:26.960
how to make scrambled eggs.

49:26.960 --> 49:28.840
So I'm gonna do it instead.

49:28.840 --> 49:32.680
I mean, can you speak to that?

49:32.680 --> 49:34.320
Because a lot of people hearing this

49:34.320 --> 49:35.840
would be like scrambled eggs.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.720
Like, why do you need to be a master chef

49:37.720 --> 49:39.960
to really make scrambled eggs?

49:40.800 --> 49:43.480
Well, first of all, for me,

49:43.480 --> 49:47.120
and it's a learning journey forever.

49:47.120 --> 49:49.440
So I make scrambled eggs,

49:49.440 --> 49:52.520
I mean, I must have made it 10,000 times or more or whatever.

49:52.520 --> 49:54.000
So it's like Gerald dreams of sushi,

49:54.000 --> 49:55.960
Kimball dreams of scrambled eggs?

49:55.960 --> 49:57.040
Pretty much.

49:57.040 --> 50:02.040
So I will wake up and be held accountable

50:02.440 --> 50:03.960
by my kids to make scrambled eggs.

50:03.960 --> 50:06.160
So this happens every morning.

50:06.160 --> 50:11.160
And I know all the steps,

50:12.000 --> 50:14.160
muscle memory level kind of steps.

50:14.160 --> 50:15.840
I don't know how much while I know it.

50:15.840 --> 50:19.360
And then I'll cook it and it's very meditative for me

50:19.360 --> 50:21.160
because you have to focus.

50:21.160 --> 50:23.560
So most scrambled eggs, soft scrambled egg recipes

50:23.560 --> 50:28.560
are 10, 15 minutes to get them to that perfect softness.

50:28.560 --> 50:32.920
And the recipe that I got from Chef Alain

50:32.920 --> 50:37.640
was something that you do in 90 seconds,

50:37.640 --> 50:40.480
but it requires total focus.

50:40.480 --> 50:43.520
Like if you look up for a second,

50:43.520 --> 50:47.120
you're going to miss the perfect moment

50:47.120 --> 50:50.520
where you have to stop and get those eggs out of the pan

50:50.520 --> 50:53.280
because the eggs will keep cooking.

50:53.280 --> 50:55.000
And so it's this meditation

50:55.000 --> 50:59.440
and it's sometimes you hit it like perfectly,

50:59.440 --> 51:03.760
but most times it could have been a little softer,

51:03.760 --> 51:05.440
could have been a little firmer,

51:05.440 --> 51:06.600
could have been a little bit more salt,

51:06.600 --> 51:08.440
could have been a little bit more pepper.

51:09.600 --> 51:12.400
And so what's really fun about the morning

51:12.400 --> 51:14.240
is my kids are kind of into it.

51:14.240 --> 51:19.240
So they're sort of like we critique the eggs every morning.

51:19.240 --> 51:20.600
Do they have a rating system?

51:20.600 --> 51:21.440
We're back to the spreadsheet.

51:21.440 --> 51:23.680
It's more like, and again,

51:23.680 --> 51:25.040
it's also come back to how do people feel, right?

51:25.040 --> 51:26.920
So my kids can be in a bad mood and they can be grumpy.

51:26.920 --> 51:28.720
Or it's like a Michelin star system, like what?

51:28.720 --> 51:30.960
No, no, it's more like, oh yeah,

51:30.960 --> 51:33.720
I like my eggs a little more gooier

51:33.720 --> 51:35.520
or yesterday it was this way,

51:35.520 --> 51:38.400
but a little bit more salt, a little less salt.

51:38.400 --> 51:41.840
Salt is usually the one that is,

51:41.840 --> 51:46.560
because not all salts are equal.

51:46.560 --> 51:49.640
So if you are used to working with a certain kind of salt

51:49.640 --> 51:51.600
and then you're just forced for some reason

51:51.600 --> 51:54.000
ran out of salt so you use some other salt,

51:54.000 --> 51:55.320
you actually don't know how to use it.

51:55.320 --> 51:58.080
You really want to have the same salt all the time.

51:58.240 --> 52:01.600
You have a page on salt in the book, which is fascinating.

52:01.600 --> 52:04.000
Salt is, you got to get to know your salt.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.640
You got to love your salt

52:05.640 --> 52:07.960
and you got to use it over and over and over again.

52:07.960 --> 52:11.560
And it will teach you how to use that salt.

52:11.560 --> 52:14.000
Your own palate will tell you how salty you like things.

52:14.000 --> 52:14.920
But if you change it up

52:14.920 --> 52:16.760
and you mix up a whole bunch of salts,

52:16.760 --> 52:19.480
you've now multiplied your learning path.

52:19.480 --> 52:23.840
So for me, my favorite salt is kosher salt.

52:23.840 --> 52:26.920
And I like to use that all the time.

52:26.960 --> 52:28.880
And if I ever change it,

52:28.880 --> 52:30.720
I might sprinkle a little bit of Moldan salt,

52:30.720 --> 52:34.680
which is a crunchy, sort of a flaky salt.

52:34.680 --> 52:36.920
But it's more for that when you're actually eating.

52:36.920 --> 52:39.800
It gives you texture as well as salt, exactly.

52:39.800 --> 52:41.800
You wouldn't use it on scrambled eggs.

52:41.800 --> 52:44.960
But if you switch out your salts,

52:44.960 --> 52:46.160
it's a different weapon.

52:47.800 --> 52:48.640
You need to learn it.

52:48.640 --> 52:53.640
I like how usually there's wine connoisseurs.

52:54.600 --> 52:58.240
You're going back to a farm to table

52:58.240 --> 53:00.280
when you're talking about carrots.

53:00.280 --> 53:03.000
In that same rigor and nuance,

53:03.000 --> 53:06.560
you have to consider the different farms involved

53:06.560 --> 53:07.680
for the carrots.

53:07.680 --> 53:11.120
In that same way, you have to consider the different salts.

53:12.880 --> 53:14.640
And also, kosher salts are the same.

53:14.640 --> 53:18.080
It's the particular salt that you like.

53:18.080 --> 53:19.680
Get to know it.

53:19.680 --> 53:21.440
Get in a relationship with it.

53:21.440 --> 53:22.720
It's great.

53:22.760 --> 53:24.600
You will learn so much.

53:24.600 --> 53:26.560
In terms of the measurement,

53:26.560 --> 53:29.840
the amount of salt you put in,

53:29.840 --> 53:32.680
are you doing that exactly,

53:32.680 --> 53:34.000
or are you doing it by feel?

53:34.000 --> 53:34.960
So it's by feel,

53:34.960 --> 53:36.200
and that's where you get the relationship.

53:36.200 --> 53:38.880
So in fact, in the cookbook,

53:38.880 --> 53:41.560
I have QR codes that people can scan.

53:41.560 --> 53:43.360
Because what I struggle with with recipes

53:43.360 --> 53:45.960
is they don't teach you technique.

53:45.960 --> 53:47.560
They can describe the technique,

53:47.560 --> 53:48.680
but they don't teach the technique.

53:48.680 --> 53:51.240
Because it's a technique, it's not a recipe.

53:51.240 --> 53:53.400
And so one of the lessons is,

53:53.400 --> 53:56.000
how do you salt a steak?

53:56.000 --> 53:57.920
And the answer is not,

53:57.920 --> 54:00.760
here's a teaspoon and you do it this way.

54:00.760 --> 54:04.320
The answer is, use kosher salt

54:04.320 --> 54:07.040
so you can see with your eyes,

54:07.040 --> 54:07.960
because they're little flakes,

54:07.960 --> 54:10.640
how much salt is on your steak,

54:10.640 --> 54:13.240
and then cook it, and then taste it.

54:14.320 --> 54:16.480
Do you think you need more or you need less?

54:16.480 --> 54:17.960
Okay, now next time,

54:17.960 --> 54:20.720
put a little more on because you can see it.

54:20.720 --> 54:22.920
And it's about learning the fact

54:22.920 --> 54:25.760
that you want to be able to see how much salt is

54:25.760 --> 54:27.520
on the steak so that you can then train yourself

54:27.520 --> 54:29.680
for the future of how much salt you want on your steak.

54:29.680 --> 54:31.920
Yeah, but then the steak and the salt kind of dance together.

54:31.920 --> 54:33.640
It depends on where the steak came from.

54:33.640 --> 54:35.920
That's true, all the thickness of the steak.

54:35.920 --> 54:36.760
That'll make a difference.

54:36.760 --> 54:39.200
But for the most part, if you learn,

54:39.200 --> 54:41.200
if you're able to see it,

54:41.200 --> 54:42.760
versus table salt, for example,

54:42.760 --> 54:44.840
this just disappears.

54:44.840 --> 54:46.920
You just can't see what you're putting on your steak.

54:46.920 --> 54:48.520
You can't really learn as a result.

54:48.520 --> 54:49.880
I think you talk about roast chickens

54:49.880 --> 54:52.680
where your love of food began.

54:52.680 --> 54:54.160
What about steak?

54:54.160 --> 54:56.320
I love a good steak, it's so great.

54:56.320 --> 54:59.720
So in the French school,

54:59.720 --> 55:02.160
you add sauces and all this kind of stuff.

55:02.160 --> 55:04.040
And in boulders, when you realize

55:04.040 --> 55:06.880
there's a beauty to the basic ingredient.

55:06.880 --> 55:11.880
Yeah, like a good New York strip from a good rancher.

55:15.400 --> 55:18.960
There's a lot of discussion controversy

55:18.960 --> 55:21.800
on how cattle should be raised.

55:21.800 --> 55:26.080
And we have a very different approach,

55:26.080 --> 55:28.800
which is we know how our cattle are raised.

55:28.800 --> 55:30.640
We go to the farm.

55:30.640 --> 55:32.760
We get to know the rancher.

55:32.760 --> 55:36.880
And sometimes you do want to have them be finished on,

55:36.880 --> 55:38.320
like they'll be grass-fed for the most part,

55:38.320 --> 55:41.680
but then there's some sort of cool recipe

55:41.680 --> 55:42.720
of food you're giving them

55:42.720 --> 55:44.560
that will then make them taste better.

55:45.760 --> 55:47.400
And sometimes it is actually pretty good

55:47.400 --> 55:49.120
to have 100% grass-fed.

55:49.120 --> 55:50.920
I've had some amazing ranchers

55:50.920 --> 55:54.400
that show me that the flavor is all there.

55:54.400 --> 55:56.160
For the average person that might go

55:56.160 --> 55:58.360
to Whole Foods or a grocery store,

55:58.360 --> 56:01.280
I think the simplicity of a good steak,

56:03.720 --> 56:05.120
it is important to get good sourcing,

56:05.120 --> 56:07.160
but also it's just good.

56:07.160 --> 56:08.640
What's your favorite cut of meat?

56:08.640 --> 56:10.680
There's New York strip, probably New York strip for me.

56:10.680 --> 56:12.040
Yeah, New York strip.

56:12.040 --> 56:14.440
I like the fact that it's lean,

56:14.440 --> 56:15.520
but if you want the fat,

56:15.520 --> 56:18.200
you can dive into that little strip of fat,

56:18.200 --> 56:19.240
or you can leave it alone

56:19.240 --> 56:21.040
because you don't want it that night.

56:21.960 --> 56:26.960
And it's also a great steak for adding something.

56:27.040 --> 56:28.280
Like if you want to,

56:28.280 --> 56:30.040
you could either do a pepper sauce

56:30.040 --> 56:32.000
or you could do a lot of ground pepper,

56:32.000 --> 56:33.640
which gives it a peppery,

56:33.640 --> 56:35.960
and it's not sauce, but it's a peppery steak.

56:35.960 --> 56:40.960
It's a really good steak for a canvas for other things.

56:41.880 --> 56:43.120
But the basic ingredients,

56:43.120 --> 56:45.200
you're playing with is salt and pepper.

56:45.720 --> 56:47.240
Pretty much.

56:47.240 --> 56:50.280
Actually, I will say there's another one, garlic.

56:51.320 --> 56:52.680
When you can,

56:52.680 --> 56:56.800
one of my favorite recipe for a steak is

56:56.800 --> 56:59.800
you season it, both sides, salt and pepper.

56:59.800 --> 57:02.800
You saute it in a little olive oil,

57:02.800 --> 57:04.680
barely anything.

57:04.680 --> 57:07.240
And you're getting a nice crisp,

57:07.240 --> 57:10.120
like a golden dark, golden brown on both sides.

57:10.120 --> 57:12.520
The other trick with cooking a steak is don't touch it.

57:12.520 --> 57:14.320
You know, just put one side.

57:14.320 --> 57:16.640
When you're ready to turn it, turn it around.

57:16.640 --> 57:18.840
Don't touch any other time.

57:18.840 --> 57:22.520
But at the end, you take a dab of butter

57:22.520 --> 57:25.600
and you crush a clove of garlic.

57:25.600 --> 57:27.320
You don't even chop it, you just crush the clove

57:27.320 --> 57:30.200
and you put the two of them in the pan

57:30.200 --> 57:33.360
and you just roll the steak around in the garlic butter.

57:34.920 --> 57:36.120
I think that's the one.

57:36.120 --> 57:38.800
Bold move, Kimball, bold move.

57:38.800 --> 57:42.320
What are you, since you're in Austin quite a bit,

57:42.320 --> 57:45.120
opening a restaurant here,

57:45.120 --> 57:47.200
what do you think about barbecue?

57:47.200 --> 57:52.200
It's kind of the Texas way.

57:52.200 --> 57:53.840
Well, I would say there's an Austin way,

57:53.840 --> 57:56.560
which is, and actually even Austin would say

57:56.560 --> 57:58.120
there's a suburb of Austin way.

57:59.440 --> 58:03.640
I think that actually the adventure of food is wonderful.

58:04.520 --> 58:06.600
I would absolutely say that Austin

58:06.600 --> 58:11.280
is one of the great food cities of America

58:11.280 --> 58:15.880
and barbecue is one of its gifts that it gives the city.

58:15.880 --> 58:17.480
But you'll go to one and the other

58:17.480 --> 58:18.920
and you'll have a different approach

58:18.920 --> 58:21.120
and that's the part I love,

58:21.120 --> 58:24.600
is where there's a real celebration of the artisan.

58:24.600 --> 58:29.560
So you might go to one and they have a style that they love

58:29.560 --> 58:31.320
and they've been doing it for years

58:31.320 --> 58:32.160
and then you'll go to another

58:32.160 --> 58:33.280
and they have a style that they love

58:33.280 --> 58:36.640
and they've been doing it for years and it's not,

58:36.640 --> 58:38.400
there's still barbecue, but they're actually different

58:38.400 --> 58:40.400
and it's really beautiful to see that

58:40.400 --> 58:44.040
and that's, I think that's what food culture is.

58:44.040 --> 58:46.600
Like it just builds up over time

58:46.600 --> 58:49.480
by people who love this style of cooking.

58:49.480 --> 58:51.680
Well, I especially love the communal,

58:51.680 --> 58:54.160
like how they structure restaurants usually,

58:54.160 --> 58:56.760
or I don't even want to call it a restaurant

58:56.760 --> 58:59.760
because it doesn't feel like a restaurant.

58:59.760 --> 59:01.280
It feels like a tavern or some sort,

59:01.280 --> 59:03.200
like Terry Black's is like that.

59:03.200 --> 59:05.400
Yeah, they also have like paper towels,

59:05.400 --> 59:06.840
get as messy as you like

59:06.840 --> 59:08.240
and it's a whole roll of paper towels.

59:08.240 --> 59:09.600
They don't even give you a napkin.

59:09.600 --> 59:10.680
They know what you're getting into.

59:10.680 --> 59:13.600
Yeah, and there's just wood everywhere

59:13.600 --> 59:15.400
and it's kind of has this feel

59:15.400 --> 59:17.040
like this place has been around forever.

59:17.040 --> 59:18.040
It's not changing.

59:18.040 --> 59:19.960
I know it's the 21st century with the internet

59:19.960 --> 59:23.080
and all this kind of nonsense that you people are building,

59:23.080 --> 59:25.600
but really this is all about the same.

59:25.600 --> 59:27.280
It's been the same for generations.

59:27.280 --> 59:29.640
We're doing it the same, that kind of feel

59:29.640 --> 59:32.040
if you want to escape the world in that way

59:32.040 --> 59:33.880
and then truly connect with people.

59:33.880 --> 59:34.960
One of the other things that'll happen

59:34.960 --> 59:37.840
in a town like Austin is there'll be a barbecue joint

59:37.840 --> 59:39.480
that is just legendary, right?

59:40.320 --> 59:42.400
And then out of that will come someone

59:42.400 --> 59:44.640
who wants to do their own barbecue joint

59:44.640 --> 59:48.480
and they'll take the learning from that barbecue joint.

59:48.480 --> 59:49.640
They'll open up a new one,

59:49.640 --> 59:52.160
but it won't be the same as the other barbecue joint.

59:52.160 --> 59:53.640
Part of it says like, dude,

59:53.640 --> 59:55.040
like don't just do the same thing.

59:55.040 --> 59:56.080
Do something.

59:56.080 --> 59:58.480
What do you have to say?

59:58.480 --> 01:00:02.000
But also part of it is if you're in the world of food

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.400
as an art form and you want to go open up

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:09.160
another barbecue joint, you kind of want to prove yourself.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.760
Like I deserve to have a barbecue joint in this town.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.760
I know this is one of the holy grails of barbecue

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:19.880
and people will follow you like they're following a musician

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.880
or they're following an artist

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:26.240
and they are excited to see what your version is

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:27.400
and how well you can pull it off.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.120
It's like, it's actually, that's what I love.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.600
That's what I mean by like a city with a food culture

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.280
that Austin has that.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.200
There's also like a legend to certain places.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.080
Certain places are more than just the food

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:40.800
that they create.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.360
It's like, that could be a burden.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.240
They have to like live up to the legendary nature

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.360
of the name.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:50.160
Our restaurant in Boulder, the kitchen is 20 years old.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.480
We're very well known, very well respected

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.320
and we do have to live up to the name.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:01.320
I think that our restaurant lives up to its name

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.040
in not just the food.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.760
It's like you walk in and you feel the restaurant

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:10.800
and that is also something we've just done naturally.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.280
The space is a 120 year old building.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.640
Used to be a brothel and it was a bookstore.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:19.960
Like storied history.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:23.840
This was a, literally, this was a mining town, right?

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:27.720
So back in the 1800s, this was built late 1800s.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.720
That sort of brothels were, that was a thing

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:35.280
and so there's an actual tunnel in the basement

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:39.720
that goes to the local hotel that would be used

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.160
for going back and forth between the hotel

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:45.040
and the brothel without people knowing

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.840
and the tunnel is now concreted up

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.640
but you can go about 20, 30 feet into the tunnel

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.000
but you go into the space and it's actually an old space

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.560
so you feel like it's been there forever.

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:58.440
Yeah.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:02.880
In 2010, you had a life threatening accident

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:06.640
that changed the way you see life, the world,

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:09.080
also the way you see food and cooking.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.120
Can you tell me the story of it?

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.160
Yeah.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.200
So 2010, I was 37.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:20.960
I had opened the restaurant in 2004

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.800
and I had loved the restaurant world, loved it

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.440
but I didn't really wanna grow a restaurant company.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:32.440
That wasn't my goal and so I went back into technology

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:37.680
and I had gone from something that I love

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.920
to something that I like.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.680
For me, it was like chewing sawdust every day.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.840
I just couldn't believe that I had gone from,

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.440
that had changed my life.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.080
I had gone back into technology

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.640
and now I do do work in technology and I do love it

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.920
but I found a better relationship with it

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.640
but I was really, really unhappy.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.400
From the outside, I was a sort of CEO of a part startup.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.600
From the inside, I was just very unhappy

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.000
and I was in Jackson Hole

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.640
and I was doing these very aggressive snowboard runs

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.200
and I'm, at the time, a pretty good aggressive snowboarder

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.240
and I remember saying to myself, look, I've got kids,

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.280
I need to chill on this.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.280
The next day was Valentine's Day,

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.640
it's the next day, tomorrow's Valentine's Day,

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.240
I'm just gonna have a nice day with the family

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:25.600
and my wife at the time.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.240
And we went to a children's run to do the inner tube run

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.480
and the tubes are small but everyone uses the same tube.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:37.320
So I'm six foot five and my kids are four years old

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.280
and everyone uses the same size tube.

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.040
It should have been a message to me

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.720
not to get on this thing

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.200
but I went and got on it and on the first run

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.320
and I went down and you're going super fast,

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:53.640
35 miles an hour and the tube hit the braking mats

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.480
and it stopped, the tube just stopped

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.280
where it was, it just threw me.

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.080
I was, my head was facing downhill

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.280
so that's created the wrong center of gravity

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.960
so instead of braking, it just threw me.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:11.680
I landed on my head, my head went into my chest,

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:15.520
like compression into my chest, down like that.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:19.240
I ruptured my spine at C6 and C7

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:25.360
and in like the blink of a second, I was paralyzed.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:29.440
I was like, like what?

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.880
You know, just like impossible to,

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.640
impossible to comprehend

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:39.720
and they take me to put this big thing on my,

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:42.080
like halo on my head and they take me to the hospital

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.160
which was more of a medical clinic

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.160
and I'm just like, what is going on here?

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.400
Do you remember your thoughts from the moment it happened

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.160
to like the way to get to, got to the hospital?

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:55.120
I remember being, so this is one of the things

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.560
that actually the doctor said caused the most damage was

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.280
I was thrown from the tube

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:05.360
and I heard this big crunch sound in my body

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:09.280
and I knew that I was hurt

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.280
but I didn't feel any pain,

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.840
which is also why wouldn't you feel pain?

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.520
Because you don't have paralyze, you don't feel pain

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:20.920
and I'm face down on the snow

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.680
and the snow is burning my face

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.800
because you can't do that, you need something

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:29.840
and I found a way to turn myself around

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.480
so that my face wouldn't be on the ground

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.560
but I knew I couldn't move

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:39.560
and that they said actually caused more damage than,

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:41.800
well, obviously the accident created the opening

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.240
but once you move your body,

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.920
the blood goes into the spinal column at a faster rate

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.840
and that is what caused my paralysis

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.120
but I remember that and I,

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:59.000
I remember getting into the ambulance.

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.800
Did you think you were gonna die at that,

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.960
like in those seconds, minutes?

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.800
It was a different feeling of death, it was more,

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.720
it was more of a, what is going on here?

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.280
Like I just was, it was more,

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.680
like I can't make sense of what's going on.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.440
It was,

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.520
it was a moment when I got to the hospital

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:29.520
and they did this MRI and the doctor comes up to me

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:33.800
and says, look, we've done this MRI

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:38.600
and so now I'm in the hospital and I'm like,

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.600
I can't move but I also don't even feel any pain

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.480
so I'm like, it's very confusing.

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.960
Your body looks like you can move it,

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.840
like, look, see how I'm moving my hand.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:49.240
Like, it looks like you can do that

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.760
and then it just doesn't move.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.200
It doesn't, there's no, there's no,

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.320
there's no feedback loop that it's not moving.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:58.600
Your brain even thinks it's moving but it's not moving.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:02.720
It's like the worst, the most terrifying thing.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.920
So the doctor says, look,

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:09.240
the way you broke your neck was really at a zero degree angle.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.800
That is so rare but as a result,

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.280
there is no twisting of the spine.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.800
We think that we can get the blood out of your spinal column

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:21.360
and you should get some or maybe all of your movement back.

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:26.840
And I was like, oh, okay, I think I'm gonna be fine.

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:29.200
I guess I'm gonna be fine and then I realized

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:33.640
I had tears just streaming down the side of my face

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:38.400
and I was like, whoa, man, I have no idea what's going on.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:43.400
So this kind of intense state of confusion.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:47.080
I wonder if it's a weird psychological defense mechanism

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.720
of like taking you away

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:52.040
from the obvious possibility of death.

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:54.240
Yeah, it was a, for sure, all the defense,

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.680
all of the defenses were up.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:00.360
I don't know how else to describe it but there was denial.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:01.200
Yeah.

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:06.200
There was this curiosity of like, why is there no pain?

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:10.040
When they did actually repair me and fix me,

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:11.520
it was three days later,

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:16.520
the pain was indescribable how much pain I was in

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.000
but there was no pain for three days.

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.480
The human body is fascinating.

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:23.800
Man.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:24.640
Wow.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.480
So they were able.

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.600
Yeah, so they did the surgery

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:32.040
but I had this very clear voice in my head

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.960
that I was like, oh, I'm gonna die.

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.960
That I've kind of determined that it's God.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.800
I'm not religious

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.760
but I don't know how else to describe the voice.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.320
And his voice was very clear.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:48.360
You're gonna work with kids and food.

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.520
I'm like, okay, where did that come from?

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.760
I'm like, tech CEO, I have a restaurant.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.400
And I knew we were working with some kids in schools

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:59.640
with like some, you know, helping out local nonprofit.

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:02.440
And he's like, no, you're just gonna work on kids and food.

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:08.840
My good friend, Antonio, my brother were in the hospital

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:12.600
and I was like, I'm gonna work on kids and food.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.080
You know, cause they're like, he's crazy.

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:15.920
He lost his mind.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.960
But not that they would argue,

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:18.800
no one was arguing with me

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.240
but I was like, I'm just going to do that.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.200
I need to say it out loud.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:26.800
And I remember resigning from my job

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.160
as a CEO from the hospital.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:34.760
And that was it.

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:36.280
It was just clear.

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:37.840
It was a clear voice.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.280
Wasn't for a moment, wasn't like a flash of light or anything.

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.520
It was probably two weeks of clear voice.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.360
Of clarity.

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:47.800
Clarity, exactly clarity and no monkey brain, nothing.

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:50.600
No monkey brain, just clarity.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:52.000
So you're not a religious person

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.840
but you do call it the voice of God.

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:58.120
Who is that God, do you think?

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:01.440
Like who is that, where did that come from?

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:05.240
Well, I've done ayahuasca

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:08.880
and I've spoken to what they call mother ayah

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:13.120
which is another version of God.

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:18.560
It's a divine presence.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.560
It's maybe, I think it's a better way to say it.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.080
I've also had this debate in my head

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:25.280
like maybe it's just me.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.800
I'm talking to me.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:31.800
And it's my peaceful, more kinder,

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:36.920
more less caught up in the emotion of the day version of me.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:38.280
Maybe it's me.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:40.920
Okay, maybe it is, but it's there.

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:42.160
But who are you?

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.800
Like how deep does it go?

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.360
What does you mean?

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.320
You could be, first of all,

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:51.960
like the depth of what the human mind even is

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.640
is a gigantic mystery.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.480
Consciousness, all of it.

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.320
Who are you?

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:57.800
Yeah, maybe it is you.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.840
But then maybe in order to build you,

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.400
we need to build the universe.

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:02.240
Yeah.

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:06.480
Like you are actually fundamentally a part

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.440
of this whole human society.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.840
So the pieces of humans that you've interacted with

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.160
are all within you.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.680
And then maybe the history of the humans

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.360
that came before are also in there.

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.120
And maybe the entirety of life on earth is also in there.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:25.480
And whatever brought life about on earth

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.480
is in there somewhere.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.320
So that's all you.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.560
Yeah, all of the, which is really true.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:34.480
Evolution is, it literally is true that we all are,

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.080
the photons from the sun came in.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.160
You're part fish.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.600
We all came from, we all came from that.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.600
I think this is one, you know,

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:45.760
so one of the things I do is meditate.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:49.440
And this was, I've been meditating for many, many years.

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:54.320
And what way I meditate is I sit and I listen to my thoughts.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.920
And I simply just do that for 15 to 20 minutes.

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:59.320
And it just calms the nervous system.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.960
And I might breathe and just be,

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.960
breathe through because it's been a stressful day.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:06.520
And it's just a beautiful way to, I kind of do it around.

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.520
I remember I said, I used to do a scotch at the bar

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.480
after work, now I go meditate for instance,

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:16.360
a little less, a little bit better for my health.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:21.160
But meditation I was taught was,

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.400
Sam Harris actually taught me this,

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:27.560
was not so much just about watching your thoughts,

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.920
but realizing that you're a watcher.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.200
You're actually a watcher.

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:38.320
You're not just like, who is the person watching that?

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.640
That's you actually.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.880
Your thoughts are floating through your mind,

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.280
but you are the watcher.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:46.920
And I was like, oh, that's really interesting.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.400
Okay, so I'm gonna learn that.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.080
I'm gonna be the watcher.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.560
And what I learned was,

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.480
I'm watching these thoughts go by

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.880
and there's a consistent other presence.

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:03.960
And I'm like, what is that consistent other presence?

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.400
It's not a thought.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:10.160
That is not something I can kind of let it float away

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:11.440
and it doesn't even want to float away.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.920
It's just a consistent other presence

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.960
that I can watch and feel.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:21.640
So you are the watcher watching the feelings and thoughts,

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:24.280
but there's also another presence next to you almost.

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.720
Yes, yeah, that's how I feel.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.080
And it's a beautiful presence.

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:32.400
It's not a presence that is trying to intervene.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:35.960
It's not a presence that is trying to tell you what to do.

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:37.640
It's just a beautiful presence.

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:40.160
And that might be the thing,

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:45.160
part of the thing you met when you took ayahuasca.

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:47.400
I learned about Mother Iowa,

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:50.160
you have this experience of talking to,

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.360
I actually, I would say the closest thing

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.800
to breaking my neck, but that feeling was ayahuasca.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:54.800
Can you go through that experience?

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:58.120
Cause I'm actually traveling to the Amazon jungle

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:01.200
in a month, I'll probably do ayahuasca for the first time.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.040
Okay.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.160
So I need a preview, unofficial instruction manual.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.000
Yeah, sure.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.880
So first of all, I think there are many different ways

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:08.720
to do it, right?

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.760
So I've done many different ways.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.840
There's a very Western medicine approach

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:19.840
where you have doctors that look after you during the day,

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.400
you know, put an eye mask on, you're on a futon

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:27.240
and you really are in a Western medicine setting.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:30.160
And it's frankly for me has been

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.760
the most powerful experience.

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:32.840
I feel the most comfortable

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:36.440
cause I'm part of Western medicine in my upbringing.

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:40.040
The other extreme, but they're kind of in between,

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.800
would be very probably a Peruvian ceremonies

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.280
where you're probably gonna go.

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:49.360
Very much about you do it in a community,

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.200
you do it with others and you feel people go

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.280
through their pain and their processing.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.960
So I know the whole gamut,

01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:01.120
but the thing that I found most powerful about it

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.160
and profoundly powerful, I would say,

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:04.760
for physical is it's non recreational.

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:08.400
So no one should do this for a good time.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.240
This is not a good time.

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:14.960
This is a very almost traumatic,

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:15.800
but in again, a beautiful way.

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.680
I was actually gonna say that way, but it's not,

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.400
it's not traumatic, it's profound.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.920
So it's more like you don't have,

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:32.480
you really leave who you were before behind

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:38.440
and then you become the person you will be afterwards.

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:42.400
And that's never an easy thing.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.240
Yes, exactly.

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:48.240
And sometimes what I recall was arguing with brother Aya

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.040
and saying, no, I'm fine.

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.440
Like what was he talking about?

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:53.440
Like leave me alone.

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:56.160
And yeah.

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.480
How did that work out?

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:05.680
But before 2010, the accident

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:09.880
and the two transformational experiences you had,

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:14.920
you were a very successful tech CEO.

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.800
Maybe you go back to the early days with Zip2.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.520
In 1994, you and Elon started Zip2.

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.200
Tell me the story of that.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.800
Yeah, so in 1994, we actually did a road trip

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:27.760
around the US to brainstorm

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:30.640
about what we wanted to do after college.

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.960
What was the road trip like?

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:32.800
That was awesome.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.720
So we went from Silicon Valley to Philadelphia.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:40.880
My brother's old, like a really cool,

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.800
it's one of those very old BMWs,

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.840
not ones from the 60s or 70s,

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.680
but the car didn't work.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.440
It would break down all the time.

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:50.640
But we had a blast.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:53.920
You know, we just, I remember going through Needles

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.360
on the border of California, Arizona.

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.640
It's the town of Needles.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:59.520
It's the hottest place in America.

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.920
And the engine was not cooling,

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:05.000
so we had to put the heat on.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.720
So we put the heat blasting to cool the engine,

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:08.560
keep the engine cool,

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.560
and keep the windows down

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.440
because we can't stand the heat in the car.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.040
But actually the outside heat is hotter

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:14.880
than the inside heat.

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.480
So you're just in a furnace.

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.320
Yeah.

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:20.160
You're driving through.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:21.000
Just sweating.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:21.840
It was at night even.

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:23.600
I can't imagine doing that in the day.

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.040
Yeah, it was a wonderful,

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.600
it took us a few weeks,

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.320
I think three weeks maybe.

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.720
First time across America?

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.800
First, like a road trip like that, yeah, for sure.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.760
But it was really not a road trip for tourist sites.

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.440
We went to the weirdest places.

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:41.520
And actually I would say we didn't go to them.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:44.400
We broke down in the weirdest places

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.960
because that's when we stopped.

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:46.800
Yeah.

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.040
Did you meet any interesting people?

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:53.240
I remember we broke down in the Badlands of South Dakota,

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:55.440
about an hour from Rapid City,

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:58.600
and that road is empty.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:01.160
And so we actually slept in the car

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:03.520
because there was just no one around.

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.680
There were no cell phones in those days.

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:08.160
And eventually a trucker picked us up.

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:09.400
I was just like,

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:13.000
man, you guys are the dumbest kids on the planet.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.560
Twat was like 21 and he was maybe 22.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:18.600
And, but he was so nice to us and so kind to us

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.360
and found us a mechanic in Rapid City

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.160
and then found us a tow truck.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.640
And yeah, you find the most wonderful people.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:29.160
When you're in a place of distress,

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:32.960
people do want to take care of other people.

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:33.800
They help you.

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.640
Yeah, they want to help.

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.600
And especially when you're on a road trip,

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:40.480
because I've taken a road trip across the United States

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:45.480
and there's a part of people where they really love that.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.400
I think part of them wants to do that also.

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:53.680
Wants to kind of escape whatever the local, the struggles,

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:58.600
just whatever the mundane-ness, the struggle of life are.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.920
A road trip is a kind of thing where you're like,

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:01.760
you know what?

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.480
I'm going to get away from it all

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.120
and I'm going to experience life in the full,

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:10.120
the epic sort of Jack Kerouac way of seeing America.

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.400
The people, not the tourist sites, just the humans.

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.240
Yeah, exactly.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.000
This was not tourist related.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.080
We did, of course, when we stopped at Mount Rushmore

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:20.240
at night, which you can see nothing.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:22.400
We thought that was hilarious.

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.480
You couldn't see Mount Rushmore.

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:25.320
That's great.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:29.880
It was like, well, we physically were here.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.160
There's a photo of us.

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:32.000
In the dark.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.880
You could just say you went to the Grand Canyon, too,

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:40.040
just at night and just visited different places

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.000
when the car broke down.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000
I love it.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.800
So yes, you took the road trip before Founding Zip 2.

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:48.520
Yeah, so I had an experience in college

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.400
running a house painting business

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:54.360
that for me was my first experience with success.

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.280
It was very, very hard.

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:58.920
It was a franchise where they teach students

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:02.320
how to paint houses, but I was good at it.

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:07.320
I built a team of 30 people after about two years.

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:10.160
And so I was like, I had a taste of,

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:13.120
hey, I'm not unable to do this.

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:14.720
In fact, my most vulnerable place,

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:17.720
I remember as an entrepreneur, was I just loved

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:23.000
the idea of Wall Street and finance.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.080
It was kind of allured by it.

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.400
This was in late 80s in high school.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.080
There was a lot of these books, Liar's Poker

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:29.920
and others that came out.

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.600
I was like, oh man, this is awesome.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:33.200
These people must be amazing.

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:36.040
So I went to business school and I busted my ass

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:38.120
to get like a kick-ass summer job.

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.640
And I got a job in one of the main banks.

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:40.480
And it was in Toronto,

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.880
but it was like the original Wall Street.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:46.800
And I was so disappointed with the people that I was around.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.680
I was just like, whoa.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:54.560
I totally misunderstood what the banking world is.

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.440
It was a very large bank.

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.440
I'm sure if I'd gone to a more aggressive one,

01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.760
maybe I would have had a better experience.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:02.680
And I say aggressive meaning someone was paying attention.

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:07.680
This was just people kind of showing up and not doing much.

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.080
Actually, this is funny.

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.600
So this is great.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:18.360
So 1991, 1992, one of those summers,

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:25.040
the summer job was literally,

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:28.520
you go to the, they print out the sales

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:32.480
for all brokerage houses for the whole company.

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:34.120
Like there's a pile of papers

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:37.040
that's maybe four or five feet tall.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.800
And you have a pencil and you add things up

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.760
using your pencil and a calculator.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:49.200
And I had known about Lotus one, two, three forever.

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:52.760
Excel was coming out and I was like,

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.200
hey guys, you know that there's a different way to do this.

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.360
And they're like, don't talk to us.

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.640
Just do your job.

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.120
Yeah, just use the pencil.

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:06.160
So I went to the head of the data.

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:09.960
I just asked, those days you had the Manila envelope

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:12.960
where you can, you just write the name of the person

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:15.360
that you want this to go to and it'll go to them.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:18.920
It's like email, I guess, but there's no filter.

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:22.360
So if you felt, there's no spam filter.

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:26.760
I wrote a nice letter to the database administrator

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.200
who I didn't really know.

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.920
And I said, would you be open to me saying hi

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:32.720
and maybe I can get access to the file

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:35.480
rather than print the damn thing out and use a pencil.

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:38.120
And she could respond right away.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.320
And we hit it off.

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:40.480
I mean, she was great.

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.440
And so she's like, of course you can.

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:45.400
I can't believe these guys are doing what they're doing.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:48.600
So for the first couple of weeks of the summer,

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:53.240
I wrote code in Lotus one, two, three,

01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:56.520
that would, it's gonna sound crazy,

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.400
but you type in the date range,

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:02.440
you type in the geography and you type in the,

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.800
which part of the bank you care about

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:09.640
and it will literally just create a new spreadsheet

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:12.800
and it will just, the macro would print it out.

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:15.680
It was like a magic trick for these guys.

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:16.520
And-

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.040
Incredible.

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:20.440
No, no, it's like, it's a sounding that this, I mean,

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:24.600
for me, I was like, guys, this is so obvious.

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.360
And so I got all that done.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.280
And this job was supposed to take three or four months

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:35.560
because it's really, you're doing this with a pencil.

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:38.520
And now I'd created this macro that you could not just,

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:40.600
not just do it, you could do it, you could tweak it

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.520
and say, oh, I want this area of the world

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:46.080
or this area of, or this month or that month

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:46.920
compared to that month, you know,

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:49.240
all the normal things you could do with a spreadsheet.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.120
And the software was on a floppy disk.

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.800
I was like, here's the software

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:56.840
and just put it into your computer.

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:59.360
All right, now open one, two, three,

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.920
and it just pops up with a little box

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:04.160
that type in your dates and the whole little,

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.040
I could a little thing like that.

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:11.040
And what I was astounded by was not so much

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:14.440
that it was a magic trick.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:18.880
It was the lack of appreciation for innovation.

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:22.120
They just looked at it, they were like, oh, that's nice.

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:27.400
And I was like, you just, we're gonna have someone spend

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:30.760
hundreds of hours doing something.

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.280
And now it's something you can do in a minute.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:35.960
Yeah, if that doesn't fuel you with excitement.

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.600
Yeah, like that doesn't move your needle, what the heck?

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:42.200
And so I was really disappointed with the banking world.

01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:44.080
Anyway, so that was also fun.

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.600
That's a good example though, yeah.

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:48.360
And then also see the possibility of where that goes.

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:51.040
But then I got back to business school

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:54.480
and I canceled all of my business classes

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.360
like possibly could, but I was actually in business school

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.960
so I couldn't cancel them all.

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:00.720
All finance courses, I'm done with that industry.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.160
I'm not going back.

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:04.800
So the vulnerable part for me was my whole family

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.560
is full of entrepreneurs.

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:09.840
And there was this franchise to do house painting.

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.080
And I genuinely was afraid that I wouldn't be good at it.

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:17.520
And I was like, wow, I really am afraid of failure.

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:20.400
It's very easy to avoid entrepreneurship.

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.800
But if your whole family's entrepreneurs,

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:27.800
and you go in and you aren't good, I was really afraid.

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.760
You're gonna have to face that failure

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:32.280
every time you meet your family.

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:37.280
Yes, and it's, our family are wonderful and everything,

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:43.000
but pretty much everyone's an entrepreneur.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.520
And of course, not everyone is perfect

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.440
and everyone's doing it successfully all the time.

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.680
But when you're young and you want to prove yourself,

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:55.800
it really was putting my heart on my sleeve.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:59.000
I started the business in this part of Toronto.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.720
And for the first, paint the houses in the summer,

01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:04.760
but you do all your sales before the summer.

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:09.400
And all the way till April, I was just not succeeding.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:11.400
And I was like, oh, I'm like, oh my God,

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:15.120
I'm just gonna fail.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.080
And I remember that.

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:20.880
I was like, my whole nervous system was like,

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:21.760
I'm a failure.

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:25.640
And I remember I had this general manager who,

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.880
he was like, Kim, you seem like you know what you're doing.

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:32.400
Why are you not making any sales?

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.960
And so he actually went with me on a few sales calls

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:39.200
and I was like, oh, he was great.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.320
You're doing this wrong, you're doing that wrong,

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:45.320
you're doing this wrong and change those three things.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:48.320
And it was like a watershed moment,

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.640
just like all of a sudden,

01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:55.280
and I just followed the instructions

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:57.040
of what this guy told me.

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.680
All of a sudden, every single sale I would make,

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:04.800
I was like, I can't believe that I,

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:09.360
it was really my lack of humility

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.120
to learn from someone else.

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.600
I was like, no, I'm gonna prove

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:16.120
that I can do this without your teachings.

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:20.720
And I was gonna fail.

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:23.520
So to you, that humility is essential

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:25.880
for the entrepreneur, especially young.

01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:29.640
I would say if we have an openness to learning,

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:31.600
which does require humility,

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:35.920
you course correct,

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:38.800
or you help get other people to help you course correct.

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.120
But it does start with humility,

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.200
because if you try and pretend you have all the answers,

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:45.560
you don't.

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:48.280
So you went from that to founding Zip2.

01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:50.560
That was an interesting time in the history of tech.

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.400
Yeah.

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:52.920
I mean, what was it like,

01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:57.920
you mentioned the first people to look at a map,

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:00.400
basically directions.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.520
Yeah, so mapping had been on the internet,

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.520
but vector-based mapping had not.

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:07.240
So that's the ability to zoom in or zoom out.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:11.080
And it's really data versus an image that comes across.

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:13.800
And we went to this company called Navtech,

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:15.880
my brother and I, and we just asked for the data.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:18.040
And they, this is Silicon Valley,

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.640
they wrote us one page letter that we had to sign

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:23.320
and said, here's all of our data,

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:25.600
that we own it, you don't own it,

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.280
but you can use it on the internet.

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:28.840
And if you ever make any money on it,

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:31.520
you have to call us, that was it.

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.360
Yeah.

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:33.360
And we're like, okay, that sounds great.

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.040
And so we put it up on the internet

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:38.360
and back in those days, it might take 60 to 120 seconds

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.600
to actually give you an answer back.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:45.480
But it was amazing, the door-to-door directions,

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.360
the ability to take a map and zoom in and zoom out.

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:52.560
We use these things 10 times a day now.

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:55.160
It was amazing.

01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:59.160
We were the first two humans to see it on the internet.

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:00.920
Like this stuff didn't even exist to the world.

01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:03.360
Like the Navtech was building it for Neverloss,

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:04.200
for Hertz Neverloss,

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:06.040
which would come out a few years later.

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:09.040
This was not something that people knew existed.

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:11.320
This was something we discovered that it existed.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:12.800
Everyone was like, let's put it on the internet

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.440
and share it with the world.

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:17.280
What did the two of you feel like to see that magic?

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:18.120
Did you know?

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.120
Amazing.

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:22.720
It was like, what?

01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:26.720
Like, I mean, the amazing just that it's cool,

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:29.920
but also that you could see the future

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:32.000
that this could transform.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.440
I don't think people understand,

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:38.480
before this moment,

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:41.720
you could not be told your directions.

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:43.920
You just could not.

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:45.160
Like today, we live in this world

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:47.000
where we're told our directions all the time.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.880
Before this moment, you could not be told your directions.

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:53.960
And all of a sudden, you could.

01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:56.480
It wasn't like a little thing.

01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:59.400
Yeah, there's a bunch of things that we,

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:01.240
once we have, we take it for granted.

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:05.080
And that takes like a day for people to transition.

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:05.920
Totally.

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:08.280
It's like, boom, oh, okay, cool.

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:10.360
Exactly, exactly.

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:11.760
And it's when you see,

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:14.920
maybe when you're one of the first humans to see that thing,

01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:15.960
you're like, holy shit.

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.680
Holy shit, this is going to be used by everyone

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.280
all the time forever.

01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:22.040
So Zip2 was a success.

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.280
I would say it was a success,

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:27.600
but it was also a very hard company to build.

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.560
And I mean it because

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:32.480
the internet in those days was a boom time.

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:34.640
We were being funded,

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:36.440
but you couldn't make any money.

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:40.760
And so it was actually really hard.

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:45.760
The constant outside criticism that we aren't for real.

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:47.080
This is not going to survive.

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:47.920
This is not going to,

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.880
and it started to feel that way.

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.720
We're like, wow, man, this is a,

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.720
we are doing something that is great,

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:56.720
that people are using.

01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:58.240
And we were top 100 website.

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:01.800
Most of our work was to focus like the New York Times.

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:04.560
So we're even much, much busier than that.

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:07.600
But there was just no money in it.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:09.880
Even today, go to Google Maps,

01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:10.720
there's no money in it.

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:15.720
It's just local search that is needed for everyone.

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:18.120
And it became an add-on to search.

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:19.200
But even remember in those days,

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.480
you couldn't make money at search either.

01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:23.920
No one had figured out AdWords or anything.

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:26.240
They didn't realize how big of a business this was.

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:28.480
But we all knew this was a thing.

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:30.360
And everyone was using it.

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.920
But didn't quite know how to make money.

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.240
Couldn't make money.

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.600
When we got acquired,

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:36.040
it was a bittersweet moment

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:39.560
because Compaq that owned AltaVista wanted to merge.

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:40.640
So that's sort of regular search

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:44.160
with the best search engine at the time pre-Google

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:46.600
with Zip2, which would be the best local search.

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:48.280
And it would be a Yahoo killer.

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:53.680
And the Compaq just wanted to make money

01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:56.200
by taking the company public.

01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:58.200
But they wouldn't give us any stock.

01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.040
They paid us cash return out actually very well for us,

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.520
but because the whole internet bubble burst.

01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:04.440
We didn't know that at the time.

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:05.280
And so it was bittersweet

01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:07.880
because they essentially wanted our company.

01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:10.280
And we were welcome to stay,

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:13.440
but you don't have to.

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.800
And that feeling was pretty,

01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:17.400
that was pretty rough feeling.

01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:22.520
But in retrospect, it opened the door to-

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:26.680
It set us up for an incredible platform

01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:28.520
to go do beautiful things.

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.720
You invested in x.com

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.360
that eventually merged with PayPal.

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.400
That's a fascinating story there.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:37.040
Also fascinating on many levels,

01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:41.680
including the fact that the current social media company,

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:44.120
formerly known as Twitter, is now called X.

01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:47.840
History has a rhyme to it.

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:50.960
It's kind of all hilarious in a certain kind of way.

01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:55.600
You invested in and helped sell

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:57.680
a lot of the initial products for Tesla.

01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:00.840
Yeah, I still sell on the board of Tesla.

01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:02.680
Tesla is 20 years now.

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:04.160
Isn't that amazing? 20 years.

01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:06.920
From the roadster, the initial roadster to-

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:09.360
I still have the first business plan.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:10.720
So I didn't join as a founder.

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:13.480
I joined as a founding board member.

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:15.800
I didn't write the business plan.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:18.040
I got to read it, and I still have that.

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.160
I still have it as a part of history.

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:22.320
Did you see the future at that time?

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:23.960
The company that Tesla is today,

01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:25.400
could you have possibly,

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:27.880
could you and Elon imagine it?

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:30.480
No, I certainly didn't.

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:35.480
What I saw in it was a real, for me personally,

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:40.640
I was really upset that General Motors

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:42.640
had killed their EV car.

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:45.480
There's even a movie called Who Killed the Electric Car?

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:50.480
And I knew that the physics of electric is perfectly fine.

01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:55.560
I mean, there's no reason why you couldn't use

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:57.480
an electric car to drive around.

01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:01.320
What resonated with me with the business plan was

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:03.520
take an electric motor,

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:06.120
which is really a high-performance motor,

01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:08.120
and put it in a sports car,

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:09.800
and sell it at a high price

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:11.560
as a way to enter into the market.

01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:13.360
Whereas what others had been doing,

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:14.840
at least General Motors had done,

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:18.160
is you put it into a really crummy car,

01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:20.160
and you sell it as a commuter vehicle

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.000
that doesn't really work that well,

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.120
and looks ugly as well.

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.120
They really did everything they could

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:26.760
to make that thing as ugly as sin.

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:30.000
And then I was like, okay, I get it.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.760
We're gonna take an appropriate technology

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:35.600
and put it in an appropriate car

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.200
so that when you have,

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:40.480
because electric motors, they have constant torque,

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:43.040
incredible power,

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.440
put it in a car that looks like a sports car.

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:49.480
So the idea was to put it in the Lotus Elise,

01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:50.520
redesign it a bit.

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:54.400
And even at that point, I was like,

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.600
this is theoretically good,

01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:59.000
so I'm gonna join and help build it.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.360
But I was not convinced that it would work,

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:03.440
because General Motors had done such a terrible job

01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:06.600
of making everyone think that these things are terrible.

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:08.160
But I was curious,

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:10.640
and the time that I fell in love with the company

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:12.760
and its mission was,

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:16.520
I was driving in what's called a mule,

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:21.520
where we take a car and we take the engine out

01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:24.600
and we put in an electric drivetrain.

01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:27.560
And I drove it, even the dashboards,

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:28.880
there's no dashboard, it's just like,

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:31.280
you got a steering wheel and it's just like wires

01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:33.280
and everything around.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:35.480
And I remember there's a street we were on

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:37.280
in the Bay Area called Bing Street,

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:40.240
and I was just like, no traffic.

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:42.720
So I'm just gonna drive this on the floor,

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:44.440
see what happens.

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:48.600
And it was a feeling I'd never experienced before.

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.600
Gasoline cars have an inertia to them,

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.560
so you go, vroom.

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:56.680
This is just, it was like being shot out of a cannon.

01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:58.160
And I was like, okay, this is gonna be real.

01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.240
It's a very spaceship-like feeling.

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:02.080
Yeah, it's like, whoa.

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:06.000
It's like the G4 that pulls you back.

01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:09.680
So I was like, okay, this is gonna be great.

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.000
This is gonna be an interesting,

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.440
we're gonna create something interesting here.

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:17.480
I think the real transformative thing for Tesla

01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:21.480
was the Model 3, when we were able to get the price down

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:23.360
for the world.

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:27.160
And that was also one of the most challenging periods

01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:28.000
for Tesla.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:28.960
And you were docked.

01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:31.760
We were borderline bankrupt like two or three times

01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:34.720
that year, and everyone was hating on us

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:36.360
about whether we'd get that done.

01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:41.480
The Model 3 today is incredibly affordable car,

01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:46.480
like a 300 bucks a month kind of lease and $3,000 down.

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:49.480
That's where you get the scale.

01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:51.720
That's where you get people who,

01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:52.680
and by the way, it's a great car.

01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:55.760
It's even a better Model 3 now than it was five years ago.

01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:59.360
We don't function the way car companies function, right?

01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:03.600
We function more like how an iPhone company or Apple works.

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:06.120
So our Model 3 today is,

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:07.520
this year is better than last year.

01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:10.560
It's like way better, and we just keep getting better.

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:13.480
And the software is a fundamental part of the car

01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:14.880
and the software keeps improving.

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:17.120
Exactly, and we can upload over the air.

01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:18.200
Which was one of the things

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.000
that people often acknowledge.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.240
It's the over-the-air updates.

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.120
It's like a revolutionary thing.

01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:27.200
It's not just the autopilot.

01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:28.680
To me, it's like the over-the-air updates

01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:30.520
is even bigger thing than the autopilot,

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:32.760
at least in this moment of history,

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:36.200
because you basically turn the car into the iPhone.

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:38.000
Exactly, it's an iPhone with wheels.

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.000
But actually, talking about autopilot,

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:42.920
like right after this interview,

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:45.360
I'm gonna go test out the latest Model 3.

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:46.960
You're gonna get driven around by a robot.

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:48.560
I'm gonna get driven around by the car.

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:52.280
I'm gonna say, I wanna go to this barbecue joint.

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.880
Take me there and park me there.

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:56.360
And I'm gonna see how it is.

01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:59.360
And this is the latest Model 3 that we have

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.680
out into production, anyone can buy it.

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:02.880
And it's super affordable.

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:03.840
And it's like, okay.

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:09.240
Full start driving is a journey.

01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:12.160
It's not like there's a destination.

01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:14.360
It's a journey forever.

01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:16.840
So let's see where we are on the journey today.

01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:18.360
And there's been a bit of a push and pull

01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:21.000
between you and Elon in terms of levels of optimism

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.400
about deadlines and so on, timelines,

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:26.120
about when we'll arrive at the destination.

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:28.200
I like that you said it's a journey.

01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:29.600
For Elon, there's a destination.

01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:31.040
Right, exactly.

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:34.920
That destination is tomorrow or yesterday.

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:36.760
I think that's a really good insight.

01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:39.960
I actually live with this concept of a growth mindset

01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:41.480
versus a fixed mindset.

01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:45.640
And it's a philosophical term where fixed mindset

01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:47.640
is about the destination.

01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:51.560
And growth mindset is about learning on the journey.

01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:56.440
And I think that I'm a happier person

01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:59.960
because I take that learning on the journey approach

01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:03.840
whereas it's really frustrating if you're always,

01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:06.040
it has to be about the destination every time.

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:07.560
The nice thing about destination,

01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:09.920
at least from my personal perspective

01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.760
as a programmer, engineer,

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:16.240
is it puts a little fire under you to get shit done.

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:19.040
If there's a clear deadline of a destination,

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:20.920
you feel the anxiety of that.

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:22.200
I would say that I still do that,

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:25.440
but I call those forcing functions instead of destinations

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:28.360
because you're just forcing people

01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:32.400
to crank on some code or cookbook or whatever

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:33.760
because you have a date.

01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:36.240
And sometimes there's a reason.

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:37.360
I mean, it's the 20th anniversary,

01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.680
you want to get the cookbook out.

01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:39.800
We have a reason.

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:42.400
We didn't make this up out of thin air.

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:45.200
And so yeah, that does push you.

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.000
But just because we have the cookbook

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.160
doesn't mean it's a destination.

01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:51.720
It means it was a forcing function to get it out there.

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:53.280
Now we're on the journey.

01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:56.440
Speaking of journeys, I have to ask you about SpaceX.

01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:00.600
The journey that all of humanity saw.

01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.240
Seriously, that is a book about a journey.

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:04.200
That is incredible.

01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:07.400
It's an interesting moment in the history of humanity

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:09.520
that perhaps hopefully will become

01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:11.880
a multi-planetary species.

01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:14.600
But SpaceX is also a company.

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:17.680
You invested in SpaceX, you were side by side

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:21.920
with Elon through the highs and the lows,

01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:24.160
through the lows and the highs.

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:28.040
So what were some memorable challenges?

01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:32.200
What were some low points from the history of SpaceX?

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:37.200
One of the hardest times in SpaceX was

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:41.320
we were in the mid-Pacific in Kwajalein

01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:43.600
and my brother had sold PayPal.

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:47.040
He'd done well financially, but in the rocket world,

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.080
that money goes away really quickly.

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:53.080
And we were in this military base in Kwajalein

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:57.920
and I think it was the second rocket that blew up.

01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:02.880
But we didn't have infinite resources.

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:04.080
I certainly didn't have the resources.

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:07.000
I mean, I'm there to support, brotherly support.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.960
But so every rocket launch was do or die.

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:14.440
And the first one had blown up.

01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:19.440
And so the second one, I think it was the second one,

01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:23.360
blew up and it was so depressing.

01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:25.640
It was just like, oh, and there's nowhere to go.

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:28.320
You're in the, there's no distraction.

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:30.800
You're just, you're on this military base.

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:31.680
You don't re-socialize.

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:33.680
So it's just, we were all together.

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:38.120
And I had gotten to know, for me, I'm not part of the team.

01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:40.600
I'm just there for emotional support or whatever,

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:41.880
because it's cool.

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:44.920
And so I got to know a couple of people locally

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:48.960
and got to know this one guy who had a mobile home,

01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:51.880
best view in the world, but it's just a mobile home

01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:54.800
next to, with a patch of grass next to it.

01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:57.640
And I was just desperate to find food

01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:59.000
that wasn't from the cafeteria,

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.960
because this is the worst food you can imagine.

01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:04.760
And so he showed, I met him and he showed me

01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:07.240
this little tiny little grocery store,

01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:09.160
which had a few things, like canned tomatoes.

01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:11.200
And this is, again, you're middle of nowhere,

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:13.600
so it's nothing fresh.

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:18.480
And I made this dish that was kind of a version of a,

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:21.080
like an Italian version of chili, just baked beans

01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:25.120
and sweating onions and then tomatoes.

01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:30.120
And it was a big pot of food, because it's a group of people.

01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:31.600
We didn't even have a table.

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:34.160
And we just put the big pot in the middle

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:35.480
and we had our little paper plates

01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:37.800
and took a scoop as we needed it.

01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:40.040
And it was, to me, the gathering place of,

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:44.440
like food brings people together in the most difficult times.

01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:46.280
And it was one of my favorite memories,

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:50.480
because I was able to bring my gift to this group

01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:55.480
of incredible people that their hearts were broken.

01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:59.360
And to sit there and share a meal

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:02.320
and feel the life kind of come back into us.

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:03.160
And by the end of the night,

01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:04.640
we're actually having a good time.

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:07.960
What a fascinating contrast of rock

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:11.480
is kind of representing the peak accomplishment

01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:13.520
of human beings as a society,

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.720
and then returning to the thing

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:18.880
that is the foundation of human society,

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:20.200
which is that communal experience.

01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:23.440
And then the communal, vulnerable connection,

01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:25.280
like we mentioned vulnerability earlier,

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:26.880
the most vulnerable place.

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.040
Actually, that's when you have

01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:29.680
some of your most beautiful meals.

01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:31.280
Yeah, the descendants of apes

01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:33.200
gathering around some baked beans

01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:36.480
after watching a rocket explode.

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:37.800
Yeah.

01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:40.560
What gives you hope about the future

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:42.680
of this whole thing we've got going on?

01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:43.520
Humanity.

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:45.760
If you look at how things have changed

01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:47.400
over the past, say, 50 years,

01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:50.360
you can clearly say, oh, wow,

01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:52.320
poverty rates have gone down,

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:55.480
infant mortality has gone down dramatically.

01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:57.320
All these things have gone down a lot.

01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:01.560
So if you look at it on a daily basis,

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:05.040
you can tell that life is very dramatic,

01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:08.600
whether it's some things blowing up on X

01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:11.760
or from the newspapers or whatever,

01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:14.200
and you can really get caught up into it.

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:18.320
But if you look back over the past few decades,

01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:20.280
things are getting better.

01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:21.560
And I mean at the fundamental level,

01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:23.760
like are less people hungry?

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.240
When there is war going on, of course,

01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:34.240
but are there less wars?

01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:35.080
Yes.

01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:38.200
And so I think that,

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:42.520
I think if we all just step back a little bit,

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:43.920
it's less about hope,

01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:47.840
it's more perspective and reflection.

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:52.560
And if I do see a problem,

01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:54.600
like in case of the obesity epidemic,

01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:56.160
I work really hard to help with that.

01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:58.800
I work with nonprofits called Big Green,

01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:01.880
and we work with 150 nonprofits around the country

01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:03.480
to help Americans grow food again,

01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:05.520
get connected to their food,

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:08.080
because I really believe growing food changes your life.

01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:10.400
And so, okay, let's go do that.

01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:13.120
So I'll help out where I think

01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:15.120
we really can make a difference,

01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.640
but if you step back a little,

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:18.600
things are actually getting better.

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:20.920
It's just a bumpy ride.

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:24.040
Yeah, and for those of us watching all of this,

01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:27.320
I think I would love to see more celebrating

01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:28.880
of the people that are helping,

01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:32.600
the people that have found their way of helping

01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:34.080
and just celebrating those people.

01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:36.160
Well, I would also, actually, it's a really nice point.

01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:39.040
I have learned that you really wanna celebrate

01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:43.040
your successes because even in the greater scheme of things,

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:44.160
I've learned this in the startup world

01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:47.600
where you're constantly facing death.

01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:50.240
You know, like just why should you even exist?

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:52.440
Do your customers want your product or whatever?

01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:54.200
And then something will happen where you're like,

01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:55.480
wow, we really nailed that.

01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:56.320
That's really great.

01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:57.480
We got a product released

01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:00.360
or got some good kudos from something.

01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:03.480
All right, everyone, we're gonna go celebrate.

01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:04.920
And actually, everyone's still like,

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:07.440
no, no, we've got all these other problems.

01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:09.840
Nope, we're gonna go celebrate

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:11.520
and then we'll go back to the problems.

01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:12.440
But if you don't do that,

01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:14.880
then it just starts building on this kind of,

01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:17.160
you never really get to celebrate.

01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:19.440
And be grateful.

01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:22.520
Well, I think this is a good time to go celebrate

01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:24.360
the very fact that we're alive today.

01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:27.360
We get to live and enjoy this incredible life,

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:29.800
the two of us and have this great conversation

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:32.360
and we'll get to celebrate over some scrambled eggs.

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:33.640
I'm gonna hold you to it.

01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:34.480
Beautiful.

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:36.080
Kimo, thank you so much for talking today.

01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:37.880
Thank you for having me.

01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:40.480

01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:48.040
from Anthony Bourdain.

01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:50.960
Your body is not a temple.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.960
It's an amusement park.

01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:55.200
Enjoy the ride.

01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:57.440

and hope to see you next time.

Thank you.
