00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
The following is a conversation with Jay Bhattacharya,

00:02.920 --> 00:05.200
professor of medicine, health policy,

00:05.200 --> 00:08.160
and economics at Stanford University.

00:08.160 --> 00:11.400
Please allow me to say a few words about lockdowns

00:11.400 --> 00:14.360
and the blinding destructive effects of arrogance

00:14.360 --> 00:19.360
on leadership, especially in the space of policy and politics.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.800
Jay Bhattacharya is the co-author

00:21.800 --> 00:24.440
of the now famous Great Barrington Declaration,

00:24.440 --> 00:27.840
a one-page document that in October 2020

00:27.840 --> 00:31.960
made a case against the effectiveness of lockdowns.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.560
Most of this podcast conversation

00:33.560 --> 00:36.320
is about the ideas related to this document.

00:36.320 --> 00:40.200
And so let me say a few things here about what troubles me.

00:41.520 --> 00:44.440
Those who advocate for lockdowns as a policy

00:44.440 --> 00:47.280
often ignore the quiet suffering of millions

00:47.280 --> 00:50.120
that it results in, which includes economic pain,

00:50.120 --> 00:52.520
loss of jobs that give meaning and pride

00:52.520 --> 00:54.160
in the face of uncertainty,

00:54.160 --> 00:57.240
the increase in suicide and suicidal ideation,

00:57.320 --> 01:00.840
and in general, the fear and anger that arises

01:00.840 --> 01:04.200
from the powerlessness forced onto the populace

01:04.200 --> 01:07.080
by the self-proclaimed elites and experts.

01:08.120 --> 01:11.600
Many folks whose job is unaffected by the lockdowns

01:11.600 --> 01:14.840
talk down to the masses about which path forward is right

01:14.840 --> 01:16.600
and which is wrong.

01:16.600 --> 01:20.040
What troubles me most is this very lack of empathy

01:20.040 --> 01:22.880
among the policymakers for the common man

01:22.880 --> 01:26.280
and in general for people unlike themselves.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.560
The landscape of suffering is vast

01:28.560 --> 01:30.200
and must be fully considered

01:30.200 --> 01:33.240
in calculating the response to the pandemic

01:33.240 --> 01:36.280
with humility and with rigorous,

01:36.280 --> 01:39.320
open-minded scientific debate.

01:39.320 --> 01:42.080
Jay and I talk about the email from Francis Collins

01:42.080 --> 01:46.440
to Anthony Fauci that called Jay and his two co-authors,

01:46.440 --> 01:48.760
fringe epidemiologists,

01:48.760 --> 01:51.560
and also called for a devastating published takedown

01:51.560 --> 01:53.240
of their ideas.

01:53.280 --> 01:57.160
These words from Francis broke my heart.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.640
I understand them.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.760
I can even steelman them,

02:00.760 --> 02:02.960
but nevertheless, on balance,

02:02.960 --> 02:06.720
they show to me a failure of leadership.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.080
Leadership in a pandemic is hard,

02:09.080 --> 02:12.640
which is why great leaders are remembered by history.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.440
They are rare.

02:14.440 --> 02:18.520
They stand out and they give me hope.

02:18.520 --> 02:21.600
Also, this whole mess inspires me

02:21.640 --> 02:24.720
on my small individual level to do the right thing

02:24.720 --> 02:28.240
in the face of conformity, despite the long odds.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.480
I talked to Francis Collins.

02:31.480 --> 02:34.200
I talked to Albert Burla, Pfizer CEO.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.960
I also talked and will continue to talk with people like Jay

02:37.960 --> 02:39.840
and other dissenting voices

02:39.840 --> 02:42.040
that challenge the mainstream narratives

02:42.040 --> 02:43.800
and those in the seats of power.

02:44.840 --> 02:47.920
I hope to highlight both the strengths and weaknesses

02:47.920 --> 02:50.680
in their ideas with respect and empathy,

02:50.680 --> 02:53.200
but also with guts and skill,

02:54.040 --> 02:57.840
the skill part I hope to improve on over time.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.760
And I do believe that conversation

03:00.760 --> 03:03.360
and an open mind is the way out of this.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.000
And finally, as I've said in the past,

03:07.000 --> 03:09.760
I value love and integrity

03:09.760 --> 03:13.000
far, far above money, fame, and power.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.080
Those latter three are all ephemeral.

03:16.080 --> 03:17.360
They slip through the fingers

03:17.360 --> 03:19.040
of anyone who tries to hold on

03:19.920 --> 03:23.280
and leave behind an empty shell of a human being.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.080
I prefer to die a man who lived by principles

03:27.080 --> 03:28.720
that nobody could shake

03:28.720 --> 03:31.600
and a man who added a bit of love to the world.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.840
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.280
To support it, please check out our sponsors

03:37.280 --> 03:38.480
in the description.

03:38.480 --> 03:42.200
And now here's my conversation with Jay Barakaria.

03:43.880 --> 03:48.480
To our best understanding today, how deadly is COVID?

03:48.520 --> 03:52.720
Do we have a good measure for this very question?

03:52.720 --> 03:55.200
So the best evidence for COVID,

03:55.200 --> 03:58.040
the deadliness of COVID comes from a whole series

03:58.040 --> 04:00.120
of seroprevalence studies.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.600
Seroprevalence studies are these studies

04:01.600 --> 04:04.880
of antibody prevalence in the population at large.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.000
I was part of the very first set of seroprevalence studies,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
one in Santa Clara County, one in LA County,

04:11.000 --> 04:14.280
and one with Major League Baseball around the US.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.200
If I may just pause you for a second,

04:17.200 --> 04:20.720
if people don't know what serology is in seroprevalence,

04:20.720 --> 04:23.080
it does sound like you say zero prevalence.

04:23.080 --> 04:26.040
It's not, it's sero and serology is antibodies.

04:26.040 --> 04:29.920
So it's a survey that counts the number of antibodies.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.160
Specific to COVID, yes.

04:31.160 --> 04:34.880
People that have antibodies specific to COVID,

04:34.880 --> 04:37.040
which perhaps shows an indication

04:37.040 --> 04:39.160
that they likely have had COVID,

04:39.160 --> 04:41.680
and therefore this is a way to study

04:41.680 --> 04:43.160
how many people in the population

04:43.160 --> 04:45.480
have been exposed to or have had COVID.

04:45.560 --> 04:46.840
Exactly, yeah, exactly.

04:46.840 --> 04:51.840
So the idea is that we don't know

04:51.840 --> 04:53.520
exactly the number of people with COVID

04:53.520 --> 04:56.480
just by counting the people that present themselves

04:56.480 --> 04:57.760
with symptoms of COVID.

04:57.760 --> 04:58.960
COVID has, it turns out,

04:58.960 --> 05:01.720
a very wide range of symptoms possible,

05:01.720 --> 05:04.120
ranging from no symptoms at all

05:04.120 --> 05:05.920
to this deadly viral pneumonia

05:05.920 --> 05:07.480
that's killed so many people.

05:07.480 --> 05:10.440
And the problem is if you just count the number of cases,

05:10.440 --> 05:12.320
the people who have very few symptoms

05:12.320 --> 05:14.560
often don't show up for testing.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.200
They're outside of the can of public health.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.960
And so it's really hard to know the answer to your question

05:21.960 --> 05:24.240
without understanding how many people are infected,

05:24.240 --> 05:26.360
because you can probably tell the number of deaths,

05:26.360 --> 05:28.440
that's even though there's some controversy over that.

05:28.440 --> 05:31.400
But that, so the numerator is possible,

05:31.400 --> 05:33.160
but the denominator is much harder.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.160
How much controversy is there about the death?

05:35.160 --> 05:37.000
We're gonna go on million tangents.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.200
Is that, okay, I have a million questions.

05:40.200 --> 05:43.600
So one, I love data so much,

05:43.600 --> 05:47.480
but I'm like almost tuned out paying attention to COVID data

05:47.480 --> 05:50.000
because I feel like I'm walking on shaky ground.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.400
I don't know who to trust.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.480
Maybe you can comment on different sources of data,

05:54.480 --> 05:56.040
different kinds of data.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.200
The death one, that seems like a really important one.

05:59.200 --> 06:03.320
Can we trust the reported deaths associated with COVID,

06:03.320 --> 06:06.080
or is it just a giant messy thing that mixed up?

06:06.080 --> 06:09.680
And then there's this kind of stories about hospitals

06:09.680 --> 06:14.360
being incentivized to report a death as COVID death.

06:14.360 --> 06:16.520
So there's some truth in some of that.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.120
Let me just talk about the incentives.

06:19.120 --> 06:23.280
So in the United States, we passed this CARES Act

06:23.280 --> 06:26.440
that was aimed at making sure hospital systems

06:26.440 --> 06:29.560
didn't go bankrupt in the early days of the pandemic.

06:29.560 --> 06:30.480
The couple of things they did,

06:30.480 --> 06:34.680
one was they provided incentives to treat COVID patients,

06:34.680 --> 06:38.840
tens of thousands of dollars extra per COVID patient.

06:39.120 --> 06:39.960
And the other thing they did

06:39.960 --> 06:42.480
is they gave a 20% bump to Medicare payments

06:42.480 --> 06:44.480
for elderly patients who are treated with COVID.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.440
The idea is that there's more expensive to treat them

06:46.440 --> 06:48.400
at I guess the early days.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.600
So that did provide an incentive

06:49.600 --> 06:52.600
to sort of have a lot of COVID patients in the hospital

06:52.600 --> 06:55.840
because your financial success of the hospital

06:55.840 --> 06:57.960
or at least lack of financial ruin

06:57.960 --> 07:00.640
depended on having many COVID patients.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.160
The other thing on the death certificates

07:02.160 --> 07:04.120
is that reporting of deaths is a separate issue.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.560
I don't know that there's a financial incentive there,

07:06.560 --> 07:08.920
but there is this sort of like complicated,

07:08.920 --> 07:11.280
you know, when you fill out a death certificate

07:11.280 --> 07:13.960
for a patient with a lot of conditions,

07:13.960 --> 07:15.440
like let's say a patient has diabetes,

07:15.440 --> 07:17.240
a patient that while that diabetes

07:17.240 --> 07:20.080
could lead to heart failure,

07:20.080 --> 07:22.120
you know, you have a heart attack, heart failure,

07:22.120 --> 07:26.480
your lungs fill up, then you get COVID and you die.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.240
So what do you write on the death certificate?

07:28.240 --> 07:29.560
Was it COVID that killed you?

07:29.560 --> 07:31.240
Was it the lungs filling up?

07:31.240 --> 07:32.880
Was it the heart failure?

07:32.880 --> 07:34.080
Was it the diabetes?

07:34.080 --> 07:36.760
It's really difficult to like disentangle.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.600
And I think a lot of times what's happened is

07:40.600 --> 07:44.880
people have like erred on the side of signing it as COVID.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.120
Now, what's the evidence of this?

07:46.120 --> 07:49.640
There's been a couple of audits of death certificates

07:49.640 --> 07:51.040
in places like Santa Clara County,

07:51.040 --> 07:54.240
where I live in Alameda County, California,

07:54.240 --> 07:56.600
where they carefully went through the death certificates

07:56.600 --> 07:57.960
and said, okay, is this reasonable to say

07:57.960 --> 08:00.880
this was actually COVID or it was COVID incidental?

08:00.880 --> 08:02.520
And they found that about 25%,

08:02.560 --> 08:06.320
20, 25% of the deaths were more likely incidental

08:06.320 --> 08:08.400
than directly due to COVID.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.480
I personally don't get too excited about this.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.280
I mean, it's a philosophical question, right?

08:12.280 --> 08:15.040
Like ultimately, what kills you?

08:16.200 --> 08:19.400
Which is an odd thing to say if you're not in medicine,

08:19.400 --> 08:23.320
but like really it's almost always multifactorial.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.160
It's not always just the bus hits you.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.200
The bus hits you, you get a brain bleed.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.720
Was the brain bleed that killed you?

08:28.720 --> 08:29.680
Would it have burst anyway?

08:29.680 --> 08:32.480
I mean, you know, the bus hits you, killed you, right?

08:33.480 --> 08:35.320
The way you die is a philosophical question,

08:35.320 --> 08:37.920
but it's also a sociological and psychological question

08:37.920 --> 08:41.560
because it seems like every single person

08:41.560 --> 08:44.280
who has passed away over the past couple of years,

08:44.280 --> 08:46.120
kind of the first question that comes to mind.

08:46.120 --> 08:46.960
Was it COVID?

08:46.960 --> 08:47.800
Was it COVID?

08:47.800 --> 08:49.440
Not just because you're trying to be political,

08:49.440 --> 08:50.280
but just in your mind.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.120
No, I think there's a psychological reason for this, right?

08:53.120 --> 08:56.560
So, you know, we spent the better part

08:56.560 --> 08:58.800
of at least a half century in the United States,

08:58.800 --> 09:02.400
not worried too much about infectious diseases.

09:03.240 --> 09:04.480
We had essentially conquered them.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.760
It was something that happens in far away places

09:06.760 --> 09:08.600
to other people.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.760
And that's true for much of the developed world.

09:10.760 --> 09:14.800
Life expectancy were going up for decades and decades.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.920
And for the first time in living memory,

09:16.920 --> 09:19.200
we have a disease that can kill us.

09:19.200 --> 09:22.200
I mean, I think we're effectively evolved to fear that.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.160
Like the panic centers of our brain,

09:24.160 --> 09:26.760
the lizard part of our brain takes over.

09:26.760 --> 09:30.600
And our central focus has been avoiding this one risk.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.400
It's not surprising that people,

09:32.400 --> 09:33.920
when they're filling out death certificates

09:33.920 --> 09:36.600
or thinking about what led to the death,

09:36.600 --> 09:38.960
this most salient thing that's in the front

09:38.960 --> 09:41.200
of everyone's brain would jump to the top.

09:42.320 --> 09:46.840
And we can't ignore this very deep psychological thing

09:46.840 --> 09:51.000
when we consider what people say on the internet,

09:51.000 --> 09:52.320
what people say to each other,

09:52.320 --> 09:55.720
what people write in scientific papers, everything.

09:55.760 --> 10:00.760
It feels like when COVID has been brought onto this world,

10:05.200 --> 10:09.360
everything changed in the way people feel about each other,

10:09.360 --> 10:11.800
just the way they communicate with each other.

10:11.800 --> 10:15.840
I think the level of emotion evolved.

10:15.840 --> 10:19.440
I think in many people, it brought out the worst in them.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.240
For sometimes short periods of time,

10:22.240 --> 10:24.240
and sometimes it was all therapeutic,

10:24.240 --> 10:27.760
like you were waiting to get out the darkest parts of you,

10:27.760 --> 10:30.280
just to say, if you're angry at something in this world,

10:30.280 --> 10:31.760
I'm going to say it now.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.080
And I think that's probably talking

10:34.080 --> 10:38.640
to some deep primal thing that fear we have

10:38.640 --> 10:41.840
for formalities of all different kinds.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.000
And then when that fear is aroused

10:44.000 --> 10:46.040
and all the deepest emotions,

10:46.040 --> 10:49.920
it's like a Freudian psychotherapy session,

10:49.920 --> 10:51.240
but across the world.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.800
That's something that psychologists are going to have

10:53.800 --> 10:56.480
a field day with for a generation, trying to understand.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.160
I mean, I think what you say is right,

10:59.160 --> 11:02.520
but piled on top of that is also this sort of,

11:04.200 --> 11:05.960
this impetus to empathy,

11:05.960 --> 11:08.640
to empathize compassion toward others,

11:08.640 --> 11:11.320
essentially militarized, right?

11:11.320 --> 11:16.320
So I'm protecting you by some actions.

11:16.520 --> 11:20.280
And those actions, if I don't do them,

11:20.280 --> 11:21.120
if you don't do them,

11:21.120 --> 11:24.400
well, that must mean you hate me.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.400
It's created this like social tension

11:26.400 --> 11:27.240
that I've never seen before.

11:27.240 --> 11:30.960
And we have started, we looked at each other

11:30.960 --> 11:35.640
as if we were just simply sources of germs,

11:35.640 --> 11:37.840
rather than people to get to know,

11:37.840 --> 11:41.200
people to enjoy, people to get to learn from.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.840
It colored basically almost every human interaction

11:44.840 --> 11:47.200
for every human on the planet.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.640
Yeah, the basic common humanity.

11:49.640 --> 11:52.720
It's like you can wear a mask, you can stand far away,

11:52.720 --> 11:54.720
but the love you have for each other

11:54.720 --> 11:56.240
when you're looking into each other's eyes,

11:56.240 --> 11:59.960
that was dissipating, and by region too.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.000
I've experienced having traveled quite a bit

12:02.000 --> 12:06.360
throughout this time, it was really sad.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.400
Even people that are really close together,

12:08.400 --> 12:11.600
just the way they stood, the way they looked at each other.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.320
And it made me feel for a moment

12:15.240 --> 12:17.440
that the fabric that connects all of us

12:17.440 --> 12:20.000
is more fragile than I thought.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.320
I mean, if you walk down the street,

12:21.320 --> 12:23.240
or if you did this during COVID,

12:23.240 --> 12:24.440
I'm sure you had this experience

12:24.440 --> 12:25.440
where you walk down the street,

12:25.440 --> 12:27.720
if you're not wearing a mask, or even if you are,

12:27.720 --> 12:30.280
people will jump off the sidewalk

12:30.280 --> 12:33.480
as you walk past them, as if you're poison.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.960
Even though the data are that COVID spreads

12:37.960 --> 12:41.440
indifferently outdoors, if at all, really outdoors.

12:41.440 --> 12:43.520
But it's not simply a biological,

12:43.520 --> 12:46.400
or infectious disease phenomenon, or epidemiological,

12:46.400 --> 12:50.720
it is a change in the way humans treated each other.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.880
I hope temporary.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.880
I do wanna say on the flip side of that,

12:54.880 --> 12:58.240
so I was mostly in Boston, Massachusetts

12:58.240 --> 13:01.480
when the pandemic broke out, I think that's where I was, yeah.

13:01.480 --> 13:04.360
And then I came here to Austin, Texas

13:04.360 --> 13:07.560
to visit my now good friend Joe Rogan,

13:07.560 --> 13:11.040
and he was the first person without pause,

13:11.040 --> 13:13.440
this wasn't a political statement, this was anything,

13:14.320 --> 13:17.720
and he just walked toward me and gave me a big hug,

13:17.720 --> 13:19.480
and said, it's great to see you.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.600
And I can't tell you how great it felt

13:21.600 --> 13:24.000
because I, in that moment, realized the absence

13:24.000 --> 13:25.480
of that connection back in Boston

13:25.480 --> 13:28.080
over just a couple of months.

13:28.080 --> 13:31.400
And it's, we'll talk about it more,

13:31.400 --> 13:35.480
but it's tragic to think about that distancing,

13:35.480 --> 13:38.200
that dissolution of common humanity at scale,

13:38.200 --> 13:40.680
what kind of impact it has on society.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.640
Congress, the board, political division,

13:43.640 --> 13:45.840
and just in the quiet of your own mind

13:45.840 --> 13:47.280
and the privacy of your own home,

13:47.280 --> 13:49.680
and the depression, the sadness, the loneliness,

13:49.680 --> 13:53.320
that at least the suicide and forget suicide,

13:53.320 --> 13:56.440
just low key suffering.

13:56.440 --> 13:59.960
Yeah, no, I think that's the suffering, that isolation.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.440
We're not meant to live alone.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.880
We're not meant to live apart from one another,

14:02.880 --> 14:04.920
and that's of course the ideology of lockdown

14:04.920 --> 14:08.440
is to make people live apart alone, isolated,

14:08.440 --> 14:10.300
spread diseases to each other, right?

14:10.300 --> 14:12.300
But we're not actually designed as a species

14:12.300 --> 14:13.220
to live that way.

14:14.140 --> 14:16.660
And that, what you're describing, I think,

14:16.660 --> 14:19.300
if everyone's honest with themselves have felt,

14:19.300 --> 14:22.060
especially in places where lockdowns have been

14:22.060 --> 14:23.980
sort of very militantly enforced,

14:23.980 --> 14:26.460
has felt deep into their core.

14:26.460 --> 14:29.220
Well, if I could just return to the question of deaths,

14:30.100 --> 14:31.620
you said that the data isn't perfect

14:31.620 --> 14:35.500
because we need these kind of seroprevalence surveys

14:35.500 --> 14:37.980
to understand how many cases there were

14:37.980 --> 14:40.000
to determine the rate of deaths.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.120
And we need to have a strong footing

14:42.120 --> 14:42.960
in the number of deaths.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.840
But if we assume that the number of deaths

14:45.840 --> 14:49.320
is approximately correct, like what's your sense,

14:49.320 --> 14:51.760
what kind of statements can we say

14:51.760 --> 14:54.120
about the deadliness of COVID

14:54.120 --> 14:55.960
across different demographics,

14:55.960 --> 14:58.880
maybe not in a political way or in the current way,

14:58.880 --> 15:03.400
but when history looks back at this moment of time,

15:03.400 --> 15:05.280
50 years from now, 100 years from now,

15:05.280 --> 15:09.560
the way we look at the pandemic 100 years ago,

15:09.560 --> 15:12.480
what will they say about the deadliness of COVID?

15:12.480 --> 15:14.160
I mean, I think the deadliness of COVID

15:14.160 --> 15:16.360
depends on not just the virus itself,

15:16.360 --> 15:18.480
but who it infects.

15:18.480 --> 15:19.920
So probably the most important thing

15:19.920 --> 15:21.800
about the deadliness of COVID

15:21.800 --> 15:26.280
is this steep age gradient in the mortality rate.

15:26.280 --> 15:29.040
So according to these seroprevalence studies

15:29.040 --> 15:31.680
that have been done, now hundreds of them,

15:32.720 --> 15:34.400
mostly from before vaccination,

15:34.400 --> 15:37.800
because vaccination also reduces the mortality risk of COVID.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.080
The seroprevalence studies suggest

15:40.080 --> 15:44.760
that the risk of death if you're, say, over the age of 70

15:44.760 --> 15:49.760
is very high, you know, 5% if you get COVID.

15:50.640 --> 15:54.080
If you're under the age of 70, it's lower, 0.05.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.400
But there's not a single sharp cutoff.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.560
It's more like, I have a rule of thumb that I use.

15:59.560 --> 16:03.440
So if you're 50, say, the infection fatality rate

16:03.440 --> 16:07.520
in COVID is 0.2%, according to the seroprevalence data,

16:07.520 --> 16:11.480
that means 99.8% survival if you're 50.

16:11.480 --> 16:14.600
And for every seven years of age above that, double it.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.040
Every seven years of age below that, have it.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.920
So a 57-year-old would have a 0.4%,

16:20.920 --> 16:24.680
mortality, a 64-year-old would have a 0.8%, and so on.

16:24.680 --> 16:27.640
And if you have a severe chronic disease like diabetes,

16:27.640 --> 16:29.520
or if you're morbidly obese,

16:29.520 --> 16:32.440
it's like adding seven years to your life.

16:32.480 --> 16:35.120
And this is for unvaccinated folks.

16:35.120 --> 16:39.000
This is unvaccinated before Delta also.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.760
Are there a lot of people that will be listening to this

16:41.760 --> 16:44.000
with PhDs at the end of their name

16:44.000 --> 16:47.520
that would disagree with the 99.8, would you say?

16:47.520 --> 16:50.000
So I think there's some disagreement over this.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.040
And the disagreement is about the quality

16:53.040 --> 16:56.320
of the seroprevalence studies that were conducted.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.960
So as I said earlier, I was a senior investigator

16:58.960 --> 17:00.640
in three different seroprevalence studies

17:00.680 --> 17:02.040
very early in the epidemic.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.200
I view them as very high-quality studies.

17:07.120 --> 17:10.760
In Santa Clara County, what we did is we used a test kit

17:12.880 --> 17:16.320
that we obtained from someone who works

17:16.320 --> 17:18.080
in Major League Baseball, actually.

17:18.080 --> 17:21.360
He ordered these test kits very early, March 2020,

17:21.360 --> 17:26.360
that very accurately measures antibodies in the bloodstream.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.960
This test kits were eventually were approved by the,

17:29.960 --> 17:34.960
had an EUA by the Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA

17:34.960 --> 17:36.720
sort of shortly after we did this.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.080
And it had a very low false positive rate.

17:39.080 --> 17:43.520
False positive means if you don't have these COVID antibodies

17:43.520 --> 17:46.760
in your bloodstream, the kit shows up positive anyways.

17:46.760 --> 17:50.160
That turns out to happen about 0.5% of the time.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.880
And based on studies, a very large number of studies

17:54.880 --> 17:58.800
looking at blood from 2018, you try it against this kit.

17:58.800 --> 18:02.840
And 0.5% of the time, 2018, there shouldn't be antibodies

18:02.840 --> 18:05.160
there, so for COVID, if it turns positive,

18:05.160 --> 18:07.480
it's a false positive, it's 0.5% of the time.

18:08.480 --> 18:12.680
And then, like a false negative rate, about 10%, 12%,

18:12.680 --> 18:15.280
something like that, I don't remember the exact number.

18:15.280 --> 18:17.440
But the false positive rate is an important thing there.

18:17.440 --> 18:20.960
So you have a population in March 2020 or April 2020

18:20.960 --> 18:23.480
with very low fraction of patients,

18:23.760 --> 18:26.560
fraction of patients having been exposed to COVID.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.760
You don't know how much, but low.

18:28.760 --> 18:31.960
Even a small false positive rate could end up

18:31.960 --> 18:33.480
biasing your study quite a bit.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.000
But there's a formula to adjust for that.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.520
You can adjust for the false positive rate,

18:37.520 --> 18:38.360
false negative rate.

18:38.360 --> 18:40.160
We did that adjustment.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.440
And those studies found in a community population,

18:43.440 --> 18:45.080
so leaving aside people in nursing homes

18:45.080 --> 18:47.080
who have a higher death rate from COVID,

18:48.640 --> 18:52.040
the death rate was 0.2% in Santa Clara County

18:52.080 --> 18:53.440
and in LA County.

18:53.440 --> 18:56.080
Across all age groups in a community,

18:56.080 --> 18:58.080
community meeting just like regular folks.

18:58.080 --> 19:00.160
Yeah, so that's actually a real important question too.

19:00.160 --> 19:02.200
So the Santa Clara study,

19:02.200 --> 19:04.400
we did this Facebook sampling scheme,

19:05.800 --> 19:08.040
which is, I mean, not the ideal thing,

19:08.040 --> 19:11.200
but it was very difficult to get a random sample

19:11.200 --> 19:16.200
during lockdown, where we put out an ad on Facebook

19:17.080 --> 19:19.880
soliciting people to volunteer for the study,

19:19.880 --> 19:22.280
a randomly selected set of people.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.160
We were hoping to get a random selection of people

19:24.160 --> 19:25.000
from Santa Clara County,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.640
but the people who tend to volunteer

19:27.640 --> 19:29.280
were from the richer parts of the county.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.360
I had Stanford professors writing,

19:31.360 --> 19:32.320
begging to be in the study

19:32.320 --> 19:34.240
because they wanted to know their antibody levels.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.240
So we did some adjustment for that.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.400
In LA County, we hired a firm

19:38.400 --> 19:42.560
that had a preexisting representative sample of LA County.

19:44.520 --> 19:46.080
But it didn't include nursing homes.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.240
It didn't include people in jail, things like that.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.800
Didn't include the homeless populations.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.840
So it's representative of a community dwelling population,

19:53.840 --> 19:54.960
both of those.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.920
And there we found that both in LA County

19:57.920 --> 20:00.360
and Santa Clara County in April, 2020,

20:00.360 --> 20:04.280
something like 40 to 50 times more infections

20:04.280 --> 20:06.760
than cases in both places.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.200
So for every case that had been reported

20:09.200 --> 20:10.920
to the public health authorities,

20:10.920 --> 20:15.320
we found 40 or 50 other infections,

20:15.320 --> 20:17.920
people with antibodies in their blood

20:17.960 --> 20:20.280
that suggested that they'd had COVID and recovered.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.600
So people were not reporting.

20:21.600 --> 20:25.040
They were severe, at least in those days, under reporting.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.960
Yeah, I mean, there was this testing problem.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.040
I mean, there weren't so many tests available.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.240
People didn't know.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.760
A lot of them, we asked a set of questions

20:32.760 --> 20:34.880
about the symptoms they'd faced.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.360
And most of them said they faced no symptoms,

20:36.360 --> 20:39.400
or 30, 40% of them said faced no symptoms.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.240
And I mean, even these days,

20:42.240 --> 20:44.280
how many people report that they get COVID,

20:44.280 --> 20:45.120
when they get COVID?

20:45.160 --> 20:49.160
Okay, have those numbers, that 0.2%,

20:49.160 --> 20:51.440
has that approximately held up over time?

20:51.440 --> 20:53.440
That is, so if Professor John Ioannidis,

20:53.440 --> 20:55.280
who's a colleague of mine at Stanford,

20:55.280 --> 20:56.920
is a world expert in meta-analysis,

20:56.920 --> 21:00.160
probably the most cited scientist on earth, I think,

21:00.160 --> 21:03.320
at least living, he did a meta-analysis

21:03.320 --> 21:06.520
of now 100 or more of these seroprevalence studies.

21:08.080 --> 21:11.640
And what he found was that that 0.2%

21:11.640 --> 21:13.880
is roughly the worldwide number.

21:13.920 --> 21:17.400
In fact, I think he cites this lower number, 0.15%,

21:17.400 --> 21:20.640
as the median infection fatality rate worldwide.

21:20.640 --> 21:21.920
So we did these studies,

21:21.920 --> 21:25.240
and it generated an enormous amount of blowback

21:25.240 --> 21:27.080
by people who thought that the infection fatality rate

21:27.080 --> 21:28.520
is much higher.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.480
And there's some controversy over the quality

21:30.480 --> 21:32.400
of some of the other studies that are done.

21:32.400 --> 21:35.520
And so there are some people who look at this same literature

21:35.520 --> 21:37.840
and say, well, the lower quality studies

21:37.840 --> 21:39.800
tend to have lower IFRs.

21:39.800 --> 21:40.640
The higher quality studies-

21:40.640 --> 21:41.480
IFR?

21:41.480 --> 21:43.400
Oh, infection fatality rate, I apologize.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.760
I do this in lectures, too, I apologize.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.640
And I'm going to rudely interrupt you

21:48.640 --> 21:51.680
and ask for the basics sometimes, if it's okay.

21:51.680 --> 21:52.520
No, of course.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.440
So these higher quality studies,

21:54.440 --> 21:56.640
they say, tend to produce higher IFR.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.440
But the problem is that

21:58.440 --> 22:00.880
if you want a global infection fatality rate,

22:00.880 --> 22:04.440
you need to get seroprevalence studies from everywhere,

22:04.440 --> 22:05.960
even in places that don't necessarily

22:05.960 --> 22:07.040
have the infrastructure set up

22:07.040 --> 22:09.640
to produce very, very high quality studies.

22:09.640 --> 22:12.680
And in poor places in the world,

22:12.760 --> 22:15.960
like places like Africa,

22:15.960 --> 22:18.320
the infection fatality rate is incredibly low.

22:20.080 --> 22:23.600
And in some richer places, like New York City,

22:23.600 --> 22:25.840
the infection fatality rate is much higher.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.840
There's a range of IFRs in a single number.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.680
This sometimes surprises people

22:32.680 --> 22:34.200
because they think, well, it's a virus.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.840
It should have the same properties no matter where it goes.

22:36.840 --> 22:41.840
But the virus kills or infects or hurts

22:42.160 --> 22:44.760
in interaction with the host.

22:44.760 --> 22:46.560
And the properties of both the host

22:46.560 --> 22:50.160
and the virus combine to produce the outcome.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.040
But you also mentioned the environment too.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.600
Well, I'm thinking mainly just about the person.

22:55.600 --> 22:56.640
Like if I'm going to think about it,

22:56.640 --> 22:58.840
like the most simplest way to think about it is age.

22:58.840 --> 23:01.240
Age is the single most important risk factor.

23:01.240 --> 23:06.000
So older places are going to have a higher IFR

23:06.000 --> 23:07.040
than younger places.

23:07.040 --> 23:10.160
Africa, 3% of Africa is over 65.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.640
So in some sense, it's not surprising

23:12.640 --> 23:15.400
that they have a low infection fatality rate.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.320
So that's one way you would explain the difference

23:17.320 --> 23:19.000
between Africa and New York City

23:19.000 --> 23:22.040
in terms of the fatality rate is the age, the average age.

23:22.040 --> 23:24.840
Yeah, and especially in the early days of the epidemic

23:24.840 --> 23:26.800
in New York City,

23:26.800 --> 23:31.120
the older populations living in nursing homes

23:31.120 --> 23:33.400
were differentially infected

23:33.400 --> 23:35.880
based on, because of policies that were adopted,

23:35.880 --> 23:39.080
to send COVID-infected patients back to nursing homes

23:39.120 --> 23:40.360
to keep hospitals empty.

23:40.360 --> 23:42.920
What do you mean by differentially infected?

23:42.920 --> 23:47.400
The policy that you adopt determines who is most exposed.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.520
Right, okay.

23:48.520 --> 23:49.360
So that's what I mean by differentially.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.840
The policy, it's the person that matters.

23:52.840 --> 23:56.160
I mean, it's not like the virus just kind of doesn't care.

23:56.160 --> 23:59.360
I mean, the policy determines the nature of the interaction.

23:59.360 --> 24:01.680
And there's also, I mean, there is some contribution

24:01.680 --> 24:04.920
from the environment, different regions

24:04.920 --> 24:08.320
have different proximity maybe of people interacting

24:08.360 --> 24:10.120
or the dynamics of the way they interact.

24:10.120 --> 24:10.960
Yeah, they have to generate.

24:10.960 --> 24:12.760
I'm like, if you have situations

24:12.760 --> 24:17.280
where there's lots of intergenerational interactions,

24:17.280 --> 24:19.520
then you have a very different risk profile

24:19.520 --> 24:22.920
than if you have societies where generations

24:22.920 --> 24:24.720
are more separate from one another.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.680
Okay, so let me just finish real fast about this.

24:27.680 --> 24:32.680
So you have, in New York, you have a population

24:32.840 --> 24:34.240
that was infected in the early days

24:34.240 --> 24:36.520
that was very likely going to die,

24:36.680 --> 24:40.120
but had a much higher likelihood of dying if infected.

24:40.120 --> 24:43.200
And so New York City had a higher IFR,

24:43.200 --> 24:48.200
especially in the early days than Africa has had.

24:49.240 --> 24:50.920
The other thing is treatment, right?

24:50.920 --> 24:52.920
So the treatments that we adopted

24:52.920 --> 24:54.040
in the early days of the epidemic,

24:54.040 --> 24:58.240
I think actually may have exacerbated the risk of death.

24:58.240 --> 25:00.080
Which treatments?

25:00.080 --> 25:03.160
Using ventilators, like the over-reliance on ventilators

25:03.160 --> 25:04.560
is what I'm primarily thinking of,

25:04.560 --> 25:06.520
but I can think of other things.

25:06.520 --> 25:09.600
But that also, we've learned over time

25:09.600 --> 25:12.720
how better to manage patients with the disease.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.720
So you have all those things combined.

25:14.720 --> 25:18.120
So that's where the controversy over this number is.

25:18.120 --> 25:23.120
I mean, New York City also is a central hub

25:23.680 --> 25:28.680
for those who tweet and those who write powerful stories

25:29.240 --> 25:31.760
and narratives in article form.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.720
And I remember those quite dramatic stories

25:34.720 --> 25:36.520
about sort of doctors in the hospitals

25:36.520 --> 25:37.400
and these kinds of things.

25:37.400 --> 25:40.520
I mean, there's very serious, very dramatic,

25:40.520 --> 25:44.840
very tragic deaths going on always in hospitals.

25:44.840 --> 25:49.840
Those stories, loved ones losing each other on a deathbed,

25:50.880 --> 25:52.360
that's always tragic.

25:52.360 --> 25:55.200
And you can always write a hell of a good story about that.

25:55.200 --> 25:58.200
And you should, about the loss of loved ones.

25:58.240 --> 26:01.880
But they were doing it pretty well, I would say,

26:01.880 --> 26:04.080
over this kind of dramatic deaths.

26:04.080 --> 26:09.080
And so in response to that, it's very unpleasant to hear,

26:09.280 --> 26:11.160
even to consider the possibility

26:11.160 --> 26:15.960
that the death rate is not as high as you might otherwise,

26:15.960 --> 26:17.560
as you might feel.

26:17.560 --> 26:20.640
Yeah, I was surprised by the reaction,

26:20.640 --> 26:23.880
both by regular people and also the scientific community

26:23.880 --> 26:25.680
in response to those studies,

26:25.680 --> 26:28.240
those early studies in April of 2020.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.640
To me, they were studies.

26:31.640 --> 26:33.640
I mean, they're the kinds of,

26:33.640 --> 26:35.600
not exactly the kinds of work I've worked on all my life,

26:35.600 --> 26:39.720
but kind of like the kind of, you write a paper

26:39.720 --> 26:42.880
and you get responses from your fellow scientists

26:42.880 --> 26:45.040
and you change the paper to improve it.

26:45.040 --> 26:47.280
You hopefully learn something from it.

26:47.280 --> 26:50.480
Well, but to push back, it's just a study,

26:50.480 --> 26:53.240
but there's some studies, and this is kind of interesting

26:53.240 --> 26:57.200
because I've received similar pushback on other topics.

26:59.400 --> 27:04.400
There's some studies that, if wrong,

27:04.400 --> 27:09.400
might have wide-ranging detrimental effects on society.

27:09.720 --> 27:12.000
So that's the way they would perceive the studies.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.920
If you say the death rate is lower

27:13.920 --> 27:16.480
and you end up, as you often do in science,

27:16.480 --> 27:19.920
realizing that nope, there was a flaw

27:19.920 --> 27:21.120
in the way the study was conducted

27:21.120 --> 27:23.880
or we're just not representative of a broader population

27:23.880 --> 27:26.040
and then you realize the death rate is much higher,

27:26.040 --> 27:29.600
that might be very damaging in people's view.

27:29.600 --> 27:33.520
So that's probably where the scientific community

27:33.520 --> 27:36.640
sort of just steel man the kind of response

27:36.640 --> 27:41.280
is that's where they felt like there's some findings

27:41.280 --> 27:45.880
where you better be damn sure before you kind of report them.

27:45.880 --> 27:47.400
Yeah, I mean, we were pretty sure we were right

27:47.400 --> 27:48.520
and it turns out we were right.

27:48.520 --> 27:53.520
So we released the Santa Clara study

27:54.160 --> 27:56.840
via this open science process

27:56.840 --> 27:59.280
and this server called Med Archive.

27:59.280 --> 28:02.280
It's designed for releasing studies

28:02.280 --> 28:03.920
that have not yet been peer reviewed

28:03.920 --> 28:06.560
in order to garner comment from the scientists

28:06.560 --> 28:07.640
before peer review.

28:08.560 --> 28:09.920
The LA County study,

28:09.920 --> 28:12.440
we went through this traditional peer review process

28:12.440 --> 28:13.680
and got it published in the Journal

28:13.680 --> 28:16.600
of American Medical Association sometime in like July,

28:16.600 --> 28:19.080
I think, I forget the date of 2020.

28:19.080 --> 28:22.040
The Santa Clara study released in April of 2020

28:22.040 --> 28:25.120
in this sort of working paper archive.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.200
The reason was that we felt we had an obligation,

28:28.200 --> 28:32.000
we had a result that we thought was quite important

28:32.000 --> 28:35.080
and we wanted to tell the scientific community about it

28:35.080 --> 28:36.760
and also tell the world about it

28:36.760 --> 28:38.160
and we wanted to get feedback.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.880
I mean, that's part of the purpose

28:39.880 --> 28:42.320
of sending it to these kinds of places.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.520
I think a lot of the problem is that

28:45.520 --> 28:47.880
when people think about published science,

28:47.880 --> 28:50.400
they think of it as automatically true.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.480
And if it goes through peer review,

28:51.480 --> 28:52.320
it's automatically true.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.320
If it hasn't gone through peer review,

28:53.320 --> 28:54.960
it's not automatically true.

28:54.960 --> 28:56.960
And especially in medicine,

28:56.960 --> 28:59.880
we're not used to having this access

28:59.880 --> 29:03.400
to pre-peer reviewed work.

29:03.400 --> 29:06.520
I mean, in economics actually, that's quite normal.

29:06.520 --> 29:07.960
It takes years to get something published.

29:07.960 --> 29:10.680
So there's a very active debate over

29:10.680 --> 29:13.480
or discussion about papers before they're peer reviewed

29:13.520 --> 29:16.280
in this sort of working paper way,

29:16.280 --> 29:20.440
much less normal or much newer in medicine.

29:20.440 --> 29:21.520
And so I think part of that,

29:21.520 --> 29:26.080
the perception about what process happens in open science

29:26.080 --> 29:29.360
when you release a study, that got people confused.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.480
And you're right, it was a very important result

29:31.480 --> 29:34.960
because we had just locked the world down in middle of March

29:36.080 --> 29:38.720
with I think catastrophic results.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.960
And if that study was right, if our study was right,

29:41.960 --> 29:44.040
that meant we'd made a mistake.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.840
And not because of the death rate was low.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.800
That's actually not the key thing there.

29:47.800 --> 29:51.600
The key thing is that we had adopted these policies,

29:51.600 --> 29:55.440
these test and trace policies, these lockdown policies

29:55.440 --> 30:00.040
aimed at suppressing the virus level to close to zero.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.880
That was essentially the idea.

30:01.880 --> 30:04.800
If we can just get the virus to go away,

30:04.800 --> 30:07.440
we won't have to ever worry about it again.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.360
The main problem with our result

30:09.360 --> 30:10.720
as far as that strategy was concerned

30:10.720 --> 30:11.600
wasn't the death rate.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.840
It was the 40 to 50 times more infections than cases.

30:14.840 --> 30:19.560
It was the 2.5% or 3% or 4% prevalence rate

30:19.560 --> 30:23.080
that we identified of the antibodies in the population.

30:23.080 --> 30:25.800
If that number is right, it's too late.

30:25.800 --> 30:28.120
The virus is not going to go to zero.

30:28.120 --> 30:30.280
And no matter how much we test and trace and isolate,

30:30.280 --> 30:32.920
we're not going to get the viral level down to zero.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.880
So we're gonna have to let the virus go through

30:36.880 --> 30:39.800
the entire population in some way or some other way.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.160
We can talk about that in a bit.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.480
That's the Great Barrington Declaration.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.280
You don't have to let the virus go through the population.

30:44.280 --> 30:45.920
You can shield preferentially.

30:47.200 --> 30:50.600
The policy we chose was to shield preferentially

30:50.600 --> 30:54.680
the laptop class, the set of people who could work from home

30:54.680 --> 30:56.760
without losing their job.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.440
And we did a very good job at protecting them.

30:59.440 --> 31:04.120
Well, let me take a small tangent.

31:04.120 --> 31:06.640
We're gonna jump around in time,

31:06.640 --> 31:09.280
which I think will be the best way to tell the story.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.600
So that was the beginning.

31:11.440 --> 31:13.920
Actually, can I go back one more thing for that?

31:13.920 --> 31:14.760
Because that's really important

31:14.760 --> 31:16.560
and I should have started with this.

31:17.520 --> 31:21.960
What led me to do those studies was a paper

31:21.960 --> 31:23.720
that I had remembered seeing

31:23.720 --> 31:26.400
from the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.320
This is where I had been much less active

31:28.320 --> 31:29.160
in writing about that.

31:29.160 --> 31:32.840
I had written like a paper or two about that in 2009.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.760
There was actually the same debate over the mortality rate

31:38.800 --> 31:41.680
except it unfolded over the course of three years,

31:41.680 --> 31:43.240
two or three years.

31:43.240 --> 31:48.000
The early studies of the mortality rate in H1N1

31:48.000 --> 31:52.240
counted the number of cases in the denominator,

31:52.240 --> 31:53.680
counted the number of deaths in the numerator.

31:53.680 --> 31:56.640
Cases meaning people identified as having H1N1

31:56.640 --> 31:59.440
showing up the doctor tested to have it.

32:00.480 --> 32:04.040
And the earliest estimates of the H1N1 mortality

32:04.040 --> 32:08.000
were like 4%, 3%, really, really high.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.320
Over the course of a couple of more years,

32:11.320 --> 32:12.960
a whole bunch of seroprevalence studies,

32:12.960 --> 32:15.840
seroprevalence studies of H1N1 flu came out

32:15.840 --> 32:20.280
and it turned out that there were 100 or more times

32:20.280 --> 32:22.240
of people infected per case.

32:23.320 --> 32:27.560
And so the mortality rate was actually something like 0.02%

32:27.560 --> 32:32.120
for H1N1, not the three, like a hundredfold difference.

32:32.120 --> 32:35.240
So this made you think, okay, it took us a couple

32:35.240 --> 32:37.280
of two or three years to discover the truth

32:37.280 --> 32:41.800
behind the actual infections for H1N1.

32:41.800 --> 32:45.040
And then what's the truth here and can we get there faster?

32:45.040 --> 32:47.640
Yeah, and it spreads in a similar way

32:47.640 --> 32:49.160
as the H1N1 flu did.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.640
I mean, it spreads via solidization,

32:51.640 --> 32:55.480
via person-to-person breathing kind of contact up.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.160
And maybe some by fomites,

32:57.160 --> 32:59.240
but it seems like that's less likely now.

32:59.240 --> 33:01.720
In any case, it seemed really important to me

33:01.720 --> 33:04.000
to speed up the process of having

33:04.000 --> 33:05.920
those seroprevalence studies

33:05.920 --> 33:09.040
so that we can better understand who was at risk

33:09.040 --> 33:12.240
and what the right strategy ought to be.

33:12.240 --> 33:17.240
This might be a good place to kind of compare influenza,

33:17.320 --> 33:21.000
the flu and COVID in the context of the discussion

33:21.000 --> 33:24.400
we just had, which is how deadly is COVID?

33:24.400 --> 33:27.880
So you mentioned COVID is a very particular kind of steepness

33:29.280 --> 33:32.160
where the X axis is age.

33:32.160 --> 33:34.440
So in that context,

33:34.440 --> 33:37.320
could you maybe compare influenza and COVID?

33:37.320 --> 33:41.520
Because a lot of people outside of the folks

33:41.520 --> 33:45.120
who suggested the lizards who run the world

33:45.120 --> 33:48.440
have completely fabricated and invented COVID.

33:48.440 --> 33:51.880
Outside of those folks, kind of the natural process

33:51.880 --> 33:54.640
by which you dismiss the threat of COVID is say,

33:54.640 --> 33:55.840
well, it's just like the flu.

33:55.840 --> 33:58.760
The flu is a very serious thing, actually.

33:58.760 --> 34:03.600
So in that comparison, where does COVID stand?

34:03.600 --> 34:04.960
Yeah, the flu is a very serious thing.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.960
It kills 50, 60,000 people a year,

34:07.960 --> 34:10.520
something I found out or depending on the particular strain

34:10.520 --> 34:12.760
that goes around, that's in the United States.

34:12.760 --> 34:15.080
The primary difference to me,

34:15.080 --> 34:15.920
there's lots of differences,

34:15.920 --> 34:17.360
but one of the most salient differences

34:17.360 --> 34:20.120
is the age gradient and mortality risk for the flu.

34:21.400 --> 34:26.400
So the flu is more deadly for two children than COVID is.

34:26.680 --> 34:28.480
There's no controversy about that.

34:29.320 --> 34:34.320
Children, thank God, have much less severe reactions

34:35.760 --> 34:39.960
to COVID infection than they do to flu infections.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.800
And rate of fatalities and stuff like that.

34:41.800 --> 34:42.840
Rate of fatality, all of that.

34:42.840 --> 34:43.960
I think you mentioned,

34:44.840 --> 34:47.080
I mean, it's interesting to maybe also comment on,

34:47.080 --> 34:48.800
I think in another conversation you mentioned,

34:48.800 --> 34:53.800
there's a U shape to the flu curve.

34:54.520 --> 34:56.920
So meaning like there's actually quite a large number

34:56.920 --> 34:59.200
of kids that die from flu.

34:59.200 --> 35:03.000
Yeah, I mean, the 1918 flu, the H1N1 flu,

35:03.000 --> 35:08.000
the Spanish flu in the US killed millions of younger people.

35:09.480 --> 35:12.360
And that is not the case with COVID.

35:13.480 --> 35:16.840
More than, I'm gonna get the number wrong,

35:16.840 --> 35:19.280
but something like 70, 80% of the deaths

35:19.280 --> 35:21.440
are people over the age of 60.

35:22.040 --> 35:24.960
We've talked about the fear the whole time, really.

35:24.960 --> 35:27.960
But my interaction with folks,

35:27.960 --> 35:30.280
now I wanna have a family, I wanna have kids,

35:30.280 --> 35:32.840
but I don't have that real firsthand experience.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.880
But my interaction with folks is at the core of fear

35:35.880 --> 35:39.920
that folks had is for their children.

35:39.920 --> 35:44.920
Like that somehow I don't wanna get infected

35:46.040 --> 35:47.880
because of the kids.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.760
Because God forbid something happens to the kids.

35:50.800 --> 35:54.520
And I think that, obviously that makes a lot of sense,

35:54.520 --> 35:57.480
this kind of the kids come first, no matter what,

35:57.480 --> 35:58.680
that's their own priority.

35:58.680 --> 36:02.000
But for this particular virus,

36:02.000 --> 36:05.880
that reasoning was not grounded in data, it seems like,

36:05.880 --> 36:08.600
or that emotion and feeling was not grounded in data.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.440
It wasn't.

36:09.440 --> 36:12.240
But at the same time, this is way more deadly than the flu,

36:12.240 --> 36:15.120
just overall, and especially to older people.

36:15.520 --> 36:16.480
Yes.

36:16.480 --> 36:17.320
Right?

36:17.320 --> 36:21.160
So the numbers, when the story is all said and done,

36:21.160 --> 36:24.040
COVID would take many more lives.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.040
Yeah.

36:25.040 --> 36:27.360
So, I mean, point two sounds like a small number,

36:27.360 --> 36:29.600
but it's not a small number worldwide.

36:29.600 --> 36:32.560
What do you think that number will be by the,

36:32.560 --> 36:35.400
that's not like me, but would we cross,

36:35.400 --> 36:37.240
I think it's in the United States,

36:37.240 --> 36:40.680
it's the way the deaths are currently reported,

36:40.680 --> 36:42.680
it's like 800,000, something like that.

36:42.680 --> 36:44.440
Do you think we'll cross a million?

36:44.480 --> 36:45.320
Seems likely.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.160
Yeah.

36:47.160 --> 36:49.080
Do you think it's something that might contain you

36:49.080 --> 36:50.360
with different variants?

36:50.360 --> 36:51.200
What?

36:51.200 --> 36:53.520
Well, I think, so we can talk about the end state of COVID.

36:53.520 --> 36:56.040
The end state of COVID is it's here forever.

36:56.040 --> 37:01.040
I think that there is good evidence of immunity

37:01.480 --> 37:05.720
after infection, such that you're protected

37:05.720 --> 37:09.480
both against reinfection and also against severe disease

37:09.480 --> 37:11.360
upon reinfection.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.920
So the second time you get it,

37:12.920 --> 37:14.680
it's not true for everyone, but for many people,

37:14.680 --> 37:16.360
the second time you get it will be milder,

37:16.360 --> 37:18.640
much milder than the first time you get it.

37:18.640 --> 37:22.720
With the long tail, like that lasts for a long time.

37:22.720 --> 37:23.560
Yeah.

37:23.560 --> 37:26.080
So just, there are studies that follow, of course,

37:26.080 --> 37:28.360
the people who were infected for a year,

37:28.360 --> 37:30.440
and the reinfection rate is something like

37:30.440 --> 37:32.720
somewhere between 0.3 and 1%.

37:32.720 --> 37:33.840
Yeah.

37:33.840 --> 37:36.240
And like a pretty fantastic study out of Italy

37:36.240 --> 37:38.800
has found that, there was one in Sweden, I think,

37:38.800 --> 37:41.840
there's a few studies that found similar things.

37:41.840 --> 37:46.840
And the reinfections tend to produce much milder disease,

37:46.960 --> 37:48.440
much less likely to end up in the hospital,

37:48.440 --> 37:50.120
much less likely to die.

37:50.120 --> 37:52.560
So what the end state of COVID is,

37:52.560 --> 37:54.600
it's circulating the population forever

37:54.600 --> 37:56.520
and you get it multiple times.

37:56.520 --> 37:57.680
Yeah.

37:57.680 --> 38:01.000
And then there's, I think, studies and discussions

38:01.000 --> 38:04.320
like the best protection would be to get it

38:04.320 --> 38:06.240
and then also to get vaccinated.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.760
And then a lot of people push back against that

38:08.760 --> 38:10.720
for the obvious reasons from both sides,

38:10.720 --> 38:13.080
because somehow the discourse has become

38:13.080 --> 38:14.840
less scientific and more political.

38:14.840 --> 38:16.560
Well, I think you want to,

38:16.560 --> 38:18.120
the first time you meet it

38:18.120 --> 38:20.280
is going to be the most deadly for you.

38:20.280 --> 38:21.560
And so the first time you meet it,

38:21.560 --> 38:22.800
it's just wise to be vaccinated.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.400
The vaccine reduces severe disease.

38:25.400 --> 38:26.240
Yeah.

38:26.240 --> 38:27.680
Well, we'll talk about the vaccine

38:27.680 --> 38:30.120
because I want to make sure I address it carefully

38:30.120 --> 38:32.720
and properly in full context.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.040
But yes, sort of to add to the context,

38:38.040 --> 38:40.360
a lot of the fascinating discussions we're having

38:41.000 --> 38:43.080
is in the early days of COVID

38:43.080 --> 38:46.480
and now for people who are unvaccinated.

38:46.480 --> 38:49.120
That's where the interesting story is.

38:49.120 --> 38:52.760
The policy story, the sociological story and so on.

38:52.760 --> 38:55.960
But let me go to something really fascinating

38:55.960 --> 38:57.960
just because of the people involved,

38:57.960 --> 38:59.280
the human beings involved

38:59.280 --> 39:03.040
and because of how deeply I care about science

39:03.040 --> 39:07.720
and also kindness, respect and love and human things.

39:07.760 --> 39:12.400
Francis Collins wrote a letter in October, 2020

39:12.400 --> 39:15.000
to Anthony Fauci, I think somebody else.

39:15.960 --> 39:19.840
I have the letter,

39:19.840 --> 39:22.600
oh, it's not a letter, email, I apologize.

39:22.600 --> 39:27.600
Hi Tony and Cliff, cgbdeclaration.org.

39:29.520 --> 39:32.960
This proposal, this is the Great Barrington Declaration

39:32.960 --> 39:34.960
that you're a co-author on.

39:34.960 --> 39:38.680
This proposal from the three fringe epidemiologists

39:38.680 --> 39:40.160
who met with the secretary

39:40.160 --> 39:42.240
seem to be getting a lot of attention

39:42.240 --> 39:45.960
and even a co-signature from Nobel Prize winner,

39:45.960 --> 39:48.720
Mike Levitt at Stanford.

39:48.720 --> 39:52.080
There needs to be a quick and devastating published

39:52.080 --> 39:54.800
takedown of its premises.

39:54.800 --> 39:58.000
I don't see anything like that online yet.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.040
Is it underway?

39:59.040 --> 40:00.480
Question mark, Francis.

40:00.480 --> 40:03.320
Francis Collins, director of the NIH,

40:03.360 --> 40:06.160
somebody I talked to on this podcast recently.

40:06.160 --> 40:09.680
Okay, a million questions I wanna ask,

40:09.680 --> 40:12.640
but first, how did that make you feel

40:12.640 --> 40:17.640
when you first saw this email come to light?

40:18.720 --> 40:20.960
When did it come to light?

40:20.960 --> 40:22.920
This week, actually, I think, or last week.

40:22.920 --> 40:26.440
Okay, so this is because of freedom of information,

40:26.440 --> 40:30.240
which by the way, sort of maybe,

40:30.240 --> 40:32.480
cause I do wanna add positive stuff

40:32.480 --> 40:34.120
on the side of Francis here.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.840
Boy, when I see stuff like that,

40:37.840 --> 40:41.040
I wonder if all my emails leaked.

40:41.040 --> 40:43.040
How much embarrassing stuff.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.120
Like I think I'm a good person,

40:45.120 --> 40:49.320
but I haven't read my old emails.

40:49.320 --> 40:53.280
Maybe, I'm pretty sure sometimes I could be an asshole.

40:53.280 --> 40:55.880
Well, I mean, look, he's a Christian and I'm a Christian.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.040
I'm supposed to forgive, right?

40:57.040 --> 41:00.040
I mean, I think he was looking at this

41:00.920 --> 41:02.560
Great Barrington Declaration

41:02.560 --> 41:05.280
as a political problem to be solved

41:05.280 --> 41:08.520
as opposed to a serious alternative approach

41:08.520 --> 41:10.000
to the epidemic.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.280
So maybe we'll talk about it in more detail,

41:12.280 --> 41:15.000
but just in case people are not familiar,

41:15.000 --> 41:18.800
Great Barrington Declaration was a document

41:18.800 --> 41:22.280
that you co-authored that basically argues

41:22.280 --> 41:26.240
against this idea of lockdown as a solution to COVID,

41:26.240 --> 41:29.400
and you propose another solution that we'll talk about.

41:29.440 --> 41:34.440
But the point is, it's not that dramatic of a document.

41:34.920 --> 41:36.960
It is just a document that criticizes

41:36.960 --> 41:38.920
one policy solution that was proposed.

41:38.920 --> 41:40.280
But it was the policy solution

41:40.280 --> 41:43.120
that had been put forward by Dr. Collins

41:43.120 --> 41:47.160
and by Tony Fauci and a few other scientists.

41:47.160 --> 41:48.960
I mean, I think a relatively small number

41:48.960 --> 41:50.800
of scientists and epidemiologists

41:50.800 --> 41:55.800
in charge of the advice given to governments worldwide.

41:56.680 --> 42:00.040
And it was a challenge to that policy

42:00.040 --> 42:02.960
that said that, look, there is an alternate path

42:02.960 --> 42:06.080
that the path we've chosen, this path of lockdown

42:06.080 --> 42:09.000
with an aim to suppress the virus to zero effectively,

42:09.000 --> 42:12.400
I mean, that was unstated, cannot work

42:12.400 --> 42:14.640
and is causing catastrophic harm

42:14.640 --> 42:17.840
to large numbers of poor and vulnerable people worldwide.

42:19.320 --> 42:23.520
We put this out in October 4th, I think of 2020,

42:23.520 --> 42:25.720
and it went viral.

42:26.560 --> 42:28.280
I mean, I've never actually been involved with anything

42:28.280 --> 42:31.600
like this, where I just put the document on the web

42:31.600 --> 42:34.280
and tens of thousands of doctors signed on,

42:34.280 --> 42:37.200
hundreds of thousands of regular people signed on.

42:37.200 --> 42:40.200
It really struck a chord of people,

42:40.200 --> 42:41.920
because I think even by October of 2020,

42:41.920 --> 42:45.160
people had this sense that there was something really wrong

42:45.160 --> 42:48.200
with the COVID policy that we'd been following.

42:48.200 --> 42:52.160
And they were looking for reasonable people

42:52.160 --> 42:53.000
to give an alternative.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.080
I mean, we're not arguing that COVID

42:55.080 --> 42:56.160
isn't a serious thing.

42:56.160 --> 42:57.640
I mean, it is a very serious thing.

42:57.640 --> 43:01.200
This is why we had a policy that aimed at addressing it.

43:03.320 --> 43:05.760
But we were saying that the policy we're following

43:05.760 --> 43:07.000
is not the right one.

43:08.280 --> 43:11.080
So how does a democratic government

43:11.080 --> 43:12.960
deal with that challenge?

43:14.000 --> 43:15.960
So to me, that, you asked me how I felt.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.720
I was actually, frankly, just,

43:17.720 --> 43:20.920
I suspected there had been some email exchanges like that,

43:20.920 --> 43:23.000
not necessarily from DeFrancis Collins,

43:23.200 --> 43:26.040
around the government around this time.

43:26.040 --> 43:29.040
I mean, I felt the full brunt of a propaganda campaign

43:30.280 --> 43:32.440
almost immediately after we published it,

43:32.440 --> 43:35.520
where newspapers mischaracterized it

43:35.520 --> 43:38.040
in the same way over and over and over again,

43:39.320 --> 43:41.600
and sought to characterize me

43:41.600 --> 43:45.320
as sort of a marginal fringe figure or whatnot.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.680
And Sunetra Gupta, Martin Kulldorf,

43:47.680 --> 43:50.400
or the tens of thousands of other people that signed it.

43:50.400 --> 43:53.600
I felt the brunt of that all year long.

43:53.600 --> 43:56.280
So to see this in black and white,

43:56.280 --> 43:58.720
in the handwriting essentially,

43:58.720 --> 44:01.080
I mean, the metaphorical handwriting of DeFrancis Collins

44:01.080 --> 44:02.360
was actually, frankly, a disappointment

44:02.360 --> 44:05.360
because I've looked up to him for years.

44:05.360 --> 44:07.400
Yeah, I've looked up to him as well.

44:09.560 --> 44:12.200
I mean, I look for the best in people

44:12.200 --> 44:15.360
and I still look up to him.

44:15.360 --> 44:17.320
What troubles me is several things.

44:17.320 --> 44:22.320
The reason I said about the asshole emails

44:23.240 --> 44:28.240
I send late at night is I can understand this email.

44:29.920 --> 44:33.320
It's fear, it's panic, not being sure.

44:34.160 --> 44:37.480
The fringe, three fringe epidemiologists.

44:37.480 --> 44:40.560
Plus Mike Levitt, who won a Nobel Prize, I mean.

44:40.560 --> 44:45.440
But using fringe, maybe in my private thoughts,

44:45.440 --> 44:47.920
I have said things like that about others,

44:47.920 --> 44:50.360
like a little bit too unkind.

44:50.360 --> 44:52.320
Like you don't really mean it.

44:52.320 --> 44:56.880
Now add to that, he recently, this week or whatever,

44:58.160 --> 45:00.280
doubled down on the fringe.

45:00.280 --> 45:02.520
This is really troubling to me.

45:02.520 --> 45:04.960
That, like I can excuse this email,

45:04.960 --> 45:07.880
but the arrogance there.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
DeFrancis, honestly, I mean,

45:11.000 --> 45:12.720
broke my heart a little bit there.

45:12.760 --> 45:16.160
This was an opportunity to like, especially at this stage,

45:16.160 --> 45:18.920
to say, just like I told him,

45:20.440 --> 45:23.760
to say I was wrong to use those words in that email.

45:23.760 --> 45:27.400
I was wrong to not be open to ideas.

45:27.400 --> 45:29.680
I still believe that this is not,

45:29.680 --> 45:33.760
like say, like actually argue with the proposal,

45:33.760 --> 45:36.280
with the policy, the proposed solution.

45:36.280 --> 45:40.920
Also, the devastating published,

45:41.200 --> 45:45.880
devastating takedown, devastating takedown.

45:45.880 --> 45:50.880
As you say, somebody who's sitting on billions of dollars

45:51.400 --> 45:54.680
that they're giving to scientists,

45:54.680 --> 45:58.120
some of whom are often not their best human beings

45:58.120 --> 46:00.680
because they're fighting with each other over money.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.480
Not being cognizant of the fact

46:02.480 --> 46:06.640
that you're challenging the integrity.

46:06.640 --> 46:08.840
You're corrupting the integrity of scientists

46:08.840 --> 46:10.840
by allocating them money.

46:11.760 --> 46:15.960
You're now playing with that by saying devastating takedown.

46:15.960 --> 46:19.600
Where do you think the published takedown will come from?

46:19.600 --> 46:21.560
It will come from those scientists

46:21.560 --> 46:23.280
to whom you're giving money.

46:23.280 --> 46:25.400
What kind of example would they give

46:25.400 --> 46:28.760
to the academic community that thrives on freedom?

46:28.760 --> 46:33.760
Like this is, I believe Francis Collins is a great man.

46:34.560 --> 46:36.680
One of the things I was troubled by

46:36.680 --> 46:38.920
is the negative response to him

46:38.920 --> 46:40.800
from people that don't understand

46:40.800 --> 46:44.040
the positive impact that NIH has had on society,

46:44.040 --> 46:45.880
how many people it's helped.

46:45.880 --> 46:49.960
But this is exactly the, so he's not just a scientist.

46:49.960 --> 46:53.440
He's not just a bureaucrat who distributes money.

46:53.440 --> 46:55.720
He's also a scientific leader

46:55.720 --> 46:58.760
that in difficult times we live in

46:58.760 --> 47:01.360
is supposed to inspire us with trust,

47:01.360 --> 47:04.840
with love, with the freedom of thought.

47:04.840 --> 47:08.680
He's supposed to, you know those fringe epidemiologists?

47:08.720 --> 47:10.920
Those are the heroes of science.

47:10.920 --> 47:13.440
When you look at the long arc of history,

47:13.440 --> 47:15.600
we love those people.

47:15.600 --> 47:18.480
We love ideas even when they get proven wrong.

47:18.480 --> 47:20.280
That's what always attracted me to science.

47:20.280 --> 47:23.760
Like somebody, the lone voice saying,

47:23.760 --> 47:27.040
oh no, the moon of Jupiter does move.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.560
Yeah.

47:28.560 --> 47:30.480
I mean, you know, but the funny thing is,

47:30.480 --> 47:32.800
you know, Galileo is saying something truly revolutionary.

47:32.800 --> 47:34.960
We were saying that what we proposed

47:34.960 --> 47:35.920
in the Great British Declaration

47:35.960 --> 47:38.920
was actually just the old pandemic plan.

47:38.920 --> 47:42.160
It wasn't anything really fundamentally novel.

47:43.120 --> 47:46.360
In fact, there were plans like this

47:46.360 --> 47:49.680
that lockdown scientists had written

47:49.680 --> 47:52.720
in late February, early March of 2020.

47:52.720 --> 47:54.440
So we were not saying anything radical.

47:54.440 --> 47:57.160
We were just calling for a debate effectively

47:57.160 --> 47:59.800
over the existing lockdown policy.

48:00.960 --> 48:02.720
And this is a disappointment,

48:02.720 --> 48:04.760
really truly a big disappointment

48:04.800 --> 48:08.400
because by doing this, you were absolutely right, Lex.

48:08.400 --> 48:12.280
He sent a signal to so many other scientists

48:12.280 --> 48:15.160
to just stay silent, even if you had reservations.

48:15.160 --> 48:17.520
Yeah, devastating takedown.

48:17.520 --> 48:21.280
The people, you know how many people wrote to me privately

48:21.280 --> 48:26.280
like Stanford, MIT, how amazing the conversation

48:26.280 --> 48:28.080
with Francis Collins was.

48:28.080 --> 48:31.840
There's a kind of admiration because,

48:31.840 --> 48:33.440
okay, how do I put it?

48:35.760 --> 48:38.400
A lot of people get into science

48:38.400 --> 48:40.440
because they wanna help the world.

48:40.440 --> 48:42.240
They get excited by the ideas

48:42.240 --> 48:46.160
and they really are working hard to help

48:46.160 --> 48:47.760
in whatever the discipline is.

48:47.760 --> 48:50.640
And then there is sources of funding

48:50.640 --> 48:53.280
which help you do help at a larger scale.

48:53.280 --> 48:58.200
So you admire the people that are distributing the money

48:58.200 --> 49:01.280
because they're often, at least on the surface,

49:01.280 --> 49:02.720
are really also good people.

49:02.800 --> 49:04.800
Oftentimes they're great scientists.

49:04.800 --> 49:06.840
So like, it's amazing.

49:06.840 --> 49:08.440
That's why I'm sort of,

49:10.640 --> 49:12.200
like sometimes people from outside

49:12.200 --> 49:14.520
think academia is broken some kind of way.

49:14.520 --> 49:16.320
No, it's a beautiful thing.

49:16.320 --> 49:17.960
It really is a beautiful thing.

49:17.960 --> 49:19.840
And that's why it's so deeply heartbreaking

49:19.840 --> 49:23.760
with this person is,

49:23.760 --> 49:26.440
I don't think this is malevolence.

49:26.440 --> 49:31.160
I think he's just incompetent at communication twice.

49:31.160 --> 49:33.640
I think there's also arrogance at the bottom of it too.

49:33.640 --> 49:34.480
So like-

49:34.480 --> 49:35.840
But all of us have arrogance at the bottom.

49:35.840 --> 49:38.000
Yes, but there's a particular kind of arrogance, right?

49:38.000 --> 49:40.800
So here it's the same kind of arrogance

49:40.800 --> 49:43.280
that you see when Tony Fauci gets on TV

49:43.280 --> 49:46.560
and says that if you criticize me,

49:46.560 --> 49:48.440
you're not simply criticizing a man,

49:48.440 --> 49:51.080
you're criticizing science itself, right?

49:51.080 --> 49:55.000
That is at the heart also of this email.

49:55.000 --> 49:59.480
The certainty that the policies that they were recommending,

49:59.480 --> 50:01.080
Collins and Fauci were recommending

50:01.080 --> 50:03.480
to the president of the United States were right.

50:03.480 --> 50:06.480
Not just right, but right so far right

50:06.480 --> 50:09.480
that any challenge whatsoever to it is dangerous.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.680
And I think that is really the heart of that email.

50:13.680 --> 50:18.680
It's this idea that my position is unchallengeable.

50:19.840 --> 50:21.680
Not to be completely,

50:21.680 --> 50:23.680
to be as charitable as I can be to this.

50:23.680 --> 50:25.720
You know, I believe they thought that.

50:25.720 --> 50:27.760
I believe some of them still think that.

50:28.160 --> 50:31.840
That there was only one true policy possible

50:31.840 --> 50:32.680
in response to COVID.

50:32.680 --> 50:35.120
Every other policy was immoral.

50:36.240 --> 50:37.840
And if you come from that position,

50:37.840 --> 50:39.160
then you write an email like that.

50:39.160 --> 50:42.600
You go on TV, you say effectively la science est moi, right?

50:42.600 --> 50:44.600
I mean, that is what happens

50:44.600 --> 50:47.720
when you have this sort of unchallengeable arrogance

50:47.720 --> 50:50.040
that the policy you're following is correct.

50:50.040 --> 50:52.240
I mean, when we wrote the Great Bank Declaration,

50:52.240 --> 50:55.720
what I was hoping for was a discussion

50:55.760 --> 50:57.760
about how to protect the vulnerable.

50:57.760 --> 51:00.040
I mean, that was the key idea to me in the whole thing

51:00.040 --> 51:03.000
was better protection of the older population

51:03.000 --> 51:04.960
who were really at really serious risk

51:04.960 --> 51:06.320
if infected with COVID.

51:06.320 --> 51:08.680
And we had been doing a very poor job, I thought,

51:08.680 --> 51:11.280
to date in many places in protecting the vulnerable.

51:12.360 --> 51:16.600
And what I wanted was a discussion by local public health

51:16.600 --> 51:18.840
about better methods, better policies

51:18.840 --> 51:20.200
to protect the vulnerable.

51:21.520 --> 51:25.200
So when we were met with instead

51:25.520 --> 51:28.360
a series of essentially propagandist lies about it.

51:28.360 --> 51:32.680
So for instance, I kept hearing from reporters in those days,

51:32.680 --> 51:34.400
why do you want to let the virus rip?

51:34.400 --> 51:35.720
Let it rip, let it rip.

51:35.720 --> 51:38.920
The words let it rip does not appear

51:38.920 --> 51:41.280
in the Great Barrington Declaration.

51:41.280 --> 51:43.680
The goal isn't to let the virus rip.

51:43.680 --> 51:46.040
The goal is to protect the vulnerable,

51:46.040 --> 51:50.360
to let society go as open schools and do other things

51:50.360 --> 51:52.160
that function as best it can

51:52.160 --> 51:53.320
in the midst of a terrible pandemic.

51:53.360 --> 51:56.920
Yes, but not let the virus rip

51:56.920 --> 51:59.600
where the most vulnerable aren't protected.

51:59.600 --> 52:01.240
The goal was to protect the vulnerable.

52:01.240 --> 52:02.600
So why let it rip?

52:02.600 --> 52:04.600
Because it was a propaganda term

52:04.600 --> 52:07.600
to hit the fear centers of people's brains.

52:07.600 --> 52:09.080
Oh, these people are immoral.

52:09.080 --> 52:10.720
They just want to let the virus go through society

52:10.720 --> 52:12.000
and hurt everybody.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.040
That was the idea.

52:14.040 --> 52:16.360
It was a way to preclude a discussion

52:16.360 --> 52:19.960
and preclude a debate about the existing policy.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.760
So this is an app called Clubhouse.

52:25.240 --> 52:29.480
I've gone back on it recently to practice Russian,

52:29.480 --> 52:33.120
unrelated for a few big Russian conversations coming up.

52:33.120 --> 52:34.480
Anyway, it's a great way to talk

52:34.480 --> 52:36.000
to regular people in Russian.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.440
But I also, I was nervous.

52:38.440 --> 52:40.800
I was preparing for a Pfizer CEO conversation

52:40.800 --> 52:42.560
and there was a vaccine room.

52:42.560 --> 52:47.560
And so I joined it and it was a pro-science room.

52:48.160 --> 52:50.080
It's like, these are like scientists

52:50.080 --> 52:52.720
that were calling each other pro-science.

52:52.720 --> 52:55.400
The whole thing was like theater to me.

52:55.400 --> 52:57.200
I mean, I haven't thoroughly researched,

52:57.200 --> 52:58.240
but looking at the resume,

52:58.240 --> 53:03.240
there were like pretty solid researchers and doctors

53:04.080 --> 53:09.080
and they were mocking everybody who was at all,

53:10.120 --> 53:11.840
I mean, it doesn't matter what they stood for,

53:11.840 --> 53:13.240
but they were just mocking people.

53:13.240 --> 53:15.880
And the arrogance was overwhelming.

53:15.920 --> 53:18.960
I had to shut off because I couldn't handle

53:18.960 --> 53:21.480
that human beings can be like this to each other.

53:21.480 --> 53:24.520
And then I went back just to double check,

53:24.520 --> 53:25.520
is this really happening?

53:25.520 --> 53:26.960
How many people are here?

53:26.960 --> 53:28.480
Is this theater?

53:28.480 --> 53:31.560
And then I asked to come on stage on Clubhouse

53:31.560 --> 53:32.720
to make a couple of comments.

53:32.720 --> 53:36.240
And then as I opened my mouth, I said, thank you so much.

53:36.240 --> 53:39.960
This is a great room, sort of the usual civil politeness,

53:39.960 --> 53:41.760
all that kind of stuff.

53:41.760 --> 53:46.760
And I said, I'm worried that the kind of arrogance

53:47.800 --> 53:51.560
with which things are being discussed here

53:51.560 --> 53:55.440
will further divide us, not unite us.

53:55.440 --> 54:00.440
And before I said even the unite us, further divide us,

54:00.480 --> 54:02.320
I was thrown off stage.

54:02.320 --> 54:04.360
Now, this isn't why I mentioned platform,

54:04.360 --> 54:09.360
but like I am like Lex Fridman, MIT also,

54:10.120 --> 54:12.880
which is something those people seem to sometimes care

54:12.880 --> 54:15.800
about the followers and stuff like that.

54:15.800 --> 54:18.240
Like, did you just do that?

54:18.240 --> 54:21.160
And then they said, enough of that nonsense.

54:21.160 --> 54:22.800
Enough of that nonsense.

54:22.800 --> 54:27.440
They said to me, enough of that nonsense.

54:27.440 --> 54:31.560
Somebody who is obviously interviewed, Francis Collins,

54:31.560 --> 54:35.120
is the Pfizer CEO.

54:35.120 --> 54:37.200
You're bringing on French epidemiologists also.

54:37.200 --> 54:38.040
So just.

54:38.040 --> 54:38.860
Yeah, exactly.

54:39.300 --> 54:40.780
But this broke my heart, the arrogance.

54:40.780 --> 54:43.220
And this is echoes of that arrogance

54:43.220 --> 54:44.580
is something you see in this email.

54:44.580 --> 54:47.020
And I really would love to have a million things

54:47.020 --> 54:48.660
to talk about to try to figure out

54:48.660 --> 54:50.460
how can we find a path forward?

54:50.460 --> 54:54.300
I think a lot of the problems we've seen

54:54.300 --> 54:57.100
in the discussion over COVID,

54:57.100 --> 54:59.180
especially in the scientific community,

54:59.180 --> 55:02.420
you know, there's two ways to look at science, I think,

55:02.420 --> 55:05.260
that have been competing with each other for a while now.

55:06.260 --> 55:08.780
One way, and this is the way that I view science

55:08.780 --> 55:10.900
and why I've always found it so attractive,

55:10.900 --> 55:14.180
is an invitation to a structured discussion

55:14.180 --> 55:18.060
where the discussion is tempered by evidence,

55:18.060 --> 55:22.020
by data, by reasoning and logic, right?

55:22.020 --> 55:23.940
So it's a dialectical process

55:23.940 --> 55:26.860
where if I believe A and you believe B,

55:26.860 --> 55:29.540
well, we talk about it.

55:29.540 --> 55:30.740
We come up with an experiment

55:30.740 --> 55:32.620
that distinguishes between the two.

55:32.620 --> 55:34.900
And while B turns out to be right,

55:35.420 --> 55:37.140
I'm all frustrated, but I buy you dinner,

55:37.140 --> 55:38.500
and I say, no, no, no, no, C.

55:38.500 --> 55:40.500
And then we go on from there, right?

55:40.500 --> 55:43.340
That's what science is at its best,

55:43.340 --> 55:46.460
is this process of using data in discussion.

55:46.460 --> 55:48.700
It's a human activity, right?

55:48.700 --> 55:53.700
To learn, to have the truth unfold itself before us.

55:54.220 --> 55:57.420
On the other hand, there's another way

55:57.420 --> 55:59.820
that people have used science or thought about science

55:59.820 --> 56:03.420
as truth in and of itself, right?

56:03.780 --> 56:07.060
If it's science, therefore it's true automatically.

56:07.060 --> 56:10.300
And what does the science say to do?

56:10.300 --> 56:12.260
Well, the science never says to do anything.

56:12.260 --> 56:13.740
The science says, here's what's true.

56:13.740 --> 56:17.820
And then we have to apply our human values to say,

56:17.820 --> 56:20.020
okay, well, if we do this,

56:20.020 --> 56:21.860
well, then this is likely to happen.

56:21.860 --> 56:23.100
That's what the science says.

56:23.100 --> 56:25.060
If we do that, then that is likely to happen.

56:25.060 --> 56:27.500
Well, we'd rather have this than that, right?

56:27.500 --> 56:29.420
But the science doesn't tell us

56:29.420 --> 56:30.260
that we'd rather have this than that.

56:30.260 --> 56:31.700
It's our human values that tell us

56:31.700 --> 56:32.580
that we'd rather have this than that.

56:32.580 --> 56:35.140
Science plays a role, but it's not the only thing.

56:36.060 --> 56:36.900
It's not the only role.

56:36.900 --> 56:40.140
It helps us understand the constraints we face,

56:40.140 --> 56:41.620
but it doesn't tell us what to do

56:41.620 --> 56:43.260
in face of those constraints.

56:43.260 --> 56:45.620
But underneath it, at the individual level,

56:45.620 --> 56:46.860
at the institutional level,

56:46.860 --> 56:51.860
it seems like arrogance is really destructive.

56:52.660 --> 56:55.820
So the flip side of that, the productive thing is humility.

56:55.820 --> 57:00.820
So sort of always not being sure that you're right

57:03.060 --> 57:05.140
This is actually kind of a,

57:05.140 --> 57:07.740
Stuart Russell talks about this for AI research.

57:07.740 --> 57:09.500
How do you make sure that AI,

57:09.500 --> 57:11.340
super intelligent AI doesn't destroy us?

57:11.340 --> 57:15.380
You built in a sort of module within it

57:15.380 --> 57:18.580
that it always doubts its actions.

57:18.580 --> 57:20.140
Like, it's not sure.

57:20.140 --> 57:23.180
Like, I know it says I'm supposed to destroy all humans,

57:23.180 --> 57:24.820
but maybe I'm wrong.

57:24.820 --> 57:27.860
And that maybe I'm wrong is essential for progress

57:27.860 --> 57:30.860
for actually doing in the long arc of history,

57:30.860 --> 57:31.780
not the perfect thing,

57:31.780 --> 57:33.460
but better and better and better and better.

57:33.460 --> 57:37.860
I mean, the question I have here for you is this,

57:37.860 --> 57:41.940
this email so clearly captures some maybe echo,

57:41.940 --> 57:44.220
but maybe a core to the problem.

57:44.220 --> 57:47.020
Do you put responsibility of this email,

57:47.020 --> 57:49.900
of the shortcomings and failures

57:49.900 --> 57:52.060
on individuals or institutions?

57:52.060 --> 57:53.700
Is this Francis Collins, Anthony?

57:53.700 --> 57:55.340
No, this is an institutional failure, right?

57:55.340 --> 57:59.180
So the NIH, so I've had two decades of NIH funding.

57:59.180 --> 58:01.220
I've sat on NIH review panels.

58:01.220 --> 58:03.820
The purpose of the NIH is what you said earlier, Lex.

58:03.820 --> 58:08.140
The purpose of the NIH is to support the work of scientists.

58:08.140 --> 58:10.660
To some extent, it's also to help scientists,

58:10.660 --> 58:12.820
to direct scientists to work on things

58:12.820 --> 58:14.540
that are very important for public health

58:14.540 --> 58:16.180
or for the health of the public.

58:17.220 --> 58:18.780
So, and the way you do that is you say,

58:18.780 --> 58:22.900
okay, we're gonna put $50 million on the research

58:22.900 --> 58:24.540
in Alzheimer's disease this year,

58:24.540 --> 58:27.300
or $70 million on HIV or whatever it is, right?

58:27.300 --> 58:30.940
And that pot of money, then scientists compete

58:30.940 --> 58:33.500
with each other for the best ideas to use it

58:33.500 --> 58:36.180
to address that problem.

58:36.180 --> 58:38.420
So it's essentially an endeavor

58:38.420 --> 58:40.380
to support the work of scientists.

58:40.380 --> 58:45.100
It is not in and of itself a policy organ.

58:45.100 --> 58:48.260
It doesn't say what public health policy should be.

58:49.220 --> 58:50.620
For that, you have the CDC.

58:52.540 --> 58:57.260
And what happened during the pandemic is that people,

58:58.220 --> 59:01.660
NIH were called upon to contribute

59:01.660 --> 59:03.740
to public health policymaking.

59:04.900 --> 59:06.900
And that created the conflict of interest

59:06.900 --> 59:09.060
you see in that email, right?

59:09.060 --> 59:12.900
So now you have the head of the NIH

59:12.900 --> 59:15.060
in effect saying to all scientists,

59:15.060 --> 59:17.820
you must agree with me in the policy

59:17.820 --> 59:22.100
that I've recommended, or else you're a fringe.

59:23.620 --> 59:25.340
That is a deep conflict of interest.

59:25.340 --> 59:27.500
It's deep because first, he's conflicted.

59:27.500 --> 59:31.660
He has this dual role as the head of the NIH,

59:31.660 --> 59:33.140
supporter of scientific funding,

59:33.140 --> 59:35.980
and then also inappropriately called

59:35.980 --> 59:39.500
to set or help set pandemic policy.

59:39.500 --> 59:40.940
That should never have happened.

59:40.940 --> 59:44.420
There should be a bright line between those two roles.

59:45.580 --> 59:47.220
Let me ask you about just Francis Collins.

59:47.220 --> 59:49.180
I don't know if you, I had a chance to talk

59:49.180 --> 59:50.020
to him on a podcast.

59:50.020 --> 59:51.180
I don't know if you maybe by chance

59:51.180 --> 59:52.980
gotten a chance to hear a few words.

59:52.980 --> 59:54.420
I heard some of it, yeah.

59:54.420 --> 59:56.780
Well, I have a kind of a question to that

59:56.780 --> 01:00:00.100
because a lot of people wrote to me

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:02.620
quite negative things about Francis Collins.

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:05.820
And like I said, I still believe he's a great man,

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:06.980
a great scientist.

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:13.460
One of the things when I talked to him off mic

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:14.820
about the vaccine,

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:21.300
the excitement he had about when we were recollecting,

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.580
when they first got in an inkling

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:26.940
that it's actually going to be possible to get a vaccine.

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:28.940
Just, he wasn't messaging,

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:31.300
just in the private or of our own conversation,

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:32.780
he was really excited.

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:34.220
And why was he excited?

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.540
Because he gets to help a lot of people.

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:40.580
This is a man that really wants to help people.

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:43.660
And there could be some institutional self delusion,

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.740
the arrogance, all those kinds of things

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.260
that lead to this kind of email.

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.380
But ultimately the goal is this will,

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.820
I don't think people quite realize this.

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:55.100
The reason he would call you a fringe epidemiologist,

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.700
the reason there needs to be a devastating

01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:58.780
published takedown,

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.900
he I believe really believes

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:05.420
that it could be very dangerous.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:09.420
And it's a lot of burden to carry on his shoulders

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.180
because like you said, in his role

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.500
where he defines some of the public policy,

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:19.060
depending on how he thinks about the world,

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.340
millions of people could die

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:22.860
because of one decision he make.

01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:25.180
And that's a lot of burden to walk with.

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.020
No, I think that's right.

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:29.460
I don't think that he has bad intentions.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.860
I think that he was basically put,

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:34.420
it was put or maybe put himself in a position

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:38.100
where this kind of conflict of interest

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:41.740
was going to create this kind of reaction.

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:44.580
The kind of humility that you're calling for

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:48.140
is almost impossible when you have that dual role

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:51.380
that you shouldn't have as funder of science

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.460
and also setter of scientific policy.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.500
I agree with everything you just said,

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.700
except the last part.

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:58.180
The humility is almost impossible.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.660
Humility is always difficult.

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:04.740
I think there's a huge incentive

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:06.700
for humility in that position.

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.500
Now look at history.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:13.500
Great leaders that have humility are popular as hell.

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.740
So if you like being popular,

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.700
if you like having impact, legacy,

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:22.260
these descendants of ape seem to care about legacy,

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:25.980
especially as they get older in these high positions.

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:28.940
I think the incentive for humility is pretty high.

01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:30.380
The thing is there's a lot

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:33.060
that he has to be proud of in his career.

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:36.300
The Human Genome Project wouldn't have happened without him.

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:39.500
And he is a great man and a great scientist.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.700
So it is tragic to me that his career

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.300
has ended in this particular way.

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:46.820
Can I ask you a question about

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:50.700
my podcast conversation with him?

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:53.220
By way of advice or maybe criticism,

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:56.260
there's a lot of people that wrote to me

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.220
kind words of support,

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.780
and a lot of people that wrote to me

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:03.340
respectful, constructive criticism.

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:06.180
How would you suggest to have conversations

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.820
with folks like that?

01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:11.020
And maybe, I mean,

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.900
because I have other conversations like this,

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:17.340
I was debating whether to talk to Anthony Fauci.

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:19.220
He wanted to talk.

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:22.820
And so what kind of conversation do you have?

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.620
And sorry to take us on a tangent,

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:27.300
but almost from an interview perspective

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:31.780
of how to inspire humility and inspire trust in science,

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:34.460
or maybe give hope that we know what the heck we're doing

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:35.700
and we're gonna figure this out.

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:40.700
I mean, I think I've been now interviewed by many people.

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:44.500
I think the style you have really works well, Lex.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.580
You have to,

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:49.020
because I don't think you're gonna be ever an attack dog

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.500
trying to go after somebody and force them

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:55.820
to admit that they were wrong or whatever.

01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:59.020
I mean, I also actually find that form of journalism

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:00.540
and podcasting really off-putting.

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.100
It's hard to watch.

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.140
Also, it's a whole lot of the tangent.

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.420
Is that actually effective?

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:06.260
I don't think so.

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:09.180
Do you wanna ask Hitler,

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.060
and I think about this a lot, actually interviewing Hitler.

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:11.900
I've been studying a lot

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:15.180
about the rise and fall of the Third Reich.

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:16.860
I think about interviewing Stalin.

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.220
I put myself in that mindset.

01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:22.740
How do you have conversations with people

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.340
to understand who they are,

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:28.260
so that not so you can sit there and yell at them,

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:29.380
but to understand who they are

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:32.460
so that you can inspire a very large number of people

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:34.260
to be the best version of themselves

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:36.260
and to avoid the mistakes of the past?

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:39.740
I believe that everyone that's involved in this debate

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:41.220
has good intentions.

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:44.100
They're coming at it from their points of view.

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:48.220
They have their weaknesses,

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:50.860
and if you can paint a picture in your questioning

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:55.220
by sympathetic questioning of those strengths and weaknesses

01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:57.380
and their point of view, you've done a service.

01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:00.220
That's really all I personally like to see

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.140
in those kinds of interviews.

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:06.700
I don't think a gotcha moment is really the key thing there.

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:09.340
The key thing is understanding where they're coming from,

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.700
understanding their thinking,

01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:12.340
understanding the constraints they faced

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.140
and how do they manage them.

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:15.700
That's gonna provide a much,

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.100
I mean, to me, that's what I look for

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.860
when I listen to podcasts like yours,

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:24.660
is an understanding of that person and the moment

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.260
and how they dealt with it.

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:30.580
I mean, I guess the hope is to discover in a sympathetic way

01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:33.820
a flaw in a person's thinking together.

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:35.980
Like, as opposed to discovering

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:39.500
the positive thing together, you discover the thing.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.860
Well, I didn't really think about that.

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:42.940
Yeah, I mean, that's how science is, right?

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:45.220
That's why I think we find it so attractive,

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:49.780
is this, I like it when a student shows me

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:52.180
I'm thinking incorrectly, right?

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.980
I'm really grateful to that student

01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:57.300
because now I have an opportunity to change my mind about it

01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:58.980
and then start thinking even more correctly.

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:02.540
I mean, and there are moments when,

01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:05.020
I mean, like this is probably a good time to say

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.900
like what I think I got wrong during the pandemic, right?

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:09.380
So like, for instance, you said,

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:12.580
Francis Collins had a moment when he learned

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:16.620
that there was quite possible to get a vaccine going.

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:19.060
He must've learned that quite early.

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:21.500
And I didn't learn that early.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:25.060
I mean, I didn't know, in March of 2020,

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:28.140
in my experience with vaccine development,

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:32.100
I thought it would take a decade or more to get a vaccine.

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:34.260
That was wrong, right?

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:38.060
I didn't, and I was so happy

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:40.460
when I started to see the preliminary numbers

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:42.460
in the Pfizer trial

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.980
that strongly suggested it was going to work.

01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:47.220
Yeah.

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.740
And I mean, like very few times in my life

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:50.940
I'm so happy to be wrong.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:54.380
And it changes kind of,

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:56.460
I think I've heard you mention that a lockdown

01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:58.500
is still a bad idea

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:01.820
unless the vaccine comes out in like tomorrow.

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:05.340
There's still like suffering and economic pain.

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:07.140
All kinds of pain can still happen

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:12.140
in even just a scale of weeks versus months.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.140
Yeah.

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:16.340
Well, let's talk about the vaccine.

01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:18.980
What are your thoughts on the safety and efficacy

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:22.940
of COVID vaccines at the individual and the societal level?

01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:26.300
So for the vaccine safety data,

01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:30.140
it's actually challenging to convey to the public

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:31.500
how this is normally done.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:34.460
Like normally you would do this in the context of the trial.

01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:36.100
You'd have a long trial

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.740
with relatively large numbers of people.

01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:40.140
You'd follow them over a long time

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.420
and the trial will give you some indication

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:43.780
of the safety of the vaccine.

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:44.620
And it did.

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:49.660
But the trial, the way it was constructed,

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:52.820
when it came out that it was protective against COVID,

01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:55.260
it was no longer ethical to have a placebo arm.

01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:58.300
And so that placebo arm was vaccinated,

01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.220
large part of it.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:02.300
And so that meant that from the trial,

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:05.220
you were not going to be able to get data

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:07.740
on the long-term safety profiles of the vaccine.

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:11.220
And also the other thing about trials,

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.020
there's tens of thousands of people enrolled.

01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:14.500
That's still not enough to get

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:18.980
when you deploy a vaccine at population scale,

01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:22.980
you're gonna see things that weren't in the trial, guaranteed.

01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:24.660
Populations of people that weren't represented

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:27.700
well in the trial are gonna be given the vaccine

01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:30.020
and then they're gonna have things that happened to them

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:32.300
that you didn't anticipate.

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:35.140
So I wasn't surprised when people

01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:37.540
were a little bit skeptical when the trial was done

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:38.620
about the safety profile,

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:40.740
just the way the nature of the thing was gonna make it

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:42.220
so that it was gonna be hard

01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:45.140
to get a complete picture from the trials itself.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:47.580
And the trial showed they were pretty safe

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:51.300
and quite effective at preventing both you

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:52.700
from getting COVID.

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:54.900
I think the main endpoint of the trial itself

01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:56.260
was symptomatic COVID.

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.300
So that was like, that was,

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:03.620
I mean, it was really to me

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:06.580
like about as amazing achievement as anything,

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:08.580
organizing a trial of that scale

01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:10.700
and running it so quickly.

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:14.380
And the final results being so surprisingly high.

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:15.460
So good, right?

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:20.740
But the problem then was normally

01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:23.020
it would take a long time.

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:25.460
The FDA would tell Pfizer to go back

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:27.140
and try it in this subgroup.

01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:28.660
They'd work more on dosing.

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:31.060
They do all these kinds of things

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:31.980
that kind of didn't,

01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:33.340
we really didn't have time for

01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:34.820
in the middle of the pandemic, right?

01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:38.620
So you have a basis for approval

01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:42.380
that it's less full than normally you would have

01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:44.100
for a population scale vaccine.

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.380
But the results were good.

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:47.540
The results looked really good.

01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:49.980
And actually I should say for the most part

01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:52.980
that's been born out when we've given the vaccine at scale

01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:56.740
in terms of protection against severe disease, right?

01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:59.340
So people who have got the vaccine

01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:01.220
for a very long time after they've had

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.660
for the full vaccination

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:05.740
have had great protection against going,

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:08.460
being hospitalized and dying if they get COVID.

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:11.460
Let's separate, because this seems to be,

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:16.060
there's critics of both categories, but different.

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:20.980
Kids and kids and old, not older people,

01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:23.900
like let's say five years old and above

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:26.100
or something like that, or 13 years old and above.

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:31.100
So for those, it seems like the reduction

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:35.980
of the rate of fatalities and serious illness

01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:38.300
seems to be something like 10X.

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:42.340
I mean, for older people, it is a godsend, this vaccine.

01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:47.020
It transforms the problem of focus protection

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:49.220
from something that's quite challenging,

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:50.820
possible I believe, but quite challenging

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:53.180
to something that's much, much more manageable.

01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:56.180
Because the vaccine in and of itself when deployed

01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:58.820
in older populations is a form of focus protection.

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.620
Yes, well, by the way,

01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:04.340
we'll talk about the focus protection in one segment

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:05.740
because it's such a brilliant idea

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:08.500
for this pandemic of future pandemics.

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:11.740
I thought the sociological, psychological discussion

01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:14.060
about the letter from Francis Collins is,

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:17.420
because it was so recent, it has been so troubling to me,

01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:19.420
so I'm glad we talked about that first.

01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:25.260
But so there seems to be, the vaccines work to reduce deaths

01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:31.060
and that has especially the most transformative effects

01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:32.140
for the older folks.

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:33.340
Yeah, so can I, let me give you,

01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:35.140
I've told you one thing that I got wrong in the pandemic.

01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:35.980
Let me tell you the second thing

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:38.300
I got wrong for sure in the pandemic.

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:43.060
In January of this year, 2021,

01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:46.660
I thought that the vaccines would stop infection.

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:48.940
Yes.

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:51.700
Right, it would make it so that you were much less likely

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:55.300
to be infected at all because the antibodies

01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:56.500
that were produced by the vaccines

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.260
looked like they were neutralizing antibodies

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.260
that would essentially block you from being infected at all.

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:06.260
That turned out to be wrong, right?

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:11.220
I think, and it became clear as data came out from Israel,

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:12.500
which vaccinated very early,

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.820
that they were seeing surges of infection,

01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:17.780
even in a very highly vaccinated population,

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:21.740
that the vaccine does not stop infection.

01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:24.180
So you're a used car salesman

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:26.140
and you were selling the vaccine

01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:28.420
and the features you thought a vaccine would have,

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.060
I mean, I have a similar kind of sense

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:31.620
when the vaccine came out.

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.380
Vaccine would reduce,

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:37.460
if you somehow were able to get it,

01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:40.260
it would reduce rate of death and all those kinds of things,

01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:44.220
but it would also reduce the chance of you getting it.

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:45.700
And if you do get it,

01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:48.820
the chance of you transmitting it to somebody else.

01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:52.140
And it turns out that those latter two things

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:55.780
are not as definitive or in fact,

01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:57.820
I mean, I don't know to what degree they're not.

01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.220
I think it's a little complicated

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:01.500
because I think the first two or three months

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:04.260
after you're fully vaccinated, after the second dose,

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:10.140
you have 60, 70% efficacy peak against infection.

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:12.700
So that, which is pretty good, I mean, right?

01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:16.740
But by six, seven, eight months, that drops to 20%.

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:18.300
Some places, some studies,

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:19.660
like there's a study out of Sweden

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:21.740
that suggested it might even drop to zero.

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:24.780
And then you're also infectious for some period of time

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:27.380
if you do get it, even though you're vaccinated.

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.820
Although there seems to be lucidated

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:31.860
that the period of time you're infectious is shorter.

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:36.540
But the infectivity per day is about as high.

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:39.380
So you still, the point is that the vaccine

01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:41.860
might reduce some risk of infecting others,

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:44.860
but it's not a categorical difference.

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:49.700
So it's not safe to be in the presence

01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.260
of just vaccinated people.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.700
You can still get infected.

01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:56.220
Right, so I mean, there's a million things

01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:59.740
I wanna ask here, but is there in some sense

01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:04.060
because the vaccine really helps

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:06.860
on the worst part of this pandemic,

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.340
which is killing people.

01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:09.180
Yes.

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:14.340
Doesn't that mean, where does the vaccine hesitancy

01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:18.300
come from in terms of, it seems like obviously

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:20.580
a vaccine is a powerful solution

01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:22.580
to let us open this thing up?

01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:24.580
Yeah, so I wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed

01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:27.060
with Sunetra Gupta in December of last year,

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:30.260
with a very naive title, which says,

01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:32.340
we can end the lockdowns in a month.

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:33.820
And the idea was very simple,

01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:37.860
vaccinate all vulnerable people,

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.660
and then open up.

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:41.500
Open up.

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.660
Right, and the idea was that the lockdown harms,

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.580
this is directly related to the Great Barrier Injury

01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:48.460
Declaration, the Great Barrier Injury Declaration said,

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:51.140
the lockdown harms are devastating

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:53.220
to the population at large.

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:55.940
There's this considerable segment of people

01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:58.300
that are vulnerable, protect them.

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.220
Well, with the vaccine, we have a perfect tool

01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:02.700
to protect the vulnerable, which is, I still believe,

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:04.260
I mean, it is true, right?

01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:07.140
You vaccinate the vulnerable, the older population,

01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:09.340
and as you said, it's a 10-fold decrease

01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:13.140
in the mortality risk from getting infected,

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:14.940
which is, I mean, amazing.

01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:17.220
So that was the strategy we outlined.

01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:20.420
What happened is that the vaccine debate got transformed.

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:22.820
So first there's, so you're asking about vaccine hesitancy.

01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:26.980
I think there's first, there's the inherent limitations

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:29.420
of how to measure vaccine safety, right?

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.580
So we talked about a little bit about the trial,

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:35.100
but also after the trial, there's a mechanism,

01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:37.900
and this is the work I've been involved with before COVID

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:42.420
on tracking and identifying and checking

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:43.940
whether the vaccines actually are safe,

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:47.220
and the central challenge is one of causality.

01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:49.380
So you no longer have the randomized trial,

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:52.780
but you wanna know, is the vaccine,

01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:56.860
when it's deployed at scale, causing adverse events?

01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:00.100
Well, you can't just look at people who are vaccinated

01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:02.100
and see what adverse events happen,

01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:04.020
because you don't know what would have happened

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:06.100
if the person had not been vaccinated.

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:09.820
So you have to have some control group.

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:12.100
Now, what happened is there's several systems

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.700
to check this that the CDC uses.

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:18.220
One very commonly known one now is called VAERS,

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.580
the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:22.700
There, anyone who has an adverse event,

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:24.980
that either a regular person or a doctor

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:27.660
can just go report, look, I had the vaccine

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:30.700
and two days later I had a headache or whatever it is,

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:34.260
the person died a day after that the vaccine, right?

01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:37.660
Now, the vaccine was rolled out to older people first,

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:42.140
and older people die sometimes with or without the vaccine.

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:44.740
So sometimes you'll see someone's vaccinated

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:46.660
and a few days later they die.

01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:48.540
Did the vaccine cause it or something else cause it?

01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:50.340
It's really difficult to tell.

01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:52.540
In order to tell, you need a control group.

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:58.540
For that, there are other systems the FDA and CDC have.

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:02.380
Like there's one called VSD, Vaccine Safety Data Link.

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:04.140
There's another system called BEST,

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:06.900
I forget what the acronym is,

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:11.500
to essentially to track cohorts of people

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.940
vaccinated versus unvaccinated

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:15.700
with as careful a matching as you can do.

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:18.420
It's not randomized, and C,

01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:23.420
if you have safety signals that pop up in the vaccinated

01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:25.940
relative to the control group unvaccinated.

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:28.140
And so that's, for instance,

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:32.740
how the myocarditis risk was picked up in young,

01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:34.300
especially young men.

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:38.060
It's also how the higher risk of blood clots

01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:41.100
in middle-aged and older women

01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:42.980
with the J&J vaccine was picked up.

01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:46.380
There what you have is our situations

01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:50.420
where the baseline risk of these outcomes are so low

01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:54.060
that if you see them in the vaccinated arm at all,

01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.500
then it's not hard to understand

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:57.100
that the vaccine did this, right?

01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:00.500
Young men should not be having myocarditis.

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.260
Middle-aged women should not be having

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:04.380
huge blood clots in the brain, right?

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:05.860
So when you see that, you can say it's linked.

01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:08.140
Now the rates are low, so young men,

01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:11.900
maybe one in 5,000, one in 10,000 of the vaccine,

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:14.180
vaccine-related myocarditis, pericarditis.

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:17.620
Young women, middle-aged women, I don't know,

01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:19.700
I'm not sure what the right number might be,

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:21.740
but like I'd say it's like in the,

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:24.500
one in hundreds of thousands, something like that.

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:27.900
So these are rare outcomes,

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:30.940
but they are vaccine-linked outcomes.

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:33.780
How do you deal with that as a messaging thing?

01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.380
I think you just tell people.

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:36.860
You tell people here are the risks.

01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:37.980
You transparently tell them.

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:40.060
You're not, so they're not getting into something

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:41.180
that they don't know.

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:45.500
And don't treat people like they're children

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.700
and need to be told lies because they won't understand

01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:50.980
the full complexity of the truth.

01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:54.220
People, I think, are pretty good at,

01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:58.260
or actually, you know, people with time

01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:01.460
are good at understanding data, but better than anything.

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:05.460
They're better at, they're extremely good

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:08.460
at detecting arrogance and bullshit.

01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:11.100
And give them either one of those.

01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:13.860
Well, I'll give you one that's where I think

01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:16.620
it's greatly undermined the demand for the vaccine

01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:20.460
is this weird denial that if you recover from COVID,

01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:24.100
you have extremely good immunity,

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:27.100
both against infection and access to disease.

01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:31.860
And that denial leads to people distrusting the message

01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:33.900
given by like the CDC director, for instance,

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:35.780
in favor of the vaccine.

01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:37.780
Right, why would you deny a thing

01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:39.580
that's such an obvious fact?

01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:42.060
Like you can look at the data and it just,

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:43.700
I mean, it just pops out at you

01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:45.860
that people that are COVID recovered

01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:48.780
are not getting affected again at very high rates,

01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:50.340
much lower rates.

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:53.020
After these kinds of conversations,

01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:55.580
I'm sure after this very conversation,

01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:58.780
I often get a number of messages from Joe,

01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:00.620
Joe Rogan, and from Sam Harris,

01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:03.620
who to me are people I admire,

01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:06.580
I think are really intelligent, thoughtful human beings.

01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:08.420
They also have a platform.

01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:11.180
And I believe, at least in my mind

01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:14.140
about this COVID set of topics,

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:17.260
they represent a group of people.

01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:24.420
Each group has smart, thoughtful,

01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:27.940
well-intentioned human beings.

01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:30.340
And I don't know who is right,

01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:35.340
but I do know that they're kind of tribal a little bit

01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:37.220
of those groups.

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:41.100
And so the question I wanna ask is like,

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:45.940
what do you think about these two groups?

01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:48.900
And this kind of tension over the vaccine

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:54.060
that sometimes it just keeps finding different topics

01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:55.380
on which to focus on,

01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:57.860
like whether kids should get vaccinated or not,

01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:00.420
whether there should be vaccine mandates or not,

01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:03.460
which seem to be often very kind of specific policy

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:06.220
kinds of questions that miss the bigger picture.

01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:08.300
I think it's a symptom of the distrust

01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:10.460
that people have in public health.

01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:13.900
I think this kind of schism over the vaccine

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:16.580
does not happen in places where the public health authorities

01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:18.860
have been much more trustworthy, right?

01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:20.060
So you don't see this vaccine

01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:21.900
hasn't seen Sweden, for instance.

01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:25.620
What's happened in the United States

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.340
is that the vaccine has become,

01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:30.540
first because of politics,

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:33.020
but then also because of the scientific arrogance,

01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:35.100
this sort of touchstone issue,

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.220
and people line up on both sides of it.

01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:39.580
And the different language you're hearing

01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:40.860
is structured around that.

01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:42.620
So before the election, for instance,

01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:46.620
I did a testimony in the House

01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:49.820
on measurement of vaccine safety.

01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:52.580
And I was invited by the Republicans.

01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:54.460
There were, I think, four other experts

01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:55.300
invited by the Democrats

01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:57.660
or three other experts invited by the Democrats,

01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:59.260
each of whom had a lot of experience

01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:00.620
in measuring vaccine safety.

01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:04.740
I was really surprised to hear them each doubt

01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:06.860
whether the FDA would do a reasonable job

01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:08.780
in assessing vaccine safety,

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:11.180
including by people who have long records

01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:12.980
of working with the FDA.

01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:17.140
I mean, these are professionals, great scientists,

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:19.460
whose main sort of goal in life

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:22.500
is to make sure that unsafe vaccines

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.140
don't get released into the world.

01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:26.420
And if they are, they get pulled.

01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:28.540
And they were casting down on the vaccine

01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:32.140
the ability to track vaccine safety before the election.

01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:34.860
And then after the election,

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:39.140
the rhetoric switched on a dime, right?

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:41.300
All of a sudden it's Republicans that are cast

01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:43.460
as if they're vaccine hesitant.

01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:47.500
That kind of political shift, the public notices.

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:50.100
If all it takes is an election to change

01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:52.060
how people talk about the safety of the vaccine,

01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:53.980
well, we're not talking science anymore,

01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:55.420
many people think, right?

01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:57.820
I think that created its hesitancy.

01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:00.020
The other thing I think,

01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:06.900
the hesitancy, some politicians viewed it as a political,

01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:10.260
as sort of like a political opportunity

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:12.780
to sort of demonize people who are hesitant.

01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:16.340
And that itself fueled hesitancy, right?

01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:18.180
Like if you're telling me I'm a rube

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:19.420
that just doesn't want the vaccine

01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:20.420
because I want everyone to die,

01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:23.060
well, I'm gonna react really negatively.

01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:27.140
And if you're talking down to me

01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:32.540
about my legitimate sort of concerns

01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:34.580
about whether this vaccine's safe to take,

01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:36.900
I've heard from women who are thinking

01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:38.740
about getting pregnant, should I take the vaccine?

01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:39.580
I don't know.

01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:41.220
I mean, there are all kinds of questions,

01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:44.220
legitimate questions that I think

01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:45.860
should have good data to answer,

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.900
that we don't necessarily have good data to answer.

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:50.100
So what do you do in the face of that?

01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:52.940
Well, one reaction is to pretend,

01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:55.420
like we know for a fact that it's safe

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:57.700
when we don't have the data to know for a fact

01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:58.540
in that particular group

01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:00.420
with that particular set of clinical circumstances,

01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:03.780
you know, and that I think breeds hesitancy.

01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:05.580
People can detect that bullshit.

01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:09.340
Whereas if you just tell people, you know, I don't know.

01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:10.700
Yeah, leave it with humility.

01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:13.380
Yeah, you will end up with a better result.

01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:15.940
Let me ask you about,

01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:19.180
I've recently had a conversation with the Pfizer CEO.

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:24.180
This is part therapy session, part advice,

01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:29.540
because again, I really want us to get through this together

01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:31.620
and it feels like the division is a thing

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:35.260
that prevents us from getting through this together.

01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:38.620
And once again, just like with Francis Collins,

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:43.620
a lot of people wrote to me words of support

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:47.220
and a lot of people wrote to me words of criticism.

01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:53.140
I'm trying to understand the nature of the criticism.

01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:57.540
So some of the criticism had to do with against the vaccine

01:24:57.540 --> 01:24:58.940
and those kinds of things

01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:00.980
that I have a better understanding of,

01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:06.540
but some kind of deep distrust of Pfizer.

01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:12.460
So actually looking at Big Pharma broadly,

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:18.620
I'm trying to understand, am I so naive

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:21.540
that I just don't see it?

01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:24.700
Because yes, there's corrupt people

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:28.900
and they're greedy, they're flawed in all walks of life,

01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:34.820
but companies do quite an incredible job

01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:37.780
of taking a good idea at the scale

01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.580
and making some money with that idea,

01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:43.420
but they are the ones that achieve scale on a good idea.

01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:46.340
I don't know, it's not obvious to me,

01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:49.780
I don't see where the manipulation is.

01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:51.340
So the fear that people have,

01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:55.020
and I talked to Joe about this quite a bit,

01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:57.500
I think this is a legitimate fear

01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:00.300
and a fear you should often have,

01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:01.780
that money has influence,

01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:04.940
disproportional influence, especially in politics.

01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:09.940
So the fear is that the policy of the vaccine

01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:13.500
was connected to the fact that lots of money

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:16.540
could be made by manufacturing the vaccine.

01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:19.340
And I understand that.

01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:22.020
It's actually quite a heck of a difficult task

01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:24.780
to alleviate that concern.

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:27.900
You really have to be a great man or woman or leader

01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:30.460
to convince people that you're not full of shit,

01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:32.700
that you're not just playing a game on them.

01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:35.300
I don't know, it's a difficult task,

01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:38.100
but at the same time, I really don't like

01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:41.820
the natural distrust every billionaire,

01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:44.180
distrust everybody who's trying to make money,

01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:47.860
because it feels like, under a capitalistic system at least,

01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:50.940
the way to do a lot of good,

01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:53.260
to do good at scale in the world

01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:58.020
is by being, at least in part, motivated by profit.

01:26:58.020 --> 01:26:59.340
I mean, I share your ambivalence, right?

01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:02.860
So on the one hand, you have a fantastic achievement,

01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:06.700
the discovery of the vaccine

01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:08.860
and then the manufacturing at scale

01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:12.660
so that billions of people can take the vaccine

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.060
in a relatively short time.

01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:15.700
That is a remarkable achievement

01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:17.220
that could not have happened

01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:18.980
without companies like Pfizer.

01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:22.780
On the other hand, there is this sort of

01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:24.780
corrupting influence of that money.

01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:27.380
Just to give you one example,

01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:30.300
there's an enormous controversy over whether

01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:32.820
relatively inexpensive repurposed drugs

01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:35.700
can be used to treat the disease.

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:41.900
No company like Pfizer has any interest whatsoever

01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:43.020
in evaluating it.

01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:45.500
Even Merck, I think it was Merck,

01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:50.460
that had the patent on ivermectin now expired,

01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:54.500
has no interest at all in checking to see if it works.

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.700
Not only do they not have interest,

01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:01.620
they have a way of talking about people

01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:04.580
who might have a little bit of interest

01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:09.580
that's, again, full of arrogance.

01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:12.660
And that is what troubles me.

01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:15.660
Is there not a, it's back to the play of science.

01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:17.740
It's not, they're not a bit of curiosity.

01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:20.780
One, okay, one, the natural curiosity of a human being

01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:23.340
that should always be there and an open mindness.

01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:25.700
And second, in the case of ivermectin

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:27.260
and other things like that,

01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:30.420
you have to acknowledge that there's a very large number

01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:33.620
of people who care about this topic

01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:37.780
and this is a way to inspire them to also play

01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:39.900
in the space of science, to inspire them with science.

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:43.940
You can't just like dismiss everybody that,

01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:45.900
you can't just dismiss people, period.

01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:48.380
Yeah, well, I mean, I think here, take ivermectin, right?

01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:51.740
There's actually a study funded by the NIH,

01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:56.740
by Tony Fauci's NIAID and the NIH called Active 6,

01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:01.580
that's a randomized trial of ivermectin.

01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:05.540
It's due to be completed in March, 2023.

01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:09.900
So normally, when you have private actors

01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:12.780
like these big drug companies that have no interest

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:15.660
in conducting some kind of scientific experiment

01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:17.700
that would have some public benefit,

01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:19.900
it's the job of the government,

01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:22.500
and in this case, the NIH, to fund that kind of work.

01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:26.700
The NIH has been incredibly slow

01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:31.820
in its evaluations of these repurposed drugs.

01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:35.060
And it's been left to lots of other private scientists

01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:39.620
private activities of uneven quality.

01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:42.220
And hence, that's why you have these big fights.

01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:44.260
Because the data are not solid,

01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:45.980
you're gonna have these big fights.

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:50.140
Yeah, but also, okay, forget the process of science here,

01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:53.620
the studies, not enough effort being put into the studies,

01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:55.220
just the way it's being communicated about.

01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:57.540
Yeah, no, like horse-paced, I mean, come on.

01:29:57.540 --> 01:30:01.820
The FDA put a tweet out telling people who are like,

01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:02.780
they're taking ivermectin

01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:04.180
because they've heard good things about it

01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:06.380
and they're sick and they're desperate.

01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:09.780
And just call it horse-paced, that was terrible.

01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:10.980
That was deeply irresponsible.

01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:13.780
My hope is grounded in the fact

01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:16.580
that young people see the bullshit of this.

01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:18.740
Young PhD students, graduate students,

01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:20.220
young students in college,

01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:25.220
they see the less than stellar way

01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.700
that our scientific leaders

01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:29.420
and our political leaders are behaving,

01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:30.620
and then the new generation

01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:33.220
will not repeat the mistakes of the past.

01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:34.180
That is my hope,

01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:37.460
because that's the cool thing I see about young people

01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:40.300
is they're good at detecting bullshit

01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:42.420
and they don't wanna be part of that.

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:46.820
That's my hope in the space of science.

01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:48.500
Let me return to this idea

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:50.660
of the Great Barrington Declaration.

01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:52.700
Return to the beginning.

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:54.780
So what are the basics?

01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:57.340
Can you describe what the Great Barrington Declaration is?

01:30:57.340 --> 01:30:58.660
What are some of the ideas in it?

01:30:58.660 --> 01:31:00.940
You mentioned focus protection.

01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:04.460
What are your concerns about lockdowns?

01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:07.380
Just paint the picture of this early proposal.

01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:09.260
Sure, so the Great Barrington Declaration,

01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:11.860
first, why is it called Great Barrington Declaration?

01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:13.300
It's such a great name.

01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:16.820
I mean, it's such an epic name,

01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:20.340
but the reason why it's called that is way less than epic.

01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:23.900
It was because the conference,

01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:25.580
which is organized by Martin Kulldorf,

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:28.820
who was a professor at Harvard University by a statistician,

01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:33.060
he actually designed the safety system,

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:36.340
the statistical system that the FDA uses

01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:38.980
for tracking vaccine safety.

01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:43.140
He and I had met previously just the summer before,

01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:45.980
that summer, and he invited me

01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:47.780
to come to this small conference

01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:50.260
where he was inviting me and Sunetra Gupta,

01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:53.420
who was a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Harvard,

01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:54.940
sorry, at Oxford University.

01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:58.900
And I mean, I jumped at the chance

01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:01.020
because I knew that Martin and Sunetra

01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:02.180
were both smarter than me,

01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:04.420
and it would be fun to talk about

01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:07.260
what the right strategy would be.

01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:10.740
On the drive in, I didn't know what the name of the town was,

01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:13.580
and I asked, they said it was Great Barrington,

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:16.020
and I had it in the back of my head.

01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:17.620
Martin and I arrived a little early,

01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:20.220
and we were writing an op-ed about some of the ideas

01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:22.380
I hope we'll get to talk about very soon

01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:25.500
about focus protection and the right strategy.

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.340
And when Sunetra arrived,

01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:30.220
we realized we'd actually come basically to the same place

01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:33.060
about the right way to deal with the epidemic.

01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:38.020
And I thought, well, why don't we write something

01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:39.340
like the Port Huron Statement

01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:41.540
is what I had that in the back of my head.

01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:43.620
And I'm like, well, what's the name of this town again?

01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:44.780
It was Great Barrington.

01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:48.020
Yeah, so it's not Barrington, it's Great Barrington.

01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:50.140
Which is fantastic, right?

01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:53.100
It's so over-the-top that it's perfect.

01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:55.820
It's literally like the Big Bang.

01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:58.380
There's something about these over-the-top fun titles

01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:01.180
that just really deliver the power.

01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:03.820
That's my main contribution was the title,

01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:05.860
the name, Great Barrington Decor.

01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:07.940
But yeah, so it was kind of a,

01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:12.100
and the idea is actually, while the title is great,

01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:14.900
and I think that it was written in a very stylish way,

01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:17.020
it's less than a page,

01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:18.820
and you can go look online and read it.

01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:21.860
It's written for, not for scientists,

01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:23.220
but for the general public

01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:25.700
so that people can understand the ideas really simply.

01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:29.540
But it is not actually a radical set of ideas.

01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:32.860
It actually represents the old pandemic plans

01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:35.220
that we've used for a century

01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:37.300
dealing with other similar pandemics.

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:40.460
And it's twofold.

01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:43.460
First, let me talk about the science it rests on,

01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:45.140
and then I'll talk about the plan.

01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:47.740
The science actually, some of it we already talked about.

01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:49.660
There's this massive age gradient

01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:52.020
in the risk of COVID infection.

01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:54.820
Older people face much higher risk than younger people.

01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:57.460
The second bit of science is all,

01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:58.860
that's not controversial, right?

01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:02.060
Even if you think the IFR is 0.7 or 0.2,

01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:05.220
no matter what, everyone agrees on this age gradient.

01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:09.940
The second bit of science is also not controversial.

01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:13.420
The lockdown-focused policies that we followed

01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:16.420
have absolutely devastating consequences

01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:18.660
on the health of the population.

01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:22.020
Let me just give you some examples.

01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:24.740
And this was known in October of 2020 when we wrote it, right?

01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:28.100
So the UN was sounding alarms

01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:31.860
that there would be tens of millions of people

01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:34.180
who would starve as a consequence

01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:37.460
of the economic dislocation caused by the lockdowns.

01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:38.780
And that's come to pass.

01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:40.860
Hundreds of thousands of children

01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:43.460
in places like South Asia dead from starvation

01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:46.140
as a consequence of lockdowns.

01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:56.060
Priorities like the treatment of patients with tuberculosis

01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:59.940
in poor countries stopped because of lockdowns.

01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:05.020
Childhood vaccinations of measles, mumps, rubella,

01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:08.620
DPT, diphtheria, so on, pertussis, tetanus,

01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:12.460
all those standard vaccination campaigns stopped.

01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:16.860
Tens of millions of children skipping these doses

01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:19.460
for diseases that are actually deadly for them.

01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:23.580
Is there, just on a small tangent,

01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:25.740
is it well understood to you

01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:28.140
what are the mechanisms that stop all those things

01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:29.300
because of lockdowns?

01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:31.180
Is it some aspect of supply chain?

01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:35.180
Is it just literally because hospital doors are closed?

01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:39.180
Is it because there's a disincentive to go outside by people

01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:41.100
even when they deeply need help?

01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:42.660
It's all of the above.

01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:44.380
But a lot of those efforts,

01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:45.860
especially those vaccination efforts,

01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:49.900
are funded and run by Western efforts.

01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:53.420
Like Gavi is a, I think it's a Gates-funded thing, actually,

01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:58.180
that provides vaccines for millions of kids worldwide.

01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:01.220
And those efforts were scaled back.

01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:02.900
Malaria prevention efforts.

01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:04.780
So in the developing world,

01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:08.220
it was a devastating effect, these lockdowns.

01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:09.300
There was also direct effects.

01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:11.980
Like in India, the lockdowns,

01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:13.460
when they first instituted,

01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:17.340
there was an order that 10 million migrant workers

01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:20.180
who live in big cities and they live hand-to-mouth,

01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:23.820
they buy coconuts, they sell the coconuts with the money,

01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:25.020
they buy food for themselves

01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:27.020
and coconuts for the next day to sell,

01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:29.620
walk back to their villages

01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:33.620
or go back to their villages overnight.

01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:35.900
So 10 million people walking back to their villages

01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:36.940
or taking a train back,

01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:40.140
1,000 died en route over crowded trains,

01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:42.180
dying essentially on the side of the road.

01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:44.700
I mean, it was absolutely inhumane policy.

01:36:46.540 --> 01:36:48.820
And the lockdowns there,

01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:53.180
it's kind of like what's happened in the West as well,

01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:55.380
but it was so severe.

01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:58.540
There was a seroprevalence study done in Mumbai

01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:00.180
by a friend of mine at the University of Chicago.

01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:03.540
What he found was that in the slums of Mumbai,

01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:05.460
there were 70% seroprevalence

01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:08.700
in July or August of 2020,

01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:11.340
whereas in the rest of Mumbai, it was 20%.

01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:12.180
Yeah.

01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:13.700
Right, so it was incredibly unequal.

01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:17.660
The lockdowns protected the relatively well-off

01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:20.700
and spread the disease among the poor.

01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:25.500
So that's in the developing world.

01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:26.340
In the developed world,

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:30.820
the health effects of lockdowns were also quite bad.

01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:31.980
Right, so we've talked already

01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:34.180
about isolation and depression.

01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:37.660
There was a study done in July of 2020

01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:41.180
that found that one in four young adults

01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:43.420
seriously considered suicide.

01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:47.940
Now, suicide rates haven't spiked up so much,

01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:51.420
but the depths of despair that would lead somebody

01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:53.420
to seriously consider suicide itself

01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:57.820
should be a source of great concern in public health.

01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:00.100
Yeah, this is one of the troubling things

01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:03.100
about measuring well-being is,

01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:06.260
we're okay at measuring death and suicide.

01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:09.020
We're not so good at measuring suffering.

01:38:09.020 --> 01:38:10.580
It's like people talk about,

01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:16.460
maybe even Holladahmore under Stalin

01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:19.540
or the concentration camps with Hitler.

01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:21.460
We talk about deaths,

01:38:21.460 --> 01:38:23.980
but we don't talk about the suffering

01:38:23.980 --> 01:38:27.780
over periods of years by people living in fear,

01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:29.500
by people starving,

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:32.460
psychological trauma that lasts a lifetime,

01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:33.940
all of those things.

01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:36.500
I mean, and just to get back to that point,

01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:38.580
we closed schools, especially in blue states,

01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:40.140
we closed schools.

01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:42.340
Now, richer parents could send their kids

01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:44.140
to private schools, many of which stayed open

01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:45.100
even in the blue states.

01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:47.100
They could get pods, they could get tutors,

01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:50.620
but that's not true for poor and middle-class parents.

01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:53.900
And as a result, what we did

01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:56.100
is we took away life opportunities for kids.

01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:58.820
We tried to teach five-year-olds to read

01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:00.340
via Zoom in kindergarten.

01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:04.740
And the consequence actually,

01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:06.180
you think, okay, we can just make it up,

01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:08.980
but it's really difficult to make that up.

01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:11.820
There's a literature in health economics

01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:16.740
that shows that even relatively small disruptions

01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:20.260
in schooling can have lifelong consequences,

01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:22.500
negative consequences for kids, right?

01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:25.380
So they end up growing up poorer,

01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:28.860
they lead shorter lives and less healthy lives

01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:30.180
as a consequence.

01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:31.620
And that's what the literature now shows

01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:34.940
is likely to happen with the interruptions of schooling

01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:36.700
that we had in the United States.

01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:39.180
Many European countries actually managed to avoid this.

01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:40.860
There were, in the early days of the epidemic,

01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:43.260
great indications that children, first,

01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:46.660
were not severely at risk from COVID itself,

01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:48.100
nor are they superspreaders.

01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:51.660
Schools were not the source of community spread.

01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:54.860
Community spread spread the disease to schools,

01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:56.100
not the other way around.

01:39:57.460 --> 01:39:59.300
And we can talk about the scientific base of that

01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:00.140
if you'd like.

01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:02.820
That was pretty well known, even in October.

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:06.780
We closed hospitals in order to keep them

01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:11.020
available to COVID patients, but as a result,

01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:14.180
women skipped breast cancer screening.

01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:15.900
As a result, they are showing up

01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:17.540
with late stage breast cancer

01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:19.700
that should have been picked up last year.

01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:21.940
Men and women skipped colon cancer screening,

01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:23.780
again, with later stage disease

01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:24.980
that should have been picked up last year,

01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:26.220
with earlier stage.

01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:27.820
For patients with diabetes,

01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:30.700
it's very important to have regular screening

01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:34.820
for blood sugar levels and sort of counseling

01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:37.900
for lifestyle improvement, and we skipped that.

01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:39.460
People stayed home with heart attacks

01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:41.300
and died at home with heart attacks.

01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:47.140
So you had this wide range of medical

01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:51.660
and psychological harms that were being utterly ignored

01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:53.740
as a result of the lockdowns.

01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:55.620
Plus there's the economic pain.

01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:59.060
So, like you said, whatever is a good term

01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:03.740
for the non-laptop class, people would lose their jobs.

01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:05.860
Yes, there might be in the Western world

01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:08.220
support for them financially,

01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:11.940
but the big loss there that is perhaps correlated

01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:16.380
with depression and suicide is loss of meaning,

01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:18.460
loss of hope for the future,

01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:21.500
loss of kind of a sense of stability,

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.900
all the pride you have in being able to

01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:29.180
make money that allows you to pave your own way in the world.

01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:32.260
And yes, just having less money than you're used to,

01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:34.180
so your family, your kids are suffering,

01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:35.020
all those kinds of things.

01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:38.060
And there's, again, economics literature on this,

01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:40.420
on deaths of despair, it was called.

01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:42.620
2009, there was the Great Recession.

01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:47.620
It led to an enormous uptake in overdose from drugs,

01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:50.180
suicidality, depression.

01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:51.500
As a result of that,

01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:54.420
the job losses that happened during the Great Recession.

01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:56.180
Well, that's happening again,

01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:59.740
like an enormous increase in drug overdoses.

01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:05.020
That's not an accident, that's a lockdown harm, right?

01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:07.460
Same thing with the job losses.

01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:08.780
The job losses, by the way, are like,

01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:12.660
it's so interesting because the states that stayed open

01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:15.420
have had much, much lower unemployment

01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:17.660
than the states that stayed closed.

01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:19.100
The labor force, by the way,

01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:20.780
has stayed closed.

01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:23.540
The labor force participation rates declined by 3%.

01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:25.460
It's women that separated

01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:28.580
because they stayed home with their kids.

01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:31.460
We've reversed a generation of women,

01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:37.140
improving women's participation in the labor force.

01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:41.180
Do you think it has to do with the institutions

01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:44.540
that we mentioned that there was so much priority given,

01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:48.300
or so much power given to maybe NIH

01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:51.700
versus other civilian leaders,

01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:54.420
or do people just not care about the economic pain?

01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:59.420
The leaders, I mean, because to me, it was obvious.

01:42:59.420 --> 01:43:03.540
I mean, probably it's just studying history.

01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:06.540
Whenever I listen to people on Twitter,

01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:09.820
on mainstream news, or just anything,

01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:14.620
I realize that's the very kind of top.

01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:17.260
The people that have a voice

01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:19.660
represent a tiny selection of people.

01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:21.780
And so whenever there's hard times,

01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:26.780
I always kind of think about the quiet, the voiceless,

01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:30.020
the quiet suffering of the tens of millions,

01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:31.420
of the hundreds of millions.

01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:36.420
Do political leaders not just give a damn?

01:43:36.420 --> 01:43:39.580
I mean, I think it was actually a very odd ethical thing

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:41.300
at the beginning of the pandemic,

01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:44.380
where if you brought up economic harms at all,

01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:46.460
you were seen as callous.

01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:50.060
Right, so I had a reporter call me up

01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:51.620
almost at the very beginning of the epidemic,

01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:56.620
asking me about a very particular phenomenon.

01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:00.700
So he was anticipating a rise in child abuse,

01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:02.340
because children were gonna be staying at home,

01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:05.020
child abuse is generally picked up at school.

01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:06.100
And that actually happened.

01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:08.540
So the reported child abuse dropped,

01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:10.420
but actual child abuse increased.

01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:14.140
Because normally you pick up the child abuse at school,

01:44:15.060 --> 01:44:16.100
you have the intervention, right?

01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:17.940
So yeah, so I was talking about like,

01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:19.140
well, there's gonna be some economic harms,

01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:20.220
and they're gonna have health consequences,

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:21.780
but the economic harms matter.

01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:24.580
But he counseled me,

01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:27.500
and I think he had my best interests at heart.

01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:29.540
Like if you were to put that in the story,

01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:31.740
I would essentially be canceled.

01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:36.380
Because the narrative that arose in March of 2020

01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:39.740
is if you care about money at all,

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:42.980
you're evil and crass, you must only care about lives.

01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:46.380
The problem with that narrative is that that money,

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:51.380
what we're talking about is actually lives of poor people.

01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:54.700
When you throw 100 million people around the world

01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:57.140
into poverty, you're going to see

01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:58.780
enormous harm to their health,

01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:01.300
enormous increases in their mortality.

01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:04.940
It is not immoral to think about that and worry about that

01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:07.340
in the context of this pandemic response.

01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:10.300
Our mind focused so much on COVID,

01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:11.980
that it forgot that there are so many

01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:13.540
other public health priorities as well

01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:15.500
that need our attention desperately.

01:45:16.420 --> 01:45:21.220
And this is the thing I sensed about San Francisco

01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:22.060
when I visited.

01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:24.620
I was thinking of moving there for a startup.

01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:26.580
This is the thing I'm really afraid of,

01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:30.420
especially if I have any effect on the world

01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:34.300
through a startup, is losing touch in this kind of way.

01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:36.980
That you mentioned the laptop class,

01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:40.260
living in this world where you're only concerned

01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:44.340
about this particular class of people.

01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:48.900
And also, perhaps early on in the pandemic,

01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:50.060
amongst the laptop class,

01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:52.100
there was a legitimate concern for health.

01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:55.940
You're not sure how deadly this virus is.

01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:57.260
You're not sure who to listen to,

01:45:57.260 --> 01:45:58.900
so there's a real concern.

01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:00.420
And then at a certain point,

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:02.060
when the data starts coming in,

01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:05.140
you start becoming more and more detached from the data.

01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:07.300
You don't start caring less and less,

01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:10.780
and you start just swimming in the space of narratives,

01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:12.460
like existing in the space of narratives,

01:46:12.460 --> 01:46:15.460
and you have this narrative in San Francisco,

01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:17.020
in the laptop class,

01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:21.220
that you're just very proud that you know the truth.

01:46:21.220 --> 01:46:22.980
You're the sole possessors of the truth.

01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:25.180
You congratulate yourself on it,

01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:28.980
and you don't care what actually gigantic detrimental effect

01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:29.820
that has on society,

01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:33.160
because you're mostly fine.

01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:36.700
I'm so terrified of that.

01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:39.780
Well, I think the antidote to that is just to remember.

01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:40.620
You remember.

01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:41.940
Yeah.

01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:44.020
I don't think you remember where you came from,

01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:46.380
and remember who you're doing this for.

01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:47.980
At the back of your head should always be,

01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:49.500
what's the purpose?

01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:50.780
Like, why am I here?

01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:51.780
What's the purpose of this?

01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:56.540
And if the purpose is simply self-aggrandizement,

01:46:56.540 --> 01:46:57.660
then you should rethink,

01:46:57.660 --> 01:47:00.060
because you'll just end up being a hollow life.

01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:03.100
All of us will be forgotten in the end.

01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:04.860
Yeah.

01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:08.580
Focus protection, the idea, the policy.

01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:09.980
What is focus protection?

01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:10.820
Right.

01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:13.140
So I was saying that there's two scientific bases, right?

01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:15.180
So one is this steep age gradient,

01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:17.100
and the second is the existence of locked arms.

01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:19.260
Again, I think there's very little disagreement

01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:22.340
in the scientific community about both of those facts.

01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:24.540
If you put those facts together,

01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:27.760
the obvious policy is to protect the people

01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:31.620
who are at the most severe risk from the disease itself.

01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:33.100
And that's the idea of focus protection.

01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:35.180
That's the general principle of it.

01:47:35.180 --> 01:47:37.900
The actual implementation of it depends

01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:41.700
on the living circumstances of the people that are at risk,

01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:44.460
the resources that are available in the community,

01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:47.820
the technology that's available to do this.

01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:51.900
And so it's almost always going to be,

01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:54.900
in fact, it'll always be a local thing,

01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:58.340
because it'll depend on all of those things

01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:00.540
which are all local in nature, right?

01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:04.860
So one very, very obvious thing in a country like ours

01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:06.700
where so many older people live

01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:09.500
in institutionalized settings, in nursing home settings,

01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:13.140
and that's where older, really vulnerable,

01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:14.940
chronically ill patients often live.

01:48:16.380 --> 01:48:18.380
And you know this disease affects that group,

01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:22.580
most commonly, it is absolutely vital to protect that group.

01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:26.620
We should have known that in February, 2020,

01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:28.260
from just from the Chinese data.

01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:32.300
And we should have thought about that group

01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:36.820
as the key constraint in our policymaking.

01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:40.860
Instead, we thought about, in February, March, 2020,

01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:43.940
as hospital beds as the key constraint,

01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:46.060
hospital beds and ventilator shortages.

01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:51.060
And so we ran around trying to address that constraint,

01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:52.460
like a linear programming problem,

01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:54.340
you figure out which constraint's binding,

01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:55.460
and you address that one thing,

01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:57.540
and then you go on to the next one, right?

01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:00.620
If that one constraint, we said,

01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:02.580
okay, the constraint is hospital beds.

01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:08.020
That led to the decision in many of the Northeast states

01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:12.180
to send COVID-infected patients who were on the verge of,

01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:14.100
or looked like they were about to recover,

01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:15.580
back to nursing homes,

01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:18.940
who then spread the disease all through there,

01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:21.500
because they wanted to preserve the hospital beds.

01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:24.940
Well, for somebody who loves numerical optimization,

01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:26.580
I love the way you framed this,

01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:30.380
but those are kind of connected, right?

01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:33.780
If you actually focus on protecting the vulnerable,

01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:38.780
you will also have the effect of not hitting the ceiling

01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:40.820
of the available hospital beds.

01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:41.660
That's the irony.

01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:44.180
If we protected the vulnerable,

01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:47.140
the vulnerable are the most likely to be hospitalized,

01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:49.900
and so by protecting the vulnerable,

01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:53.060
we would also have addressed the shortage of hospital beds

01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:53.900
more effectively.

01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:55.620
So that little shift in priority

01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:57.700
would have had a big impact.

01:49:57.700 --> 01:50:01.700
Okay, but specifically, the idea is to,

01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:03.660
and we could talk about different ideas

01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:04.620
of how to actually do this,

01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:09.620
but you basically do a lockdown or something like that

01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:12.260
on a very small set of people.

01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:13.300
You may have to do that

01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:14.860
if its community spread is very high,

01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:18.500
but generally, I think it would depend on, again,

01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:20.420
the living circumstances and the,

01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:23.300
so for instance, if you are in a,

01:50:23.300 --> 01:50:25.420
if you have a, here's a very simple idea

01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:28.260
that doesn't require a lockdown forced on them.

01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:29.940
I don't actually generally am not in favor

01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:31.060
of that kind of forced lockdown

01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:33.020
because you just won't get cooperation,

01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:36.300
but what you could do is provide resources

01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:38.020
to that group of people.

01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:42.460
So imagine you live next door to somebody, an older couple,

01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:46.300
and there's high community spread.

01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:48.940
Well, they have to go grocery shopping.

01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:51.180
We did, some communities did these

01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:53.540
senior-only grocery hour, right?

01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:55.100
But they still have to go out,

01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:56.780
and they might get exposed

01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:59.660
when they're shopping amongst other seniors.

01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:03.420
Well, why not organized home delivery of groceries to them?

01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:06.380
We did that for the laptop class, right?

01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:09.060
Or you can even just as a volunteer effort,

01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:10.220
the older people living next door,

01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:11.060
just call them up and say,

01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:13.620
can I help you get, go out and go shopping for you?

01:51:13.620 --> 01:51:16.460
So you would have potentially federal support

01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:17.300
of that kind of thing.

01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:19.460
So these kinds of efforts.

01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:22.100
Identify where the vulnerable people live.

01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:24.580
It's really challenging in multi-generational homes,

01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:25.580
in LA County, for instance,

01:51:25.580 --> 01:51:28.780
there's a lot of older people living together

01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:31.460
with younger people in relatively crowded,

01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:34.140
there it's really quite a challenge.

01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:35.780
But there, again, you can use resources.

01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:40.780
So if grandma is worried that grandson has come home,

01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:42.020
is potentially being exposed,

01:51:42.020 --> 01:51:43.460
grandson calls grandma, says,

01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:47.140
I might've been at a party where COVID was,

01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:49.460
grandma calls public health, public health then says,

01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:51.980
okay, you can have this hotel room for a couple of days

01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:54.340
until you check to turn negative.

01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:56.060
In case it wasn't clear,

01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:58.620
the idea of focused protection

01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:03.100
is the people that are vulnerable, protect them.

01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:06.180
And everybody else goes on with their lives,

01:52:06.180 --> 01:52:09.780
open up the economy, just do as it was before.

01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:10.960
There was still fear abroad.

01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:12.900
So there still would be some restrictions

01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:14.100
people would pose on themselves.

01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:15.740
They probably would go to parties less.

01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:19.020
The grandsons probably wouldn't go so many parties, right?

01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:23.500
That there would be less participation in big gatherings.

01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:25.140
You may even say like big gatherings

01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:27.500
in order to restrict community spread again.

01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:29.380
I'm not against any of that,

01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:31.820
but you shouldn't be closing businesses.

01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:34.020
You shouldn't be closing churches and synagogues.

01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:38.540
You shouldn't be forcing people to not go to school.

01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:41.340
You should not be shuttering businesses.

01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:44.040
You should just allow society to go on.

01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:46.900
Some disease will spread, but as we've seen,

01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:50.100
the lockdown didn't stop the disease from spreading anyways.

01:52:50.140 --> 01:52:52.780
Right, so what do you make of the criticism

01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:57.660
that this idea like all good ideas

01:52:57.660 --> 01:53:01.340
cannot actually be implemented in a heterogeneous society

01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:03.700
where there's a lot of people intermixing.

01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:08.620
And once you open it up, people like the younger people

01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:11.060
will just forget that this is even existing

01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:13.100
and they'll stop caring about the older people

01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:14.340
and mess up the whole thing.

01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:16.860
And the government will not want to fund

01:53:16.860 --> 01:53:18.940
any kind of the great efforts you're talking about

01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:22.020
about food delivery and then the food delivery services

01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:24.500
will be like, why the heck am I helping out on this anyway

01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:26.780
because like it's not making me much money.

01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:30.600
And so therefore like all good ideas, it will collapse.

01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:31.440
That might be true.

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:34.040
I mean, I think it's always a risk with policy thing,

01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:36.140
but I think like think back to the moment

01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:39.100
where we actually felt like we were in this together

01:53:39.100 --> 01:53:39.940
to some extent.

01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:40.860
Yes.

01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:44.540
Right, I think that that empathy that we had

01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:48.660
that was used to like tell people to stay

01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:52.300
happily, not go in happily, but like stay in

01:53:53.380 --> 01:53:56.320
to like wear a mask or to do all these things

01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:58.840
that we thought would help other people

01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:01.300
could have been redirected to actually helping the people

01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:02.900
who most needed to be helped.

01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:06.980
Especially, I do remember March.

01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:10.500
So this is even way before Barrington,

01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:14.820
all of that kind of stuff, March, April, May,

01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:18.400
there was a feeling like if we all just work together,

01:54:19.140 --> 01:54:20.900
we'll solve this.

01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:22.420
And that maybe started to,

01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:24.460
when did that start breaking down?

01:54:24.460 --> 01:54:28.820
I mean, unfortunately, the election is mixed into this

01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:30.980
that it became politicized,

01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:32.940
but I think it lasted quite a long time.

01:54:32.940 --> 01:54:35.180
I think into the summer, I think there was some

01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:37.260
of that sense, I don't know,

01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:39.900
it obviously varied among different people.

01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:42.460
But I think that it's true, it would have been challenging.

01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:44.940
It's also true that it's heterogeneous

01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:46.900
exactly the way you said.

01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:49.900
But what that means is you need a local response,

01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:53.500
a response, so like my vision of a public health officer

01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:56.500
is someone that understands their community,

01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:59.240
not necessarily the nation at large, but their community,

01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:01.460
and then works within their community

01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:03.340
to figure out how to deploy the resources

01:55:03.340 --> 01:55:07.500
that are available to do the kind of protection policies

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:08.320
we're talking about.

01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:10.060
That's what should have happened.

01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:12.780
Instead, they spent a huge amount of efforts

01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:15.580
closing, making sure businesses stayed closed,

01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:19.380
businesses that, I mean, they're like hardware stores

01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:20.740
that closed.

01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:22.900
What good did closing a hardware store do

01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:25.060
for the spread of COVID?

01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:26.980
If it had an effect on spread, COVID spread,

01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:28.940
I mean, it's gonna be more checking to make sure

01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:31.140
that plexiglass was put up everywhere,

01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:32.500
which now in retrospect turns out

01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:34.860
to probably made the disease worse.

01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:40.380
Masking enforcement, so shaming around masks,

01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:42.540
I mean, a huge amount of effort on things

01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:47.020
that were only tangentially related to focus protection.

01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:49.180
What if we turned our energy,

01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:52.300
that enormous energy put into that,

01:55:52.300 --> 01:55:54.500
instead into focus protection of the vulnerable?

01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:57.140
That's essentially the conversation I was calling for.

01:55:57.140 --> 01:55:59.420
And it wasn't, I mean, I didn't think of it

01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:01.020
as we had every single idea.

01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:03.220
I mean, we gave some concrete proposals,

01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:04.600
and we got, but the criticism we got

01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:07.000
was that those concrete proposals weren't enough.

01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:10.260
And the answer to that I have is that's true.

01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:11.100
They weren't enough.

01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:12.660
I wasn't thinking of them as enough.

01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:15.300
I was thinking that I wanted to involve

01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:17.980
an enormous number of people in local public health

01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:20.900
to help think about how to do focus protection

01:56:20.900 --> 01:56:22.180
in their communities.

01:56:23.260 --> 01:56:25.740
The question that's interesting here

01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:27.420
is about the future too.

01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:32.740
So COVID has very specific characteristics,

01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:36.180
like you mentioned about the curve of the death rate

01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:39.580
based on the, like it seems like with COVID,

01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:42.140
it's a little bit easier to actually identify

01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:44.820
a group of people that you need to protect.

01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:47.900
So other viruses may not be this way.

01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:51.540
So might lockdown be a good idea,

01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:55.420
like hardcore lockdown for a future virus

01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:57.620
that's 10 times deadlier,

01:56:57.620 --> 01:56:59.740
but spreads at the same rate as COVID?

01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:01.780
Or maybe another way to ask that is,

01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:04.260
imagine a virus that's 10 times deadlier.

01:57:04.260 --> 01:57:06.220
What's the right response?

01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:08.780
I mean, I think it's always gonna be focus protection,

01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:11.500
but the group that needs the focus protection

01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:14.380
may change depending on the biology of the virus, right?

01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:18.540
So the polio epidemic in the 40s and 50s in the US,

01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:22.020
the great, the people at most risk were children.

01:57:23.180 --> 01:57:24.980
We didn't know really at the beginning

01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:27.020
there was this fecal oral spread.

01:57:27.020 --> 01:57:29.220
And so we did all kinds of crazy things,

01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:33.700
including like spraying DDT in communities,

01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:36.980
which was somehow supposed to get rid of polio.

01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:40.020
But the focus was on whenever there was an outbreak,

01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:42.060
they would close the school down.

01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:43.700
And that was the right thing to do

01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:48.700
because that group that needed protection was children

01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:51.980
and the disease was spread, we thought, in schools.

01:57:53.620 --> 01:57:56.660
I don't think there's a single formula that works,

01:57:56.660 --> 01:57:59.380
but there's a single principle that works, right?

01:57:59.380 --> 01:58:02.260
No matter, it's hard to imagine a disease

01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:05.420
that's uniformly deadly across every group

01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:07.180
and every single person.

01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:09.660
There's always gonna be some group

01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:13.620
that's differentially harmed.

01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:14.820
There's always gonna be some group

01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:16.260
that's differentially protected.

01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:17.940
And that may change over time, right?

01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:22.940
So like in this disease, in this epidemic,

01:58:23.380 --> 01:58:25.820
as people got infected and recovered,

01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:27.140
we now had a class of people

01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:29.700
that were pretty well protected against the disease.

01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:34.340
They should be, instead of ostracizing them

01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:36.020
because they don't want a vaccine,

01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:37.820
we should be allowing them to work.

01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:41.300
I mean, we're having staffing shortages in hospitals now

01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:43.300
because we forgot that principle.

01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:46.580
It is quite a bit of this, a technology problem.

01:58:46.580 --> 01:58:49.700
So being able to, some of it,

01:58:49.700 --> 01:58:52.540
how much of it is a sociological problem?

01:58:53.940 --> 01:58:56.380
How much of it is a technology problem?

01:58:56.380 --> 01:58:59.100
Like, where do you put the blame,

01:58:59.100 --> 01:59:01.420
sort of on why this didn't go so great

01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:04.140
and how it can go great in the beginning?

01:59:04.980 --> 01:59:05.820
I mean, think about lockdowns.

01:59:05.820 --> 01:59:08.700
Like, if we didn't have Zoom, we wouldn't have lockdowns.

01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:11.580
There's a reason in 2009 we didn't lock down.

01:59:11.580 --> 01:59:13.740
I mean, we didn't have the technology to replace work

01:59:13.740 --> 01:59:16.900
with this remote technology.

01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:21.340
So we had good lockdown technology in Zoom.

01:59:21.340 --> 01:59:25.340
We didn't have good focus protection technology.

01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:26.260
Yeah, I mean, focus protection

01:59:26.260 --> 01:59:27.380
is always gonna be complicated,

01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:29.500
especially for something like this that spreads so easily,

01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:30.980
it's gonna be complicated.

01:59:30.980 --> 01:59:33.620
And I'm very, I'm the last person to say

01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:35.380
that it would have been perfect.

01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:37.740
There would have been people that would have gotten sick,

01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:39.060
but they got sick anyways.

01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:41.500
The hope was that if we suppress community spread

01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:44.540
low enough, we can protect the vulnerable.

01:59:44.540 --> 01:59:47.180
That was the hope by lockdown.

01:59:47.180 --> 01:59:50.380
The reality was that only a certain class of people

01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:51.820
were able to benefit from lockdown.

01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:53.820
The rest of society, we call them essential workers,

01:59:53.820 --> 01:59:55.700
had to keep working and they got sick.

01:59:56.660 --> 01:59:58.180
And the disease kept spreading.

01:59:58.180 --> 02:00:00.300
It didn't actually have a substantial effect

02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:05.460
on community spread in non-laptop class populations.

02:00:05.980 --> 02:00:08.380
And also we should probably expand the class of people

02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:12.260
we call vulnerable to those who would suffer,

02:00:12.260 --> 02:00:14.340
who have the capacity to suffer

02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:19.060
given the policies that you're weighing.

02:00:19.060 --> 02:00:22.700
It's very disingenuous to call the vulnerable

02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:26.180
just the people, obviously we had very specific meaning,

02:00:26.180 --> 02:00:29.500
but broadly speaking, vulnerable

02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:32.780
should include anybody who can suffer

02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:36.180
based on the policies you take in response to a virus.

02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:39.140
That principle you just said is I completely agree with

02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:41.540
is something I think has been lost

02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:44.300
and unfortunately lost, right?

02:00:44.300 --> 02:00:49.300
So the policies themselves, if they have harm,

02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:53.500
those are real and we shouldn't pretend like they're not

02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:57.340
and essentially demonize the people that suffer them

02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:00.540
or pretend, I mean like a lot of times

02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:02.780
like the depression that we've been talking about,

02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:06.060
that's thought of as like not so important,

02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:07.020
but it is important.

02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:12.500
And especially the harm to the people in poor countries,

02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:14.860
it's like been out of sight, out of mind

02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:16.940
in much of the rich parts of the world.

02:01:16.940 --> 02:01:20.180
Once again, I've hoped that we seeing this,

02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:23.020
learning the lessons of history with the communication tools

02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:24.300
who have now will learn this.

02:01:24.300 --> 02:01:26.940
It's like going to another country and bombing,

02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:29.380
targeted terrorist locations

02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:32.100
and there's going to be some civilians who die

02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:37.100
pretending that the child who watches their dad die

02:01:37.740 --> 02:01:40.620
is not going to grow up, first of all, traumatized,

02:01:40.620 --> 02:01:43.700
but second of all, potentially bring more hate to the world

02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:46.860
than the hate that you were allegedly fighting

02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:47.700
in the first place.

02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:52.580
That's another sort of considering only one kind of harm

02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:54.140
and not the full range of harms

02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:55.780
that are being caused by your policies.

02:01:56.740 --> 02:01:59.180
To return to focus protection,

02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:01.700
we still should be following the policy now for COVID

02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:03.060
and we're not, right?

02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:06.820
So the vaccines, there's a great shortage in vaccines.

02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:08.460
You wouldn't know it in the United States

02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:09.820
and the rich parts of the world,

02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:11.660
but there's a great shortage of vaccines.

02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:13.180
We're not going to be able to vaccinate

02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:17.140
the most of the entire set of elderly at least

02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:20.980
and or larger groups until late 2022.

02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:24.140
Huge numbers of older people around the world

02:02:24.140 --> 02:02:27.460
in poor countries that have not COVID recovered yet.

02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:29.100
So they're still quite vulnerable,

02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:30.900
have not had the vaccine.

02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:34.500
And yet we're talking about vaccinating five-year-olds

02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:37.540
who benefit if at all from the vaccines

02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:38.580
of just a very little bit

02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:41.220
because they face such a low risk of harm from COVID.

02:02:43.060 --> 02:02:45.900
Well, something that's a little bit near and dear

02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:49.260
to our specific, the two of our hearts.

02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:51.260
So you're at Stanford.

02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:53.660
So Stanford recently announced

02:02:53.660 --> 02:02:55.660
that they're going back to virtual,

02:02:55.660 --> 02:02:59.300
at least for some period of time in response to the,

02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:00.180
maybe you can clarify,

02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:02.580
but I think it's in response to the escalated,

02:03:04.140 --> 02:03:05.380
how would they phrase it?

02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:06.780
It's related to Omicron.

02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:10.180
And a few other universities

02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:13.660
are kind of like considering back and forth.

02:03:13.660 --> 02:03:18.300
In my perspective, as somebody who loves in-person lectures,

02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:23.140
who sees the value of that

02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:25.820
to students, to young minds,

02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:30.820
also looking at the data seems the risk aversion

02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:36.980
in university policies around this,

02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:40.900
given how healthy the student population is,

02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:44.020
seems not well-calibrated.

02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:44.860
Let's put it this way.

02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:45.680
Also-

02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:46.520
Pathological.

02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:48.100
Pathological is one way to put it.

02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:50.660
Given that, depending on the university,

02:03:50.660 --> 02:03:53.140
but I think many universities require

02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:57.020
that the student body is vaccinated at this point.

02:03:57.020 --> 02:04:01.060
So I think it's a big mistake by Stanford to do this.

02:04:01.060 --> 02:04:04.020
And I'd like to say that,

02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:05.780
because I just hope MIT doesn't.

02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:09.020
But what are your thoughts about Stanford?

02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:09.860
Is there a student-

02:04:09.860 --> 02:04:10.680
I agree with you.

02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:11.520
I completely agree with you.

02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:14.980
I think we have failed in our mission

02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:19.100
to educate our students by this decision.

02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:20.940
And I think I frankly, just more broadly,

02:04:20.940 --> 02:04:23.020
I think we failed generally over the course

02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:24.380
of the last year and a half

02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:26.380
in living up to our educational mission.

02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:31.020
In-person teaching is vital.

02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:35.340
Now I can understand you have older faculty,

02:04:35.340 --> 02:04:37.200
the principle of focus protection says,

02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:40.300
provide some alternative teaching arrangements for them.

02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:41.400
That makes sense to me.

02:04:42.620 --> 02:04:44.340
From the kid's point of view,

02:04:44.340 --> 02:04:46.980
they're more harmed by not getting the education

02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:50.320
we promised them than by COVID.

02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:54.820
So applying this principle of this focus protection,

02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:58.100
let young professors teach in-person.

02:04:58.100 --> 02:04:59.220
This is before the vaccine.

02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:01.340
After the vaccine, let everyone teach in-person.

02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:02.300
Yeah, this is the part,

02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:04.660
I don't understand the discussion we're even having

02:05:04.660 --> 02:05:09.660
because, okay, let's leave focus protection aside here

02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:12.340
because that's a brilliant policy

02:05:12.340 --> 02:05:15.860
for perhaps for the future when there's no vaccine.

02:05:15.860 --> 02:05:17.660
Now with the vaccine,

02:05:17.660 --> 02:05:20.180
I'm misunderstanding something here

02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:25.180
because we're now in a space that's psychological.

02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:27.740
It's no longer about biology

02:05:27.740 --> 02:05:30.620
because with the booster shots,

02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:34.940
which I believe MIT is now requiring before January,

02:05:34.940 --> 02:05:37.220
with the booster shots, the data shows,

02:05:37.220 --> 02:05:38.500
no matter how old you are,

02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:43.500
the risks are very low for ending up in a hospital

02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:47.780
relative to all the other risks you face when you're older.

02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:51.260
I don't understand.

02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:56.260
Can you explain the policy around closing a university,

02:05:56.900 --> 02:06:01.900
but also just a policy about just being so scared still

02:06:04.460 --> 02:06:05.940
in the university setting?

02:06:05.940 --> 02:06:09.580
I think the great universities have done great harm

02:06:09.580 --> 02:06:12.100
by modeling this kind of behavior.

02:06:12.340 --> 02:06:15.260
Yes, to me, sorry to keep interrupting,

02:06:15.260 --> 02:06:17.820
but to me, the university should be the beacon

02:06:17.820 --> 02:06:22.820
of great behavior, not the beacon of scared, conservative,

02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:27.780
let's not mess up, let's not make it pathological,

02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:29.860
let's not make anybody angry.

02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:34.700
It should be a place to play in the space of ideas.

02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:37.660
So I think the central problem is,

02:06:37.660 --> 02:06:39.060
actually related to the central problem

02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:41.340
of COVID policy more generally.

02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:45.300
The goal seems to be to stop the disease from spreading,

02:06:46.220 --> 02:06:49.700
rather than to reduce the harm from the disease.

02:06:51.580 --> 02:06:54.020
If the goal is to stop the disease from spreading,

02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:57.660
the sad fact is we have no technology to stop,

02:06:57.660 --> 02:06:59.180
to accomplish that.

02:06:59.180 --> 02:07:00.260
At this point?

02:07:00.260 --> 02:07:01.100
Yes.

02:07:01.100 --> 02:07:03.540
Because it's already deeply integrated

02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:05.180
into the human civilization.

02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:07.060
Well, I mean, it's here forever, right?

02:07:07.060 --> 02:07:11.140
There's a zero survey of white-tailed deer in the US.

02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:13.420
It turns out 80% of white-tailed deer in the US

02:07:13.420 --> 02:07:15.740
have COVID antibodies.

02:07:15.740 --> 02:07:18.020
Dogs get it, cats get it.

02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:20.860
There's almost certainly human animal transmission of it.

02:07:22.460 --> 02:07:23.460
I mean, presumably, I mean,

02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:25.500
I've heard bats get it apparently.

02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:29.540
So you have a situation where you have this disease

02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:30.660
that's here to stay.

02:07:30.660 --> 02:07:31.500
Yeah.

02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:33.300
And the vaccines don't stop the spread of it,

02:07:33.300 --> 02:07:34.580
the lockdowns don't stop the spread of it.

02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:37.420
We have no technology to stop the spread of it.

02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:40.980
And so we're burning the earth trying to stop,

02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:42.980
do something that's impossible

02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:46.820
rather than working on what's possible.

02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:51.860
And so like letting regular college happen,

02:07:51.860 --> 02:07:53.140
that's a great good.

02:07:53.140 --> 02:07:56.420
Universities are a wonderful invention

02:07:56.420 --> 02:07:58.820
and it's contributed so much to society

02:07:58.820 --> 02:08:00.580
to decide to shut it down.

02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:03.340
The universities should be fighting tooth and nail

02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:06.060
to not be shut down, not the other way around.

02:08:06.060 --> 02:08:07.220
Yeah.

02:08:07.220 --> 02:08:09.380
Whatever the mechanisms that results

02:08:09.380 --> 02:08:10.460
in the universities doing that,

02:08:10.460 --> 02:08:12.620
that's probably, this is me talking.

02:08:12.620 --> 02:08:14.500
It probably has to do with certain incentives

02:08:14.500 --> 02:08:15.500
for the administration,

02:08:15.500 --> 02:08:18.820
probably has to do with lawyers and legal kinds of things

02:08:18.820 --> 02:08:21.180
to avoid legal trouble.

02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:24.620
But once again, it's when the administration

02:08:24.620 --> 02:08:27.300
has too much power and too much definition

02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:29.220
of what the policy is for the university,

02:08:29.220 --> 02:08:30.780
that's when you get into trouble.

02:08:30.780 --> 02:08:33.300
The beauty, the power of the university

02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:36.300
should be about the faculty and the students.

02:08:36.340 --> 02:08:40.380
Administration just gets in the way,

02:08:40.380 --> 02:08:41.380
get out of the way.

02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:43.140
I mean, they can help organize things.

02:08:43.140 --> 02:08:45.860
They play some important role, but they certainly do.

02:08:45.860 --> 02:08:47.580
But they need to remember what the mission is.

02:08:47.580 --> 02:08:50.180
The mission is not safety.

02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:51.700
The mission, actually,

02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:53.820
universities should be dangerous places

02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:55.980
for ideas and whatnot.

02:08:57.020 --> 02:08:59.180
What is the role of fear in a pandemic?

02:08:59.180 --> 02:09:00.740
We've been dancing around it.

02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:01.700
Is it useful?

02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:03.180
Is it destructive?

02:09:03.180 --> 02:09:05.820
Or is there sort of a complicated story here?

02:09:06.780 --> 02:09:10.020
So they've taken us back into January, 2020.

02:09:10.020 --> 02:09:11.420
There was so much uncertainty.

02:09:11.420 --> 02:09:16.420
This could have been a pandemic that is a black death,

02:09:16.660 --> 02:09:17.780
the bubonic plague.

02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:21.100
It could have killed hundreds of millions of people.

02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:22.620
We don't know that.

02:09:22.620 --> 02:09:24.060
We're very new to this.

02:09:24.060 --> 02:09:25.140
It's been a while.

02:09:25.140 --> 02:09:26.500
We're rusty.

02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:29.420
So there is some value to fear

02:09:29.420 --> 02:09:31.300
so that you don't do the stupid thing.

02:09:31.300 --> 02:09:33.060
You don't just go on living.

02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:34.140
I guess where I come from,

02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:36.700
I think it's almost entirely counterproductive.

02:09:36.700 --> 02:09:39.940
I think fear should never be used as a tactic

02:09:39.940 --> 02:09:44.060
to manipulate human behavior by public health.

02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:47.060
So the fear on the individual level,

02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:48.700
that feeling of fear,

02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:51.100
you should be very hesitant about that feeling

02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:53.900
because it could be easily manipulated by the powerful.

02:09:53.900 --> 02:09:54.740
Exactly.

02:09:54.740 --> 02:09:57.940
So I think that fear is natural.

02:09:57.940 --> 02:10:02.940
And it's not something that you have to stoke to get

02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:05.860
when the facts on the ground suggest it.

02:10:07.020 --> 02:10:11.780
In fact, the tendency for humans in the face of threats

02:10:11.780 --> 02:10:14.740
from infectious disease is to exaggerate the fear

02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:18.300
in their own minds of being contaminated

02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:19.900
by the environment and by others.

02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:21.740
That's just natural to humans.

02:10:22.620 --> 02:10:26.220
And the role of public health is not necessarily

02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:28.140
to eradicate the fear.

02:10:28.140 --> 02:10:29.420
Obviously, technological advances

02:10:29.420 --> 02:10:30.900
can help eradicate the fear,

02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:33.660
but it's really to help manage that fear

02:10:33.660 --> 02:10:38.660
and help people put the sort of incentives

02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:41.140
that come out of that to useful things

02:10:41.140 --> 02:10:42.580
as opposed to harmful things.

02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:46.180
What's happened in this pandemic

02:10:46.180 --> 02:10:49.900
is that there's been a deliberate policy to stoke the fear,

02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:52.580
to help make people think that the disease is worse

02:10:52.580 --> 02:10:54.180
than it actually is.

02:10:54.180 --> 02:10:56.660
In survey after survey, you see this.

02:10:56.660 --> 02:10:58.900
And that's been incredibly damaging.

02:10:58.900 --> 02:11:02.980
So young people have readily given away

02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:05.580
their willingness to participate in regular life

02:11:05.580 --> 02:11:08.900
because A, they fear COVID more than they ought,

02:11:09.860 --> 02:11:11.780
and B, they fear that they're gonna harm

02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:15.260
the vulnerable in their lives.

02:11:15.260 --> 02:11:16.420
You put those two together

02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:18.940
and you get this powerful demand for lockdowns.

02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:21.180
You see this all over the world.

02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:23.500
Broadly speaking, you have a powerful demand

02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:26.580
for irrational policies,

02:11:26.700 --> 02:11:29.220
I would like to mention the flip side of that.

02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:32.820
I've been saddened to see how much money

02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:37.540
there is to be made by the martyrs,

02:11:37.540 --> 02:11:40.700
the people, the conspiracy theorists

02:11:40.700 --> 02:11:45.700
that tell you you should be afraid of the government.

02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:49.220
You should be afraid of the man.

02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:51.780
It feels like fear is the problem.

02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:53.780
I think there's some guy that once said something

02:11:53.780 --> 02:11:56.100
about we should fear fear itself.

02:11:58.940 --> 02:11:59.980
He was a president or something.

02:11:59.980 --> 02:12:01.780
I vaguely remember that.

02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:05.140
So I'm worried about both sides here.

02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:07.940
I think the general principle is

02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:10.420
that should not be a tool of public policy.

02:12:12.140 --> 02:12:13.820
Public policy should attempt,

02:12:13.820 --> 02:12:15.140
and public health policy in particular

02:12:15.140 --> 02:12:16.900
should attempt to address that fear.

02:12:18.180 --> 02:12:22.780
It's not that you should tell people lies, of course not.

02:12:22.780 --> 02:12:25.340
Tell people accurately what the risk is.

02:12:26.500 --> 02:12:29.060
Give people tools that have evidence

02:12:29.060 --> 02:12:31.100
that they can address their risk with.

02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:36.220
And level with people when we don't know.

02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:38.820
I think that is the right adult way

02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:41.660
to deal with this pandemic from a public health point of view.

02:12:41.660 --> 02:12:44.700
And that is not the policy we have followed.

02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:47.540
Instead, public health has intentionally stoked the fear

02:12:47.540 --> 02:12:50.540
in order to gain compliance with its edicts.

02:12:50.580 --> 02:12:53.380
And I think the consequence of that

02:12:53.380 --> 02:12:56.700
is people distrust public health.

02:12:56.700 --> 02:12:58.660
What you're talking about, the distrust of government,

02:12:58.660 --> 02:13:00.860
I think is partly a consequence of that.

02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:03.420
That movement, which is much smaller once upon a time,

02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:06.980
is much larger now because of essentially,

02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:09.180
people look at what public health has done

02:13:09.180 --> 02:13:12.300
and say they've lied to me a whole bunch of times

02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:15.380
and a whole bunch of things is the general sense.

02:13:15.380 --> 02:13:17.300
And there are consequences of that.

02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:20.140
We're gonna have to work in public health for a long time

02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:22.900
to try to regain the trust of the public.

02:13:22.900 --> 02:13:24.340
Throughout all of this,

02:13:24.340 --> 02:13:27.740
you've been inspiring to me, to a lot of people.

02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:32.660
You've been fearless, bold,

02:13:32.660 --> 02:13:35.940
in these kind of challenging the policies

02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:38.980
and not in a martyr kind of way

02:13:38.980 --> 02:13:42.220
because you're walking the line gracefully

02:13:42.220 --> 02:13:44.460
and beautifully, I would say.

02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:47.180
And looking at that,

02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:50.300
I think you're an inspiration to a lot of young people,

02:13:50.300 --> 02:13:53.980
so I have to ask, what advice would you give them

02:13:53.980 --> 02:13:56.540
if they're thinking of going into science,

02:13:56.540 --> 02:13:59.540
if they're thinking of having an impact in the world,

02:13:59.540 --> 02:14:02.860
what advice would you give them about their career

02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:05.940
and maybe about their life,

02:14:05.940 --> 02:14:07.660
thinking about somebody in high school,

02:14:07.660 --> 02:14:09.740
maybe in undergraduate college?

02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:10.660
I'd say a few things.

02:14:10.660 --> 02:14:13.220
One is, this is a wonderful profession.

02:14:13.220 --> 02:14:17.380
You have an opportunity to improve the lives of so many

02:14:17.380 --> 02:14:19.180
and do it by having fun,

02:14:19.180 --> 02:14:20.940
the kind of play we're talking about.

02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:23.260
It's an absolute privilege

02:14:23.260 --> 02:14:25.260
to be able to work in this kind of area.

02:14:27.300 --> 02:14:29.140
And to young people looking at the same,

02:14:29.140 --> 02:14:32.740
that have some gifts or desire for this area,

02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:35.780
I say, please, go for it.

02:14:35.780 --> 02:14:36.620
Do what you can.

02:14:36.620 --> 02:14:37.660
So this area of science broadly.

02:14:37.660 --> 02:14:39.620
Yeah, I mean, it could be,

02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:41.300
I don't have any gifts in AI,

02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:42.220
but like, it could be your,

02:14:42.220 --> 02:14:46.300
but or in health or in medicine or whatever,

02:14:46.300 --> 02:14:47.740
whatever your gifts lie,

02:14:47.740 --> 02:14:49.340
develop them, work hard and develop them

02:14:49.340 --> 02:14:50.180
because it's worth it.

02:14:50.180 --> 02:14:54.580
It's worth it not just because you get some status

02:14:54.580 --> 02:14:56.940
because the journey is fun

02:14:56.940 --> 02:15:00.580
and the result is improvements to the lives of so many.

02:15:00.580 --> 02:15:03.260
So I think that that is the encouragement I give.

02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:06.060
I'd also say, if you're looking at this ugliness

02:15:06.060 --> 02:15:09.300
of this debate that's happened over the pandemic,

02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:10.660
I'd say to young people,

02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:13.860
we need you to come in and help transform it.

02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:15.180
Many of the people we've seen in this debate

02:15:15.180 --> 02:15:17.100
that behave poorly,

02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:18.780
I ask that you forgive them.

02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:20.340
I've done my best to try.

02:15:21.820 --> 02:15:26.020
Because many of them are acting out of their own sense

02:15:26.020 --> 02:15:27.420
that they need to do good,

02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:31.660
but the mistake they've made is in this arrogance,

02:15:31.660 --> 02:15:32.500
in this power.

02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:33.340
But when you come in,

02:15:33.340 --> 02:15:35.820
remember that example as a negative example.

02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:38.260
And so that when you join the debate,

02:15:38.260 --> 02:15:40.500
you'll join it in a spirit of humility,

02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:42.460
in a spirit of trying to learn

02:15:42.460 --> 02:15:45.900
while keeping that love that led you

02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:48.300
to enter the field in the first place.

02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:52.620
And yeah, choose forgiveness versus derision.

02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:57.540
Like the people that you know have messed up

02:15:57.540 --> 02:15:59.460
might give them a pass

02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:03.420
because it feels like that's how improvement starts.

02:16:03.420 --> 02:16:05.740
Funny, I've been thinking this is like,

02:16:05.740 --> 02:16:06.940
I told you I'm Christian, right?

02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:10.180
So like God has given me many opportunities

02:16:10.180 --> 02:16:11.580
to forgive people,

02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:12.740
learn to practice how to do that.

02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:13.780
Gave you a gift.

02:16:13.780 --> 02:16:15.540
It's a very humbling thing, I guess.

02:16:15.540 --> 02:16:19.980
Is there a memory from when you were young

02:16:19.980 --> 02:16:22.380
that was very formative to you?

02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:24.620
So you just gave advice to some young people.

02:16:24.620 --> 02:16:26.500
Is there something that stands out to you

02:16:26.500 --> 02:16:30.580
that a decision you made,

02:16:30.580 --> 02:16:32.260
an event that happened

02:16:32.260 --> 02:16:34.260
that made you the man you are today?

02:16:35.580 --> 02:16:38.340
I actually grew up in a relatively poor environment.

02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:42.700
I was born in India and moved when I was four.

02:16:42.700 --> 02:16:45.380
My dad had eight brothers and sisters

02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:48.380
and my mom had four brothers and sisters.

02:16:48.380 --> 02:16:52.380
She grew up in the slum in Calcutta.

02:16:52.380 --> 02:16:54.820
My dad, his dad died when he was young

02:16:54.820 --> 02:16:57.260
and he supported his family, his brothers and sisters

02:16:57.260 --> 02:16:59.180
with university scholarship money.

02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:02.540
Came to the US and my dad worked in a McDonald's,

02:17:02.540 --> 02:17:04.100
even though he was an electrical engineer,

02:17:04.100 --> 02:17:06.580
couldn't find a job in 1971.

02:17:06.580 --> 02:17:08.220
And so I worked at McDonald's.

02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:11.980
We lived in a, like this,

02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:15.500
basically the housing port like development

02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:18.220
in Cambridge, it's like this middle building

02:17:18.220 --> 02:17:20.740
on the 17th floor, this like housing development.

02:17:21.620 --> 02:17:25.060
I mean, I think that was transformative for me.

02:17:25.060 --> 02:17:27.220
Like I didn't realize so much at the time

02:17:27.220 --> 02:17:30.100
well how that experience of being

02:17:30.100 --> 02:17:33.700
essentially like poor lower middle class,

02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:36.300
what effect it had on my outlook.

02:17:36.900 --> 02:17:37.980
You mentioned to me offline that you listened

02:17:37.980 --> 02:17:40.620
to a conversation that I had with my dad.

02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:42.660
What impact did your dad have on your life?

02:17:42.660 --> 02:17:45.020
What memories do you have about him?

02:17:45.020 --> 02:17:46.900
He was a rocket scientist actually.

02:17:46.900 --> 02:17:51.100
He helped design rocket guidance systems.

02:17:51.100 --> 02:17:55.340
He died when I was 20 and I still miss him to this day.

02:17:55.340 --> 02:17:59.740
And I think that experience of seeing him sacrifice

02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:04.740
himself for his family, a brilliant man,

02:18:05.220 --> 02:18:08.620
but in many ways frustrated with like his opportunities

02:18:08.620 --> 02:18:10.340
in the world is partly what led him to come

02:18:10.340 --> 02:18:11.820
to the US in the first place.

02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:16.340
That's transformed, it's had a transformative effect on me.

02:18:16.340 --> 02:18:19.380
And I wish I could tell him that looking back.

02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:25.300
Do you think about your own mortality?

02:18:25.300 --> 02:18:26.900
Do you think about your death?

02:18:26.900 --> 02:18:29.380
Your dad is no longer with us.

02:18:29.380 --> 02:18:34.380
You're the old wise sage that represents.

02:18:35.740 --> 02:18:39.940
I've only worried about death once in this pandemic.

02:18:39.940 --> 02:18:43.060
Although I've had two of my cousins who's 73

02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:47.500
and my uncle who's 74 die in India during the pandemic.

02:18:47.500 --> 02:18:50.020
And I grieve them both from COVID.

02:18:52.700 --> 02:18:55.500
Like the fear of COVID really has only hit me

02:18:55.500 --> 02:18:58.940
only really once during this and it wasn't for me.

02:18:58.940 --> 02:19:01.020
And I recognize this is irrational.

02:19:01.020 --> 02:19:03.380
So on the eve of the Santa Clara County

02:19:03.460 --> 02:19:08.020
seroprevalence study, it was a really interesting thing

02:19:08.020 --> 02:19:10.820
because so many people volunteered to help.

02:19:10.820 --> 02:19:15.820
And my daughter who's 20, I guess she was 19 at the time

02:19:16.740 --> 02:19:18.500
and my wife also volunteered to help

02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:21.100
with like various aspects of the study.

02:19:21.100 --> 02:19:22.060
And so the eve of the study,

02:19:22.060 --> 02:19:24.140
they were going to go out in public

02:19:24.140 --> 02:19:25.820
and I didn't know what the death rate was

02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:27.900
because we hadn't done the study.

02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:30.380
And I suspected it was lower than people were saying,

02:19:30.380 --> 02:19:31.740
but I didn't know.

02:19:31.740 --> 02:19:33.900
I knew about the age gradient

02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:37.180
because I'd seen the Chinese data and my daughter's young,

02:19:37.180 --> 02:19:40.940
but my wife is my age and I didn't know the death rate.

02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:43.660
And I couldn't sleep the night before.

02:19:43.660 --> 02:19:45.900
Like what if I'm putting my family,

02:19:45.900 --> 02:19:48.740
my daughter and my wife at risk

02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:51.140
because of some activity that I'm doing.

02:19:52.260 --> 02:19:53.780
It was kind of, I don't know.

02:19:53.780 --> 02:19:58.780
So it's worried about the wellbeing of others.

02:19:59.060 --> 02:20:00.460
When you look in the mirror.

02:20:00.460 --> 02:20:01.460
If I die, I die.

02:20:01.460 --> 02:20:04.220
I mean, like I just, it's not, again, I'm Christian.

02:20:04.220 --> 02:20:07.980
So I don't, death is not the end for me, I believe.

02:20:07.980 --> 02:20:10.620
And so I don't particularly worried about my own death,

02:20:10.620 --> 02:20:14.460
but I do, I mean, I just, I think we can't help

02:20:14.460 --> 02:20:17.580
but we worry about the wellbeing of our loved ones.

02:20:17.580 --> 02:20:22.220
So from the perspective of God, then let me ask you,

02:20:23.380 --> 02:20:24.460
what do you think is the meaning

02:20:24.460 --> 02:20:25.940
of this whole journey we're on?

02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:28.100
What do you think is the meaning of life?

02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:29.180
You know, it's very simple.

02:20:29.180 --> 02:20:32.660
Love one another, treat your neighbor as yourself.

02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:34.580
It's love, as simple as that.

02:20:35.820 --> 02:20:38.260
Well, I'd love to see a little bit more of that

02:20:38.260 --> 02:20:39.980
in this pandemic.

02:20:39.980 --> 02:20:44.300
It's an opportunity for the best of our nature to shine.

02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:46.500
It's, I've seen some of the worst,

02:20:47.740 --> 02:20:49.820
but I think some of that is just good therapy.

02:20:49.820 --> 02:20:54.820
And I'm hoping in the end, what we have here is love.

02:20:54.940 --> 02:20:57.620
At the very least, make your dad proud

02:20:58.140 --> 02:21:01.140
and I hope that you have some incredible rockets

02:21:01.140 --> 02:21:01.980
that we're launching.

02:21:01.980 --> 02:21:04.580
I think you'd get along well with my dad, Lex.

02:21:04.580 --> 02:21:05.940
I definitely would.

02:21:05.940 --> 02:21:06.780
Thank you so much.

02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:08.900
This is an incredible honor to talk to you, Jay.

02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:11.540
You've been an inspiration to so many people

02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:13.380
and keep fighting the good fight.

02:21:13.380 --> 02:21:15.780
Thank you so much for spending your valuable time

02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:16.620
with me today.

02:21:16.620 --> 02:21:18.500
Thank you for having me here, appreciate it.

And now let me leave you with some words from Alice Walker.

02:21:30.420 --> 02:21:33.220
The most common way people give up their power

02:21:33.220 --> 02:21:35.500
is by thinking they don't have any.

02:21:36.380 --> 02:21:39.380
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
