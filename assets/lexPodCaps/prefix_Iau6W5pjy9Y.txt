The following is a conversation with RZA.

00:03.340 --> 00:06.720
The rapper, record producer, filmmaker, actor, writer,

00:06.720 --> 00:10.680
philosopher, kung fu scholar, and the mastermind

00:10.680 --> 00:14.880
of the legendary hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.260
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:19.260 --> 00:20.480
in the description.

00:20.480 --> 00:23.620
And now, here's my conversation with RZA.

00:24.860 --> 00:27.220
In the Tao of Wu, you're right.

00:27.220 --> 00:29.500
When my mother left the physical world,

00:29.540 --> 00:32.560
I lost one of my main links to the universe.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.300
They say that you have an umbilical cord

00:35.300 --> 00:38.220
and an etheric cord, which is the invisible cord

00:38.220 --> 00:41.400
that attaches you to your soul, your mother's soul,

00:41.400 --> 00:43.260
and all other souls.

00:43.260 --> 00:46.500
When one passes away, you really lose something.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.380
It's physical and mental.

00:48.380 --> 00:49.540
It's real.

00:49.540 --> 00:50.700
Part of you dies.

00:52.500 --> 00:55.060
What have you learned about life from your mother?

00:56.060 --> 00:58.820
I mean, I learned life itself from my mother.

01:01.060 --> 01:03.700
Being one of 11 children

01:05.040 --> 01:10.040
and seeing the sacrifice that she gave to us,

01:10.340 --> 01:12.180
therefore given to life,

01:13.340 --> 01:15.520
it's really the greatest lesson of life.

01:16.780 --> 01:21.320
The thing that shook me as I wrote those words

01:22.320 --> 01:27.320
was coming up young with arrogance,

01:29.520 --> 01:33.260
confidence, knowledge of myself.

01:34.240 --> 01:36.000
They called me the scientists.

01:36.960 --> 01:40.280
We was taught you're the supreme being.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.680
In order to be the supreme being,

01:41.680 --> 01:44.720
you gotta be supreme amongst other beings.

01:47.140 --> 01:50.120
I understand that more now than I did then

01:50.120 --> 01:52.020
because then it was so literal.

01:53.360 --> 01:58.240
The word God derived basically from the Greek language,

01:58.240 --> 02:01.940
as they say, and it meant wisdom, strength, and beauty.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.120
Yeah, we could have that,

02:06.120 --> 02:08.760
but the power to control life and death

02:09.740 --> 02:14.240
is something that you would assume is a God trait.

02:15.320 --> 02:18.320
So now here you are saying that you're a God, right?

02:20.200 --> 02:21.400
And you're reading the Bible,

02:21.400 --> 02:23.640
how Jesus brought back Lazarus.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.440
And now it's your turn to do something.

02:28.360 --> 02:32.320
And when my mother was laying there in the hospital bed

02:32.320 --> 02:34.840
and air was no longer coming out of her lungs

02:34.840 --> 02:36.280
and going into her lungs,

02:37.660 --> 02:39.960
where's my power to bring her back to life?

02:42.200 --> 02:44.720
So you can't truly be God.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.360
You're powerless.

02:46.360 --> 02:48.960
Yeah, or God is not the definition

02:48.960 --> 02:51.600
that we need to use to describe it

02:51.600 --> 02:54.660
because it's a translation of wisdom, strength, and beauty.

02:54.660 --> 02:56.320
So you could be that.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.520
But so I'm answering your question

02:58.520 --> 03:00.000
what did my mother teach me about life?

03:00.000 --> 03:04.360
I learned that day on her physical passing, okay.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.040
You know what I mean?

03:07.040 --> 03:07.880
There's a physical me.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.760
Do you think about her?

03:10.760 --> 03:12.140
Do you miss her?

03:12.140 --> 03:13.760
Of course.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.580
I keep my mother in my prayer every day.

03:17.580 --> 03:22.580
And the thing I pray the most beyond giving thanks is,

03:24.540 --> 03:29.260
I pray that her name is honored and remembered by my family.

03:30.340 --> 03:33.700
I don't know if the world's gonna remember that, right?

03:33.700 --> 03:36.020
Even though if you watch my movie, Love Beach Rhymes,

03:36.020 --> 03:38.300
I named the school in that movie

03:38.300 --> 03:41.740
after my mother just to leave it somewhere else.

03:41.740 --> 03:44.100
Yeah, in physical space, yeah.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.180
Yeah, exactly.

03:45.180 --> 03:47.760
But yeah, painful.

03:47.760 --> 03:51.920
The pain of my mother's passing is indescribable.

03:51.920 --> 03:55.380
Only until it happens to a person they know

03:55.380 --> 03:56.900
and then they won't describe it either.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.580
Only the people that lost their mother,

03:58.580 --> 04:00.860
they can look at each other and they got this nod.

04:00.860 --> 04:01.860
You know what I mean?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.660
But one other thing happened to me

04:05.700 --> 04:08.620
was the joy of life hit me differently.

04:09.620 --> 04:13.780
And I think it was the realization

04:13.780 --> 04:18.780
of my own mortality versus my immortality.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.600
It's a big, big thing.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.020
And I don't know if we'll get to expound on that,

04:25.020 --> 04:26.700
but there was a joy that overcame me

04:26.700 --> 04:30.380
because I was kind of free of a certain illusion

04:30.380 --> 04:34.300
about the immortality of my physical being

04:35.060 --> 04:39.100
versus the mortality of my physical being.

04:39.100 --> 04:42.180
And I was like, okay, wow, I understand.

04:42.180 --> 04:45.840
So that was the first or the hardest realization

04:45.840 --> 04:47.840
you've experienced that you're mortal.

04:48.740 --> 04:50.860
Yeah, and I'll say mortal

04:51.740 --> 04:54.400
and what you're looking at here physically.

04:55.580 --> 04:58.180
I wouldn't say my soul is mortal.

04:58.180 --> 04:59.540
Right, I'll say it's immortal

04:59.540 --> 05:01.240
because at the end of the day,

05:02.240 --> 05:03.840
it's just like I could sit here

05:04.760 --> 05:08.280
and I could just hum please, please, please

05:08.280 --> 05:10.200
by James Brown,

05:10.200 --> 05:14.500
but James Brown is not gonna come in here and do that.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.400
So in some sense, James Brown is still here.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.240
In another sense, he's gone.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.400
Yeah, his soul is here.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.240
His soul.

05:21.240 --> 05:22.420
His soul is here.

05:22.420 --> 05:25.580
Well, it lives through you by you singing it.

05:25.580 --> 05:28.820
It lives through you by you listening to it, celebrating it.

05:28.820 --> 05:32.500
And the hope is that the human species continues

05:32.500 --> 05:34.900
to celebrate the great minds

05:34.900 --> 05:36.880
and the great creations of the past.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.540
I will add this to that equation.

05:41.460 --> 05:43.020
When I say it's immortal,

05:44.280 --> 05:45.860
I don't think it's not just only

05:45.860 --> 05:48.340
because somebody sings it, right?

05:48.340 --> 05:50.940
It's like, where's the fire at right now?

05:52.600 --> 05:54.100
It's in the air.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.340
You just gotta spark the spark.

05:56.340 --> 05:58.860
Yeah.

05:58.860 --> 06:00.180
So it's always there.

06:01.660 --> 06:03.340
Are you afraid of death?

06:03.340 --> 06:05.700
No, I'm not afraid of death.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.260
I'm not trying to see it.

06:08.420 --> 06:10.880
I'm not watching that nowhere near me, right?

06:10.880 --> 06:12.980
Because all I know is life, right?

06:12.980 --> 06:14.160
My life is living.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.500
I read a lot of ancient texts

06:17.500 --> 06:18.700
people probably know about me.

06:18.700 --> 06:21.980
And I love one of the great teachers named Bodhidharma.

06:22.820 --> 06:27.820
And there was a thing written in one of the books of his

06:29.660 --> 06:30.860
or one of the teachings of his.

06:30.860 --> 06:34.860
And the question, somebody asked him similar question.

06:34.860 --> 06:37.380
You're scared of death or what are you gonna be

06:37.380 --> 06:39.500
after you die?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.460
And his answer was, I don't know.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.780
He had answers to everything,

06:43.780 --> 06:44.620
but he was like, I don't know.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.540
They said, oh, he doesn't know that.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.260
He said, yeah, because I haven't died yet.

06:49.300 --> 06:52.100
Well, the uncertainty to some people is terrifying.

06:52.100 --> 06:55.060
Not knowing what's on the other side of the door.

06:55.060 --> 06:56.180
Yeah.

06:56.180 --> 06:58.460
I mean, especially when you're young.

06:58.460 --> 07:03.460
As a kid, fear permeated my life.

07:03.580 --> 07:04.580
You know what I mean?

07:04.580 --> 07:06.420
I was actually watching horror movies

07:06.420 --> 07:10.740
and I believed in all type of supernatural things

07:10.740 --> 07:12.060
that could or can happen.

07:12.060 --> 07:14.460
I thought I saw things as well.

07:14.460 --> 07:18.060
And whether it was being projected from my own mind

07:18.060 --> 07:20.660
or whether it was there visible to me, I don't know.

07:22.380 --> 07:27.380
But life is beautiful and we have it

07:28.220 --> 07:32.900
and we should use it all the way to the last drop.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.860
Realizing the mortality,

07:34.860 --> 07:38.940
the gift your mother gave to you is realizing the immortal

07:38.940 --> 07:42.460
and in so doing, help you realize that life is beautiful.

07:43.860 --> 07:47.060
On this topic, Quincy Jones, I read,

07:47.100 --> 07:50.420
said to ODB and you, when it rains, get wet.

07:51.380 --> 07:52.980
What do these words mean to you?

07:54.900 --> 07:57.540
Well, I think what Quincy was saying at that time was,

07:59.700 --> 08:03.860
I think I was more conservative as a person

08:03.860 --> 08:08.860
and had money, women wanted me.

08:09.140 --> 08:14.140
Anything I kind of wanted, I probably could have had.

08:14.980 --> 08:17.100
And he was just saying, when it rains, get wet,

08:17.100 --> 08:19.420
enjoy this, man, it's raining on you.

08:21.420 --> 08:24.980
Don't put up the umbrella, don't go back in the house.

08:24.980 --> 08:25.860
Get wet.

08:25.860 --> 08:27.140
Experience the moment.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.500
Yeah, and enjoy it.

08:28.500 --> 08:32.660
And I didn't take total heed to him at that time.

08:32.660 --> 08:35.380
A couple of years later, I took some heed.

08:35.380 --> 08:39.460
But at that time, I didn't take heed and when I took heed,

08:40.460 --> 08:44.460
I think that I may have misinterpreted

08:45.540 --> 08:47.700
by looking at his example of getting wet

08:47.700 --> 08:49.540
versus my example of getting wet.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.900
And I can tell you right now, I'm getting wet right now,

08:53.900 --> 08:55.620
in my way.

08:55.620 --> 08:58.340
In part, thanks to your mother, but overall,

08:58.340 --> 09:01.060
you just learned how to appreciate the rain,

09:01.060 --> 09:04.180
just like the experience of every moment.

09:04.180 --> 09:05.340
Yeah, and I'll share this with you

09:05.340 --> 09:07.940
because this is gonna be a very open conversation

09:08.460 --> 09:09.980
and I haven't had this conversation.

09:09.980 --> 09:12.740
So definitely in part to my mother,

09:12.740 --> 09:14.060
then in part to my wife.

09:15.340 --> 09:19.580
I meet my wife, it's my second wife,

09:19.580 --> 09:22.340
but I met her after my mother passed.

09:22.340 --> 09:25.300
And she was just a friend, some girl I met

09:25.300 --> 09:27.140
and thought she was beautiful

09:27.140 --> 09:29.260
and actually built a friendship with her.

09:31.260 --> 09:35.700
But a few years later, when the relationship became like,

09:35.700 --> 09:37.740
this is gonna be my woman,

09:38.660 --> 09:42.060
when I was doing the middle of my divorce

09:42.060 --> 09:44.780
and I was like, do I run wild?

09:44.780 --> 09:48.020
And hey, me and my wife already filed,

09:48.020 --> 09:51.260
we were separated and do I run wild?

09:51.260 --> 09:53.100
And I didn't run wild, a little bit,

09:53.100 --> 09:54.660
but not too wild, right?

09:56.660 --> 10:00.340
You know, I'm still a man, I'm a hip hop guy.

10:00.340 --> 10:01.620
I read you know how to party.

10:01.620 --> 10:02.860
Yeah, exactly.

10:02.860 --> 10:06.620
But the funny thing is that my wife now,

10:06.660 --> 10:10.140
her name is Tilani, my uncle said,

10:10.140 --> 10:15.060
she reminds me of your mother.

10:15.060 --> 10:17.900
He knew my mother before I knew my mother.

10:18.940 --> 10:23.700
And he saw that and we ended up dating,

10:25.300 --> 10:28.540
got engaged and then her mother passed us.

10:30.740 --> 10:35.740
And so now there's a total understanding of everything

10:35.740 --> 10:38.620
and we actually help build each other back up.

10:38.620 --> 10:42.380
So of course I have to thank my mother for the awareness.

10:43.380 --> 10:47.860
Then I thank my wife for bringing that awareness

10:47.860 --> 10:52.860
to actualization, like to actually feel,

10:52.900 --> 10:54.580
I don't think I'll be talking to you right now

10:54.580 --> 10:56.780
and talking as much as I do these days,

10:56.780 --> 11:00.020
if it wasn't for the security and peace and harmony

11:00.020 --> 11:05.020
that I was able to gain at home, you know, so.

11:05.620 --> 11:07.980
And like you said, you now share that look

11:07.980 --> 11:12.580
of having both lost your mom.

11:14.020 --> 11:16.380
What have you learned from Quincy about music,

11:16.380 --> 11:17.980
about business, about life?

11:19.700 --> 11:23.940
Quincy Jones is a great mind, a great artist,

11:23.940 --> 11:26.140
you know, a treasure in all reality.

11:27.060 --> 11:30.740
He's seen it from when it was, he couldn't walk in this,

11:30.740 --> 11:34.060
he couldn't eat in the same place as he played his music at

11:34.060 --> 11:36.900
to owning places bigger than ours.

11:36.900 --> 11:38.660
So what a beautiful life, you know?

11:41.820 --> 11:44.540
He's the type of guy, if you spend one hour with him,

11:45.660 --> 11:48.860
you got a lifetime of information.

11:48.860 --> 11:51.020
And I was blessed to spend multiple hours with him

11:51.020 --> 11:51.860
and days with him.

11:51.860 --> 11:54.020
And you know, there's a certain period of time

11:54.020 --> 11:55.500
where we came across each other

11:55.500 --> 11:59.580
and he was always there to share the knowledge.

11:59.580 --> 12:01.820
Like that's another thing about him that I think is special.

12:02.580 --> 12:04.900
Hopefully, I picked that up,

12:04.900 --> 12:09.220
is that he's always willing to share.

12:09.220 --> 12:12.060
Share with his experience, his knowledge.

12:12.060 --> 12:17.060
I mean, I think he'll even share his home

12:17.420 --> 12:19.860
to the right person if he feels that that's what they need

12:19.860 --> 12:20.900
to get back on their feet.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.260
He's a very beautiful man.

12:23.460 --> 12:26.020
So just the kindness, the goodness of the man

12:26.020 --> 12:28.820
is like the thing that really rubbed off on you.

12:28.820 --> 12:31.220
Yeah, I mean, minimum, right?

12:31.220 --> 12:36.220
I mean, Quincy Jones also in his 50s as a producer

12:36.540 --> 12:39.820
produced one of the greatest albums of all time

12:39.820 --> 12:41.860
and one of the greatest selling albums of all time.

12:41.860 --> 12:45.780
Not just great critically, economically great.

12:45.780 --> 12:49.780
And I mean, I think he did it at the age I am right now,

12:49.780 --> 12:51.580
so I might have a great year coming up.

12:51.580 --> 12:52.420
Yeah.

12:55.260 --> 12:56.380
Timing well, yeah.

12:57.340 --> 13:00.220
So now you got a taste of what greatness is.

13:00.220 --> 13:03.540
You get to see what greatness is, so you know what-

13:03.540 --> 13:04.380
It's happy.

13:04.380 --> 13:05.220
You need to do something.

13:05.220 --> 13:06.700
Yeah.

13:06.700 --> 13:08.620
You have a few people you've worked with

13:08.620 --> 13:11.980
who are fascinating like yourself, Quentin Tarantino.

13:11.980 --> 13:12.940
You work with him.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.420
When somebody asked you to describe him with one word,

13:16.420 --> 13:18.540
you said encyclopedia.

13:18.540 --> 13:19.980
What have you learned from the guy

13:19.980 --> 13:22.740
about filmmaking and about life again?

13:22.740 --> 13:25.060
A very generous man with his knowledge.

13:25.060 --> 13:28.740
And for me, he shared it, I think in a way

13:28.740 --> 13:30.780
that was unique in a sense of,

13:31.780 --> 13:35.860
no, at a point in time, we just was super duper tight,

13:35.860 --> 13:39.300
like I'm going to his crib and watching movies

13:39.300 --> 13:42.940
and just having long conversations about art

13:42.940 --> 13:45.300
and about life, you know what I mean?

13:46.780 --> 13:48.020
So I learned a lot.

13:48.020 --> 13:51.500
I consider him, especially when it comes to anything

13:51.500 --> 13:54.220
cinematic in my life, I consider him

13:54.220 --> 13:56.340
the godfather of that for me.

13:56.340 --> 14:01.340
I think I humbly asked him to mentor me,

14:02.180 --> 14:04.580
which is a very humbling thing to do,

14:04.580 --> 14:07.220
coming from my neighborhood, coming from who I am,

14:07.220 --> 14:10.980
coming from, I was already a multi-platinum artist.

14:12.820 --> 14:16.140
I mean, it was the year, it was past the year 2000 already.

14:16.140 --> 14:20.220
So it was like 2001, 2002 that I asked him to mentor me.

14:20.220 --> 14:23.580
So I was the wizard already, you know what I mean?

14:23.580 --> 14:28.460
But I humbled myself because I saw in him

14:28.460 --> 14:33.460
a craft of brain power that to me resonated with me,

14:34.260 --> 14:37.860
but I was just a Patamon at it, I was a novice at it

14:38.820 --> 14:42.460
because I was trying to make movies in my music,

14:42.460 --> 14:45.300
trying to make videos and here was a man

14:45.300 --> 14:48.780
who was a master of it and an encyclopedia of it as well.

14:50.380 --> 14:51.540
Like film history.

14:51.540 --> 14:54.260
Film history from whether it's the actor,

14:54.260 --> 14:56.660
the director, the cinematographer,

14:56.660 --> 14:58.500
maybe even the costume designer.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.700
He may know 50, 60, he may know the 50 greatest

15:01.700 --> 15:03.420
costume designers in his memory.

15:04.260 --> 15:06.380
Yeah, I mean, it's God's brain.

15:06.380 --> 15:08.180
Both of you have pretty good memory.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.740
I'd love to be a fly on the wall with that conversation.

15:12.740 --> 15:14.580
And Kung Fu movies, most of you guys.

15:14.580 --> 15:19.580
We actually started, I think we started our relationship

15:19.740 --> 15:21.540
trying to outdo each other.

15:21.540 --> 15:22.860
Knowledge-wise or what?

15:22.860 --> 15:24.860
Yeah, movie knowledge-wise.

15:24.860 --> 15:27.300
Actually Kung Fu movie knowledge-wise.

15:27.300 --> 15:29.740
And I think that, if it wasn't another category,

15:29.740 --> 15:33.260
I wouldn't have had a chance, but at least in that category,

15:33.260 --> 15:35.180
I was pretty holding my weight.

15:35.180 --> 15:36.220
Who won?

15:36.220 --> 15:37.460
You know what?

15:37.460 --> 15:42.100
I'll be honest and say that I may have said a few

15:42.100 --> 15:44.940
he didn't see, but Quinn is older than me.

15:45.780 --> 15:47.980
So he could go back farther.

15:47.980 --> 15:51.340
Yeah, he could go back to 72 when I didn't see one yet.

15:51.340 --> 15:52.180
You know what I mean?

15:52.180 --> 15:53.020
Yeah.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.100
Well, he said, Master of the Flying Gate Team

15:55.100 --> 15:58.180
that I got a chance to, that you commentated over today

15:58.180 --> 16:00.180
and I got a chance to see the screening of.

16:00.180 --> 16:02.660
He said that's one of his favorites.

16:03.780 --> 16:08.020
For you, the 36th Chamber of Shaolin,

16:08.020 --> 16:10.100
the Master Killer is your favorite.

16:10.100 --> 16:14.420
Best ever, would you say that's the greatest Kung Fu

16:14.420 --> 16:15.260
movie ever?

16:16.020 --> 16:18.100
It's hard to say the greatest ever, right?

16:18.100 --> 16:20.140
Because somebody may make another one

16:20.140 --> 16:22.580
and it depends on your own phase of life,

16:22.580 --> 16:27.580
but I will put that first.

16:27.980 --> 16:30.220
If I want to introduce somebody to Kung Fu movies,

16:30.220 --> 16:32.340
that's a beautiful entry.

16:32.340 --> 16:35.020
You talk about knowledge, you talk about wisdom.

16:35.020 --> 16:39.300
What kind of wisdom do you draw from Kung Fu movies?

16:39.300 --> 16:40.140
You know what?

16:40.140 --> 16:42.460
The martial art itself and the movies.

16:42.540 --> 16:46.380
It's endless wisdom to be drawn and I draw it, you know?

16:47.620 --> 16:49.580
I draw it in a way, you know,

16:49.580 --> 16:52.540
that I could decipher it in my own life.

16:53.500 --> 16:58.500
So for instance, in the movie, Master Killer,

17:00.740 --> 17:04.060
he basically, when he does Kung Fu,

17:04.060 --> 17:08.020
he does a really, a style called the Hung Gar technique.

17:08.020 --> 17:12.980
And the director of the movie is actually a Hung Gar expert

17:12.980 --> 17:15.820
who has a lineage that traces all the way back

17:15.820 --> 17:17.100
to Shaolin temple.

17:17.100 --> 17:21.460
And this director always wanted to keep his movies pure

17:21.460 --> 17:23.380
and to bring Hung Gar to the world.

17:23.380 --> 17:26.460
It's like he wanted to show the world this lineage.

17:26.460 --> 17:29.580
In fact, you just said Master of the Flying Guillotine

17:29.580 --> 17:30.820
is Quentin's favorite movie.

17:30.820 --> 17:33.100
And we mentioned in 36 Chambers, it's my favorite movie,

17:33.100 --> 17:36.860
but the action director of Master of the Flying Guillotine

17:36.860 --> 17:40.780
is the director of 36 Chambers of Shaolin.

17:40.780 --> 17:43.100
And some of the things that's happening

17:43.100 --> 17:45.820
in Master of the Flying Guillotine

17:45.820 --> 17:49.740
is really the infant stage of what this action director

17:49.740 --> 17:53.460
is gonna learn and then use later on in his movies.

17:53.460 --> 17:54.540
So that's the beauty of it.

17:54.540 --> 17:57.300
It's almost like, you know,

17:57.300 --> 17:59.900
Quentin is seeing him in his generation.

17:59.900 --> 18:02.340
So Quentin might have been the same age I was

18:02.340 --> 18:03.180
watching that movie.

18:03.180 --> 18:05.100
And then when he becomes a director,

18:05.140 --> 18:08.020
I'm at Quentin's age and now I'm seeing his work.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.660
So some symbionic relationship there.

18:10.660 --> 18:13.020
And I'll end this question by saying,

18:14.500 --> 18:18.240
Hung Gar deals with the five animal technique,

18:18.240 --> 18:20.900
the tiger, the crane, right?

18:20.900 --> 18:24.580
The leopard, the snake, and the dragon.

18:24.580 --> 18:26.420
Those are the five, that's the five pattern.

18:26.420 --> 18:27.860
Some people go seven, some go 12,

18:27.860 --> 18:30.740
but it's a stick to the five pattern and fist.

18:30.740 --> 18:35.420
How do a man emulate a tiger?

18:36.980 --> 18:39.040
And you see a tiger's fist.

18:40.380 --> 18:43.600
He curls before he spawns on you.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.540
How does a man emulate a snake?

18:47.700 --> 18:50.980
It doesn't have to be only in the kung fu move.

18:50.980 --> 18:54.780
It's in the ideology of the snake.

18:54.780 --> 18:59.780
It's in the agility of the crane at any moment.

19:00.180 --> 19:04.480
Sometimes punching a person is not gonna work,

19:04.480 --> 19:07.260
as they would say in leopard fist or tiger paw.

19:07.260 --> 19:10.820
So sometimes you might have to poke him in the eye

19:10.820 --> 19:12.800
with the crane's beak.

19:12.800 --> 19:16.340
So having your mind able to adapt the instinct

19:17.300 --> 19:20.700
of the animal when you are being attacked,

19:20.700 --> 19:22.640
or when you are being the aggressor,

19:24.140 --> 19:26.620
that's something that you don't need a form for.

19:26.620 --> 19:27.540
That's the mentality.

19:27.540 --> 19:30.820
So kung fu, like I said, it influenced me endlessly

19:30.820 --> 19:34.580
because at first I was trying to learn on a whole,

19:34.580 --> 19:36.740
like I can't really hit you with that and really hurt you

19:36.740 --> 19:37.900
unless I've been banging my hand

19:37.900 --> 19:39.780
a thousand times on some bricks

19:39.780 --> 19:43.460
and made it so callous or muscles are so strong.

19:43.460 --> 19:47.740
But the idea that if me and you was to get into a fight

19:47.740 --> 19:50.900
and I'm gonna tiger up on you and take that instinct

19:50.900 --> 19:53.300
and prance when I'm a prance,

19:53.300 --> 19:58.260
or fly away like the stork, you know what I mean?

19:58.260 --> 20:00.660
Like, yo, that's the mentality.

20:00.660 --> 20:02.820
It's much more than the technical moves.

20:02.820 --> 20:04.860
It's much deeper.

20:06.660 --> 20:07.500
Yeah, it's interesting.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.940
I mean, when I see the kung fu movies,

20:08.940 --> 20:11.900
because I love martial arts, all martial arts,

20:11.900 --> 20:13.060
and competitive ones too,

20:13.060 --> 20:15.140
like the actual competitions and so on.

20:15.140 --> 20:18.460
It just seems like kung fu movies go much deeper

20:18.460 --> 20:20.020
than just like the techniques.

20:20.860 --> 20:23.220
They stork, I mean, if you see it, right?

20:23.220 --> 20:25.740
Even I watched a great MMA fight recently.

20:27.060 --> 20:30.100
Just interesting, because he was on top of the guy,

20:32.540 --> 20:34.300
and the way he got from under him,

20:38.340 --> 20:42.180
it had to be his spirit got from under him.

20:42.180 --> 20:45.140
It's some like mixture of crane and whatever.

20:45.140 --> 20:48.900
Snake, ill, with the slippery ill technique.

20:49.620 --> 20:52.900
No, I love that when people become artists in the cage,

20:52.900 --> 20:56.020
or it's much bigger than just like winning,

20:56.020 --> 20:57.780
much bigger than particular techniques.

20:57.780 --> 21:00.620
It's just art, especially at the highest level competition

21:00.620 --> 21:02.700
where millions of people are watching.

21:02.700 --> 21:04.020
Which is pressure within itself.

21:04.020 --> 21:09.020
Yes, that's art under pressure is even more beautiful art.

21:10.140 --> 21:11.740
You know, you look at some of these fights,

21:11.740 --> 21:14.700
and you wonder like why somebody wins and lose.

21:15.700 --> 21:19.300
And sometimes the less talented guy could win

21:19.300 --> 21:21.580
because he could deal with the pressure.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.220
But the other guy, he could have beat him

21:23.220 --> 21:25.620
there with somewhere else, but not in this arena.

21:28.260 --> 21:31.900
So you're a scholar of history, including hip hop history.

21:33.180 --> 21:35.420
I've listened to so many of your interviews.

21:35.420 --> 21:38.460
You've spoken brilliantly about some of the big figures

21:38.460 --> 21:43.220
in hip hop history, Tupac, Biggie, Nas, many others.

21:44.180 --> 21:47.020
Maybe let's look at Tupac and Biggie.

21:47.020 --> 21:49.700
What made them special in the history of music?

21:50.700 --> 21:52.700
That's a good question.

21:52.700 --> 21:56.020
So I don't know if I'm the authority to answer it,

21:56.020 --> 21:58.660
but I'll just speak my piece on it.

21:58.660 --> 22:00.580
And maybe I could just add on,

22:00.580 --> 22:01.900
because I'm sure it's a lot of people

22:01.900 --> 22:05.140
that spend a lot of time with them that could speak on it.

22:05.140 --> 22:06.980
But just as a fellow artist,

22:07.980 --> 22:12.980
I think not only was B.I.G. a dope lyricist,

22:14.540 --> 22:18.900
I think he had a voice that was really immaculate

22:19.820 --> 22:24.820
in the sense that some rappers get on top of music

22:26.180 --> 22:27.540
and you gotta get used to them

22:27.540 --> 22:30.740
when you got a vibe with them.

22:30.740 --> 22:35.740
But he make a record sounds like a record immediately.

22:37.940 --> 22:41.140
If you go back and listen to his music,

22:41.140 --> 22:43.500
you could take his voice and put it on anything.

22:43.500 --> 22:47.380
And for some reason, it sounds like a record.

22:47.380 --> 22:48.220
You know what I mean?

22:48.220 --> 22:50.420
You mean just like the raw voice of the man?

22:50.420 --> 22:51.260
Yeah.

22:51.260 --> 22:52.860
So you could just listen to it raw

22:52.860 --> 22:54.260
and it sounds like a record.

22:54.260 --> 22:56.420
Yeah, but if you put a beat,

22:56.420 --> 22:58.340
take his voice and put it on any beat,

22:59.460 --> 23:04.260
he just has a voice, it's immaculate, you know?

23:04.260 --> 23:06.500
So his lyrical skills and all that was great.

23:07.860 --> 23:10.180
And you gotta think once again,

23:10.180 --> 23:12.940
he's doing all this, he's not even 25 years old.

23:12.940 --> 23:14.140
Yeah, yeah.

23:15.340 --> 23:18.860
Then you go to Pac, once again, immaculate voice.

23:18.860 --> 23:23.860
But what Pac had, I think, was a way of touching us

23:25.500 --> 23:27.860
on all of our emotions.

23:27.860 --> 23:30.940
And especially on, like Pac had the power

23:30.940 --> 23:33.780
to infuse your emotional thought,

23:33.780 --> 23:36.220
like Brenda has a baby, their momma.

23:37.300 --> 23:41.620
But then he had the power to arouse the rebel in you.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.220
You know?

23:44.220 --> 23:45.060
Yeah.

23:45.060 --> 23:46.140
And those two things,

23:48.580 --> 23:52.020
actually, he was probably more dangerous

23:53.780 --> 23:56.500
than Big, Notorious B.I.G.

23:56.500 --> 23:59.420
Like Notorious B.I.G., we could party with him.

23:59.420 --> 24:01.420
To this day, we're still,

24:01.420 --> 24:04.260
but Pac was probably going to a point,

24:04.260 --> 24:07.860
you know, he was more going into the Malcolm X of things,

24:07.860 --> 24:12.260
and society fears that.

24:12.260 --> 24:15.460
Yeah, so he was really good at communicating love

24:15.460 --> 24:18.980
and at starting revolutions.

24:18.980 --> 24:20.140
Yeah, yeah.

24:20.140 --> 24:21.060
And that's dangerous.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.500
Very dangerous.

24:22.500 --> 24:24.780
And they communicated love,

24:24.780 --> 24:26.740
but he wasn't starting revolutions.

24:26.740 --> 24:29.980
Well, it's interesting to think about

24:29.980 --> 24:32.740
what the world would be like if they were still with us.

24:32.740 --> 24:36.940
But it's the way the world, Hendricks,

24:36.940 --> 24:39.700
a lot of those guys just go too soon.

24:39.700 --> 24:41.060
Yeah, it's a peculiar thing.

24:41.060 --> 24:43.860
You know, you asked me earlier,

24:43.860 --> 24:45.260
am I scared of death?

24:47.380 --> 24:49.780
And I answered you, no, I'm not scared of death.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.420
I mean, I'm not trying to see it, though.

24:51.420 --> 24:52.780
You know what I mean?

24:52.780 --> 24:55.340
It's like, that was the block of death.

24:55.340 --> 24:57.740
It's like, I'm not really going right there right now.

24:57.980 --> 25:00.020
I'm making a left or right turn.

25:00.020 --> 25:00.980
You know what I mean?

25:00.980 --> 25:05.100
Unless it was mandatory for some greaterness, greater good.

25:05.100 --> 25:07.620
It's like, okay, I gotta drive through that.

25:07.620 --> 25:08.460
You know what I mean?

25:08.460 --> 25:09.900
Yeah, but it can still happen.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.780
That's the meditation on death part,

25:11.780 --> 25:14.300
where you could die at the end of today.

25:14.300 --> 25:15.820
Yeah, you could die.

25:15.820 --> 25:17.500
Well, dying and death,

25:17.500 --> 25:19.700
I think is two different things, personally.

25:21.060 --> 25:23.260
The process, you mean, of death, or just?

25:23.260 --> 25:24.780
Yeah, I mean, you could die.

25:24.780 --> 25:26.580
Like I said, you could die every day.

25:26.580 --> 25:29.820
You could die and not be yourself.

25:29.820 --> 25:30.980
You know what I mean?

25:30.980 --> 25:32.740
Which is crazy.

25:32.740 --> 25:35.820
But to get to a point of no return,

25:35.820 --> 25:38.260
you know, and that's a whole nother chamber.

25:38.260 --> 25:39.900
I mean, there's some sense in which

25:41.420 --> 25:46.100
RZA, the producer, becomes somebody else completely

25:46.100 --> 25:47.180
when you're making a film,

25:47.180 --> 25:50.540
becomes somebody else completely when you're,

25:50.540 --> 25:52.620
I don't know, playing chess, becomes completely,

25:52.620 --> 25:55.820
we need something different when you do kung fu

25:55.820 --> 25:58.740
or watch kung fu or when you're a family man.

25:58.740 --> 25:59.980
All of those are little deaths

25:59.980 --> 26:02.300
when you transition from one place to another.

26:02.300 --> 26:04.260
So it's not like you're one being.

26:04.260 --> 26:06.540
You're many things.

26:06.540 --> 26:07.380
Yeah.

26:07.380 --> 26:09.940
I would describe that as all life, though.

26:09.940 --> 26:12.660
Yeah, it's fun.

26:14.100 --> 26:18.220
Outside of you and anybody on Wu-Tang,

26:18.220 --> 26:21.940
who is the greatest rapper from a lyrics,

26:21.940 --> 26:24.660
like a Wart Smith perspective in hip hop history,

26:24.660 --> 26:25.620
or some of the greatest?

26:26.460 --> 26:27.300
Maybe some candidates.

26:27.300 --> 26:28.620
Let's name a few.

26:28.620 --> 26:32.300
I mean, you're gonna have to start with Rakim, you know?

26:32.300 --> 26:34.700
You're gonna have to pick Kuji Rap in there.

26:34.700 --> 26:35.700
You know what I mean?

26:35.700 --> 26:36.660
So going back.

26:36.660 --> 26:38.020
Yeah, you're gonna have to pick up

26:38.020 --> 26:38.900
with those brothers first.

26:38.900 --> 26:41.580
You might have to, if you want to get technical,

26:41.580 --> 26:43.860
you might have to start with Grandmaster Kaz.

26:43.860 --> 26:44.700
You know what I mean?

26:44.700 --> 26:46.500
Who you might not, you might not even have heard of.

26:46.500 --> 26:47.340
Nope.

26:47.340 --> 26:48.180
You know what I mean?

26:48.180 --> 26:49.420
But you may have sung his lyrics

26:49.420 --> 26:52.140
every time you sang Sugarhill Rapper's Delight.

26:52.140 --> 26:52.980
That's his?

26:52.980 --> 26:53.820
That was it.

26:54.060 --> 26:56.740
They copied his and they made it theirs.

26:59.100 --> 27:02.660
What point being made, but I'll name a couple more.

27:02.660 --> 27:04.580
I gotta put Nas in that category.

27:05.660 --> 27:07.420
You know, we got a chess board in front of us

27:07.420 --> 27:10.380
and one of the greatest chess players,

27:10.380 --> 27:13.180
the youngest Grandmaster, you know,

27:13.180 --> 27:18.180
before, I think, Carlson was Bobby Fischer, right?

27:21.860 --> 27:23.500
So let's use Bobby Fischer as American.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.180
One of the greatest American chess players.

27:25.180 --> 27:27.740
Of course, Susan Polgar may have tied his record

27:27.740 --> 27:29.900
as the youngest Grandmaster

27:29.900 --> 27:32.940
and she's the youngest female Grandmaster, I think, to date.

27:32.940 --> 27:37.540
But he was a master at what, 14?

27:37.540 --> 27:39.540
Yeah, something like that.

27:39.540 --> 27:44.540
So now, to me, I met Nas when he was 15.

27:44.660 --> 27:46.820
He was already a master lyricist.

27:46.820 --> 27:49.300
It takes about 10 years to become a master lyricist.

27:49.300 --> 27:52.780
So by the time the world heard Wu-Tang,

27:52.820 --> 27:55.980
most of us had 10 years of rapping in us already.

27:55.980 --> 27:58.940
So that's why you met us at mastery level.

27:58.940 --> 28:02.300
The Jizzle was already a master when Nas was a master,

28:02.300 --> 28:04.940
but Jizzle was 21, Nas was 15.

28:06.860 --> 28:09.380
Nas is like the Mozart of rap.

28:09.380 --> 28:11.220
Yeah, or the Bobby Fischer.

28:11.220 --> 28:13.660
Bobby Fischer, just born something in him,

28:13.660 --> 28:15.300
or maybe those early years,

28:15.300 --> 28:20.060
just because he's not just good at the lyrics.

28:20.060 --> 28:22.700
He's also, he goes deep with it.

28:23.620 --> 28:25.340
Just like you, so he's like, there's depth.

28:25.340 --> 28:30.340
It's not just mastery of the word smithing.

28:30.980 --> 28:35.980
It's just the message you actually send across, yeah.

28:36.460 --> 28:40.740
Into a small phrase, right?

28:40.740 --> 28:42.180
That's the whole thing of energy.

28:42.180 --> 28:46.740
How do we condense all that energy into this

28:46.740 --> 28:48.980
so that it can fuel that?

28:49.940 --> 28:52.860
And he's definitely one of those artist emcees

28:52.860 --> 28:54.180
that does that.

28:54.180 --> 28:56.460
And he was doing it at 15.

28:56.460 --> 28:58.100
Like I said, I'm thinking five years

28:58.100 --> 29:00.340
or four or five years older than Nas.

29:00.340 --> 29:03.220
So I was always feeling my confidence

29:03.220 --> 29:04.300
of what I was doing, boy.

29:04.300 --> 29:06.260
I was like, this kid is only 15.

29:07.820 --> 29:09.700
I got to step up my game.

29:09.700 --> 29:12.940
When he turned 19, then we got your Matic.

29:12.940 --> 29:13.780
Yeah.

29:15.180 --> 29:18.860
From you, what are the best and most memorable lyrics?

29:18.860 --> 29:19.900
You've ever written.

29:22.140 --> 29:24.180
Well, that's a hard question for me.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.580
The stuff stand out, like stuff you're really proud of

29:26.580 --> 29:29.700
that was like important in your career.

29:29.700 --> 29:34.700
Yeah, I mean, I think I did a song called Sunshower.

29:35.740 --> 29:38.460
I don't know if we put it on the Wu-Tang forever double CD

29:38.460 --> 29:40.820
but only on the international version.

29:42.140 --> 29:44.580
But if anybody could go get those lyrics

29:44.580 --> 29:46.060
and write those lyrics down,

29:46.060 --> 29:47.460
you could just put that in your pocket

29:47.460 --> 29:48.940
and I'm sure that it'll answer

29:48.940 --> 29:51.380
at least about 25% of your life's problems.

29:52.980 --> 29:55.340
Well, there's a good one, Sunshine,

29:55.340 --> 29:58.100
where you talk about religion and God, that's good.

29:58.100 --> 30:00.020
Tomorrow, I think it's on A Diagram.

30:01.700 --> 30:02.740
I'm not a record guy.

30:02.740 --> 30:03.580
Yeah. I'm a song guy.

30:03.580 --> 30:04.740
It might have been A Diagram.

30:04.740 --> 30:06.540
Do you have a lyric from it?

30:06.540 --> 30:08.900
Yeah, the answer to all questions.

30:08.900 --> 30:10.100
You're talking about God.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.060
Yeah.

30:11.060 --> 30:14.220
The spark of all suggestions of righteousness,

30:14.220 --> 30:16.380
the pathway to the road of perfection

30:16.380 --> 30:19.140
who gives you all and never asks more of you,

30:19.140 --> 30:22.380
the faithful companion that fights every war with you

30:22.380 --> 30:24.660
before the mortal view of the pre-historical,

30:24.660 --> 30:26.980
historical, he's the all in all

30:26.980 --> 30:30.020
you searching for the oracle, that's a good line, man.

30:30.020 --> 30:31.780
This is so good.

30:31.780 --> 30:34.020
A Mission Impossible is purely philosophical

30:34.020 --> 30:36.420
but you can call on your deathbed

30:36.420 --> 30:37.820
when you're laying in the hospital.

30:37.820 --> 30:39.500
You will call him on your deathbed.

30:39.500 --> 30:42.940
I had a big, I have a scientist friend,

30:42.940 --> 30:45.580
well, my wife's best friend, Rebecca,

30:47.220 --> 30:49.100
she married a scientist, they both scientists,

30:49.100 --> 30:51.980
they both were scientists and she married Dr. Neal.

30:51.980 --> 30:55.740
I'm not going to say their last names

30:55.740 --> 30:59.740
but Neal and Rebecca, my wife's best friend,

30:59.740 --> 31:01.820
so they come over and me and Neal,

31:01.820 --> 31:06.820
we go through the longest debates of science and religion

31:07.100 --> 31:10.300
and we just go, we could go break day with it.

31:10.300 --> 31:14.740
And before he had a child,

31:15.620 --> 31:20.620
he was more adamant and there's,

31:21.300 --> 31:23.380
don't believe in God, you know what I mean?

31:23.380 --> 31:25.980
After a child, he still kept his thing

31:25.980 --> 31:27.420
but I just hit him with the question,

31:27.420 --> 31:29.100
if you was about to die,

31:29.100 --> 31:31.220
because now you got a child to think about, right?

31:31.220 --> 31:33.100
It's different when you thinking about yourself.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.980
If you was about to die,

31:34.980 --> 31:37.180
you don't think you're going to make that call.

31:37.180 --> 31:39.500
He's like, I'll make that call.

31:40.540 --> 31:42.500
And it kind of inspired my lyric

31:42.500 --> 31:44.940
because it was like, yeah, who, you gonna?

31:45.940 --> 31:48.100
And I just want to say, so you mentioned lyric,

31:48.100 --> 31:49.620
that is one of my favorite lyrics

31:49.620 --> 31:54.620
but that's part two to Sunshower was the prequel to Sunshine.

31:57.260 --> 31:59.740
So if you ever get a chance to check out Sunshower,

32:00.740 --> 32:04.220
it starts off with trouble follows a wicked mind.

32:04.220 --> 32:07.900
2020 vision of the prism of life

32:07.900 --> 32:10.100
but still blind because you lack the inner.

32:11.100 --> 32:12.540
So every sinner could end up

32:12.540 --> 32:15.500
in the everlasting winter of hell fire.

32:16.780 --> 32:19.460
With thorns and splinters prick your eye out,

32:19.460 --> 32:22.060
you cry out, your words fly out,

32:22.060 --> 32:24.100
but you remain unheard.

32:24.100 --> 32:28.300
Suffering internal and external,

32:28.300 --> 32:31.420
along with the wicked fraternal of generals and colonels,

32:31.420 --> 32:33.020
letting off thermal nuclear heats

32:33.020 --> 32:36.980
that burns you firmly and permanently upon the journey

32:36.980 --> 32:39.420
through the journal of the book of life.

32:39.580 --> 32:41.980
But those who took a life without justice

32:41.980 --> 32:43.900
will become just ice.

32:44.900 --> 32:47.100
It's been taught your worst enemy

32:47.100 --> 32:49.740
couldn't harm you as much as your own wicked thoughts.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.580
But people ought be not and listen wrought.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.100
So they find themselves persecuted

32:57.100 --> 32:58.820
inside their own universal court.

33:00.580 --> 33:03.820
So that is a long one, it's like a three pager.

33:03.820 --> 33:05.140
Wow, that is about life.

33:05.140 --> 33:06.620
That's like character integrity,

33:06.620 --> 33:10.420
how to be in this world

33:10.420 --> 33:12.220
and that ultimately connects to God.

33:13.780 --> 33:15.740
Who is God to you?

33:15.740 --> 33:16.980
I'm glad you just asked that question

33:16.980 --> 33:18.900
because I actually,

33:19.780 --> 33:22.860
I'm gonna have to make a distinguishable separation here.

33:23.820 --> 33:24.660
All right.

33:26.860 --> 33:28.860
And it's funny because I heard recently,

33:30.580 --> 33:34.740
I heard a rabbi was debating with this historian,

33:34.740 --> 33:36.740
Dr. Ben, I can't pronounce Dr. Ben name,

33:36.740 --> 33:40.260
but there was a debate and in the debate,

33:40.260 --> 33:43.780
they started going back through the etymology.

33:44.860 --> 33:47.620
They went way back beyond antiquity

33:47.620 --> 33:48.700
because they was debating.

33:48.700 --> 33:52.380
And so there was some things, they was going deep

33:52.380 --> 33:54.460
and they really went far, far back

33:54.460 --> 33:57.820
to kind of the first word of God.

33:58.820 --> 34:00.820
And it was, when they pronounced it

34:00.820 --> 34:02.780
on this particular debate, it was Allah.

34:03.780 --> 34:05.780
And they said from that, they got Elohim.

34:08.020 --> 34:11.860
I've already agreed in my heart, in my life

34:11.860 --> 34:16.860
that the father of this universe proper name is Allah.

34:18.060 --> 34:20.260
And of course, in Allah, I get all.

34:23.260 --> 34:28.260
And I don't think that God is the same as that.

34:28.740 --> 34:31.020
I think Allah gives birth to God.

34:33.300 --> 34:35.540
In fact, if you take the word Allah,

34:35.540 --> 34:40.220
A-L-L-A-H, and you take it through numerology or numbers,

34:40.220 --> 34:44.340
the number A being, letter A being one, L being 12,

34:44.340 --> 34:48.100
and you add it all up to its lowest,

34:48.100 --> 34:51.900
to the last denominator, you're gonna get the number seven.

34:51.900 --> 34:53.260
And the number seven is gonna bring you

34:53.260 --> 34:55.540
right back to that letter G.

34:55.540 --> 34:59.220
So Allah borns God, but God don't born Allah.

34:59.740 --> 35:03.700
How does that guy, how does Allah connect to the oracle

35:03.700 --> 35:06.620
that you're going to be calling for

35:06.620 --> 35:08.420
when you're laying in the hospital?

35:08.420 --> 35:10.180
Well, what I was saying in that particular verse

35:10.180 --> 35:12.300
was that we're looking for the oracle.

35:12.300 --> 35:14.660
We're looking for somebody else or something to help us

35:14.660 --> 35:17.740
that nobody can really help you at the end of the day.

35:19.980 --> 35:23.060
And we're speaking on, so now that we,

35:23.060 --> 35:24.580
I don't wanna say we're speaking on religion,

35:24.580 --> 35:27.380
but we're speaking on a way of life and a way of thinking.

35:29.540 --> 35:32.340
And I've read many books, of course,

35:32.340 --> 35:36.340
and I can say there's no book that my,

35:36.340 --> 35:38.580
the book that is the most strongest book I've ever read

35:38.580 --> 35:40.420
is actually the Holy Quran.

35:40.420 --> 35:43.780
It's stronger to me than the Bible, which I've read.

35:43.780 --> 35:46.820
It's stronger than quantum physics, which I've read.

35:46.820 --> 35:48.660
It's stronger than the Bhagavad Gita.

35:48.660 --> 35:53.100
It's just, and I read once a British scholar said

35:53.100 --> 35:56.140
it's the most stupidest book ever written,

35:56.140 --> 35:58.860
and it doesn't make sense.

35:59.740 --> 36:02.260
And so I said, oh, I see why he says that though.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.620
I understand exactly why he said that as well.

36:04.620 --> 36:05.900
Why is that?

36:05.900 --> 36:10.900
Because the structure of the words are just,

36:10.980 --> 36:14.260
it's peculiar, you know what I mean?

36:14.260 --> 36:16.500
But it's almost like how some people's songs,

36:16.500 --> 36:18.820
you don't really know exactly what they say

36:18.820 --> 36:20.020
until years later.

36:22.820 --> 36:24.780
Yeah, you have, actually with Joe Rogan,

36:24.780 --> 36:28.100
I think you talked about how a joke of Dave Chappelle's

36:28.100 --> 36:30.740
hit you like a long time after this.

36:30.740 --> 36:32.540
So this is kind of like the Quran.

36:33.780 --> 36:38.060
I tend to believe that human beings

36:38.060 --> 36:41.820
cannot possibly understand anything as big as these ideas.

36:41.820 --> 36:45.780
So just, I don't know, do you think that,

36:47.260 --> 36:51.500
like are you humble in the face of just the immensity of it?

36:51.540 --> 36:52.660
To be honest, yes.

36:53.900 --> 36:56.540
I'm humble in the face of the,

36:56.540 --> 36:58.860
you can say the word again, I pronounce words funny,

36:58.860 --> 37:03.860
the omnipotence, the omniscience, the magnitude.

37:04.540 --> 37:07.540
I'm humble in the face of Allah.

37:07.540 --> 37:10.140
The problem that I may have had was that

37:10.140 --> 37:12.060
I wasn't humble in the face of God

37:12.060 --> 37:16.100
because it's just a definable thing.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.060
And that's why I think a lot of us,

37:18.060 --> 37:19.220
and not saying that, you know,

37:19.220 --> 37:22.220
I know when we say God, we're trying to say Allah,

37:22.220 --> 37:23.820
like people was saying that,

37:23.820 --> 37:26.900
but you're actually not saying the same thing

37:26.900 --> 37:30.140
because you're actually putting something beside him.

37:31.260 --> 37:36.260
And that's the reason why you can have all these mini gods.

37:37.780 --> 37:41.140
You can find a whole bunch of them, you know what I mean?

37:41.140 --> 37:42.380
But you're not going to find many,

37:42.380 --> 37:45.860
there's no body beside Allah, Allah is one.

37:45.860 --> 37:47.940
So I know it's the whole thing,

37:47.940 --> 37:50.100
but that's my heart is there.

37:50.100 --> 37:52.020
I'm humbled by it.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.140
I'm at peace with it.

37:54.460 --> 37:56.620
And it doesn't take nothing

37:56.620 --> 37:59.260
or demerit anything from myself.

37:59.260 --> 38:00.420
That's the beauty of it.

38:00.420 --> 38:03.380
It doesn't take nothing from me, from being who I am.

38:03.380 --> 38:06.820
So if I say, if somebody woke up your peace guard,

38:06.820 --> 38:08.900
I could take that because they're telling me that,

38:08.900 --> 38:11.740
yo, I'm a man of wisdom, I'm a man of strength,

38:11.740 --> 38:15.180
I'm a man of beauty, or some attribute of that.

38:15.180 --> 38:16.020
You know what I mean?

38:16.020 --> 38:17.860
Wu-Tang, they the gods of rap.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.340
There's wisdom there, there's strength there,

38:19.340 --> 38:21.100
there's beauty, they will take that.

38:23.340 --> 38:25.180
So Wu-Tang is one of the greatest

38:25.180 --> 38:28.140
musical, artistic, philosophical groups ever.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.540
Let's look hundreds of years from now

38:31.540 --> 38:33.300
when humans or robots or aliens

38:33.300 --> 38:35.740
or whatever that's left here, they look back.

38:35.740 --> 38:37.620
What do you hope they remember about Wu-Tang?

38:37.620 --> 38:39.300
What do you hope the legacy is?

38:41.540 --> 38:43.100
Well, even if it's thousands of years,

38:43.100 --> 38:44.860
I hope we don't get rid of the humans.

38:45.780 --> 38:47.940
But you know, look, whatever happens is gonna happen,

38:47.940 --> 38:52.220
but I think that my philosophy on it is that

38:55.340 --> 38:59.140
we're gonna continue to advance

38:59.140 --> 39:02.020
and continue to advance things around us,

39:02.020 --> 39:04.620
but I don't see us becoming extinct.

39:04.620 --> 39:07.220
Well, I mean, the reason I bring up sort of Wu-Tang

39:07.220 --> 39:10.260
in that context, and this is a special moment

39:10.260 --> 39:12.180
in human history, it's like a hundred years

39:12.180 --> 39:13.860
and we've created all of this music.

39:14.340 --> 39:16.300
If you think of all the richness of music

39:16.300 --> 39:18.420
that's been created over a hundred years,

39:18.420 --> 39:21.900
it's not obvious to me that that's not going to stop.

39:21.900 --> 39:23.820
There's a flourishing here.

39:23.820 --> 39:26.060
So it's funny, because I could see

39:26.060 --> 39:29.580
where the book of human history is written.

39:29.580 --> 39:32.220
There's a chapter on this period of time.

39:32.220 --> 39:34.060
And one of the things we did well

39:34.060 --> 39:36.900
is all the technological innovation

39:36.900 --> 39:40.820
with the rockets and with the internet,

39:40.820 --> 39:42.620
but then there's also the musical innovation

39:42.660 --> 39:44.060
and film innovation.

39:44.060 --> 39:45.780
Just so much art that's being created.

39:45.780 --> 39:47.980
And Wu-Tang is a huge part of that.

39:47.980 --> 39:50.180
So I just wonder if there's a few sentences

39:50.180 --> 39:51.340
written about Wu-Tang.

39:53.340 --> 39:56.780
It just makes me wonder how they remember.

39:56.780 --> 40:00.540
I would hope that people, no matter how many years,

40:00.540 --> 40:02.540
are inspired by us.

40:02.540 --> 40:07.300
But I will say if I could just use Wu-Tang as itself.

40:07.300 --> 40:12.300
So we first started off the witty, unpredictable,

40:13.620 --> 40:16.900
talent and natural game, right?

40:16.900 --> 40:19.700
Natural game meaning natural wordplay.

40:19.700 --> 40:24.700
And then we went to the wisdom of the universe.

40:27.140 --> 40:32.140
The truth of Allah for a nation of God.

40:34.460 --> 40:37.900
Wisdom, universal, truth, Allah, nation, God.

40:37.900 --> 40:39.300
And it's just like,

40:39.300 --> 40:41.420
so this is go back to a nation of God.

40:41.460 --> 40:43.260
Let's just take the last two letters.

40:44.820 --> 40:47.140
A nation of wisdom, strength and beauty.

40:49.540 --> 40:50.380
Right?

40:50.380 --> 40:52.260
You know, and I'm gonna go a little political here,

40:52.260 --> 40:53.700
but not going political.

40:53.700 --> 40:56.100
As we'll say, we're the greatest country in the world.

40:56.100 --> 40:57.740
What makes us the greatest?

40:58.660 --> 40:59.780
That's to be a question we ask.

40:59.780 --> 41:00.780
Is it our wisdom?

41:01.860 --> 41:03.660
Is it our strength?

41:03.660 --> 41:04.900
Is it our beauty?

41:04.900 --> 41:07.540
Now, let's just say off the easiest answer,

41:07.540 --> 41:09.460
you know it's our strength.

41:09.460 --> 41:10.620
We got the nukes.

41:11.740 --> 41:13.340
Nobody can really, you know,

41:13.340 --> 41:14.820
between America and Russia,

41:14.820 --> 41:17.060
they say, you know, that's the argument.

41:17.060 --> 41:18.860
Who could beat them?

41:18.860 --> 41:19.980
But where's the wisdom?

41:21.100 --> 41:24.700
Then they can argue, well, we got the technology, right?

41:24.700 --> 41:25.940
But then where's the beauty

41:25.940 --> 41:28.180
when there's so much suffering in the people?

41:29.460 --> 41:30.540
So it's not complete.

41:30.540 --> 41:33.340
The hope is that the wisdom is in the founding documents

41:33.340 --> 41:37.140
and the imperfect, but wise founding documents

41:37.140 --> 41:41.380
of that celebrated freedom, that celebrated all the ideas

41:42.380 --> 41:43.780
sort of having a lot of nukes,

41:43.780 --> 41:46.460
having a lot of airplanes and tanks.

41:46.460 --> 41:50.180
That's not important.

41:50.180 --> 41:52.820
And the hope is whatever we're doing here

41:52.820 --> 41:55.300
with this, quote, greatest country on earth,

41:55.300 --> 41:58.020
that we preserve the ideas and help them flourish.

41:58.020 --> 41:59.100
Just like you said.

41:59.100 --> 41:59.940
Well, that's what I mean.

41:59.940 --> 42:01.820
So if we could get, so if you go back to the Wu-Tang,

42:01.820 --> 42:03.020
you know what I'm saying?

42:03.020 --> 42:05.620
That's what we're striving for.

42:05.620 --> 42:07.420
We're striving for that, you know what I mean?

42:07.420 --> 42:09.580
But you started on Predictable and just like-

42:09.580 --> 42:10.420
Yeah.

42:10.420 --> 42:14.460
Yeah, but like got deep pretty quick.

42:16.580 --> 42:18.420
I got to talk to you about Bruce Lee.

42:19.500 --> 42:20.780
Who's Bruce Lee to you?

42:20.780 --> 42:22.020
Who is he to the world?

42:22.020 --> 42:25.340
What ideas of his were interesting to you?

42:25.340 --> 42:29.700
Like what, you know, you talk about like Hendrix and music,

42:29.700 --> 42:31.300
Bruce Lee is that in martial arts.

42:31.300 --> 42:33.180
He just seems to have changed the game.

42:33.180 --> 42:34.020
Yeah.

42:34.940 --> 42:37.140
You know, I went as, I guess,

42:37.140 --> 42:39.100
I don't know what the word bold is the right word to say,

42:39.100 --> 42:44.100
but I went as bold as to say that he was a minor prophet.

42:44.780 --> 42:47.140
And I got that concept from the Holy Quran

42:47.140 --> 42:50.660
where it says that we send prophets to every nation,

42:50.660 --> 42:52.220
every village.

42:52.220 --> 42:55.380
We don't let nobody not hear the word in some form

42:55.380 --> 42:57.060
because it won't be fair.

42:57.060 --> 42:59.060
And so if a law is merciful,

43:00.020 --> 43:03.460
even a man who's deaf has to somehow get a sign.

43:03.460 --> 43:05.860
I don't know if Moses saw a burning bush,

43:05.860 --> 43:06.940
was nobody else to talk to,

43:06.940 --> 43:09.180
so he had to talk to the bush, I don't know.

43:09.180 --> 43:11.540
It could have been the bush this way too, right?

43:11.540 --> 43:13.460
But point being made,

43:13.460 --> 43:15.020
it says that they are minor prophets

43:15.020 --> 43:17.580
and I see Bruce Lee as one of them

43:17.580 --> 43:19.820
because what he brought to the world through his,

43:19.820 --> 43:23.820
through martial art was a whole shift

43:23.820 --> 43:27.100
in the dynamic of thinking, you know?

43:27.100 --> 43:30.660
And that happens when certain entities are born,

43:30.660 --> 43:33.660
but he didn't do it only in a physical sense.

43:34.660 --> 43:36.620
In a physical sense,

43:36.620 --> 43:40.100
he was also philosophizing in the same process.

43:41.780 --> 43:45.980
And he was also striving to be the best of himself.

43:45.980 --> 43:48.780
So you got three things going on.

43:48.780 --> 43:53.140
I study Bruce Lee multiple times.

43:54.220 --> 43:55.340
And first, of course,

43:58.940 --> 44:00.940
when I saw my first Kung Fu movie,

44:00.940 --> 44:03.380
it was the fake, it wasn't really Bruce Lee.

44:04.140 --> 44:07.540
It was a few green hornet clips cut together.

44:07.540 --> 44:08.940
And then I saw a Black Samurai.

44:08.940 --> 44:13.420
Then my following Kung Fu movies was like Fearless Fighters,

44:13.420 --> 44:14.700
The Ghostly Face,

44:16.380 --> 44:17.340
you know, The Fist of the Devil King,

44:17.340 --> 44:19.780
but basically in Fearless Fighters,

44:19.780 --> 44:21.500
the lady put the little kid on her back

44:21.500 --> 44:25.820
and flew across the ocean, across the lake, right?

44:25.820 --> 44:27.940
So Bruce wasn't doing that.

44:27.940 --> 44:30.220
And then I went on to Five Deadly Venoms

44:30.220 --> 44:32.740
and Spearman and 36 Chambers

44:33.300 --> 44:36.260
and these movies are beautiful

44:36.260 --> 44:38.140
and yet they're all heightened.

44:39.780 --> 44:42.980
Bruce, they're heightened beyond doable.

44:42.980 --> 44:43.820
You're not gonna-

44:43.820 --> 44:44.660
Yeah, it's like surreal.

44:44.660 --> 44:47.500
They play with the world that's not of this world.

44:47.500 --> 44:48.900
Yeah.

44:48.900 --> 44:51.220
Bruce played with this world.

44:51.220 --> 44:55.100
So when I first saw Bruce,

44:55.100 --> 44:57.820
I actually didn't think he was as good as these guys.

44:57.820 --> 44:58.900
He can't fly.

44:59.300 --> 45:02.340
He's not flying in the movies, right?

45:03.780 --> 45:06.140
But then when I saw,

45:06.140 --> 45:08.860
cause the first one I saw was The Big Boss,

45:08.860 --> 45:11.260
which they retitled Fist of Fury.

45:11.260 --> 45:14.860
But then when I saw Chinese Connection,

45:14.860 --> 45:18.500
which is the real Fist of Fury, right?

45:19.340 --> 45:21.340
I saw something different there

45:21.340 --> 45:24.340
and I got enamored.

45:24.340 --> 45:26.420
And then of course Enter the Dragon, right?

45:26.420 --> 45:28.100
Just really complete.

45:28.100 --> 45:32.140
That's why my first album was Enter the Wu Tang,

45:32.140 --> 45:33.500
36 Chambers of Shaolin.

45:33.500 --> 45:35.580
So it's Enter the Dragon and 36 put together

45:35.580 --> 45:37.180
cause those are the two epitomes.

45:38.380 --> 45:40.340
So what happened is, that's young me.

45:40.340 --> 45:43.380
Then teenage me studies him again.

45:43.380 --> 45:46.780
And I realized, wow, look at his physicality.

45:46.780 --> 45:49.980
Look out how he's really, he's moving for real.

45:50.940 --> 45:52.380
And then I studied him again.

45:52.380 --> 45:53.820
Wow, look at what he's saying.

45:55.060 --> 45:55.980
Then I studied him again.

45:55.980 --> 45:57.780
Wow, look at what he stands for.

45:59.100 --> 46:03.540
Which do you like in the realm of martial arts?

46:03.540 --> 46:05.860
The real or the surreal?

46:05.860 --> 46:07.860
Or the dance between the two?

46:07.860 --> 46:09.300
Yeah, I'd like the dance between the two

46:09.300 --> 46:14.180
because a movie to me is to entertain you.

46:15.660 --> 46:20.660
So I'm cool with Obi-Wan Kenobi disappearing

46:22.020 --> 46:25.940
out of the cloak when Vader strikes him down.

46:25.940 --> 46:27.580
And then I'm like, yo, what happened?

46:27.580 --> 46:29.180
And he's like, run, Luke, run.

46:30.300 --> 46:31.860
I'm cool with that, right?

46:31.860 --> 46:34.140
Because that's the imagination.

46:34.140 --> 46:36.540
And the imagination gets stimulated to the point

46:36.540 --> 46:40.220
to where as things that we saw imagined by an artist,

46:40.220 --> 46:42.340
we strive to create in our real world.

46:42.340 --> 46:46.620
Thus Star Trek to me is just a precursor to our cell phones.

46:47.780 --> 46:50.220
So for me, I like the mix the two.

46:51.900 --> 46:53.900
Yeah, it's funny how the science fiction,

46:53.900 --> 46:55.300
pushing into the impossible

46:55.300 --> 46:57.420
actually makes you realize eventually.

46:58.260 --> 47:00.500
Yeah, we humans, once we see a idea on screen,

47:00.500 --> 47:02.940
no matter how wild it is, we're trying to make it.

47:02.940 --> 47:03.980
Yeah, we're trying to make it.

47:03.980 --> 47:06.700
It's when a young kid gets inspired and watch that.

47:06.700 --> 47:08.260
Be like, I'm gonna build that.

47:08.260 --> 47:09.100
Exactly.

47:09.100 --> 47:10.780
So I don't know who's gonna come

47:10.780 --> 47:13.060
with the Back to the Future time machine,

47:13.060 --> 47:16.260
but do you have any classmates that you think?

47:16.260 --> 47:17.860
Time machine?

47:17.860 --> 47:19.780
I thought you were going to Back to the Future,

47:19.780 --> 47:23.940
like the, what is it, the hoverboard?

47:23.940 --> 47:24.780
Or like the-

47:24.780 --> 47:26.500
Yeah, we're there at least.

47:26.500 --> 47:29.540
Somebody, they got, they seen the one on the water?

47:29.540 --> 47:30.380
No.

47:30.380 --> 47:31.220
No, you know the-

47:31.220 --> 47:32.060
It's close on the water, wait.

47:32.060 --> 47:34.420
No, the surf hover, it's dope.

47:34.420 --> 47:35.260
Nice.

47:35.260 --> 47:36.100
It's dope.

47:36.100 --> 47:40.220
It actually, if you were Back to the Future fan,

47:40.220 --> 47:43.100
you feel like you made it to, you made it there.

47:43.100 --> 47:43.940
Yeah, all right.

47:43.940 --> 47:46.220
Well, now we just gotta work on the time travel.

47:46.220 --> 47:48.380
And it was cool to hear you talk about

47:48.380 --> 47:50.660
the master of the flying guillotine today,

47:50.660 --> 47:55.380
that that inspired the lyric

47:55.380 --> 47:58.860
for the Wu-Tang Clan and nothing to eff with.

47:58.860 --> 48:00.060
Yeah.

48:00.060 --> 48:01.220
How does that go again?

48:02.340 --> 48:03.820
But the curse word or the lyric?

48:03.820 --> 48:04.660
Nothing.

48:04.660 --> 48:07.060
And I remember the curse, I am Russian,

48:07.060 --> 48:09.900
but I remember the curse word, but the lyric.

48:09.900 --> 48:12.540
I said, I be tossing and forcing.

48:12.540 --> 48:13.860
My style is awesome.

48:13.860 --> 48:17.300
I'm causing more family foods than Richard Dawson.

48:17.300 --> 48:20.100
And the survey said, you're dead.

48:20.100 --> 48:23.500
The fatal flying guillotine chops off your head.

48:23.500 --> 48:24.900
Yeah. Yeah.

48:24.980 --> 48:26.940
And it was interesting to see the guillotine

48:26.940 --> 48:31.940
in the movie today, how, I don't know.

48:32.100 --> 48:33.820
That's surreal, right?

48:33.820 --> 48:34.660
But it's not.

48:34.660 --> 48:37.540
It's like, it's engineering, it's both surreal

48:37.540 --> 48:42.380
and it just, and then it adds this chaos

48:42.380 --> 48:44.780
into this real world that, and then challenges

48:44.780 --> 48:46.580
everybody to think what you're gonna do with that.

48:46.580 --> 48:47.780
Yeah, how you gonna beat it?

48:47.780 --> 48:48.740
Yeah, how you gonna beat it?

48:48.740 --> 48:51.460
Both when you have like the good and the evil

48:51.460 --> 48:54.300
and the mix of the bad guys and the good guys

48:54.300 --> 48:56.140
and you're not sure who the bad guys are.

48:56.140 --> 48:58.580
It's the old question of good versus evil, right?

48:58.580 --> 49:02.220
Yeah, like you said, then the question of who was good,

49:02.220 --> 49:05.540
who was evil, but they all had a similar problem

49:05.540 --> 49:07.620
when the guillotine came.

49:07.620 --> 49:11.060
But in terms of the real, you mentioned The Godfather,

49:11.060 --> 49:13.660
good and evil, that's your favorite movie.

49:13.660 --> 49:14.740
Yeah.

49:14.740 --> 49:16.180
What makes it great, do you think?

49:16.180 --> 49:20.420
The characters, the study of family, of justice, of power.

49:20.420 --> 49:21.340
What connects with you?

49:21.340 --> 49:25.220
Oh, I mean, every one of those themes

49:25.220 --> 49:26.980
connects in the real

49:28.700 --> 49:30.900
and it connects in a cinematic way as well.

49:31.860 --> 49:34.460
The difference I think with me and The Godfather

49:34.460 --> 49:36.420
was I seen it during a period of time

49:36.420 --> 49:37.740
when my father was absent

49:38.900 --> 49:43.900
and therefore family structure and family values

49:44.300 --> 49:49.300
was actually adopted in my family because of that.

49:49.300 --> 49:51.180
Me and my brother Devon,

49:52.020 --> 49:57.020
we actually took so much heed to that movie

49:57.020 --> 49:59.180
in our family life.

49:59.180 --> 50:04.180
And we kind of mimic that family in its structure

50:07.380 --> 50:10.380
of somebody has to be the leader of the family,

50:10.380 --> 50:11.380
even if it was the younger.

50:11.380 --> 50:14.220
Michael was younger than Sonny and Fredro,

50:15.740 --> 50:17.500
but he was worthy.

50:17.500 --> 50:19.260
And my brother Devon is older than me

50:19.260 --> 50:20.860
and my brother King is older than me.

50:21.540 --> 50:23.420
Sometimes Devon calls King, Fredro,

50:23.420 --> 50:24.700
and I know King wants to.

50:24.700 --> 50:28.100
King, he actually was, he could beat our ass,

50:28.100 --> 50:28.940
see my language.

50:28.940 --> 50:30.340
Yeah, yeah.

50:30.340 --> 50:31.460
But you're Michael.

50:31.460 --> 50:34.980
Yeah, and not by choice,

50:34.980 --> 50:38.220
just by definition of that's what I am.

50:41.300 --> 50:43.380
It's just a blessing for me

50:43.380 --> 50:46.180
to have my older sister, my older brothers,

50:47.300 --> 50:49.980
and my younger brothers look to me

50:49.980 --> 50:54.980
as just as a good light in the family.

50:55.580 --> 50:57.860
And like I said, that movie helped us.

50:57.860 --> 50:58.700
My sisters too.

51:00.060 --> 51:01.100
The cool thing about my family,

51:01.100 --> 51:03.020
I don't know if I shared this a lot,

51:03.020 --> 51:05.780
it's a big, we all watch these movies together.

51:05.780 --> 51:07.500
And so the eight diagram,

51:07.500 --> 51:10.540
pole fighter, master killer, father,

51:10.540 --> 51:12.380
even as my family knows these movies,

51:12.380 --> 51:15.780
it's not just I know them, right?

51:15.780 --> 51:17.260
And then you extend it further,

51:17.260 --> 51:19.900
my friends know them too.

51:20.820 --> 51:23.300
So there's a language that we all can have

51:24.740 --> 51:29.100
that actually film has informed our communication.

51:29.100 --> 51:30.380
So the Godfather,

51:31.540 --> 51:36.540
which also is still a fictitional story of something,

51:36.740 --> 51:39.900
but since it was based in reality,

51:39.900 --> 51:42.700
based on something real, and it was human,

51:42.700 --> 51:44.620
it wasn't so heightened,

51:44.620 --> 51:48.180
I think the privity of it resonates.

51:48.220 --> 51:51.540
And the privity of it is something that resonates with me.

51:53.060 --> 51:55.260
You gotta plan ahead.

51:56.260 --> 51:59.020
He didn't wanna deal with the drugs,

51:59.020 --> 52:02.260
but that time of business was upon him.

52:02.260 --> 52:05.500
It's almost like, this is a tough one,

52:05.500 --> 52:06.740
sometime when the Muslim brothers

52:06.740 --> 52:09.380
come from the Middle East to America,

52:09.380 --> 52:12.140
and they open up delis, right?

52:12.140 --> 52:14.500
They would sell ham,

52:14.500 --> 52:17.300
and we would go in there and complain to them,

52:18.300 --> 52:21.020
they used to get mad at us when we came in.

52:21.020 --> 52:22.980
But, and that's as a kid, but as a man,

52:22.980 --> 52:25.660
I'm like, yo, he's here to sell.

52:25.660 --> 52:27.420
Now he still don't have to sell to him,

52:27.420 --> 52:30.940
like Fido Corleone didn't wanna sell the drugs.

52:32.020 --> 52:34.660
Okay, he didn't have to do it, he didn't do it.

52:34.660 --> 52:36.380
And it cost him some bullets,

52:36.380 --> 52:40.020
to eventually somebody in the family ended up doing it.

52:40.020 --> 52:41.820
You see what I mean?

52:41.820 --> 52:45.860
What about this idea that family before everything else,

52:45.860 --> 52:50.860
so there's different laws you live according to in this world,

52:52.180 --> 52:54.180
and family is first.

52:54.180 --> 52:58.260
Yeah, that's mathematically correct.

52:59.860 --> 53:01.420
I like that.

53:01.420 --> 53:03.820
I mean, there's a certain sense of,

53:05.660 --> 53:08.420
you look at powerful people, you look at Putin,

53:08.420 --> 53:10.380
there's a certain sense in which

53:10.380 --> 53:12.220
the people who are in the inner circle,

53:12.220 --> 53:15.020
that's who you take care of, that's family.

53:15.020 --> 53:16.820
And anyone else that crosses you,

53:18.140 --> 53:21.300
that there's a different set of ethics

53:21.300 --> 53:23.860
under which you operate for those people.

53:23.860 --> 53:26.260
Well, Jesus said the same thing.

53:28.260 --> 53:30.460
You know, when he said, love thy neighbor and thy brother,

53:30.460 --> 53:32.780
he was talking about that community.

53:32.780 --> 53:35.900
When the other lady, the Samaritan,

53:35.900 --> 53:37.740
say, hey, Jesus, I'm not feeling,

53:37.740 --> 53:39.180
my brother not feeling so well,

53:39.180 --> 53:41.060
and could you, he say, give not that which is holy

53:41.060 --> 53:42.460
unto the dogs.

53:42.460 --> 53:43.860
If you're gonna tell a woman,

53:45.660 --> 53:48.740
give not that which is holy unto the dogs,

53:48.740 --> 53:51.780
and she's a woman, you just called her a dog.

53:51.780 --> 53:53.460
If I translate that into hip hop,

53:54.900 --> 53:57.220
she's a female, he called her a dog.

53:57.220 --> 53:58.140
I know how that goes.

53:58.140 --> 53:59.980
But she said to him,

54:00.900 --> 54:04.340
but even a dog is allowed to eat the crumbs

54:04.340 --> 54:06.460
that falls from the master's table.

54:08.020 --> 54:10.180
And he went and helped her, he helped her.

54:10.180 --> 54:12.540
Now let's go back to what you said about Putin

54:12.540 --> 54:15.460
or Vito Colón or myself and my family.

54:15.460 --> 54:17.780
Of course the family is first.

54:17.780 --> 54:20.340
But once the family is good,

54:20.340 --> 54:22.940
it has to then spread to the community,

54:22.940 --> 54:27.820
then to the state, country, world.

54:27.820 --> 54:30.020
The problem we have sometimes is that,

54:30.020 --> 54:31.780
and this is the reason why a lot of powerful families

54:31.780 --> 54:32.620
was overthrown.

54:32.620 --> 54:35.180
Like, why do they behead their own king

54:35.180 --> 54:36.460
with the guillotine, right?

54:36.460 --> 54:39.660
Because that, once the family was strong,

54:40.460 --> 54:45.460
they didn't let the wealth, the opportunity,

54:45.780 --> 54:48.780
expand out, you know?

54:48.780 --> 54:49.940
Look at Wu Tang.

54:50.980 --> 54:53.500
Yes, our family was made strong first,

54:53.500 --> 54:55.740
but then all the Wu members

54:55.740 --> 54:57.980
able to form their own corporations,

54:57.980 --> 55:00.460
and they had their own sub-families.

55:00.460 --> 55:01.500
It has to grow out.

55:01.500 --> 55:03.220
And they took over the world.

55:03.220 --> 55:05.940
You've talked about being vegan.

55:05.940 --> 55:09.780
I don't think I heard you explain this

55:09.780 --> 55:13.420
because it connects somehow about how you think about life.

55:14.900 --> 55:16.980
So you talk about when your family's good,

55:16.980 --> 55:19.380
you grow that like circle of empathy,

55:19.380 --> 55:21.380
you grow the community.

55:21.380 --> 55:24.820
Is that how you think about being vegan?

55:24.820 --> 55:29.820
That just the capacity of living beings on earth to suffer

55:29.820 --> 55:33.460
that you just don't wanna add suffering to them?

55:33.460 --> 55:36.460
Yeah, I mean, you said it clear.

55:36.460 --> 55:39.860
It's like nothing, in all reality,

55:40.940 --> 55:44.180
I came to a realization that nothing really has to die

55:44.180 --> 55:47.220
for me to live, no animal.

55:47.220 --> 55:49.580
The plants themselves, right?

55:49.580 --> 55:53.500
So let's just say, you want a steak,

55:53.500 --> 55:55.860
which is probably the most,

55:55.860 --> 55:57.340
I don't know the most expensive piece of meat,

55:57.340 --> 56:01.500
but let's just say the steak is top of the line, nice steak.

56:01.500 --> 56:03.340
And you eating the steak for the protein

56:03.340 --> 56:05.340
to help build your muscle.

56:05.340 --> 56:07.700
And I don't know if you got it from a cow or a bull,

56:07.700 --> 56:09.580
but whether it's a cow or the bull,

56:09.580 --> 56:12.060
they grow to about 1,500 pounds.

56:12.060 --> 56:14.540
And if it's a bull, it's all muscly muscle.

56:16.660 --> 56:18.100
And it's only eating grass.

56:21.020 --> 56:24.300
Yeah, yeah, there's, yeah.

56:24.300 --> 56:26.820
It's possible to both as an athlete

56:26.820 --> 56:28.940
and just as a human being to perform well

56:28.940 --> 56:29.980
without eating meat.

56:29.980 --> 56:32.580
There's something, especially in the way

56:32.580 --> 56:37.580
we're treating animals to deliver that meat to the plate.

56:37.660 --> 56:38.660
I think about that a lot.

56:38.660 --> 56:42.180
So I do, I'm a robotics person, AI person.

56:42.180 --> 56:44.180
And I think a lot about,

56:44.180 --> 56:45.700
I don't know if you think about this kind of stuff,

56:45.700 --> 56:47.380
but building AI systems

56:47.380 --> 56:49.940
as they become more and more human-like,

56:49.940 --> 56:52.780
you start to ask the question of, are we okay?

56:55.420 --> 56:59.060
If we give the capacity for AI systems to suffer,

56:59.060 --> 57:01.500
first to feel, but then to suffer,

57:02.460 --> 57:05.780
to hate and to love, to feel emotion,

57:05.780 --> 57:07.580
how do we deal with that?

57:07.580 --> 57:11.020
It starts asking the same question as you ask of animals.

57:11.020 --> 57:14.620
Are we okay adding that suffering to the world?

57:14.620 --> 57:15.740
Right.

57:15.740 --> 57:17.540
And I don't think we should add the suffering

57:17.540 --> 57:19.420
because it's not necessary.

57:19.420 --> 57:22.420
Like, look, if it's necessary, right,

57:22.420 --> 57:24.380
because we're survival

57:24.380 --> 57:27.180
or the first law of nature is self-preservation.

57:27.180 --> 57:30.140
If you are in a desert and there's nothing else to eat,

57:30.140 --> 57:32.500
but that lizard, yeah, okay,

57:32.500 --> 57:33.660
you gotta do what you gotta do.

57:33.660 --> 57:34.700
Lizards gotta go.

57:34.700 --> 57:35.540
Yeah, you gotta go.

57:35.540 --> 57:36.380
You gotta do what you gotta do

57:36.380 --> 57:38.860
because at the end of the day, man is,

57:38.860 --> 57:41.820
when they say man has dominion over these things,

57:41.820 --> 57:45.540
his dominion is almost like a caretaker.

57:45.540 --> 57:47.180
The way we do our dominion,

57:47.180 --> 57:49.780
we dominate it, eat it, cook it.

57:49.780 --> 57:52.940
Like, who's the first guy that looked at the lobster?

57:53.780 --> 57:55.780
He was like, I'm gonna eat this thing.

57:57.220 --> 57:59.020
First of all, it's hard to eat it.

57:59.020 --> 58:01.500
You gotta go through a process to get that.

58:01.500 --> 58:04.460
A crab, I remember we used to eat crabs when we was kids

58:04.460 --> 58:06.740
and I didn't know why I was always getting itchy throats

58:06.740 --> 58:09.020
and all that, you know, you don't know, just eat.

58:09.020 --> 58:10.100
But at the end of the day,

58:10.100 --> 58:14.580
a crab didn't provide no more than a finger worth of meat,

58:14.580 --> 58:18.780
maybe, and it's hell getting that stick, getting it out.

58:18.780 --> 58:20.900
It's like, it's not worth it in all reality.

58:20.900 --> 58:25.900
You could have gave me a banana

58:25.980 --> 58:27.580
and did better for my body.

58:29.340 --> 58:33.900
And my appetite and my being fulfilled as full.

58:33.900 --> 58:37.900
Like, look at the blessings of life, right?

58:38.940 --> 58:40.380
If you take a seed,

58:41.860 --> 58:43.420
or you get an apple and you eat it,

58:45.580 --> 58:48.260
and that apple is multiple seeds in it.

58:49.300 --> 58:53.100
If you plant that seed, it'll give you a whole tree

58:53.100 --> 58:56.780
with a whole bunch of apples with all multiple seeds.

58:56.780 --> 59:01.780
But if you kill a fish, it can't reproduce, it's done.

59:02.180 --> 59:04.900
If you kill a cat, it's done, it's nothing coming back.

59:04.900 --> 59:07.020
But when you deal with the plants,

59:07.020 --> 59:10.620
even after you eat the apple and then you defecate,

59:11.780 --> 59:14.460
your defecation is what feeds the ground

59:14.460 --> 59:16.260
to cause the apple to grow more.

59:16.260 --> 59:18.020
Yeah, it's a circle of life.

59:18.020 --> 59:21.340
And especially there's a guy named David Foster Wallace,

59:21.340 --> 59:24.620
he wrote a short story called Consider the Lobster.

59:24.620 --> 59:26.260
If you actually think philosophically

59:26.260 --> 59:29.700
about what, from a perspective of a lobster,

59:30.740 --> 59:32.300
that's like symbolic of something,

59:32.300 --> 59:36.940
because you basically put in the water, like cold water,

59:36.940 --> 59:41.220
and then it heats up slowly until it's no more.

59:41.220 --> 59:43.100
It's torture, yeah, it must have been like,

59:43.100 --> 59:45.860
you think they started eating lobsters in an inquisition?

59:45.860 --> 59:47.980
Yeah, yeah, they just enjoy,

59:47.980 --> 59:50.100
they probably enjoyed torturing animals

59:50.100 --> 59:51.660
and they realized they're also delicious

59:51.660 --> 59:52.900
after the torture is finished.

59:52.900 --> 59:54.940
That's probably how they discovered it.

59:54.940 --> 59:55.900
Let me ask you a question,

59:55.900 --> 59:57.020
I know you're asking me the questions,

59:57.020 --> 59:58.980
but I just want to talk a little bit about the AI,

59:58.980 --> 01:00:00.540
and you said something about trying

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:03.860
to put the emotion in it, right?

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:10.980
So are you thinking there's an algorithm for emotion?

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:15.740
Yes, but I think emotion isn't something

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:19.540
that there's an algorithm for for a particular system,

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.460
we create emotions together.

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:25.500
So emotion is something, like this conversation,

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:27.620
it's like magic we create together.

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:30.900
So I've worked with quite a few robots,

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:33.020
I've a very simple version of that,

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:35.220
I've had Roomba vacuum cleaners,

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.700
I've had them make different sounds,

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:41.180
and one of them is like screaming in pain, like lightly.

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.140
And just having them do that when you kick them

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.580
or when they run into stuff,

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:47.380
immediately I start to feel something for them.

01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:49.140
Right, so the emotion, okay,

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:53.260
so the emotion you're saying is imposed back on the human,

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:55.460
but I'm asking, do you think there's an algorithm

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:59.020
for the emotion to be imposed from machine to machine?

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:01.740
Yeah, that's a really good way to ask it.

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:06.980
It's difficult because I think ultimately

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.300
I only know how to exist in the human world.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:12.180
So it's like, it's the question of if a tree falls

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.020
in the forest and nobody's there to see it,

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.460
does it still fall?

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:18.980
I still think that ultimately machines will have

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:22.700
to show emotion to other humans

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.340
and that's when it becomes real.

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.500
I've been thinking about this a lot too.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.580
And I just, okay.

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.220
Now I'll come into it with this

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:33.060
because I've been thinking about this

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:34.620
and this is your field here.

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.780
Well, do you think emotion is wave?

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.780
Like light is wave or I think it's particle?

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.660
So emotion is just a small,

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.380
it's like a shadow of something bigger

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:52.020
and I think that bigger thing is consciousness.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:53.500
So emotion is just-

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.620
I don't know if it's a wave or a particle.

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:57.340
Y'all haven't thought about that?

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.900
I have thought about it, whether it's,

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.220
there's something like,

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.660
whether consciousness or emotion is a law of physics.

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:08.860
Like if it's that fundamental to the universe.

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:10.620
I had a lyric, I had a lyric,

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:12.060
I had a lyric that said this.

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:15.780
It comes out, they did this documentary about the planet

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:19.540
and I wrote a song, it's called The World of Confusion.

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:21.300
And I'll try to paraphrase the lyric,

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.700
but in the world of the confusion,

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:23.980
where there's so much illusions,

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.500
we suck the blood from the planet.

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.340
Now it needs a transfusion

01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:30.340
and the redistribution of wealth,

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:35.300
of health and wealth of self

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:38.460
and a deeper understanding about mental health.

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:43.580
The doctor prescribed the physical solution.

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:49.780
The psychiatrist wants to build a bigger institution,

01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:55.100
but neither have the solution or the equation

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:59.340
to make an instrument to measure the weight

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:01.940
of the hate vibration.

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:05.380
What is the weight of hate?

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:08.340
Is it heavier than the weight of love?

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:15.100
Is it heavier than the weight of lead inside of a slug

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:18.860
with just 10 milligrams is all it takes to kill a man.

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:20.700
But anyways, do not go on from there.

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.820
Damn, that's good.

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:23.940
But the question, you see the question there.

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:26.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, can be measured.

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:27.580
Can that be measured?

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.500
I think so, I think so.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:30.980
Just don't got the instrument yet, right?

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:35.260
Yeah, we're in the dark ages of that,

01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.380
but I think it could be measured.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:39.100
I think there's something physical,

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:42.220
like something that connects us all this much.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:44.900
We tend to think we humans are distinct entities

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.100
and we move about this world,

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:48.260
but I think there's some deeper connection.

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:53.340
But we're so, listen, science is in the,

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.940
we just had a few breakthroughs in the past 100 years

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:58.900
from Einstein on the theoretical physics side.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:00.900
We don't know anything about human psychology.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:03.820
We barely know much about human biology.

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:05.740
We're trying to figure it all out.

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:08.740
Yeah, I had another theory

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:12.860
because you think about quantum, right?

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:16.540
As long as you say that there's an uncertainty

01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:20.260
and you have me believe there's an uncertainty,

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.180
then there's an uncertainty.

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:25.260
But if there's not an uncertainty, what happens?

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:28.500
So I'm only saying that it's like,

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.940
because you look at quantum computers,

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:34.020
they're gonna give you the O, the one, the one, the O.

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:36.460
They're gonna take two things and make it eight things.

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:39.340
And by the time you multiply four of those things together,

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.180
it's like this chess board, right?

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:44.100
The moves goes into the millions.

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:49.100
But the thing that's introduced is the uncertainty, right?

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:52.580
You're gonna make a move.

01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.940
You know this already, right?

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:04.060
Because this has been played a thousand times.

01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:06.620
But sooner or later, something uncertain is gonna come in

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.460
or make your next move.

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:11.980
I like the weight of these.

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:14.580
They add the certainty.

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:16.820
I think just like who was saying, unpredictable.

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:19.100
There's something about us humans

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:20.500
that really doesn't like everything

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.940
to be fully predictable.

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:26.940
I mean, chess too is perfectly solvable.

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:29.100
There's nothing unpredictable about chess.

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:31.100
Right, I could agree to that because

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:35.420
Bobby Fischer said that,

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.340
Bobby Fischer said in one of his books,

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:40.260
which I actually love what he said,

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:45.300
he said, every game of chess is a draw.

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.420
The only way somebody wins

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.460
is when one of us makes a mistake.

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.420
It doesn't get any better than that.

01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:58.900
What is chess, like how do you think about chess?

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:00.940
What's at the core of your interest in chess?

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:04.220
Do you see Kung Fu, music,

01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:09.220
film, all of it, life, all just living through chess?

01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:14.860
Yeah, I see, it's the most stimulating passage of time

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:20.260
for me that's also, it's like, it's a pastime

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:25.260
that stimulates my mind, my music,

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:27.580
my thoughts about life at the same time.

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.140
So while some pastimes is like,

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:31.100
say baseball is watching, it's a pastime.

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.100
And baseball can stimulate you

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.340
depending on how you look at it, right?

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:36.460
But most likely, you're not gonna get

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:39.980
this much brain activation, this much calculation,

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:41.780
and this much thinking about yourself

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:44.460
in a game of baseball.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:47.660
I mean, the player maybe, but not the viewer.

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:51.020
Chess is something that I can engage in too.

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:53.380
And even though it's a pastime,

01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:59.140
it's giving me all the stimulation of real time in my life.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.140
It's funny because it's also,

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:03.900
it's a funny game because it's connected

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:06.900
through centuries of play.

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.500
Just some of the most interesting people

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.820
in the history of the world have played this game

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:14.460
and have struggled with whatever,

01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:16.980
have projected their struggles onto the chessboard

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:19.060
and thought, and then nations have fought

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:19.900
over the chessboard.

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:20.740
Right, right.

01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:22.540
The Soviet Union versus the United States,

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:24.660
Bobby Fischer represented the United States.

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:26.380
Spassky represented the Soviet Union.

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.900
Yeah.

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:30.540
I gotta, before I lose track of it,

01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:32.460
when we were talking about The Godfather,

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:35.100
you were in American Gangster, great film.

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:37.620
You said it's one of your favorites too.

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:40.940
You were in it with Denzel Washington.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:43.860
What makes that movie meaningful to you?

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:47.180
What was it like making that movie?

01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:49.340
Because it's a great, great American film.

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:50.660
That was a great American film.

01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:52.380
There was so many things in that film.

01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:54.820
Being a part of that film was probably

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:57.340
a blessing and a treasure.

01:07:57.380 --> 01:07:59.420
Because even if I wasn't a part of it,

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:03.260
this court sets great filmmaking

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:06.020
and to me, a really cool, great story.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:11.220
The thing that I love about it the most

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:15.740
really is the process of it.

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:19.340
Which part of the process?

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.820
I wouldn't have known the process

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:22.540
if I wasn't part of it.

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:25.020
So as a film, Joy, it was a great film,

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.940
but even the process of making it

01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:32.540
was like high level education for me on multiple levels.

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:34.220
I'm working with Ridley Scott,

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:37.700
which is, and this is a bold statement

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:38.620
if I say this here,

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:41.660
because I got a lot of friends that's gonna probably,

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:44.260
but he's probably the best living director.

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:51.340
Because watching him allowed me to understand

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:54.180
a principle that I've coined to him,

01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:56.220
and I don't know if people use it yet,

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:57.540
called multi-vision.

01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:04.900
He seems to have the capacity to see

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:09.300
eight things at one time.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.860
I heard on Robin Hood he had 18 cameras.

01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:13.340
I wasn't there for that.

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:15.660
And you think he keeps them all in his mind, just see.

01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:19.260
I seen him do it when he went to the monitors

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:22.380
with the video playback guy.

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:26.540
I seen him bring everything back to a point,

01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:28.500
but nothing was the same on the frame.

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.340
He was already there,

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:34.780
and he knew if he had what it was or not.

01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:38.260
And he placed the cameras there,

01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:44.260
and he saw it in his own way, and I peeped it.

01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:47.700
And I peeped it.

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:50.660
And I said, yo, and I just humbly asked him.

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:54.180
And he was gracious enough to speak to me

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:59.180
and talk to me and confirm what I thought I saw.

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:00.420
He confirmed it.

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:03.300
He confirmed it, and I was able to utilize it

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.340
as I'm a filmmaker now.

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:09.100
And I see, I could at least see three or four things.

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:11.740
I can't see eight yet, I'll be there though.

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:15.940
But I could definitely, even right now,

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:17.940
just I could go like this in the room.

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:22.420
Okay, I got it now.

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:25.380
I got like how to make this right here,

01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:27.020
which is just us all sitting.

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:29.500
How do I make this, look, boom.

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:32.140
Come on on him.

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:32.980
There's a story there.

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:34.060
There's a story there.

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:36.380
And I might just go off his hanging watch

01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:38.100
or his hanging wristband.

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:38.940
Yeah.

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:40.340
You know, because there's something else there too.

01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:41.180
Is he dead?

01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:42.860
We don't know. Exactly.

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.860
So he has this.

01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:47.420
And even though this is the scene.

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:51.580
You keeping that in mind, all of this in mind.

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.860
What about like, can you give an inkling

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:56.660
of other parts of the process, like the editing?

01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.100
Like where does the magic happen?

01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:58.940
Another thing.

01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:02.140
Pedro, I don't pronounce Pedro last name right.

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:02.980
He's a cool guy.

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:04.700
I had a chance to play rugby with him.

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.180
He was on, was he on my team?

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:08.340
Yeah, well, we were in both teams.

01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:12.460
But Pedro, the editor who, you know,

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:16.740
edited many great films, once again,

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:21.740
he has, I will call, deciphering power.

01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.420
A good editor is a decipher,

01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:29.100
almost like breaking the enigma

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:34.060
because he's dealing with thousands,

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:36.780
or we'll call it a film with millions of feet of film,

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:37.900
at least a million feet of film.

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:40.660
That's a lot of film for a feature.

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.980
He's dealing with that.

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:45.580
But he's dealing with multiple cameras.

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:48.740
So then it's like, it's like two cameras.

01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:50.860
He got an A, B, and he could just go back.

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:54.500
No, he may have six cameras and he has to go back

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.180
and deal with that process.

01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:57.100
And you know what?

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:01.540
He knows how to tell the story again.

01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:06.060
And he proved it on American Gangster

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.060
as me being a witness,

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:10.940
because it's so much information.

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:13.260
It's even when the brothers all start

01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:14.300
getting their little business

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.180
and he picked one of the Bronx,

01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:19.500
and he just captured every neighborhood

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:20.900
within one minute.

01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:23.300
And you knew what would happen.

01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:24.380
You knew it all.

01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.500
You saw the whole rise to fame.

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:29.260
So you watch DePalma and Scarface,

01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:30.660
who does it in two minutes,

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:34.180
but it's only one character.

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:35.500
So you see him go to the bank.

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:36.540
He drops the money off.

01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:37.780
You see him by the lion.

01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:39.900
You see him against his wife or the tiger.

01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:40.740
You see him against his wife.

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:42.900
You see all that, and then it ends

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.820
on the big side of him in the big house

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:46.660
with all the TV screens.

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:49.140
And you seen him go through it, right?

01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:50.460
But in American Gangster,

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:52.620
you're going to tell that story of rising,

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:54.900
but you also got to include these five brothers.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.780
Yeah, and that's all in the edit.

01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:58.620
Oh man.

01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:00.140
But also all in the director,

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:01.260
knowing that as well.

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:03.500
And you got to keep track.

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:04.900
You got to keep thinking about them,

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:06.500
because that was a story right there.

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:08.540
While I was hearing it,

01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:10.140
I don't know if they was taking pictures of him

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:13.700
or everybody's having a little party over there.

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.300
Chess, I think.

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:16.700
Yeah, I like it.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:19.660
They're playing chess in the distance.

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:20.500
This is great.

01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:25.940
You said that you were always an old soul

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:28.180
and see the world as if you're 200 years old.

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:29.420
I like this line.

01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:31.220
Because your creative vision allows you

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:33.740
to see the final piece you've created,

01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.260
or you're creating very quickly,

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:36.300
quicker than others.

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:42.220
I heard that as if you've almost lived many lives.

01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:45.500
You have this experience that allows you to see the vision.

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.620
So let me ask you on creativity.

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.340
Where does this creativity behind,

01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:51.060
where does it come from?

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:53.060
Both musically and film-wise.

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:57.140
Dad, I don't know if I have the answer to that one, right?

01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:59.980
No, seriously, where does it come from?

01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:04.580
Only thing I could say about that is that for some reason,

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:06.180
it seems endless.

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:12.780
And that's peculiar when I think about it myself,

01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:18.660
because I was taught a lot of things from the jizzer.

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:22.100
He introduced me to mathematics.

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:26.100
He introduced me to hip hop itself, the break dancing.

01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:29.700
I got other cousins that introduced me to graffiti.

01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:34.220
Cousins that introduced me to DJing.

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.980
I realized that I had a lot of introductions,

01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:38.380
but the jizzer definitely,

01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:44.420
my older cousin gave me a lot of early inspirations.

01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:49.420
And not saying that he's not creative,

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:53.460
as creative as he was then or now,

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:57.860
I just didn't, the wide span of creativity,

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.300
I don't see him doing that, right?

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:06.740
And I don't see the cousins that taught me how to DJ.

01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:10.940
I didn't see them move from DJing to making the beats.

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:18.060
My cousin that, who actually got me into instruments,

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:23.460
I didn't see him leave funk and rock.

01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:26.220
He didn't go, like I'm an orchestra composer now.

01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:27.220
Yeah.

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:32.020
So I just said to myself,

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:36.980
I just accept myself as a artist, as a creative artist.

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:37.820
That's what I am.

01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:40.420
I have to accept that.

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:41.620
Now where it comes from,

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:45.660
I don't know if I was to try to say where it comes from.

01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:48.540
Like, hey, give me some type of answer.

01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:50.700
I would say from life itself.

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:51.620
But what does it feel like?

01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:53.940
Because you mentioned during this pandemic, for example,

01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:57.900
for some reason more came to you in terms of writing.

01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:00.740
And so do you feel like you're just receiving signals

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:04.980
from elsewhere or do you feel like it's hard work

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:06.300
or you're just waiting?

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:10.700
Wow, it's not even waiting, no, it's hard work.

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:13.580
It's almost like I said in one of my other lyrics,

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:15.540
this is for the MC part of it.

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:18.140
I said, MCing to me is easy as breathing.

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:20.940
So it's like breathing.

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:22.220
Yeah, it's just like,

01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:25.700
in fact, there's actually was a scientific thing

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:28.020
I read about that now that you said that.

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:28.860
You heard this?

01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:30.060
I know you've had to hear this.

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:31.100
They say that,

01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:36.820
the atoms in our atmosphere,

01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:39.500
which seem to be infinite in number,

01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:43.180
are not infinite in the space they occupy.

01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:46.580
Right, because they're in our atmosphere.

01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.940
And so there's a chance

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.420
that at least one million atoms that you breathe

01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:56.660
in your life was breathed by Galileo.

01:16:58.460 --> 01:16:59.460
You heard this before, right?

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:00.380
Yeah.

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:01.220
Okay.

01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:04.140
It's very accurate.

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:07.380
Okay, how does your body digest it?

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:13.700
Well, let's start at the fact that most of the atoms

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:18.380
that we're made of is from like stars, right?

01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:19.980
Stars, births, so like,

01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:22.700
we're all really connected fundamentally somehow.

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:25.140
And then they get the atoms that make up our body

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:25.980
come and leave.

01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:28.100
And the same with the cells that are in our body,

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:29.580
they die and are reborn.

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:31.540
And we don't pay attention to any of that.

01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:33.380
That all just goes through us.

01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:34.220
I don't know.

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:42.020
That makes me feel like I'm not an individual.

01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:45.660
I'm just a finger of something much bigger,

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:47.620
some much bigger organism.

01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:51.780
Because you're drinking the coffee there, right?

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:53.260
You're gonna digest that.

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:56.060
You're gonna digest those atoms,

01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:58.900
whether you're gonna put them through the bowel

01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:00.660
or through the urination, it's coming out,

01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:02.340
or maybe you'll sweat it out.

01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:04.060
You might sneeze it out.

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:05.620
But they're gonna make their way out.

01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:07.220
How do you digest the atoms

01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:10.660
if you just breathe in Galileo, right?

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:14.580
How do, and that's what I think an artist does.

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:16.220
I think something in the artist,

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.580
some people eat things and they're gonna gain weight.

01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:19.700
Some people ain't gonna gain weight,

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:20.940
they're gonna gain muscle.

01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:23.660
I'm just giving you an analogy here.

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:26.380
I'm thinking that the artist breathes in

01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:29.700
and translates it into the art.

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:30.780
First, they gotta hear it.

01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:32.620
I think most of us don't hear that.

01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:35.300
Like don't, we receive it, but it just isn't.

01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:37.580
Right, it's not, yeah, we not have the frequency.

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:40.460
I said this to a lot of artists.

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:42.820
And even, you know, we all could consider ourselves artists

01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:44.980
in a certain way, but not, you know.

01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:48.180
But let's just say there's only

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:51.020
one million artists in the world.

01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:51.940
Yeah.

01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:52.780
Good.

01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:57.540
It's probably 10 of them, yeah.

01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:00.300
If you divide that into the population,

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.980
what would that, what part of the table would it be?

01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:04.180
That tiny part.

01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:06.340
Yeah, it might be that, right?

01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:07.780
Yeah.

01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:11.540
Yeah, it's that that inspires that.

01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:12.380
Oh yeah.

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:13.940
And you know what's so crazy about that though?

01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:16.140
There's also a chance, I'm just going numbers

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:18.140
and I'm just hypothesizing with you,

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:20.860
but there's also a chance that all of this

01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:24.260
is actually informing that.

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:25.100
Yeah.

01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:29.780
The artist is just watching this, all of this,

01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:32.060
all of the chaos of this.

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:34.580
Yeah, so it's hard to know where the beauty comes from.

01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:36.700
Is it the artist or the chaos from the-

01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:39.260
So I just, I don't have the answer,

01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:42.020
but if I was to be forced to say an answer,

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:42.900
and you're not twisting my arm,

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:44.260
but I'll say-

01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:45.300
I can if you want me to.

01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:46.140
No, thank you.

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:47.140
I'll say life.

01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:50.060
Yeah, life.

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:54.940
In the Tao of Wu, you write something about confusion,

01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:56.220
which I really like.

01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:58.700
Confusion is a gift from God.

01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:01.860
Those times when you feel most desperate for a solution,

01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:06.100
sit, wait, the information will become clear.

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.740
The confusion is there to guide you.

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:12.540
Seek detachment and become the producer of your life.

01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:15.620
So I got to ask you advice.

01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:20.060
If a young person today in high school, college,

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:21.420
is looking for some advice,

01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:23.340
what advice could you give them

01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:26.140
to be a producer of a life that can be proud of?

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.700
Read the Tao of Wu.

01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:31.420
Let's start with the Wu Tang manual first.

01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:33.340
Yeah, no, you can do that second.

01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:34.180
Second?

01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:35.020
Yeah.

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:36.420
I think you can read the Tao of Wu first

01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:37.820
and then do the manual,

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:41.300
because the manual is not to put the two books

01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:42.140
against each other,

01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:43.820
but the manual is talking about things

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:47.340
that is so deeply connected to the music

01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:51.260
and the people and the Tao of Wu goes beyond that.

01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:55.580
So I would actually start there,

01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:57.620
which is not normally how I prescribe.

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:58.460
I always tell people,

01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:00.420
start in knowledge, then go to wisdom.

01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:01.260
But since the Tao-

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:02.780
Skip ahead to the wisdom, I like it.

01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:06.180
Yeah, I think for a young man in high school,

01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:08.980
go to the Tao of Wu and then go back.

01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:11.620
It's just like sometimes you had,

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:13.540
like my son's generation,

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:17.060
they had to watch the second round of Star Wars.

01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:17.900
Yeah.

01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:19.660
And then go back, you know what I mean?

01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:22.620
This generation is watching The Force Awakens

01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:24.420
and then they go back, yeah.

01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:28.540
But what, because if you just look at your life

01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:31.860
as an example, that's one heck of a life.

01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:33.740
There's very few lives like it.

01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:36.180
You've created some of the most incredible things

01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:38.260
artistically in this world.

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:42.580
Like if somebody, you talk about that like one million,

01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:44.700
right, at the corner of the table.

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:48.860
If somebody once strives, dreams to become one of those,

01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:50.500
how do they do it?

01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:53.420
Well, the beautiful thing is that

01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:55.980
there are footprints left by those who've done it.

01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:02.460
And the best way is to study that.

01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:05.220
To study those who've already done what you wanna do.

01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:10.540
We live on the civilizations.

01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:13.260
We said this is the greatest country in the world,

01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:16.100
but our seal is a pyramid with an eye on it.

01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:18.020
You know what I mean?

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:19.700
Because they did it before.

01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:22.380
And they may have failed for some reason

01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:24.220
or something happens,

01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:27.660
but it was just a strong enough example, right,

01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:28.940
to take us further.

01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:31.500
Elon Musk is sitting here trying to do better

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:33.780
than what the rocket builders did before.

01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:36.180
He's not the first one to build the rocket.

01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:39.060
He's not the first guy to think of with the electric car.

01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:40.380
He's doing it better.

01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:43.340
He's advancing it to the point that

01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:45.140
whoever picks up after him,

01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:47.700
maybe they'll get to that flying car.

01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:49.660
So that's the beauty.

01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:52.540
There's a good verse.

01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:55.380
I love finding verses that say things to confirm

01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:58.860
because this way people could take it verbally,

01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:01.180
physically, and then maybe even spiritually.

01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:02.580
But Christmas has said a verse.

01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:06.020
He said, the fastest way to heaven

01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:08.620
is by spending time or studying the wise people,

01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:10.460
meaning the wise people who is living

01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:11.900
and those who live before you.

01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:14.820
Study the masters.

01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:17.340
Let me ask you a big, perhaps ridiculous question,

01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:18.860
but give it a shot.

01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:20.260
What is the meaning of this whole thing?

01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:21.620
What's the meaning of life?

01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:24.420
Big question.

01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:26.220
I'm not gonna rush into the answer.

01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:33.180
I'm gonna give you somebody else answer first

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:35.020
and I'll give you my answer.

01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:36.260
I remember asking this

01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:42.020
and I don't know, I was 15, 16 years old.

01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:45.060
One of the brothers, we're studying in mathematics

01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:51.060
and the letter I itself means I, Islam.

01:23:55.340 --> 01:24:00.340
I meaning the individual being a total accord with Islam.

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:04.020
Let me just finish this.

01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:07.100
Then they took the word Islam and they defined it

01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:12.100
that Islam is an Arabic word for peace.

01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:18.300
Then they said peace is the absence of confusion.

01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:25.140
Then they took, this is something that really hit me

01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:26.580
when I was, I never forgot it

01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:28.700
and I'm gonna decipher it anyway,

01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:31.260
but then they took the word Islam

01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:34.940
and they broke it down by the letter into an acronym

01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:37.300
like casual, everything around me.

01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:42.300
And they broke it down to I stimulate light and matter.

01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:51.060
Because what hit me is that if you're not here,

01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:55.180
then light and matter don't exist to you.

01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:59.220
So you're stimulating it or it ain't here for you.

01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:00.180
So anyway, taking all that.

01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:03.900
So then I said, so what's the meaning of life?

01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:06.860
And the brother just said, love Islam forever.

01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:12.820
I ain't saying the religious point of it.

01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:14.340
I'm just saying all those other elements

01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:15.820
I just spoke about in front of it.

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.900
I stimulate light and matter.

01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:19.460
I love that, that's powerful.

01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:23.060
And let me give you my definition of life.

01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:29.340
I think life is that simply

01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:31.540
for each and every one of us to add on to.

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:37.420
Build, like you said, the masters, build on top.

01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:39.620
Life gave you life, give life back.

01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:43.300
I don't think there's a better way to end it

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:44.860
than talking about the meaning of life.

01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:47.540
RZA, I'm a huge fan, it's such a huge honor

01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:49.420
that you spend your valuable time with me.

01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:50.260
Thank you so much.

01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:52.420
Thank you for inviting me, peace.

01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:55.300
Thanks for listening to this conversation with RZA.

And now let me leave you with some words from Plato.

01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:07.300
Poetry is nearer to vital truth than history.

01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:10.980
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
