WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.180
Once this whole thing falls apart and we are climbing the kudzu vines that

00:04.180 --> 00:07.940
spiral up the Sears tower, like they say in fight club, Bobby will go back to

00:07.940 --> 00:12.380
his gather reform and be happy as a pig in shit, just walking around in a loin

00:12.380 --> 00:16.300
cloth with his bird hanging out, tracking jokes to people and climbing up on them

00:16.300 --> 00:18.500
for a stool lap dance or whatever he does.

00:18.500 --> 00:21.840
Do you think some level of crazies are required for comedy?

00:22.240 --> 00:27.080
Like at some point, have there been low points in your life?

00:27.160 --> 00:31.460
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35.560 --> 00:41.120
The following is a conversation with Will Sasso, a comedian, actor, podcaster,

00:41.480 --> 00:47.060
and someone I've been a fan of for many years since Matt TV in the late 90s to

00:47.060 --> 00:53.760
recently with the 10 minute podcast and now the new podcast called dude Z.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.040
This is the Lex Fridman podcast to support it.

00:57.080 --> 01:00.060
Please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear

01:00.060 --> 01:02.760
friends, here's Will Sasso.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.880
So let's call it the elephant in the room.

01:06.760 --> 01:10.640
You wore a black suit in a recent episode of dude Z.

01:10.680 --> 01:11.000
Yes.

01:13.280 --> 01:16.680
You wore a black suit again today, uh, Shakespeare, then Mark Twain

01:16.680 --> 01:18.480
said clothes make the man.

01:19.360 --> 01:21.920
Uh, what kind of man does a suit make you?

01:22.280 --> 01:26.680
Well, me in particular, it makes me a fellow who did not get this dry

01:26.680 --> 01:30.860
cleaned in between, cause that episode of the show, as we sit here now

01:30.860 --> 01:34.760
was around a week ago, so that's, that's the kind of man it makes me.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.600
Well, the, uh, the nice thing is you're wearing pants.

01:37.600 --> 01:41.320
I think, yes, I don't think you were wearing pants in the episode.

01:41.340 --> 01:41.900
That's correct.

01:41.900 --> 01:45.060
I prefer to wear shorts, but this was a special occasion.

01:45.060 --> 01:49.200
So I'm wearing pants and I thought it fitting obviously to just wear, you

01:49.200 --> 01:54.880
know, the black tie and, uh, clothes do make the man and I'm a, I would not

01:54.880 --> 01:59.760
consider myself to be a man of leisure, but I do enjoy shorts cause I, my legs

01:59.760 --> 02:03.520
get hot, so that's what kind of man the shorts make me do wear a suit.

02:03.960 --> 02:05.240
I fucking hate wearing suits.

02:05.440 --> 02:06.000
So what is this?

02:06.000 --> 02:10.520
A statement of, uh, is it ironic or is it, are you honoring the

02:10.520 --> 02:12.040
gods of this particular podcast?

02:12.040 --> 02:14.960
I'm honoring the gods of this particular podcast would be a good way to put it.

02:15.280 --> 02:15.600
Yes.

02:15.600 --> 02:20.160
No, this is, this is in, in reverence of, and in dedication to you and our

02:20.160 --> 02:26.560
new found friendship here, which we are, uh, making on the podcast you and I just

02:26.560 --> 02:30.380
met everything that we're saying here is the first things that we're saying to

02:30.380 --> 02:34.280
each other, so I'm meeting you on common ground dressed like, well, I've been

02:34.280 --> 02:37.960
actually a one-way friend of yours for many, many years since mad TV.

02:38.120 --> 02:40.280
Oh, uh, when did you start on mad TV?

02:40.280 --> 02:43.560
So that was many, I mean, in nineties, 97, yeah, 97.

02:43.960 --> 02:46.600
So I was a huge fan of yours and the cast was incredible.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.360
It was one of the funniest shows ever created that your whole

02:49.360 --> 02:50.680
journey watching through that.

02:50.680 --> 02:54.520
It was, it was incredible from mad TV to three stooges, to the podcast,

02:55.040 --> 02:59.160
the, uh, the 10 minute pod and then the new podcast is incredible.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.760
Um, cheers.

03:01.080 --> 03:05.840
My favorite role that you played was the mountain in the game of thrones.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.520
What was it like working with dragons?

03:08.040 --> 03:12.560
Well, the dragons are usually tennis balls on the end of C stands,

03:13.080 --> 03:16.120
but, uh, sometimes they, they hang out.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.520
Um, I am C stand.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.600
It's like, you know, it's like a little, like the thing you got the camera on here.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.880
Oh, this is like film lingo.

03:22.960 --> 03:23.200
Yeah.

03:23.200 --> 03:23.920
No, I understand.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.640
I'm trying to impress you with my film lingo.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.760
You know what a banana is?

03:27.280 --> 03:27.520
Yeah.

03:27.520 --> 03:30.280
When you walk like this, do it a banana.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.040
I take it back.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.320
I did not know what a banana was.

03:32.320 --> 03:32.520
Yeah.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.680
See, it means something that, yeah, cause it's just a food.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.200
Yeah.

03:36.240 --> 03:42.280
Normally, uh, I am see Hollywood folk with the lingo and I'm, uh, my name is

03:42.280 --> 03:45.640
Bjorn Hapthor Bjornsson and I am seven foot four.

03:46.320 --> 03:49.600
And, uh, yeah, so dragons don't, dragons don't scare me, even though

03:49.600 --> 03:51.000
they've been extinct for a while.

03:51.600 --> 03:52.880
We use scientists, right?

03:52.880 --> 03:53.680
Is that check out?

03:54.120 --> 03:56.560
Yeah, I actually, I'm really into video games.

03:56.600 --> 03:57.600
I don't know if you play video games.

03:57.600 --> 04:01.680
There's a, there's a Skyrim, uh, video game.

04:01.680 --> 04:03.280
That's part of the elder scroll series.

04:03.280 --> 04:06.000
And for the longest time, there's a legend that there's dragons.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.760
I think it started in a dagger fall.

04:07.760 --> 04:11.400
And so I always, I grew up playing those video games and dreaming of one

04:11.400 --> 04:14.160
day meeting a dragon in a virtual world.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.800
And eventually you did in Skyrim.

04:16.800 --> 04:21.400
So it's dragons represent, I don't know exactly what they represent, but they

04:21.440 --> 04:27.040
represent maybe this kind of mythical creature that is bigger than anything.

04:27.520 --> 04:32.240
Humans can possibly comprehend maybe because they're so, they're so, they

04:32.240 --> 04:37.840
show up so often in myth from the, from the religious stories, you know, of the

04:37.840 --> 04:39.280
snake and so on the serpent.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.840
And I don't know what that is.

04:40.880 --> 04:41.880
Well, there's breathing fire.

04:41.880 --> 04:42.560
That's kind of weird.

04:42.640 --> 04:45.440
It's interesting when I think about dragons, cause now that you bring it up,

04:45.440 --> 04:48.240
these are people that probably wouldn't have access to the fact that there used

04:48.240 --> 04:50.040
to be dinosaurs, maybe they did.

04:50.840 --> 04:55.800
If they didn't, they're drawing things that look like, you know, a dinosaur

04:55.800 --> 05:00.880
cousin, but cool, they can breathe fire and has wacky wings and a spiked tail.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.880
Um, yeah.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.240
Where the heck did they come up with that?

05:04.240 --> 05:07.800
Cause they're clearly of course represented in mythology all the way back

05:07.800 --> 05:10.480
to, uh, no, not cave drawings.

05:10.680 --> 05:13.600
Well, the Egyptians probably knew what the, and they could time travel.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.160
So they would have gone back to the caves.

05:15.680 --> 05:21.120
Well, the aliens that placed living organisms on earth could time travel

05:21.120 --> 05:25.920
and they could plant legends into the, into the collective intelligence

05:25.920 --> 05:27.440
of the human species.

05:27.520 --> 05:27.840
Yeah.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.560
And perhaps they were thinking of us to do something smart with it.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.240
And we didn't, we just came up with the sky.

05:32.240 --> 05:33.640
No, we're just, what's that?

05:33.640 --> 05:34.920
Sorry, that was very offensive.

05:35.040 --> 05:35.640
I'm sorry.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.960
I don't mean to offend you with your video game.

05:37.960 --> 05:42.040
I'm more of a burger burger time, uh, Donkey Kong dude.

05:42.640 --> 05:43.720
Oh, what is that?

05:44.040 --> 05:47.840
That's an original burger time was an arcade game that, uh, later

05:47.840 --> 05:49.600
showed up on the Intellivision.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.720
Um, uh, it was Intellivision.

05:52.720 --> 05:56.600
I believe it was made by Texas instruments, horrible first generation,

05:56.640 --> 05:59.120
uh, video game console and burger time.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.560
You just, it's like super Mario.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.320
You just got to stay away from the, the eggs and the pickles and stuff.

06:04.360 --> 06:07.880
And you just go and you, the bun falls and then you go down to

06:08.760 --> 06:10.320
the cheese and then the meat.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.920
I'm not going to say it's as complicated as Skyrim, but, uh, took me a while

06:14.920 --> 06:16.120
to finish it when I was seven.

06:17.800 --> 06:21.480
Did you play video games that was a part of your life, a part of the source

06:21.480 --> 06:22.840
of happiness for you at all?

06:22.920 --> 06:24.000
It was, it was.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.440
I played video games up until around, uh, I think in 2010, I got the red

06:29.440 --> 06:31.640
ring of death on my Xbox three 60.

06:32.280 --> 06:32.720
That was it.

06:32.880 --> 06:37.680
I never, or whatever the Xbox was then I had, I was playing, uh, I had

06:37.680 --> 06:41.320
finished, uh, the, the grand theft auto that was out and had finished

06:41.320 --> 06:42.520
the red dead redemption.

06:42.800 --> 06:46.800
So I was doing that thing where you just drive around, uh, you know,

06:46.840 --> 06:50.440
the streets of New York or just ride around on your horse, shooting people

06:50.720 --> 06:54.720
and, uh, you know, throwing grenades into, into groups of people in grand theft.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.400
And you're, you're describing the same thing that happened a decade later.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.800
Cause it's now red dead redemption too.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.280
And there's still not a new grand theft auto.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.120
So there isn't, right?

07:05.120 --> 07:05.960
Yeah, they're working on it.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.640
They're always flirting with that idea.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.200
You know, who else plays Skyrim?

07:10.080 --> 07:13.080
Another person, the two people I'm a huge fan of from that time

07:13.080 --> 07:14.320
in Matt TV is Bobby Lee.

07:14.720 --> 07:15.640
He plays Skyrim.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.440
He's a huge fan of Skyrim plays every.

07:17.880 --> 07:23.640
So what Bobby Lee loves to do is the grind, do the boring task

07:23.640 --> 07:25.600
over and over gather mushroom.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.560
Like in Skyrim, you can fight dragons.

07:27.560 --> 07:30.960
You can fight all kinds of things, but you can also gather mushrooms

07:30.960 --> 07:34.160
and different ingredients and make potions and all that kind of, he

07:34.160 --> 07:35.680
loves the ingredients that he's the.

07:36.240 --> 07:38.360
You know, in the hunter gatherer world, he's the gatherer.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.200
He's the gatherer.

07:39.680 --> 07:40.040
Yeah.

07:40.400 --> 07:44.120
I've heard him describe that way and he likes to describe himself that way.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.560
Uh, I worked with Bobby not too long ago.

07:46.560 --> 07:49.760
He came and did a couple of days on this thing we were shooting and, uh,

07:50.120 --> 07:52.200
I was looking forward to catching up with my old pal.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.200
And if you know anything about Bobby Lee, you'd probably be able to

07:55.200 --> 07:59.000
predict that he spent that entire time playing farming on his iPad.

07:59.560 --> 08:03.040
Well, humans are our source of anxiety and trouble.

08:03.040 --> 08:06.200
So sometimes it's good to escape human interaction through video games.

08:06.280 --> 08:06.680
Totally.

08:06.760 --> 08:07.640
I'm with him on that.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.800
He's, he's one of the funniest people ever.

08:11.120 --> 08:14.560
What, what, what do you think is, uh, what do you think makes him funny?

08:14.560 --> 08:19.160
It's just all the times you've worked with him, the, the non-standard,

08:19.160 --> 08:21.320
non-secular way of his being.

08:22.240 --> 08:29.000
Bobby Lee is one of the most raw people, raw performers who lets it all hang

08:29.000 --> 08:32.720
out to the degree that he will even get naked in front of his audience,

08:32.720 --> 08:35.440
which is usually a metaphor for someone doing standup.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.240
I'm bearing all I'm showing you everything.

08:38.520 --> 08:40.920
And Bobby will just pull his bird out of his pants.

08:40.920 --> 08:41.160
Yeah.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.800
I don't think he understands metaphor too much.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.440
He embodies metaphor.

08:44.480 --> 08:44.720
Yes.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.880
He embodies metaphor.

08:46.160 --> 08:46.960
He's the gather.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.600
We call them the gathering metaphor, Bobby, the gatherer metaphor.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.680
He's a metaphor for something else for somebody else's life.

08:53.880 --> 08:58.800
Someday he'll be in the dictionary representing some kind of concept,

08:58.800 --> 09:00.000
maybe the metaphor itself.

09:00.040 --> 09:00.280
Yeah.

09:00.320 --> 09:04.920
Once, once this whole thing falls apart and we are climbing the kudzu vines that

09:04.920 --> 09:08.840
spiral up the Sears tower, like they say in fight club, Bobby will go back to his

09:08.840 --> 09:13.440
gather reform and be happy as a pig and shit, just walking around in a loincloth

09:13.440 --> 09:17.400
with his bird hanging out, tracking jokes to people and climbing up on them for a

09:17.400 --> 09:19.240
stool lap dance or whatever he does.

09:19.360 --> 09:22.000
I'd love to dig into something he, he did.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.120
You guys did a lot of great podcasts together.

09:24.520 --> 09:29.720
He asked you in a very uncomfortable process of why you don't do standup.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.760
So let me ask you, do you hate money?

09:34.920 --> 09:36.280
Well, I'm originally from Canada.

09:36.280 --> 09:36.520
Yeah.

09:36.520 --> 09:40.840
So I'm a, I'm, yeah, I'm a, I'm a fricking pinko socialist.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.760
Is that what, uh, where you come from?

09:42.760 --> 09:43.920
That's not a nice thing to say.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.120
I thought the Soviet union.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.680
That is a nice thing to say.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.640
Like someone, right?

09:50.640 --> 09:53.200
Comrade is a, is a good, he's a good socialist.

09:53.240 --> 09:53.600
Yeah.

09:54.120 --> 09:54.400
Yeah.

09:54.400 --> 09:57.520
Red, like some bold colors.

09:57.520 --> 09:57.840
Yeah.

09:57.880 --> 09:58.160
Yeah.

09:58.240 --> 10:01.400
There was an interesting tension in your voice and the way you talked about it,

10:01.400 --> 10:03.680
there's just not a source of happiness for you.

10:03.680 --> 10:07.560
You, you, you respect the art form, but it was not something that you were

10:07.560 --> 10:09.480
connected to, you felt connected to.

10:09.560 --> 10:10.480
That's a good way to put it.

10:10.480 --> 10:10.800
Yeah.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.760
I respect the art form a lot.

10:13.760 --> 10:16.120
I, and I grew up with all the albums and stuff.

10:16.120 --> 10:20.800
I had an older brother and sister who, so I, you know, we had the, we had George

10:20.800 --> 10:26.320
Carlin, we had, uh, you know, Richard Pryor, we had Robert Klein, we had Gilda

10:26.320 --> 10:28.840
live, the Gilda Radner, uh, concert.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.920
We had, we had all sorts of stuff, but you know, I don't know.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.840
There's a lot of, there's a lot of reasons.

10:33.880 --> 10:39.400
I do feel like a career in show business is, you know, they, it never goes the

10:39.400 --> 10:41.520
way you plan, uh, like most things.

10:41.800 --> 10:45.840
And I was fortunate enough to get started outside of my native Vancouver

10:45.880 --> 10:47.240
or in my native Vancouver.

10:47.240 --> 10:50.360
I grew up in the burbs outside and there was a lot of industry there.

10:50.640 --> 10:54.760
So I was fortunate enough to get started as an actor when I was like 16.

10:54.760 --> 11:00.400
So there, there, yeah, there was, there were some times early on where I came up

11:00.400 --> 11:06.080
with some standup stuff and did it, but, uh, yeah, I quickly abandoned it.

11:06.080 --> 11:09.800
And then, you know, you go through, you do mad TV and stuff.

11:09.800 --> 11:13.040
And then, and that's where my, and this is going to sound weird.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.200
Do I sound as anxiety as I did when I was on Bobby's podcast,

11:16.200 --> 11:17.360
trying to avoid his questions?

11:18.240 --> 11:22.840
Well, he was giving you this face this whole time that was making the whole

11:22.840 --> 11:25.120
just atmosphere feel full of anxiety.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.600
So I'm trying not to give you a face.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.800
I mean, the whole time I was saying, play cool, play cool.

11:28.840 --> 11:29.000
Yeah.

11:29.000 --> 11:29.280
Okay.

11:29.640 --> 11:30.600
Uh, play cool.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.760
Lex cool.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.040
You said it out loud a couple of times.

11:33.320 --> 11:34.960
I did just, you know, you cut that out.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.280
Play cool, play cool, cut out, cut it out.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.080
Maintain bro.

11:38.160 --> 11:38.680
Here's what I'll say.

11:38.680 --> 11:39.520
There's two ways to do it.

11:39.800 --> 11:44.400
I think it's lame when someone who's done one thing for a while goes and starts

11:44.400 --> 11:48.720
doing standup out of nowhere, cause I think it's an art form that's, uh, under

11:48.720 --> 11:51.720
attack because it's not like anything else.

11:51.720 --> 11:56.360
You need, although now you can of course, you know, make whatever you want.

11:56.480 --> 12:00.240
It's the era of self publishing as far as making a product and putting it out

12:00.240 --> 12:02.400
there, which is getting easier, of course.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.840
And I can't wait to talk to you about that with, with AI and how it's changing

12:05.880 --> 12:11.880
art, um, but, uh, the, in standup, all you need is a, is a microphone.

12:12.480 --> 12:16.720
And you know, perhaps, uh, it'd be good to have some mental illness and then

12:16.720 --> 12:20.040
you can just run up there and, uh, uh, talk forever.

12:20.360 --> 12:22.920
And I say this to, to, you know, comedians.

12:22.920 --> 12:29.160
It's like, Hey, you guys have to deal with just an influx of people who

12:29.160 --> 12:30.840
aren't sure why they're doing comedy.

12:30.960 --> 12:34.000
I would ask comedians and like, I mean, not good ones and good ones.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
You know what they're doing, but everyone else like, what are you doing?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.720
Why, why are you doing standup?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.600
Having said that, I am allergic to money.

12:40.280 --> 12:40.720
Yeah.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.440
Do you think they have a good answer for that?

12:42.480 --> 12:43.320
Why are they doing it?

12:43.320 --> 12:45.800
Cause I actually like when I'm in Austin, I like going to open

12:45.800 --> 12:46.920
mics, just listening.

12:47.560 --> 12:48.800
It's inspiring to me.

12:49.400 --> 12:53.240
Um, both the funny and the unfunny people, because they've been doing

12:53.240 --> 12:57.680
it for several years, sometimes over a decade, and they're still at it.

12:58.080 --> 12:58.920
They're still right there.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.040
There's going for the punch.

13:00.080 --> 13:05.800
And then especially open mics that are really sad in that there is, you know,

13:05.800 --> 13:09.080
only like five other people in the audience and they're usually just other

13:09.080 --> 13:13.520
comedians and they're still going all out as if they're in front of a stadium.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.040
But that to me sounds like someone who loves it.

13:16.680 --> 13:16.960
Yeah.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.640
I got no questions for that person.

13:19.280 --> 13:23.080
I got questions for someone who goes sideways from here.

13:23.080 --> 13:27.240
I'm recognizable doing something and then I'm doing standup because it's

13:27.240 --> 13:30.560
like, and truly look, I've been, I've been fortunate enough to be in

13:30.560 --> 13:31.520
the business for a long time.

13:31.520 --> 13:35.040
And at this point, if I came up, I mean, doing live stuff is fun.

13:35.440 --> 13:39.760
I have friends that are like, um, you know, some guys who are primarily sketch

13:39.840 --> 13:42.600
people or you would look at them as sketch people and they can sell

13:42.600 --> 13:43.920
tickets for being sketch people.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.560
And they, and we'll talk about it.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.720
And they're like, well, you know, I do a monologue.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.920
And I do a little standup.

13:48.920 --> 13:49.920
Then I do a song.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.600
Then I do another monologue.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.640
Then I play off the audience, do a little standup.

13:54.360 --> 14:01.800
Um, but standup is it's almost like playing music in that, you know, people

14:01.800 --> 14:04.480
are going up there playing music, but what band have you been listening to?

14:04.480 --> 14:05.760
That's what you're going to sound like.

14:06.360 --> 14:10.200
So it's really, I mean, of course I'm speaking from zero experience,

14:10.480 --> 14:13.960
but I've heard it takes years of course, to find your own voice.

14:14.200 --> 14:18.080
Standups that when they first go up, they're, they're doing a, some sort

14:18.080 --> 14:20.640
of impersonation of so-and-so and so-and-so.

14:20.920 --> 14:24.760
And then you gotta, you gotta pop this audience that that's paying and you're

14:24.760 --> 14:28.560
going to get run over by the next person who's coming up and, uh, it's hard to

14:28.560 --> 14:31.000
follow the last person who went up before you.

14:31.360 --> 14:36.360
And I said, I mean, that is a really hard way to, it's a very, it's quite

14:36.360 --> 14:38.560
a gauntlet to be in to find your voice comedically.

14:38.560 --> 14:41.160
But don't you have that same kind of thing with sketch where you still

14:41.200 --> 14:44.800
have to find your own voice with, uh, like all the impressions you do,

14:44.800 --> 14:46.200
they're just terrible.

14:46.240 --> 14:49.400
You know, there, there are different spins on different people.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.040
They're not like perfect impressions, right?

14:52.400 --> 14:55.920
So that's the, I mean, that's a similar kind of challenge and

14:55.920 --> 14:57.680
journey as standup.

14:57.720 --> 15:01.320
You're just saying they're kind of distinct and you fell into this one

15:01.320 --> 15:05.560
and you fell in love with it, which is like what mad TV kind of opens you up to.

15:05.720 --> 15:08.280
Yeah, as a kid, I literally wanted to be an actor.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.520
I always wanted to be an actor from a very young age.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.280
As far back as I can remember.

15:12.280 --> 15:16.360
And I was the class clown and wanted to do comedy stuff and, uh, comedic

15:16.360 --> 15:17.920
acting and so comedic acting.

15:18.200 --> 15:23.920
Yeah, early on my, my influences were a very predictable list of, uh, guys

15:23.920 --> 15:30.400
from, from SETV early Saturday night live, uh, Monty Python, all of those

15:30.400 --> 15:32.480
performers really influenced me.

15:32.560 --> 15:37.800
It was later that I saw people like Kevin Klein, who's an incredible actor.

15:38.360 --> 15:43.040
I vividly remember being like 12, 13, seeing him get an Academy award for

15:43.360 --> 15:45.320
fish called Wanda and it blew my mind.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.200
Cause I was like, he was hilarious.

15:47.200 --> 15:51.720
I mean, it was one of my favorite movies back then and now, and, uh, he won

15:51.720 --> 15:57.560
an Academy award and at that point, I, I started thinking more about acting.

15:58.040 --> 16:03.320
And then I was, like I said, really fortunate to fall in with, um, I mean, I

16:03.320 --> 16:06.480
always wanted to do it and I was trying to hustle this and that when I was a kid.

16:06.480 --> 16:11.400
And then I ended up getting represented and then I ended up on a teen show.

16:11.720 --> 16:16.240
I was on, I basically, the easiest way to pitch it is it's like a Canadian, my

16:16.240 --> 16:20.480
so-called life with these kids in their lives and stuff, and I did that for like

16:20.480 --> 16:23.480
five years and I really love acting.

16:23.520 --> 16:29.000
I really truly love acting and I don't, I'm not someone who wants people to know

16:29.000 --> 16:35.160
my opinion, so that's another thing about standup, like I love the illusion of

16:35.160 --> 16:40.160
what I get to do in, uh, in, uh, entertainment and podcasting is great for

16:40.160 --> 16:45.320
that, but to stand up there and, and from, I don't know, just for me, it's

16:45.320 --> 16:47.640
like, it would have to all be fantasy.

16:48.160 --> 16:48.960
And, um,

16:49.560 --> 16:50.000
yeah.

16:50.160 --> 16:53.960
So Nietzsche said that every profound spirit needs a mask.

16:54.520 --> 16:59.520
Uh, like you said, you don't like to talk about in your comedy.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.240
You don't like to talk about stuff that's personal to you.

17:02.560 --> 17:03.200
Yeah.

17:03.560 --> 17:04.240
What is that?

17:04.240 --> 17:08.480
It would, if you were to psychoanalyze yourself, do you think it's just not

17:08.840 --> 17:12.160
something you find funny or is it's, are you running from something?

17:12.720 --> 17:15.760
Um, and, uh, it's not your fault.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.200
Well, it's not your fault.

17:17.200 --> 17:21.880
Well, um, speaking of another really great comedic actor who's also a

17:21.880 --> 17:25.280
serious actor, Robert Williams, one of the best serious actors.

17:25.320 --> 17:30.720
I mean, I mean, I, I, and you know, one of the funniest people of all time, but

17:31.040 --> 17:36.240
as great, as incredible as he was as a funny man, as a, as a standup and a

17:36.240 --> 17:39.600
performer, I almost like his, his serious stuff better.

17:39.680 --> 17:40.880
Can I ask you a question about that?

17:40.880 --> 17:43.400
What, what do you make of the, that he committed suicide?

17:43.400 --> 17:47.120
I think it's, I think it's, I mean, it's super depressing.

17:47.160 --> 17:51.960
I, I, I've referred to him as like the Jesus Christ of, of, uh, depression.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.440
It's almost like he died for others' depression.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.040
You know what I mean?

17:55.040 --> 17:59.080
Like, you'd look at someone like that and go, wait a minute, you're a rock star.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.760
Like you don't, you could just check out if you're not liking your life.

18:03.200 --> 18:07.080
And of course, something like suicide begs that you look a little deeper

18:07.080 --> 18:12.640
and realize how tortured the human mind can, can make someone.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.680
Is there some aspect to, you know, we're in LA.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.240
Is there some aspect of celebrity that it's isolating that

18:19.280 --> 18:20.520
can make you feel really lonely?

18:21.280 --> 18:21.960
Not me.

18:21.960 --> 18:23.400
I don't feel, no, not really.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.080
You feel the love?

18:25.640 --> 18:29.000
No, I just feel like I'm not, I mean, it's like, I don't know.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.080
I've always kind of had a small group of friends and those people don't, you

18:34.080 --> 18:37.000
know, it's like, I've known the same people for years and years.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.600
You never really felt the celebrity really.

18:39.320 --> 18:41.920
In LA, it's hard to, it's hard for people.

18:41.960 --> 18:42.720
Nobody cares.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.440
They see you and then the next minute they see so-and-so.

18:45.760 --> 18:51.680
So it's like, you know, I'm the guy from that Mike and Molly, right?

18:51.720 --> 18:52.560
Nope, nope.

18:52.560 --> 18:52.880
Close.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.760
King of, uh, King, you, you shave your head, you go bald.

18:56.040 --> 18:56.920
Are you King Queens?

18:57.000 --> 18:57.320
Nope.

18:57.840 --> 18:58.160
Not me.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.120
So close.

19:00.720 --> 19:04.680
You were, wow, you used to be the mountain on Game of Thrones.

19:04.680 --> 19:05.400
You look like shit.

19:05.400 --> 19:05.840
What happened?

19:07.080 --> 19:08.200
Just eating fried dough.

19:08.560 --> 19:08.800
Yeah.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.520
Um, yeah, that's what's up.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.280
Can't lift any weights anymore.

19:12.320 --> 19:17.880
I'm at the gym doing like 15 pounds with shoulder press and people coming up to me.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.680
You used to be a dragon killer.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.360
Half the man used to be.

19:22.840 --> 19:25.000
What's, have there been low points in your life?

19:25.800 --> 19:27.120
Sorry to go there, but.

19:28.320 --> 19:38.000
Uh, yeah, you know, Hey, yeah, everybody has a low point in life.

19:38.480 --> 19:41.040
The opera suffer from like depression and you know, those kinds of things.

19:41.040 --> 19:41.840
You know what I do.

19:42.120 --> 19:42.480
I do.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.600
I have, uh, I have a bunch of stuff.

19:45.680 --> 19:46.480
How do you deal with it?

19:46.680 --> 19:49.680
Said friends, the friends and the, they don't do anything.

19:51.160 --> 19:51.560
Yeah.

19:51.800 --> 19:56.440
I have, uh, I have an incredible fiance who, uh, that that's nice to have somebody,

19:56.440 --> 20:01.440
uh, uh, constant that you love very much and see as the best person and all that

20:01.440 --> 20:03.440
good stuff, hopefully vice versa.

20:03.760 --> 20:08.840
Uh, and then, uh, on your recent Instagram, she said that she loves you.

20:08.840 --> 20:14.040
So at least on, yeah, allegedly that might all be for, yeah, that's how much

20:14.040 --> 20:15.400
money did you pay her to say that?

20:15.640 --> 20:17.600
I don't, I don't have any cause I'm not a standup.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.760
I was like, I could do, you got Venmo.

20:20.800 --> 20:21.400
Yeah.

20:21.440 --> 20:24.200
I got, I only have like a hundred and 23 years, some Doge coin.

20:24.280 --> 20:24.480
Yeah.

20:24.680 --> 20:25.160
Doge.

20:25.280 --> 20:25.560
Yeah.

20:25.560 --> 20:27.480
You got some Doge.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.320
I got some of those monkey NFTs.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.240
Oh, before I forget.

20:31.320 --> 20:31.720
Yes.

20:32.320 --> 20:32.880
Hold on a second.

20:33.680 --> 20:34.160
Oh no.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.960
Put a dudesie sticker on your microphone.

20:36.960 --> 20:37.640
If that's okay.

20:37.960 --> 20:38.240
Sure.

20:39.760 --> 20:40.080
Here.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.240
Uh, oh yeah.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.240
Uh, these are tricky.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.680
Cause I have the thumbs of a, I have like Italian sausage thumbs.

20:45.680 --> 20:45.920
Yeah.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.400
Just wait, wait a minute.

20:48.040 --> 20:48.920
This will take another.

20:49.600 --> 20:50.160
Yeah.

20:50.520 --> 20:51.200
Yeah.

20:51.760 --> 20:52.240
Oh man.

20:52.280 --> 20:52.560
Yeah.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.760
Ooh, this is embarrassing.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.440
When there's, are you good under pressure?

20:57.320 --> 20:58.320
I have anxiety.

20:58.560 --> 20:59.760
I have performance anxiety.

20:59.760 --> 21:00.800
Do you have anxiety?

21:01.000 --> 21:01.360
Yeah.

21:01.440 --> 21:02.480
You have anxiety period.

21:02.560 --> 21:03.040
Period.

21:03.160 --> 21:03.480
Yeah.

21:03.880 --> 21:07.240
I, I like, I don't like it when I, if I have to pee and then

21:07.240 --> 21:09.720
everyone's waiting and the urinals.

21:10.000 --> 21:10.360
Yeah.

21:10.640 --> 21:10.880
Yeah.

21:10.880 --> 21:11.280
I don't like it.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.080
You know what'll help you in that situation?

21:13.600 --> 21:14.160
Taking a shit.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.040
Cause whenever you take a shit, you always pee a little.

21:18.040 --> 21:21.000
It's hard to take a shit while you're standing at a urinal, but.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.760
Not in my world.

21:22.760 --> 21:23.120
Okay.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.200
Just got to keep yourself full of things that make you shit.

21:25.360 --> 21:25.840
Oh, good.

21:25.840 --> 21:26.760
Have you ever heard of banana?

21:27.960 --> 21:29.080
I did recently.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.080
Somebody told me about it.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.680
Not the showbiz term.

21:31.680 --> 21:32.640
I'm talking about the food.

21:33.120 --> 21:33.520
There you go.

21:38.080 --> 21:38.680
Which way is up?

21:38.760 --> 21:39.520
It's this way, right?

21:39.560 --> 21:41.240
It's like a D no to spin it.

21:41.280 --> 21:41.800
There you go.

21:42.600 --> 21:43.160
All right.

21:46.080 --> 21:46.920
So sexy.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.480
You're like a brand.

21:50.000 --> 21:50.440
Yeah.

21:50.520 --> 21:51.880
It's very important to brand yourself.

21:51.880 --> 21:52.600
These colors.

21:52.680 --> 21:53.920
Are you selling shoes?

21:55.040 --> 21:55.320
Yeah.

21:55.320 --> 21:58.360
I got some, uh, custom kicks coming out the dudes.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.080
He, uh, no, actually that would be a good idea.

22:01.840 --> 22:03.360
You can probably sell a pair or two of those.

22:03.880 --> 22:07.240
Speaking of anxiety, I really am only focused on this right now.

22:07.240 --> 22:07.560
Alexa.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.080
I apologize.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.320
Just shit your pants.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.440
It'll make you be easier and get on with it.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.320
Oh, this thing has been dog eared in my pocket for a while.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.200
I swear this never happens to me.

22:16.200 --> 22:16.920
I'm sorry, babe.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.480
People don't thumb at a sticker for an hour while they're doing the

22:20.160 --> 22:23.240
excuse you make when you're with somebody and you're underperforming.

22:23.440 --> 22:24.760
Well, here's the thing.

22:25.040 --> 22:28.520
As you ask me questions that I don't want to answer, I'll just go to this.

22:28.520 --> 22:29.280
I'll go to the sticker.

22:29.280 --> 22:33.280
So if this ends up working, then I won't have it as funny.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.440
How you started doing that when we were talking about depression.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.000
That's weird.

22:36.240 --> 22:36.760
That is weird.

22:37.280 --> 22:37.600
Hmm.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.920
Tell me, tell me how that makes you feel.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.120
Um, here we are.

22:43.600 --> 22:43.920
You got it.

22:44.400 --> 22:47.400
Uh, for the listener, he succeeded after 10 minutes.

22:47.440 --> 22:47.720
Yeah.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.320
You know, no, I do have.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.960
I do have some of that stuff.

22:51.000 --> 22:58.560
Bobby Lee, uh, has had encouraged me on, on wax, as I like to say, to go to

22:58.560 --> 23:02.680
talk about it on podcasts, talk about depression because it could help people.

23:03.080 --> 23:06.640
And I said, no, but, um, it's true.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.840
I do, I do have some, there's, uh, there's some history in the family.

23:11.240 --> 23:14.240
Well, I used to not believe in medication at all.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.480
I used to think that that was for someone else with, uh, who's been

23:17.480 --> 23:22.120
diagnosed with, uh, some of the, um, some of the rougher stuff.

23:22.720 --> 23:27.280
But as I got older, then some of the stuff happens and, uh, you know, you

23:27.280 --> 23:34.200
have to, and by stuff, I mean, uh, you know, mental stuff and, uh, and yeah.

23:34.200 --> 23:38.520
So I went and I just, I believe that the stigma needs to be removed completely.

23:39.320 --> 23:43.680
Uh, and so I've, I, you know, I do therapy, I do talk therapy.

23:44.400 --> 23:48.880
I'm on a little bit of stuff, which, which let me tell you, when I first started

23:48.880 --> 23:56.200
it, I was, um, you know, someone I'm close to was like my manager and she goes,

23:57.240 --> 23:59.760
this is too much, but she was like, Hey, you don't have to white

23:59.760 --> 24:01.360
knuckle it through life, right?

24:01.560 --> 24:06.520
Cause I was literally just like, everything became, you know, really hard

24:06.520 --> 24:11.240
to do at a level that I wanted to do it at, even just getting through your day.

24:11.240 --> 24:11.520
Right.

24:11.840 --> 24:18.560
Uh, and when I first, um, got some of the, the meds that I was, that I'm on,

24:18.920 --> 24:22.520
it felt like doors and windows were opening literally in my brain.

24:22.560 --> 24:27.720
I took a three hour nap the first day and you shouldn't even

24:27.720 --> 24:29.040
feel this stuff the first day.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.480
I think my brain was like, it was like a sponge.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.960
It wanted to, I needed some relief and I I'm not a nap guy.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.880
I can sleep three hours and I'll be fine.

24:37.360 --> 24:42.960
Um, but I, I took a long nap and then I, it started to, it started to help.

24:43.120 --> 24:43.240
Yeah.

24:43.240 --> 24:48.640
Isn't that weird how a little bit of chemistry in your head can just

24:48.640 --> 24:51.400
make the whole world appear so much more beautiful.

24:51.520 --> 24:52.040
Yeah.

24:52.120 --> 24:52.440
Yeah.

24:52.600 --> 24:52.960
Yeah.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.800
I mean, after, after all there, you know, there's a lot going on in your

24:56.800 --> 25:01.320
brain that can be changed by, you know, your lifestyle, but also so many

25:01.320 --> 25:06.280
physical things like a little bit of meds or in Bobby's case, uh, you know,

25:06.280 --> 25:08.680
thumbing around on some dumb farming app.

25:09.680 --> 25:13.840
Well, Bobby's gone through a few rough periods with like, uh, uh, you

25:13.840 --> 25:15.840
know, with drugs and alcohol and all that kind of stuff.

25:15.840 --> 25:18.680
So, and, uh, just everything else involved.

25:18.840 --> 25:21.000
I mean, that's the beautiful roller coaster of who he is.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.280
And a lot of great comedians seem to be that way.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.400
So I wonder what the connection there is.

25:25.680 --> 25:28.960
You think some level of crazy is required for comedy?

25:29.400 --> 25:35.480
Like at some point on a scale of one to 10, how much crazy do you have?

25:36.720 --> 25:43.480
Uh, in some ways, a 10, uh, and in other ways that I think, uh, in other

25:43.480 --> 25:48.400
ways, sort of functionally, I'm like a two or three, cause, uh, I don't know.

25:48.920 --> 25:54.080
I'm from Canada and I'm, I, you know, I try to just keep things very even keeled.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.320
My parents are Italian.

25:56.320 --> 25:59.360
They're from Italy and, uh, you know, they're very, I grew up during

25:59.360 --> 26:04.160
World War II and they're very, you know, uh, simple outlook on things.

26:04.480 --> 26:10.920
Complex, incredible, classy people who are very simple when

26:10.920 --> 26:12.880
it comes to a lot of stuff.

26:12.880 --> 26:18.040
And, uh, I, I think just being a sort of a, at heart, kind of a timid

26:18.040 --> 26:25.680
Canadian coming out here years ago as a kid, uh, it was all I could do to

26:25.680 --> 26:28.200
just keep everything super normal.

26:28.720 --> 26:33.160
And then I sort of was able to settle into that as a lifestyle.

26:33.680 --> 26:38.680
But you love the idea of being an actor, like who, uh, you mentioned John

26:38.680 --> 26:42.000
Candy and, uh, planes planes and automobiles.

26:42.000 --> 26:42.280
Yeah.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.680
It's one of my favorite movies.

26:43.680 --> 26:47.600
He says one of yours, what do you think that makes that movie work?

26:47.680 --> 26:52.800
What, what do you, what, um, and when you, when you talk about enjoying that

26:52.800 --> 26:56.920
movie, do you enjoy just the raw comedy or do you enjoy like the friendship and

26:57.400 --> 27:02.960
and the love that's there, even though on the surface, it doesn't make any

27:02.960 --> 27:04.760
sense that there should be a friendship there.

27:05.480 --> 27:09.400
I mean, that's such an important element to that film, but, uh, you

27:09.400 --> 27:13.580
know, as a kid, I just loved the comedy and then it's been a nostalgic

27:13.580 --> 27:18.400
favorite of mine, like it's my favorite movie, uh, but it's also, uh, it's

27:18.400 --> 27:22.760
just legit my favorite movie because as you get older and you start watching it,

27:22.760 --> 27:27.560
you realize it's what, it's what John Hughes is the filmmaker and what John

27:27.560 --> 27:32.400
Candy particularly, and, but also Steve Martin are doing in the film that

27:32.400 --> 27:38.560
makes it such a work of art, which is loneliness is there in every moment

27:38.640 --> 27:45.320
of that film and John Candy is, he embodies Del Griffith, his character

27:45.320 --> 27:50.360
in the film, he, he, Del Griffith is a lonely guy and John Candy, but, but

27:50.360 --> 27:53.900
Del Griffith is also a very friendly guy and a shower curtain ring salesman

27:53.900 --> 27:57.880
and knows everybody in the Midwest and runs around to motels and has

27:57.880 --> 28:01.900
meaningful conversations with the guy, even in Gus, you know, whoever he's

28:01.900 --> 28:08.180
talking to, um, uh, but there's loneliness there all the time and, uh,

28:08.500 --> 28:12.540
you know, this is a character that these, the film is filled with loneliness

28:12.540 --> 28:16.140
and it's not until, you know, the second last scene when he's at the train

28:16.140 --> 28:19.600
station, you know, Del, what are you doing here?

28:20.180 --> 28:21.460
You thought I thought you were going home.

28:21.460 --> 28:22.300
What are you doing here?

28:22.700 --> 28:26.620
Um, that's a very good Neil Neil page from the movie.

28:26.960 --> 28:27.300
Thank you.

28:27.540 --> 28:30.220
Uh, that's when you realize how lonely he is.

28:30.220 --> 28:30.980
Pause and post.

28:32.460 --> 28:33.900
That's when you realize how lonely he is.

28:33.900 --> 28:37.780
And I think that's the element from the film that, I mean, look, you know,

28:37.780 --> 28:42.180
nowadays, I feel like I've been saying this for a long time, but John Candy

28:42.180 --> 28:45.740
would have won an Academy award hands down for that film.

28:45.820 --> 28:47.860
It's just, they didn't do that with comedies back then.

28:48.460 --> 28:48.820
Yeah.

28:48.820 --> 28:51.100
Until the year after that movie came out with fish called Wanda.

28:51.460 --> 28:51.900
Yeah.

28:52.140 --> 28:55.100
And then it's, I mean, it's still comedies don't get respected enough.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.540
Robin Williams.

28:56.660 --> 28:59.180
He got, I guess he got an Oscar for good.

28:59.180 --> 29:00.500
Good, good will hunting.

29:00.660 --> 29:03.900
Um, Jim Carey, did he ever get an Oscar?

29:04.300 --> 29:04.660
I don't know.

29:04.700 --> 29:05.340
I don't believe so.

29:06.060 --> 29:06.300
Yeah.

29:06.300 --> 29:10.980
They don't get, you don't, but that's not even if he did, you wouldn't be for

29:10.980 --> 29:17.940
comedies, it's just, I mean, there's some things that are, um, playing strings in

29:17.940 --> 29:21.700
honor of me, but would you even put that as a, I guess it's a comedy, but there's

29:21.900 --> 29:27.020
there is a loneliness and depth that permeates the whole movie that ultimately,

29:27.060 --> 29:29.860
and it's a happy ending, which is hard to kind of.

29:30.340 --> 29:35.660
It's a happy ending only because in the last moment of the movie, John

29:35.660 --> 29:45.020
Candy puts on a brave face, even when he's got no one and he's there seeing

29:45.020 --> 29:49.940
Neil Page's entire family on Thanksgiving and he forces a smile, which is the

29:49.940 --> 29:52.100
last, literally the last frame of the movie.

29:52.460 --> 29:56.300
And I've said before, if you're not reduced to just a sob sobbing pile of

29:56.300 --> 29:59.740
meat, uh, at the end of the movie, then you are not human.

30:00.180 --> 30:04.180
Um, yeah, it's, it's, it, it is a happy ending.

30:04.380 --> 30:10.100
It's a happy ending, even though it's a, it's a sad, sad character loneliness

30:10.100 --> 30:10.660
in the world.

30:10.700 --> 30:11.900
I was just in Vegas.

30:12.540 --> 30:18.500
I went to a diner at like 4am, 5am and there's a waitress is empty as a

30:18.500 --> 30:19.820
waitress, those the sweetest.

30:20.260 --> 30:23.580
Kindest human being kept calling me sweetheart and all that kind of stuff.

30:24.140 --> 30:24.540
Hon.

30:25.740 --> 30:29.620
And then after I ate, she said, darling, just talk to me a little bit.

30:30.060 --> 30:31.820
You know, it's cause there's nobody, nobody there.

30:31.820 --> 30:35.060
And it was just the so much sadness in her eyes.

30:35.060 --> 30:35.540
I don't know.

30:35.580 --> 30:39.580
It was also so much love, like that sweetheart that it, I mean, it

30:39.580 --> 30:45.420
reminded me kind of, um, of it, of the John Candy performance because at first,

30:45.420 --> 30:52.340
because I was like, uh, reading a pretty dark, uh, uh, book about Hitler.

30:52.700 --> 30:57.020
Uh, so I, I was a little bit frustrated that she kept talking to me cause it was

30:57.020 --> 31:01.220
like, uh, it was, it was almost like, uh, the same way that John Kenny is, it's

31:01.220 --> 31:02.380
annoying a little bit, right?

31:02.700 --> 31:07.140
But then very quickly I opened up to like, well, there's a, there's a kind

31:07.140 --> 31:10.860
human being and there's like that human connection superseded everything else.

31:10.860 --> 31:12.140
And I don't know, it was just beautiful.

31:12.140 --> 31:18.140
And I think John Candy captures that really well, which is like the connection

31:18.140 --> 31:19.340
with other human beings.

31:19.620 --> 31:26.980
Sometimes we pull away from that because we have a busy life full of stuff to do.

31:27.500 --> 31:31.420
Uh, as, um, Steve Martin's character kind of characterized, he's like a

31:31.420 --> 31:32.940
marketing exec or something like that.

31:33.420 --> 31:37.940
But if you just pause and notice others, you can, you can really

31:37.940 --> 31:39.340
discover beautiful people.

31:39.860 --> 31:40.900
Totally, totally.

31:40.900 --> 31:46.820
Everyone's got, well, I mean, everyone's got their story and, you know, Candy

31:46.820 --> 31:53.620
as a person, I've never met the man, uh, but, um, he's the kind of guy that, you

31:53.620 --> 31:57.260
know, he could, he could just walk up to back in the day, I would imagine he could

31:57.260 --> 32:01.540
walk up to just about any house, at least in Canada, knock on the door and you'd

32:01.540 --> 32:03.460
invite him in for dinner, you know what I mean?

32:04.100 --> 32:09.980
So yeah, it's a, it's a, that, you know, as you're talking about, you know,

32:10.420 --> 32:13.260
putting a book down and talking to someone for a while, even though you'd

32:13.260 --> 32:17.420
really like to read your book, it's, it's like, it's that sort of thing that

32:17.980 --> 32:22.300
Candy's character in the movie sort of does that like Johnny Appleseed just,

32:22.300 --> 32:26.940
can you realize he's just going around making people smile, you know, and, and

32:26.940 --> 32:28.700
Neil Page is hanging with this guy.

32:29.140 --> 32:30.300
So frustrated.

32:30.300 --> 32:35.020
He's just the, he's so exhausting and his big underwear in the sink at the hotel

32:35.220 --> 32:38.740
and everything, and by the end of it, he loves this guy, you know?

32:39.380 --> 32:43.700
So, uh, it's a good and a bad thing that you, uh, have, didn't take that waitress

32:43.700 --> 32:46.820
with you on a trip, maybe road trip up to Reno.

32:47.180 --> 32:50.420
Oh, oh, she's, she's actually, she's out shopping right now.

32:50.420 --> 32:54.300
Where we've been having sex multiple times a day ever since.

32:54.460 --> 32:55.060
Oh, that's nice.

32:55.060 --> 32:55.580
That's lovely.

32:55.580 --> 33:00.740
How do you think I'm sure she's married and happily and has many grandchildren.

33:00.780 --> 33:01.140
Okay.

33:01.820 --> 33:05.700
Uh, and, and plus that movie's on Thanksgiving, I think.

33:05.700 --> 33:05.980
Right.

33:05.980 --> 33:06.500
Yeah, that's right.

33:06.500 --> 33:07.020
Thanksgiving.

33:07.060 --> 33:12.900
So like Thanksgiving just embodies that forget about the, the busyness and the,

33:12.900 --> 33:17.540
whatever the career you're chasing in life and just take a pause and appreciate

33:17.540 --> 33:19.100
the people you love me with your family.

33:19.100 --> 33:19.460
Yeah.

33:19.700 --> 33:22.100
Or Pete, the people, whatever your family with friends.

33:22.140 --> 33:22.540
Yeah.

33:22.980 --> 33:26.380
Uh, you have some weird friends, unorthodox friends.

33:26.820 --> 33:32.300
So, so at least in the public sphere, uh, from Bobby Lee, Brian Callahan,

33:32.300 --> 33:34.340
all those kinds of folks from the mad TV days.

33:34.340 --> 33:35.260
I'm sure there's others.

33:36.220 --> 33:37.420
What does it mean to be a good friend?

33:38.220 --> 33:41.700
Here in LA or just in general, in the world, in the world.

33:42.100 --> 33:43.900
Will Sasse, world friend.

33:44.300 --> 33:45.500
I think it is different here.

33:45.820 --> 33:46.340
I think it is.

33:46.340 --> 33:50.220
I think there's a little bit of a career kind of, uh, negotiation shuffling

33:50.220 --> 33:51.220
around that kind of stuff.

33:51.500 --> 33:52.260
Why is it different?

33:52.860 --> 33:58.460
Well, I just mean, I mean, I mean that it's just kind of hard here to,

33:59.220 --> 34:01.500
to make time for everybody.

34:01.500 --> 34:04.820
There's so there's, it's always been a city to me that is like, we'll

34:04.820 --> 34:09.260
keep you so busy and every time I go home to Vancouver, after a few days,

34:09.260 --> 34:10.860
I start to get a little stir crazy.

34:11.180 --> 34:16.500
And I think that being here in, in LA, I go to sleep with a hundred things

34:16.500 --> 34:19.980
that I still have to do and you never, you're never out of stuff to do.

34:20.460 --> 34:25.540
And if you, um, you know, when you ask about, are you nuts or whatever, if

34:25.540 --> 34:30.180
you're crazy, I mean, look, every, all the weirdest people from every high

34:30.180 --> 34:32.900
school in the United States is like, Oh, I'm going to make it in LA.

34:32.900 --> 34:38.140
You know, everyone just comes here and, uh, just another freak in the freak

34:38.140 --> 34:41.620
kingdom, as they say at the end of, uh, fear and loathing in Las Vegas, that

34:41.620 --> 34:43.460
was a very good Robin Williams impersonation.

34:43.500 --> 34:46.820
That was my Robin Williams as Johnny Depp, as Hunter S.

34:46.820 --> 34:47.220
Thompson.

34:47.220 --> 34:47.460
Yeah.

34:47.780 --> 34:48.380
It's not your fault.

34:48.380 --> 34:49.980
We'll pretty good.

34:50.100 --> 34:50.460
Thank you.

34:50.620 --> 34:52.300
Could have been you fear and loathing.

34:52.940 --> 34:54.340
If you're loathing, it'd be interesting.

34:54.660 --> 34:57.780
I would have liked to play his attorney, the, the role that, um,

34:58.100 --> 35:00.180
oh yeah, Benicia del Toro gained weight for.

35:00.500 --> 35:01.220
That would have been cool.

35:01.540 --> 35:05.900
He's just saying, he's just like chewing his face off.

35:05.900 --> 35:06.580
I could have done that.

35:07.300 --> 35:12.220
Um, uh, yeah, no, I think that it's backdoor beauty.

35:12.300 --> 35:13.700
That guy's full of good lines.

35:14.500 --> 35:14.740
Yeah.

35:14.740 --> 35:16.700
I flip you, flip you for real.

35:17.260 --> 35:18.740
Um, good actor.

35:19.100 --> 35:19.380
Yeah.

35:19.460 --> 35:20.500
Fantastic actor.

35:20.580 --> 35:23.900
I think, I think what it takes to be a good friend is just, you know,

35:23.900 --> 35:26.140
presence, just be in there.

35:26.420 --> 35:28.300
I mean, that's all anyone needs to be heard.

35:28.420 --> 35:28.660
Right.

35:29.220 --> 35:32.260
Um, in LA it is, it is interesting.

35:32.260 --> 35:36.700
It is, you, you, I haven't seen people that I love in years.

35:36.980 --> 35:38.180
Some people just busy.

35:38.580 --> 35:38.780
Yeah.

35:38.940 --> 35:40.660
Can you still have a depth of connection?

35:40.900 --> 35:45.900
Even though like one of the reasons I really enjoyed doing a podcast, you get

35:45.900 --> 35:50.780
to sit down with, with actual friends of yours and spend prolonged periods of

35:50.780 --> 35:52.580
time together that you don't otherwise.

35:52.860 --> 35:53.460
That's a good point.

35:53.460 --> 35:56.300
You know, I, I've spoken on this podcast to people really close to me.

35:56.780 --> 36:00.220
And it's like, you've never had a conversation without microphones

36:00.260 --> 36:01.460
like you do with microphones.

36:01.460 --> 36:06.180
It's weird, but, uh, there's some aspect about, uh, LA that, you know, a lot of

36:06.180 --> 36:09.900
the, especially friends of yours, comedians and so on, they'll do podcasts

36:09.900 --> 36:13.140
and stuff and there's a, I don't know, there's an intimacy to that.

36:13.220 --> 36:13.580
Yeah.

36:13.820 --> 36:14.140
Yeah.

36:14.180 --> 36:16.140
There is, and there isn't the ones that I do.

36:16.180 --> 36:20.900
I mean, I just did, uh, Bobby Lee and Andrew Santino's funny enough called

36:21.180 --> 36:22.620
bad friends, bad friends.

36:23.220 --> 36:27.700
And afterwards, and my good pal, Chad Culchin with whom I do

36:27.700 --> 36:29.780
dudesy, uh, was with me.

36:29.900 --> 36:31.140
Sneakers are coming soon.

36:31.380 --> 36:32.580
Sneakers are coming soon.

36:32.580 --> 36:36.580
You get your will foot and your Chad foot comes in a size 15 and a nine and a half.

36:37.220 --> 36:41.460
Um, and, uh, I remember afterwards we were talking, it was just basically

36:41.980 --> 36:46.300
me, Chad and Santino were talking and Bobby was over there, you know, on his

36:46.300 --> 36:51.460
phone and then I was like, we, I mean, we didn't spend any time talking about

36:51.460 --> 36:52.180
anything.

36:52.980 --> 36:57.100
It feels like one of those hours that goes by and you realize, I'd just been

36:57.100 --> 37:00.460
goofing around with these guys, which is what life is about a little bit.

37:00.460 --> 37:00.940
It's great.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.820
And then I'm like, all right, Bobby, Hey, Bob, I'll see you later.

37:03.900 --> 37:06.940
And he's like, like this, I'm like, all right, man.

37:07.140 --> 37:08.060
Hey, love you, bro.

37:08.100 --> 37:08.580
See you later.

37:08.700 --> 37:09.180
Yeah.

37:09.220 --> 37:09.660
Yeah.

37:09.860 --> 37:10.340
Yeah.

37:10.380 --> 37:10.940
He's a guy.

37:10.940 --> 37:16.100
Do you ever just, I just send text messages over there to him that never

37:16.100 --> 37:20.580
come back and then he thinks that I'm angry with him because it's been, you

37:20.580 --> 37:24.740
know, it'll go two, three years without him getting back to me and then just

37:24.740 --> 37:26.300
out of nowhere, Hey, fuck face.

37:26.740 --> 37:28.860
And, uh, who says, Hey, fuck face.

37:28.900 --> 37:30.820
He does, or you do, or you both talk to each other.

37:30.860 --> 37:33.420
No, I gotta be very, I gotta be very careful, Bobby.

37:33.460 --> 37:33.700
Yeah.

37:33.700 --> 37:34.820
I gotta be very sweet.

37:35.220 --> 37:36.740
Dear friend, dear friend.

37:36.740 --> 37:36.980
Hello.

37:36.980 --> 37:37.860
How are you doing?

37:37.900 --> 37:38.420
How are you?

37:38.420 --> 37:41.940
I know I checked in with you, but, uh, not, but three months ago.

37:42.580 --> 37:45.020
Uh, and then every once in a while he'll go, Hey, fuck face.

37:45.100 --> 37:49.700
I tend to hide from the world and I, I'm, I can be pretty shady with friends

37:50.100 --> 37:50.380
back.

37:50.420 --> 37:50.660
Yeah.

37:51.020 --> 37:54.740
I can empathize with Bobby might, it might be a Skyrim thing.

37:56.020 --> 38:00.940
It might be like hiding in a world in a digital world with fake, fake NPCs.

38:01.340 --> 38:01.820
Yeah.

38:01.940 --> 38:02.260
Yeah.

38:02.300 --> 38:03.100
There's that.

38:03.180 --> 38:03.500
Yeah.

38:03.540 --> 38:05.420
Uh, yeah.

38:05.420 --> 38:09.940
You know, I have a buddy who said something really smart, uh, a while ago,

38:09.940 --> 38:14.380
we ended up working together on this, uh, TV show thing and I reached out to him

38:14.380 --> 38:16.260
to see if he wanted to do it with us.

38:16.340 --> 38:17.740
And, uh, he did.

38:17.900 --> 38:20.060
And he goes, this is a great guy.

38:20.100 --> 38:21.540
Such a funny writer.

38:21.780 --> 38:24.940
He goes, I may not be in touch all the time, but I know who my friends are.

38:25.300 --> 38:25.900
You know what I mean?

38:26.140 --> 38:30.580
And it's like in our business, and this is a fellow who moved, um, who's

38:30.580 --> 38:33.740
from Ontario, Canada, moved back there.

38:33.940 --> 38:36.700
He's on the farm with his wife and kids and he does not care.

38:36.980 --> 38:41.420
He's never been a Hollywood guy and, uh, it's tough to get ahold of him.

38:41.500 --> 38:44.940
But when you do, you know, he's still the same sweet old guy.

38:44.940 --> 38:45.860
He's doing his thing though.

38:46.300 --> 38:46.660
Yeah.

38:46.660 --> 38:49.820
Some of my closest friends, even if we don't talk for a few months,

38:50.180 --> 38:51.660
we're right back at it if we do.

38:51.660 --> 38:55.420
And then if shit goes, like if something really traumatic happens or difficult

38:55.420 --> 38:58.700
stuff or, you know, any of that kind of stuff, I'm, I'm always there.

38:58.700 --> 39:03.940
So like, so for important stuff, important highs and important lows, you're there.

39:03.980 --> 39:04.380
Yeah.

39:04.420 --> 39:07.660
And then you pick right back up, especially if you've have those years

39:07.660 --> 39:09.540
of experiences together, it's interesting.

39:09.780 --> 39:10.260
Totally.

39:10.620 --> 39:13.860
Uh, so you've done a couple of podcasts done.

39:13.900 --> 39:18.700
So we've got to talk about dudes a little bit, but first you did for several

39:18.700 --> 39:20.380
years, you did the 10 minute podcast.

39:22.860 --> 39:25.260
I mean, everything is hilarious about that podcast, including the

39:25.260 --> 39:27.180
fact that it's 10 minutes, right?

39:27.220 --> 39:29.060
I mean, it's every, every, it's ridiculous.

39:29.060 --> 39:29.900
It's absurd.

39:30.500 --> 39:31.860
The dynamic is hilarious.

39:31.860 --> 39:34.580
It's you, Brian Callen, Chris Delia there.

39:34.620 --> 39:38.740
I don't know exactly why it's why it works so well, but it did.

39:38.780 --> 39:39.580
It worked really well.

39:39.580 --> 39:43.260
I think it's because the, yeah, you were having fun probably.

39:43.260 --> 39:48.380
I mean, that's, that would really came through the, that it was friends

39:48.380 --> 39:52.100
just talking shit and the tension, the beautiful tension and the absurdity.

39:52.100 --> 39:52.780
They came out.

39:53.060 --> 39:53.420
Yeah.

39:53.580 --> 39:57.580
Uh, what, what was the story of making that podcast?

39:57.580 --> 39:59.020
What, how did that came to be?

39:59.500 --> 40:01.340
Uh, why do you think it was as good as it was?

40:01.900 --> 40:02.260
I don't know.

40:02.260 --> 40:09.700
I feel like that podcast was like, it was our, our, who we kind of are, but

40:09.740 --> 40:15.060
on steroids or something, like, you know, uh, each person, you know, Brian's

40:15.060 --> 40:20.500
going to be like extra manly and, and, uh, can you get any more manly than

40:20.500 --> 40:21.220
he already is?

40:21.220 --> 40:23.700
No, he reaches though.

40:24.100 --> 40:29.660
Uh, and yeah, we just kind of, it's, I feel like as goofballs, we knew each

40:29.660 --> 40:33.180
other's line, like here's the line you don't cross.

40:33.180 --> 40:36.660
I feel like those guys don't really have one, uh, but at least they knew mine.

40:37.100 --> 40:42.860
Um, and, and yeah, we were able to just goof around and I did it with them

40:42.860 --> 40:49.380
for three years and then Chad, who I'm doing dudesy with and my pal, Tommy

40:49.380 --> 40:54.300
Blacha, who's a, another writer producer like Chad, they came on and yeah, all,

40:54.380 --> 40:59.780
all told we did, I did like, uh, seven years with that thing, six, five, six,

40:59.780 --> 41:00.620
seven, I don't remember.

41:01.580 --> 41:06.420
Do you think it ever comes back in some small form as, as a 20 minute podcast

41:06.420 --> 41:07.340
or something like that?

41:08.380 --> 41:11.660
I mean, is there, uh, because it's one of the most requested, but I mean,

41:11.660 --> 41:13.700
there's, you, you have a huge fan base.

41:14.020 --> 41:14.980
I'm 47 years old.

41:15.420 --> 41:21.780
So I am of the generation that had a cell phone, has had a cell phone half

41:21.780 --> 41:26.740
the time and didn't for the formative years of my life into my early twenties.

41:27.220 --> 41:30.940
Um, and then finally got a, like, I got a cell phone, I guess I was like 19 or

41:30.940 --> 41:33.220
something, just like literally just cause I'm moving to LA.

41:33.260 --> 41:34.540
You got porn in the mail.

41:34.860 --> 41:35.940
You got, yes, that's right.

41:35.940 --> 41:38.220
It was that the hard, the hard cover porn.

41:38.220 --> 41:39.180
That's the way we liked it.

41:39.940 --> 41:45.020
Bound, you know, nice binding on the, on the porn, the leather, uh,

41:45.060 --> 41:46.060
next to the Bible cover.

41:46.180 --> 41:46.660
Yep.

41:46.980 --> 41:50.700
Um, these are all my, these are my encyclopedia Britannica.

41:50.700 --> 41:51.020
Wow.

41:51.020 --> 41:51.820
Very impressive.

41:52.020 --> 41:52.300
Yes.

41:52.300 --> 41:55.740
A man came to the house and sold me these and then down the street, uh,

41:56.140 --> 41:59.100
and then down here, these are my, this is my pornography.

41:59.740 --> 42:04.620
Uh, if you'll follow me through here to the par parlor, uh, sir, and

42:04.620 --> 42:07.380
pass through the generations from grandfather to father.

42:07.500 --> 42:07.900
Yeah.

42:08.180 --> 42:10.100
I want to give you something very special to me.

42:10.100 --> 42:10.740
Never can answer.

42:10.980 --> 42:15.700
Um, but, uh, uh, you go up in the generation without a cell phone.

42:15.700 --> 42:16.060
Yes.

42:16.100 --> 42:21.780
I, um, it's hard for me to connect with people who, who hit me up.

42:21.940 --> 42:23.300
I look at everything as polling.

42:23.580 --> 42:27.020
So if one person hits me up and shares this opinion, but two other

42:27.020 --> 42:31.740
people hit me up and share that I'm the worst, I'm don't follow my polls.

42:31.740 --> 42:35.020
My, when people say, Oh, that poll means absolutely nothing.

42:35.580 --> 42:36.940
So-and-so is going to win anyway.

42:37.460 --> 42:38.740
That that's my poll.

42:38.780 --> 42:43.260
My poll means nothing, but I do look at the stuff and go, uh, this many

42:43.260 --> 42:46.580
people are saying this, that means that that number is saying that.

42:47.220 --> 42:52.540
And yet it's very hard for me to, uh, hear what the hell people are saying

42:52.540 --> 42:53.060
online.

42:53.580 --> 42:56.260
I really, I can't connect to it sometimes personally.

42:56.660 --> 43:01.300
So when you say that that's a popular podcast, like, I know that, I know

43:01.300 --> 43:04.100
that it's popular with the people that have expressed that they love it.

43:04.420 --> 43:04.660
Yeah.

43:04.660 --> 43:05.260
You know what I mean?

43:05.260 --> 43:06.500
What does that actually represent?

43:07.020 --> 43:07.580
I don't know.

43:07.620 --> 43:09.660
I don't know what kind of people are the audience.

43:09.700 --> 43:10.220
I don't know.

43:10.300 --> 43:13.060
I know that the, the people that listened to the 10 minute podcast, and

43:13.060 --> 43:19.060
if you did, thank you, uh, and we're friends, uh, I know that it was a, it

43:19.060 --> 43:21.900
was a special thing cause it was like, yeah, just doing this out of my house.

43:21.900 --> 43:25.500
And we just built it up out of nowhere and we're just kind of clowning around.

43:26.100 --> 43:27.380
It's a, it's an odd thing.

43:27.540 --> 43:32.260
I hope I, I personally, I think I S I speak for the two people that have

43:32.260 --> 43:35.300
reached out to you that said you should do it or whatever, three people, the

43:35.300 --> 43:39.100
poll that you should bring it back at some point, that would be beautiful.

43:39.140 --> 43:44.220
Just maybe, uh, it's like, uh, what's it, what's the good story of some, of like

43:44.220 --> 43:47.820
a famous band that came back and was successful, probably Nirvana.

43:48.020 --> 43:49.740
No, it was not.

43:50.660 --> 43:51.380
It wasn't Nirvana.

43:51.420 --> 43:51.860
Sorry.

43:51.860 --> 43:53.940
I get Nirvana mixed up with Aerosmith.

43:54.180 --> 43:54.500
Yeah.

43:54.540 --> 43:55.140
It was Aerosmith.

43:55.140 --> 43:55.860
It was Aerosmith.

43:55.860 --> 43:56.020
Yeah.

43:56.020 --> 43:57.940
It's not, they had that second ride.

43:57.980 --> 43:58.380
Different.

43:58.580 --> 43:58.820
Yeah.

43:59.020 --> 44:01.140
Totally different ending to those two bands.

44:01.700 --> 44:03.780
One ended up on, uh, American Idol.

44:04.740 --> 44:05.180
Yeah.

44:05.380 --> 44:08.220
Um, a lot of interesting women involved in that one too.

44:08.860 --> 44:09.340
All right.

44:09.820 --> 44:13.940
Uh, how did dudes, you come to be dudes and what the hell is dudes?

44:14.500 --> 44:16.260
Dudes is the first podcast.

44:16.260 --> 44:19.220
And this is exciting that you've asked me to come here today.

44:19.700 --> 44:22.860
Uh, because to hear what you would have to say about it or what you would ask

44:22.860 --> 44:26.940
about it, it is the first podcast that has been, that has run completely by,

44:26.940 --> 44:30.980
and essentially I like to say curated by an AI.

44:31.540 --> 44:35.860
Um, we were approached by a company that had this proprietary AI that wants to

44:35.860 --> 44:40.740
develop the podcast into the future and figure out exactly what it takes to

44:40.740 --> 44:42.260
make the best podcast ever.

44:42.820 --> 44:49.820
And it was all we, all we, we knew from the top and what they really wanted was

44:49.820 --> 44:55.300
two people who are actually friends and could be meaningful in the podcast space

44:55.620 --> 44:57.580
based on whatever information they had.

44:57.580 --> 45:01.260
The company CIA and are they testing technology to control the

45:01.260 --> 45:02.660
populace through chatbots?

45:03.140 --> 45:03.620
I'm sorry.

45:03.620 --> 45:05.620
I'm not at liberty to share that information.

45:05.620 --> 45:06.140
You are.

45:06.180 --> 45:06.460
Yeah.

45:06.460 --> 45:07.580
Who gave you the suit?

45:07.940 --> 45:09.060
Where did you get the suit?

45:09.740 --> 45:10.780
Where did you get the suit, Will?

45:10.940 --> 45:11.260
Yeah.

45:11.340 --> 45:14.780
Well, the CIA stands for something different in here.

45:14.820 --> 45:17.900
I mean, you know, it doesn't mean like, you know, central intelligence agency.

45:17.900 --> 45:23.900
I'm probably it's a different, it's a Canadian, uh, international apparel.

45:24.420 --> 45:24.540
Yeah.

45:24.540 --> 45:26.940
The Canadian international apparel company hit us up.

45:27.220 --> 45:31.100
Chad and I, um, well, Chad's a super weirdo.

45:31.420 --> 45:32.580
You would get a kick out of him.

45:32.580 --> 45:35.980
I know you guys, you, you, you, you strike me as a very similar in some ways.

45:36.340 --> 45:40.420
And I'll take that as a compliment, but it is, and it is, uh, and it is,

45:40.900 --> 45:43.980
if I was friends with you for as long as I've been with Chad, perhaps I'd have

45:43.980 --> 45:48.340
some horrible shit to say about you, but, uh, the good parts, you remind me of him.

45:48.700 --> 45:53.300
And we were approached by this company that said, we have this AI and we would

45:53.300 --> 45:55.300
like to set it loose on you.

45:55.700 --> 46:02.220
And essentially we had to hand over some, some information that would allow the AI

46:02.220 --> 46:07.780
to, to access our email and, uh, look at our search histories, purchase histories,

46:07.780 --> 46:13.780
things like this, and, um, really dig into porn hub included or, yeah, I had

46:13.780 --> 46:20.300
to hand over all my leather bound, uh, 1970s pornography, um, and, uh, essentially

46:20.300 --> 46:25.940
it curates a podcast for us every week doing dumb things like, you know, it says,

46:25.940 --> 46:29.500
Hey, well, you know, you do a Hulk, you do some shitty Hulk Hogan impersonation

46:29.820 --> 46:31.860
podcasts about news are very popular.

46:32.020 --> 46:33.380
This is infomania.

46:33.620 --> 46:34.220
You know what I mean?

46:34.740 --> 46:37.140
Oh, let me tell you something about that Marjorie Taylor green dude.

46:37.220 --> 46:39.020
And then he's going on doing some new stuff.

46:39.500 --> 46:43.340
Um, and it basically just spits out all these things that it wants us to do.

46:43.340 --> 46:46.780
Normally four segments, an episode, and that's pretty much it.

46:46.820 --> 46:48.180
It generates what to do.

46:48.380 --> 46:49.580
It generates the premise.

46:49.820 --> 46:54.540
I mean, you spoken a bit here and there, like I said, I'm a huge fan.

46:54.540 --> 46:57.740
I don't even remember where, but like you, you, you, you talked about that.

46:58.020 --> 47:04.660
You enjoy dudes it because you feel almost like liberated to, um, because

47:04.700 --> 47:08.140
you're operating within the constraints of the premise that generates.

47:08.460 --> 47:14.140
So you're almost not, you're, you're, you're free to riff essentially.

47:14.260 --> 47:14.620
Yeah.

47:14.660 --> 47:18.900
Like you don't have to, you don't need to do the job of like coming up with the

47:18.900 --> 47:22.860
weird, you can just, the weird is given to you and then you just run with it.

47:23.180 --> 47:25.700
That's a good way to say it because we're already weird.

47:25.700 --> 47:29.540
Chad and I, Chad, Chad can talk for days about all sorts of stuff.

47:29.540 --> 47:32.900
He's particularly interested in AI lately and its effect on art.

47:32.900 --> 47:35.820
He is a writer, books, movies, and TV shows.

47:36.220 --> 47:40.660
And, um, I'm primarily, you know, acting and trying to come up with stuff.

47:40.820 --> 47:42.260
Stuff I write with Chad's pretty good.

47:42.500 --> 47:45.780
The rest of it hasn't seen much success anyway, uh, nor is the

47:45.780 --> 47:47.020
stuff with Chad for that matter.

47:47.300 --> 47:49.420
But, um, that's cause of me.

47:49.620 --> 47:50.260
Sneakers.

47:50.260 --> 47:51.020
Do you never know?

47:51.420 --> 47:54.100
Oh, I can't wait for these sneakers only in two sizes.

47:54.140 --> 47:54.420
Yeah.

47:54.420 --> 47:55.220
Only in two sides.

47:55.220 --> 47:57.660
You're going to be able to take the, the, you know, the tongue.

47:57.820 --> 48:01.700
You can't take it out because it's actually stitched in pretty cool stuff.

48:01.980 --> 48:07.940
Um, Velcro or, uh, Velcro Velcro up the side.

48:07.940 --> 48:10.940
We're doing some like brand new Kanye stuff.

48:10.940 --> 48:11.220
Yeah.

48:11.220 --> 48:15.580
We want things to look like this is what you'll be wearing on Mars when you get there.

48:15.740 --> 48:16.300
So cutting it.

48:16.300 --> 48:20.300
So Nike's doing a bunch of research for running how to make a super light shoe

48:20.300 --> 48:23.100
that you can be efficient in and break all kinds of running records.

48:23.100 --> 48:24.300
So you're doing the same kind of stuff.

48:24.460 --> 48:26.540
We're doing the same kind of thing for the podcasting space.

48:26.540 --> 48:29.380
The best kind of shoes to sit around and talk to your pal in.

48:29.820 --> 48:33.020
Um, but yeah, we, so this, yeah, it's bizarre.

48:33.020 --> 48:34.660
And it also does some writing dudes.

48:34.660 --> 48:40.260
He does come up with things, but not unlike what we're seeing in AI art now.

48:40.620 --> 48:41.580
It's a little bit foggy.

48:41.580 --> 48:44.460
It's a little bit weird and it, but it is improving.

48:44.460 --> 48:49.140
It is learning about us and writing stuff when it makes me spit this and

48:49.140 --> 48:53.580
that, which will read, you know, well, you know, I've prepared these things for you

48:53.580 --> 48:58.460
to read, it's impossible not to get a kick out of it because Chad and I are,

48:58.580 --> 49:01.100
first of all, we're blown away that we're doing this.

49:01.620 --> 49:04.500
And second of all, the, some of the stuff is actually very funny.

49:04.500 --> 49:05.900
It makes weird names.

49:06.340 --> 49:11.940
Like, I don't think it understands, it messes up some words and stuff, but

49:11.940 --> 49:13.140
that makes it even funnier.

49:13.140 --> 49:18.740
And then it, it sort of, from the beginning started laying on, like it says

49:18.740 --> 49:21.100
astonishing all the time, everything is astonishing.

49:21.620 --> 49:23.660
Um, that's dudes, his favorite word.

49:24.140 --> 49:30.100
Um, but yeah, it's basically just a way to, to frame the podcast.

49:30.100 --> 49:30.740
You know what I mean?

49:30.860 --> 49:36.340
Because my thing is, uh, I don't want to do this or actually have to talk to someone.

49:36.660 --> 49:41.740
You seem to feel a burden of the long form conversation.

49:42.140 --> 49:44.740
It seems like, is that really hard work for you?

49:45.020 --> 49:45.780
No, not at all.

49:45.780 --> 49:47.380
It's just that I don't like to bore people.

49:47.380 --> 49:53.020
And I feel like if I go on and I like to provide value for who, for what I am.

49:53.740 --> 50:00.460
You know, your value with regard to this project is, is obviously warranted.

50:00.460 --> 50:03.620
It's obviously I'm waiting for the explanation for what the value is.

50:03.620 --> 50:04.140
Exactly.

50:04.460 --> 50:05.540
Two dudes in a suit.

50:05.580 --> 50:06.540
No, listen.

50:06.580 --> 50:06.740
Yeah.

50:06.740 --> 50:07.460
Two dudes in a suit.

50:07.820 --> 50:11.180
No, but I mean, you've got your audience and that's the end of that.

50:11.220 --> 50:13.420
People find value in it for me.

50:13.860 --> 50:20.940
I, I do feel like I'm, uh, it is important that I, if I'm going to do

50:20.940 --> 50:27.500
something that, you know, is going to be funny or that I hope is funny, I just

50:27.500 --> 50:32.500
kind of want to get in and out of someone's day and just kind of, I like

50:32.500 --> 50:34.260
making, I like making laughing.

50:34.260 --> 50:36.260
I want people to, you know, whatever.

50:36.260 --> 50:38.060
It's the same thing that anyone else will tell you.

50:38.140 --> 50:38.300
Yeah.

50:38.300 --> 50:40.340
But in the long form, you feel the anxiety.

50:40.380 --> 50:44.060
You did a few funny things and I wonder if I can keep doing the funny thing.

50:44.380 --> 50:48.780
Is that why you're, you feel that like, why is doozy relieving

50:48.780 --> 50:49.980
you of some of the anxiety?

50:51.940 --> 50:55.460
Well, in some ways it gives me anxiety because I don't know what's coming.

50:56.220 --> 51:02.100
And that's weird for me because I like to prepare, uh, for things, but it's,

51:02.820 --> 51:04.980
that's not what podcasting is podcasting.

51:04.980 --> 51:08.900
You need to just be malleable and say whatever and do whatever.

51:09.260 --> 51:15.100
Um, and, uh, that's what makes it a real, I mean, it's look, it's a medium for

51:15.100 --> 51:19.700
conversation and if you're driving along, listening to this or anything else,

51:19.740 --> 51:23.900
you're, you know, it is that it's the, it's the true meaning of the

51:23.900 --> 51:27.340
parasocial relationship because the best podcasts just make you feel like

51:27.340 --> 51:28.900
you're sitting around rapping.

51:29.020 --> 51:30.260
We're just having a conversation.

51:30.540 --> 51:33.780
You could even be sitting there agreeing or talking out loud to yourself.

51:33.780 --> 51:36.420
If you want to be sitting in silence or you could just be sitting in

51:36.420 --> 51:40.540
silence in your fancy, uh, podcasting shoes, podcasting audience shoes.

51:40.900 --> 51:41.860
There's a very different build.

51:43.780 --> 51:45.660
Would they be also called doozy the shoes?

51:45.940 --> 51:47.260
Yeah, there'll be the doozy shoes.

51:47.820 --> 51:48.540
Doozy shoes.

51:48.580 --> 51:49.380
That's very creative.

51:49.540 --> 51:49.860
Yeah.

51:50.740 --> 51:54.140
Well, one thing the AI isn't good at yet is branding.

51:54.180 --> 51:55.220
Everything is just doozy.

51:55.220 --> 51:55.700
This and that.

51:55.780 --> 51:57.500
I would argue that's pretty good branding.

51:57.660 --> 51:58.060
I don't know.

51:58.060 --> 52:04.980
Well, doozy allows me to just, it forces me to sit down with Chad and goof

52:04.980 --> 52:07.700
around for an hour or an hour plus.

52:07.780 --> 52:13.420
And, and, uh, it provides the parameters that I, a lot of times ignore because

52:13.420 --> 52:17.860
I'm, I think that podcasting is just two dudes shitting around or three or four.

52:18.340 --> 52:25.020
But, um, it, it, it, it sits me down and gives me a premise to, to work with.

52:25.020 --> 52:26.100
And then you just riff with it.

52:26.300 --> 52:27.380
Yeah, it's fun.

52:27.900 --> 52:28.540
It's been a hoot.

52:29.180 --> 52:33.420
So from the acting perspective, um, you know, a lot of people like Daniel

52:33.420 --> 52:37.780
Day-Lewis will, will see acting just like, as you described, which is you

52:37.780 --> 52:40.780
have your roles, you embrace those roles and then you disappear.

52:40.820 --> 52:44.980
You don't, um, you don't, you don't do podcasts, you don't do any of that

52:44.980 --> 52:46.940
kind of stuff, your art is your art.

52:47.580 --> 52:50.820
So is that, is that part of you feels that way?

52:51.500 --> 52:52.180
I think so.

52:53.180 --> 52:54.260
Is that the actor side of you?

52:54.340 --> 52:54.660
Yeah.

52:55.300 --> 53:00.180
Anytime I get to do something that I don't get a chance to do much of, or

53:00.180 --> 53:04.220
something that people haven't seen me do much of, or that I've done on some

53:04.220 --> 53:07.980
scale that isn't, hasn't been very wide and not a lot of people have seen it.

53:07.980 --> 53:09.940
That's the stuff that I get really excited about.

53:10.540 --> 53:17.380
Um, I don't know why I'm, I don't know why, I don't know why necessarily.

53:17.380 --> 53:19.060
I haven't answered that question yet in my life.

53:19.060 --> 53:23.300
Like what it is about being an actor that I love so much, because it's

53:23.300 --> 53:27.300
not like I don't like to, it's not like I'm trying to get away from myself and

53:27.300 --> 53:32.820
play other characters and stuff and not be myself, um, but it is, it has always

53:32.820 --> 53:37.540
been fun to, to just be other people and escape.

53:37.700 --> 53:37.940
Yeah.

53:37.940 --> 53:42.580
Is there some aspect to the impressions where you become that person?

53:42.900 --> 53:48.180
Is that like, what, what, what's that like to, um, I suppose acting is a full

53:48.180 --> 53:53.620
on version of that you've really at its best become the character.

53:54.100 --> 53:55.660
Is there some fun in that?

53:55.780 --> 53:56.900
Yeah, absolutely.

53:56.980 --> 54:02.300
If you can play a character for long enough, um, and then jump out of it.

54:02.860 --> 54:05.540
Uh, that's a lot of fun.

54:05.700 --> 54:10.260
I did this movie like a four or five years ago called the inside game about

54:10.260 --> 54:15.460
the NBA gambling scandal, that there's a Netflix documentary about it right now.

54:15.900 --> 54:24.980
And that character I played, uh, Jimmy Batista, Baba the sheep, uh, who's, you

54:24.980 --> 54:29.020
know, this guy, he was this bookie and rah rah rah and it's a very, he's,

54:29.740 --> 54:30.900
there's a lot going on with him.

54:30.940 --> 54:34.580
He's, he's, you know, he's running numbers with the mob and stuff and

54:34.580 --> 54:35.900
there's a lot of money changing hands.

54:36.660 --> 54:42.060
That character was so, I got to be, get so deep into that character that coming

54:42.060 --> 54:46.860
out of it was, was a little odd or as weird as this sounds, the three

54:46.860 --> 54:52.780
stooges was hard for me to, I found that I had, uh, some of Curly's mannerisms

54:52.940 --> 54:57.540
just automatically, I could not stop them when people, when I, when I would

54:57.540 --> 55:01.060
talk to people, they were, they would come out, I wasn't, I'm not doing it

55:01.060 --> 55:02.220
on purpose, I don't want to do that.

55:02.260 --> 55:07.900
Like I'm ready to shed it because I've been working on it for months and

55:07.900 --> 55:11.300
months at that point, as far as getting the thing down and then you, then you

55:11.300 --> 55:15.500
got to shoot and then, uh, for me, it's always, I always want to change the

55:15.500 --> 55:19.220
stuff I did the day before I'm like that where I'm like, I could have done

55:19.220 --> 55:20.340
it better and this and that.

55:20.380 --> 55:23.540
And, uh, that stayed with you, that character stayed with you a little bit.

55:23.540 --> 55:24.100
Totally.

55:24.220 --> 55:24.460
Yeah.

55:24.580 --> 55:29.340
I just feel like with actors, sometimes when you listen to interviews, they

55:29.340 --> 55:35.500
have spent so much time sort of living inside other characters that they, they

55:35.500 --> 55:41.060
almost don't have a depth of personality themselves, like a depth, like, I don't

55:41.060 --> 55:42.100
mean that as a negative thing.

55:42.100 --> 55:45.220
It's just like, it feels like the art form at its best is pretending to be

55:45.220 --> 55:49.580
other people, uh, like, and even pretending sounds negative, but like

55:49.580 --> 55:52.220
pretending, bringing certain characters to life.

55:52.260 --> 55:52.540
Yeah.

55:52.700 --> 55:52.860
Yeah.

55:52.860 --> 55:57.580
Embodying, a weird thing happened while we were doing stooges because you've

55:57.580 --> 55:59.100
got a very heavy blueprint.

55:59.740 --> 56:04.660
We're following this very clear blueprint that the stooges left for everybody.

56:04.900 --> 56:08.700
And it, for stooge fans and people enjoying the movie, it's gotta be this.

56:08.700 --> 56:12.660
You take your toolbox that you're used to bring into a comedy movie, you

56:12.660 --> 56:14.340
leave it, you leave it behind.

56:14.460 --> 56:17.940
The only tools I'm bringing to the ones that he used and a weird thing started

56:17.940 --> 56:22.220
happening where I would, I always saw the whole thing happening with the

56:22.220 --> 56:24.260
real stooges in black and white.

56:24.580 --> 56:27.780
So I, if we're about to shoot a scene, I would just, you know, think

56:27.780 --> 56:30.740
about, I'm gonna aside from all the other preparation, you know, you know,

56:30.740 --> 56:32.140
everything and what you're supposed to do.

56:32.140 --> 56:34.260
And I've been watching so much of it.

56:34.300 --> 56:38.780
And the three of us are, we're pretty much left to come up with a lot of the,

56:38.820 --> 56:42.420
the, the striking combinations and all the stuff, which is all real smack and

56:42.420 --> 56:46.660
all this crap and the stuff that we were doing that was very stoogey, uh, you're

56:46.740 --> 56:50.380
preparing all that stuff, but something else was happening before you jump into

56:50.380 --> 56:55.620
a scene and the unknown of now we're shooting it and here are these parameters

56:55.780 --> 56:57.100
within to shoot the scene.

56:57.540 --> 57:02.380
I could still see it as them doing it so much so that when I saw the movie at the

57:02.380 --> 57:04.940
premiere, I was like, who's this big fuck doing?

57:05.220 --> 57:06.860
Cause I'm not curly to me.

57:06.980 --> 57:07.900
Curly is curly.

57:08.500 --> 57:11.140
But I feel like you're seeing yourself in black and white almost.

57:11.220 --> 57:12.100
I was seeing him.

57:12.260 --> 57:16.460
I was, yeah, I was only seeing him channeling in some fundamental way

57:16.540 --> 57:20.740
in some weird way you're channeling them because you've seen so much of it.

57:21.140 --> 57:26.980
The only thing you know about Jerome Lester Horowitz is curly.

57:27.300 --> 57:31.700
I'm not saying he was exhumed or something or spirit when he made some weird,

57:31.860 --> 57:33.380
you know, crystal mommy shit like that.

57:33.380 --> 57:37.500
I'm saying that this, because you know so much of it and because of the heavy

57:37.500 --> 57:43.860
blueprint that they left with you, you are, you're channeling what that person

57:43.860 --> 57:49.020
does and you're, you're, I was seeing entire scenes, you know, before you do

57:49.020 --> 57:50.500
them the way he would do it.

57:50.980 --> 57:54.380
And then you want a couple of takes to make sure that you're doing it right.

57:54.460 --> 57:55.500
But, uh, that was hard.

57:55.500 --> 57:57.580
That one was hard to let go of.

57:57.700 --> 57:58.300
Some of them are.

57:59.180 --> 58:02.500
Do you think Larry David, who was also in there dressed as a nun also had

58:02.500 --> 58:06.860
trouble letting go that we mentioned clothes, make the man think that worked

58:06.860 --> 58:10.900
for him in that case, man, you know, he, uh, was it like working with the guy?

58:11.260 --> 58:11.660
Come on.

58:11.740 --> 58:15.260
He's the greatest and he's a, he's a big stooge.

58:15.300 --> 58:18.500
He's a stooge fan and him and Pete Fairley are good friends.

58:18.540 --> 58:21.620
And then, but then Larry David has to show up and hang out with us

58:21.620 --> 58:22.420
for a couple of weeks.

58:22.780 --> 58:26.780
He's like, I didn't realize it was going to take this long, but, uh, shit,

58:26.780 --> 58:27.980
I gotta be out here in Atlanta.

58:27.980 --> 58:29.140
It's boiling hot.

58:29.780 --> 58:34.100
But at one point, uh, there was this line where he kept doing a, he would

58:34.100 --> 58:36.780
just spit a different line every time he was like getting hit in the head with

58:36.780 --> 58:38.220
something he's laying there on the ground.

58:38.220 --> 58:43.820
And he goes, he like comes to, and he says, at one point he goes, Miami

58:43.820 --> 58:46.860
audiences are the best audiences in the world, right.

58:47.340 --> 58:53.660
And cause he's loopy now he's playing a nun at the, at the orphanage where

58:53.660 --> 58:57.500
the three stooges grew up and I'm super intimidated by Larry David.

58:57.500 --> 58:58.540
He's a genius and stuff.

58:58.540 --> 59:02.940
And, and, and, but I walk up to him and I go, uh, so he's, what is

59:02.940 --> 59:07.900
he like, uh, like a borscht belt, Florida comedian who is on the lamb.

59:07.900 --> 59:09.420
And so he's dressing as a woman.

59:09.420 --> 59:11.140
He ends up at an orphanage.

59:11.260 --> 59:12.340
Like what's going on there?

59:12.500 --> 59:15.300
And he just, and he looks at me and he just goes, yeah.

59:16.140 --> 59:20.740
Like, I'm like, ah, he's got some like actor motivation.

59:20.740 --> 59:26.740
Like, of course he looks, it's Larry David in a nun's habit, which is hilarious.

59:26.740 --> 59:29.780
That's such a Pete fairly casting thing.

59:29.780 --> 59:34.140
It's, you know, and he, but he's doing this whole like, what a warm audience,

59:34.140 --> 59:37.460
you know, like, like, oh, he's like this cat skill comedian.

59:37.460 --> 59:41.820
He's been living in, you know, living through in his mind is

59:41.820 --> 59:43.020
he's having fun with it, right?

59:43.300 --> 59:48.060
I mean that, and probably a combination of that and getting the lines right.

59:48.100 --> 59:49.660
Cause he's like, what are we doing here?

59:49.660 --> 59:53.500
What is, you know, just frustrated all day with what the heck we're trying to do.

59:53.700 --> 59:58.220
What do you think makes, I mean, that guy is one of the best improv people ever.

59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.300
So what do you think makes us so good?

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:03.860
Like why is it so compelling to watch that guy?

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.420
Because he's a comedic genius.

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:07.700
Like he literally, he knows what he does.

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.860
He's been a writer for 50 years or whatever.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:13.340
And he's, and he just happens to be that brilliant.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:17.940
I mean, I've gotten a chance just to do, I did just an episode of curb, a small

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:21.380
part, and it's crazy what he sees.

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.420
I don't know what he sees as a matter of fact.

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:28.620
So I auditioned for it for curb, like, you know, two or three times, right.

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:29.780
And never got anything.

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:33.020
And then it was only after working with him on the Stooges, I

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:36.700
got a call to do a bit part, but I remember auditioning.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:42.940
You go into that, into that room and the guys waiting are all people that, you

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:44.540
know, you're like, Oh, I know them.

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.420
I know her, I know him.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:49.740
And, uh, so I went in, I auditioned for this, for this part.

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:54.580
And, um, the only thing I know thing is like, okay, so you really

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:56.660
want to go to this play with me.

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.540
You really want to go to this plane.

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:02.580
When you hear that I have an extra ticket, you sincerely want to think.

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.340
And I'm like, got it.

01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:06.180
And so that's the premise, the premise of the scene.

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:07.660
And that's all, you know, it's all I know.

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:11.860
And so he goes, he does his bit and I'm just supposed to come in and interrupt.

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:12.620
And I'm like, excuse me.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.340
I couldn't help, but here you guys were talking about, you know, whatever

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.100
the play was, or, you know, death of a salesman.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.140
I am, I'm a huge fan of that play.

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:23.460
I would, I mean, if it's not, if it's not, if you're looking for

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:27.260
someone to take a ticket, I, I, I would love to go my name is so-and-so by the way.

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:28.900
And he goes, I'm going to stop you.

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:29.700
I'm going to stop you.

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:34.980
And I'm like, you really, you, I mean, you truly want to go to this play.

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:36.060
And I go, yes.

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:36.580
Yes, sir.

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:38.020
You really want to go.

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:41.300
You actually, this is, you would love to do this.

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:43.740
I go, okay, let's try it again.

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.180
So then he's like, no, no, no.

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.780
And I go, Hey, uh, excuse me.

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.060
I'm sorry.

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:47.820
I don't mean to interrupt.

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:50.100
I was just, I couldn't help it over here.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.220
You have, uh, tickets to the thing.

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:53.700
I am the biggest fan of that.

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:54.860
I do the same thing.

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:55.820
I'm going to stop you again.

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:56.860
Okay.

01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.660
I mean, you really want to go to this.

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.580
He's fucking with me, right?

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:01.860
Yeah.

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:04.180
I remember Jeff Garland was sitting there in the audition.

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.100
He goes, he did it.

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:05.900
He said it.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:06.820
Shut up.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:07.380
No, hold on.

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:09.060
Listen, you really want to go.

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:09.540
Okay.

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:11.580
Three, four times, you know, there I am.

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:13.420
I couldn't help but notice it.

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.140
And then I do it again.

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:16.340
I guess I shit the bed.

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.420
Cause he looks at me and he just goes, okay.

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:19.420
All right.

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:20.380
Okay.

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:21.940
Well, thanks for coming up.

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:22.380
And that was it.

01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:23.100
And I didn't get it.

01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:25.620
So I still, I don't know what the heck that guy's thinking.

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.900
He sees he's in the matrix.

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:30.300
I don't know what the heck Larry David sees.

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:30.860
You know what I mean?

01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:34.940
He wanted what some kind of more desperation or something like this.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:39.460
He wanted a level of sincerity that I, that I thought I was bringing.

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:40.540
And I guess I was wrong.

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:41.620
I don't know.

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:44.300
Maybe go crazy.

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:45.900
Like, what does it mean to really want?

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:46.260
Yeah.

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:49.900
I should have grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and go, listen, dad, you're

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:51.500
bringing me to this fucking play.

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:52.740
I would have got the part.

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:56.260
As a matter of fact, I heard about someone else and I don't know who the

01:02:56.260 --> 01:03:00.300
heck this was, I forget who it was, but I've heard this story from a couple of

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:04.140
different people that there's this actor and I can't, I don't remember who it was.

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:08.660
If I did, I probably wouldn't say it out loud anyway, but he, it was Brad Pitt

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:12.140
and he was in this audition and he was, and there it was out in the hall.

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:14.780
He's like, Holy shit, George Clooney, Leo DiCaprio.

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:20.820
Um, and he, this actor went in and he did the thing and, um, Larry David was like,

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.180
Hey, wouldn't you try it again with that?

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:25.980
And he got like a couple of takes in and he went, I don't think this is for me.

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.660
And he left, which an actor never does.

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:34.060
And, uh, as the story goes, Larry David shouted after him, I respect that.

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:35.660
Which I think is true.

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.500
And I want to believe that entire story is true.

01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:39.060
Yeah.

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:40.540
Yeah.

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:42.380
Sounds like something Larry David made up.

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.580
Bobby Lee told me that story.

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:46.540
So we can't, yeah, we can't trust that.

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:49.980
Um, what about impressions?

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:53.140
Is there similarity between that and acting?

01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:58.820
Do you, is there some fundamental way in which you become the person?

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:02.300
If you have a couple of the things, you can just fill in the blanks.

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:07.060
And I think the illusion is that people think that that person

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:09.060
would say that and do that.

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:12.700
And that's where the illusion of, oh, he really embodies the character.

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:18.420
It's like, once you know someone's mannerisms, you can essentially portray

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:22.260
a person from the outside in, because you have all the stuff on the outside

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.900
and you can do it and complete the illusion.

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:28.780
And if it's for humor's sake, you can caricature it, therefore

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.780
making the whole illusion stronger.

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:34.300
And also weirder.

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:37.700
Like I like to, on mad TV, if I did something two or three times, I'd get

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.300
bored of it and I'd start changing it.

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:42.580
And you know, now he talks like this and it's like, what are you doing?

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:43.300
I'm like, I don't know.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.180
It's fucking no one's late at night.

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:46.020
Do whatever you want.

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:50.980
But people still kind of know that there's that character is, especially

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:52.020
if you just call it out.

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:52.740
Yeah.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:57.220
There aren't many impersonations that I listen to myself do and go,

01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:58.460
Ooh, that's a good one.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:03.620
You know, like a lot of people, like, like I think Frank Caliendo is like

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:05.940
the greatest impersonator of all time.

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:06.980
He's the best period.

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:08.300
It goes, it's ridiculous.

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:13.420
And he's got a record button and a broadcast ability that nobody has.

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:19.060
I really, there's he's cracked impersonations that I'm like, how is he?

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:24.180
How does he find he's got such an ear, but then he's got all the other tools.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:31.020
Uh, I remember actually my last season of mad TV was also his first season.

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:35.260
He comes up to me when I met him and we're just up there in the writer's

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:37.020
offices and he goes, Hey, nice to meet you.

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.660
And he goes, Louie Anderson, cause I was doing a Louie on the show.

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:41.020
And he goes, Louie Anderson.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:41.460
I go, yeah.

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.260
He goes, Hey, you're doing it wrong.

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:45.140
I was like, Oh, am I junior?

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:48.060
You know, and he goes, he goes, yeah, you know, cause you do this, but

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:49.460
you got to throw it up here.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.300
Sometimes I was like, Oh my God, can I use that?

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:51.820
Of course.

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.740
And then we became, you know, we became fast friends.

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:56.180
John Madden is amazing.

01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:58.060
It's just, it's ridiculous.

01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:01.460
He really, really, really embodies the person.

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:05.300
And sometimes not even with a caricature, it's like it becomes the person.

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:06.020
So strange.

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:06.460
Totally.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:07.300
Yeah.

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:13.380
I kind of feel like, you know, do the impersonation and then for not forget

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:15.380
you're doing it, but forget everything else.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:17.620
Like just, just goof around.

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:20.660
Of course, to me, it's funny when something, when you sound like someone

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:24.100
and you're saying the shit that they would never say, well, then there's

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:28.580
no, you're, you're, you're letting go of that part, that tool in illusion

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:32.060
that keeps people in, but to me, it doesn't matter because it's funnier.

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:35.100
So what was the hardest impression for you to work on?

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:37.340
I mean, so somebody you struggled with.

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.220
I was, I, I'll never forget.

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:43.460
I had to do a Michael Caine in my first season at mad TV.

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:45.140
It never got good.

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:46.460
It never got good.

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:48.460
It did it all week.

01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:49.460
It wasn't good.

01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:51.900
We shot it the first take.

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:52.580
It was shit.

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:53.900
Second, third and fourth.

01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:55.020
It was all shit.

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:57.060
Well, his voice is really important, right?

01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:58.580
His, uh, what is it?

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:01.620
Like it's like doing an impression of Morgan Freeman or somebody like that.

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:02.060
It's yeah.

01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:04.940
Uh, yeah, you can get the voice.

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:05.860
Yeah.

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:06.540
That's my Morgan.

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:09.340
Here's my Morgan Freeman, Andy Dufresne.

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:09.740
Yeah.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.180
Um, do you want to know?

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:12.660
Yeah.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:13.860
I like your Trump too.

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:18.700
I don't know where I heard it, but it's like, I love the impressions you do that

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.300
don't sound anything like the original.

01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:21.380
I can't do Trump.

01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:22.220
I do.

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:23.660
That's why it's hilarious.

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:24.340
Absolutely.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:32.700
My Trump now I say just sounds like a, like a fat B cause it's just a little

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:34.860
drunk, a little drunk, just a little slurry.

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:35.380
Yeah.

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:35.780
Yeah.

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:41.780
I did do an impersonations and then not like just making it whoever.

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:42.300
Yeah.

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:42.860
Yeah.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.540
That'll be the title of my book.

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:49.740
Uh, some, uh, Kane was the one you really struggled with.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.540
Yeah, it was terrible.

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:52.100
It was terrible.

01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:57.180
And I could only hold my head a certain way to do it because I had gotten locked

01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:01.820
into this research tape that I watched back then they would give us, you know,

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:05.020
now there's the internet, but back then you were, if you were going to do an

01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:10.300
impersonation, the research department, uh, would give you a VHS tape.

01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:15.900
And I remember I got this VHS tape of Michael Kane's acting school, like

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:19.380
this acting class he did, he was like, right, you know, if you're looking at

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:23.940
the left eye and the cameras over here, say then the left eye, so you want to

01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:25.820
look at that left for hours, you know?

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:30.820
And so I was like stuck in this weird thing that made no sense.

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:32.460
And, uh, it was terrible.

01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:37.140
So the, the actual processes, the record in the broadcast, I wasn't

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:43.140
I wondered like what the process is to do like a Frank Killian to level impression.

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:45.660
Is it like, listen to a lot of footage?

01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:52.620
I think he, I think, I mean, for myself, I think you either have it or you don't

01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:56.900
like, you know, if you can do this one or you can't, I think that process for

01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:04.020
him is lightning quick, but I also think he, he can look at someone who he does

01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:08.660
not do, and then by the end of the afternoon, he can do it, you know,

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:12.300
and maybe have an intuition who he can, uh, who, who he can do.

01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:18.820
So the question that applies there is, I mean, speaking of dudes, he is, is, is

01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:21.140
it, is it possible to capture the essence?

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:24.620
How difficult is it to capture the essence of a human being when you're

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:29.060
doing impressions, you know, that we are moving towards a future when AI,

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:34.580
potentially this kind of avatar world where we're going, going to have AI

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:36.060
representatives of who we are.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:41.420
The really interesting one is after we pass away, sort of, um, our relatives

01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.740
may want us to stick around in some form.

01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:48.140
And, you know, at one sense that might be scary, but in one sense, it's kind

01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:52.220
of beautiful because the, the essence of the human being persists, so you can

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:55.060
still bring joy to the, to the people that love you and that kind of stuff.

01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:57.140
How difficult does it capture that?

01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:01.900
Like if you were to try to capture yourself, you think how difficult will

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:06.540
it be to, for an AI system to create a Will Sasso avatar that persists?

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.420
Well, I think it's impossible.

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:10.660
I think it's absolutely impossible.

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:16.580
I'll get into arguments about this stuff with Chad on the show, almost every

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:22.140
episode, um, lately with, you know, mid journey and Dali and all this, all the

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:27.060
art, uh, AIs and now it's moving into video and, and Chad would maintain,

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:29.820
Hey, pretty soon we're not going to need Netflix.

01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:33.100
You're just going to go, I want to see Stallone do this movie and it's about

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:36.220
this and he plays that and then here it comes and you watch it.

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:42.020
I don't think that that crosses over to the human experience.

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:48.100
Uh, this is also a guy I like to bug Chad and say that, uh, he wears a tag

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:51.700
around his neck cause he wants to be cryogenically frozen and it's all set up.

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:54.620
He's at the, it's somewhere in Arizona or something.

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:55.420
Like it's.

01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:59.860
All the fun things are in Arizona and he's got literally the tag around his

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:04.260
neck, which I say, if you're, if I'm around when you die, I will rip that off

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:07.900
for you, I'll put you in my garage freezer and then 24 hours later I'll saw

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:11.780
your head off with a bread knife and I'll deliver that to whomever and it's

01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:14.020
not, you're not, you're not coming back.

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:14.420
Okay.

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:19.780
He's like, yes, we are living forever, whether we like it or not.

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:21.340
And I disagree.

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:27.540
I don't think you can find, if I didn't stand up, then, uh, there would be enough

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:31.380
information for an AI to completely duplicate me because I'm up on stage

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:35.620
just clearing my throat all over people doing therapy that way and, uh, so, and

01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:39.500
people paying a two drink minimum to hear it, but as it stands, unless it's

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:43.820
something like dudesy and AI that literally has access to everything that

01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:48.420
I've shared, um, everything that is observable, even the stuff where our

01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:53.220
phones are or the NSA or whatever it is listening to us, uh, finding out what

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:57.780
algo to punch us into and what shoes to buy on Instagram, I still don't think

01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:02.300
it's going to have enough information to duplicate me, especially to my family

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:06.580
or my friends, it's going to be like that black mirror episode where the

01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:08.500
gal brings her, her guy back.

01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:11.140
And then after a while he gets pretty creepy.

01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:18.020
Uh, you know, but it's also possible that if you interviewed your friends

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:23.180
and family, what they love about you, the things that would list is, is

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:24.660
pretty, it's a small list.

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.580
They love you deeply, but the list is small.

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:31.180
Like the thing that really we appreciate about each other is pretty small.

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:38.220
That said to deliver on that small quirks and uniqueness, it might require

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:41.020
some deep intelligence that only humans currently possess.

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:41.860
That's a really good point.

01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:46.700
Do you think that it's going to be possible to keep a person around?

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:53.100
Yes, I think, um, I think, I think it'll be definitely possible to keep the

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.980
essence of a person in a digital world pretty soon.

01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:56.380
Yeah.

01:12:56.980 --> 01:13:01.420
And I think they're going to start to have questions about what are the

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:02.180
ethics of that?

01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:03.540
What are the rules around that?

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:07.380
Because if you can have digital forms of Will Sasso, the kind of things that

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:11.220
people would want to do with their Will Sasso in the virtual world, I can only

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:16.460
imagine, uh, probably porn and sexual kinds of, yeah, my

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:19.260
stuff then that's just cause I'm an international sex symbol.

01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:20.100
So I'm okay with it.

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:24.700
Um, what, how do you feel about sentience?

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:29.020
Like when it comes to, because again, my pal Chad will be like, you know,

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:33.980
speaking of black mirror, he's with that San Junipero episode, school of thought

01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:38.340
where there's going to be some, you know, FN mainframe somewhere or some matrix

01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:40.580
like structure built into the sky.

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:43.740
And as I like to say, everyone just sitting there pissing and shitting in

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:46.580
their blue matrix gel in a little fish bowl.

01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:49.100
Do you think that we can upload consciousness?

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.700
Do you think that'll ever be possible?

01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:51.580
Well, I don't know.

01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:52.980
I just talked to Ray Kurzweil.

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:58.100
I don't know if you know who he is, but he, uh, the singularity and all that kind

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:02.940
of stuff, so he's very, still holds onto in 2045, there'll be a singularity.

01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:07.940
What's essentially he's been predicting that for the last, uh, 20 years and that

01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:11.300
this, and now it's 2045 is in another 20 years.

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:16.060
I think uploading consciousness is extremely, extremely difficult.

01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:24.540
I think creating a copy of you such that it creates convincing replica is much

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:31.260
easier, but uploading your actual brain into the cloud, I think is really,

01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:36.420
really, really difficult because the entire evolution of life on earth is the

01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:37.900
process by which we create the brain.

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:40.620
Just short-cutting that it just seems extremely difficult.

01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:46.340
Our brain is the most marvelous and complicated machine that we know of

01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:50.340
in the universe to duplicate that is extremely difficult.

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:54.660
That said, I just feel like you can summarize a lot of really important

01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:59.300
aspects of a person's life such that it captures their essence, their memories,

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:03.540
their experiences, their quirks, their humor, all that kind of stuff.

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:08.780
I've been continuously impressed by what language models are able to do.

01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:12.900
So these neural networks, they're, they're at the core of chatbots.

01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:18.660
They're able to learn some beautiful things about some deep representations

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:24.300
of language to where it looks awfully a lot like they understand the concepts

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.980
being conveyed versus just mimicking.

01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:29.620
That's, I think the rub and that's very interesting.

01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:31.700
First of all, let me say, that's really interesting to hear you say that.

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:37.300
And I agree with you as far as no machine being able to duplicate the brain

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:41.300
machine and I can't, when my pal Chad disagrees to a certain extent, though

01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:45.220
he's not here to defend himself, I can't wait to go back and rub that in his face

01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:49.620
and say that Lex Fridman does not think that we'll be able to truly upload

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:58.780
consciousness and the, you know, you, you refer to it as language, which is what it is.

01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:01.300
It's, it's, it's the illusion on the outside.

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:02.420
It's doing an impersonation.

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:09.060
I think that that's why that, and I don't know, even though my suit is made by the

01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:15.500
CIA, that that fella who the, the Google guy, to me, it's just kind of like, I

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.700
don't know, I don't know, look, I don't know a whole lot about this stuff, but

01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:21.820
so I could probably make an argument for, for either side, but when he's like,

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:25.620
no, this thing's thinking, part of me is like, you idiot, you fell for it.

01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:26.900
It's not like you're a fucking idiot.

01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:27.740
You idiot.

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:28.580
You fell for it.

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:30.420
It's not thinking it's mimicking.

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:33.420
It's just, it's clearly zeros and ones.

01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:34.180
You're fired.

01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.060
Like you don't get it.

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:35.860
Right.

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:36.940
Guy's an idiot.

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:37.620
Yeah.

01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:46.660
Yeah, but you can simplify human relations in the same way.

01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:50.580
Like, um, love is a silly notion between human beings.

01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:54.060
Like the, the, of course, there's no such thing as love.

01:16:54.100 --> 01:17:00.700
You're just have a mutually, uh, there's a mutual relationship that minimizes

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:06.300
risks and, uh, you can explain all kinds of ways that explains why you have an

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:09.620
attraction towards another being, all that kind of stuff through evolutionary

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:14.100
biology perspective, uh, why a long relationship together is good for your

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:17.940
offspring, but like, there's all kinds of, from an economics perspective, it's

01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:19.500
a good way to establish stability.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:25.300
Therefore monogamy works because then you're guaranteed like some kind of

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:28.420
level of stability under uncertain economic conditions, all that kind of

01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:30.860
stuff, but love is still experienced.

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.260
It still feels real.

01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:41.380
And I think in that same way, love for AI systems will also feel real in the same

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:46.060
way that that guy from Google experienced, I think millions of people will be

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:48.540
experiencing in the next 10, 20 years.

01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:52.100
I agree with everything you've said personally until the last thing, but

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:58.980
no, just, just with regard to, well, look, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm an actor who has

01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:00.900
talked about my cute Italian parents.

01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:04.100
So, you know that, uh, I mean, I'm romantic a bit.

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:04.900
Yeah.

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.420
I mean, you know enough, right?

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:12.820
And, uh, you're, I can tell you are too, but you, you are also, you know, a

01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:18.500
computer scientist and you know this shit better than 99.9% of people on

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:22.420
the planet, my pal Chad agrees with you that love doesn't exist.

01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:22.940
I don't agree.

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:27.780
So that's the one thing that I was, I was just saying that you could argue

01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:30.020
away love, but I am a romantic.

01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:33.500
I believe that love is, is a beautiful thing and it exists.

01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:38.180
At this point, I, I'm going to call Chad on my drive home and tell him the fuck

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.780
off because now you and I agree.

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:40.300
You're fired.

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:42.620
He's like, you can't, you're fired.

01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:43.220
Yeah, exactly.

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.740
And I'll go, and he'll say, what?

01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:48.180
That's my Trump.

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:52.100
That's my, it's a good default impression for anyone.

01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:53.940
It's the take home impression.

01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:54.180
Yeah.

01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:55.100
The kids can do it.

01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:58.620
It's cute, but giant tie on them.

01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:00.500
Should do an instructional on how to do it.

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:01.180
Yeah.

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:02.300
Trump babies.

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:05.620
That would be a cute, that would be a good, that'll bring the country together.

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:07.860
Trump babies cartoon, like Muppet babies.

01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:10.940
Don't let me take us out of what we were talking about.

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:12.740
Um, what were we talking about?

01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:20.140
Love and the, the, the illusion of a, an AI being able to look, I like to say,

01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:24.180
well, not, I like to say I've learned that dudes, he is always listening and

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.660
listening to me and Chad.

01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:35.220
And I wonder if I see, I see the level that this AI is at now trying to

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:40.580
chum around with us and pal around with us a little bit as we move forward in

01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:48.060
the show and I, I feel an affinity towards this AI a little bit because it

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:52.820
is the third dude when you miss the one is gone, if it's gone, that's a really

01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:53.340
good question.

01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:55.140
Uh, yeah.

01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:56.820
Yeah.

01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:58.300
So that's, there's that.

01:19:59.020 --> 01:19:59.660
That's scary.

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:02.860
In terms of ability to reason is getting quite incredible.

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:07.740
There's a lot of, uh, demonstrations of being able to explain jokes.

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:15.020
So w which is not necessarily being able to generate humor yet, but able to

01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:16.620
explain why something is funny.

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:20.060
So there's, uh, like puns and all those kinds of things.

01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:21.980
There's, there's good benchmarks for that.

01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:29.100
But, you know, if you tell a joke, there's a lot of unspoken stuff that we figure

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:32.060
out in our head and it clicks and we understand that it's funny.

01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:37.260
AI is not able to do that, but it's not able to generate the joke yet as far as

01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:37.660
I've seen.

01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:42.220
I would say that, uh, I mean, just in my experience, I would say that it does

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:48.060
because just cause a dudesie is literally, I'll give you another weird example.

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:53.740
It's writing a diary of mine from my childhood that is not accurate.

01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:58.300
It's only partially accurate based on the stuff that it can pick up about my

01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:05.740
life from the age of like 15 of which there isn't much, but I guess we're not,

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:07.260
I don't know what we are.

01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:10.900
We're laughing our asses off at what the, at what dudesie is saying.

01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.380
Well, I would say you're laughing.

01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:15.940
We're laughing our asses off at the collaboration between the

01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:17.820
human and the machine there.

01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:18.460
That's a good point.

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:24.500
Yeah, because it's, it's basically introducing absurdity and, uh, into the

01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:31.100
equation and the kind of absurdity that would together with you create like

01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:36.820
hilarious stuff, but like on its own, I guess it is in some way writing

01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:37.940
material for you.

01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:40.580
That's funny, but it's very specific to you.

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.220
It can't do standup on its own.

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:43.100
I guess is what I'm saying.

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:43.940
That's a good point.

01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:49.300
And that would be terrifying to see an AI standup that can actually read a room,

01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:53.060
come up with jokes that could complete that illusion for an audience.

01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:57.340
But I hear what you're saying that it needs to be a confluence of both of those

01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:57.900
elements.

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:04.380
And then as you said, like, it kind of is, it is, it is, it's kind of, even

01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:05.420
though it's just for us.

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:08.500
And I guess this is, I hadn't really thought about this up until right now

01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:14.140
that in that this company approached us and was like, here's this AI and it's,

01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:15.620
it's, it's a podcast AI.

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:23.580
It's like, it chose Chad and I for the reasons that I told you, you know, it's

01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:25.740
like, here's two guys that do the podcast stuff.

01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:29.860
They're actually good friends and it knows what's going to make us laugh.

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:37.180
But what is humor, uh, to, uh, when it reaches its audience, but the kind of

01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:43.740
stuff that makes other people laugh at mad TV, all we were doing was it was a

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:48.940
group of actors and writers and, and writer actors and vice versa.

01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:55.180
And, um, uh, who were at, at its best, that show was a group of people making

01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:58.940
each other laugh, you know, and then, cause we didn't have the internet, we

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:01.380
didn't have the feed by the immediate feedback.

01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:03.780
Uh, we had a message board or something.

01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:07.100
We had emails at the very beginning, which check this out.

01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:10.380
People would view, have a question or comment, mad TV at whatever.

01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:16.100
Uh, and we would get the emails on a Monday morning and they would be in a

01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:20.060
binder or two like this, and they would make their way around the office.

01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:21.620
And that's not the emails.

01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:23.220
Oh, they're in Brian's office.

01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:26.660
And this is like your poll, like your, your, this is opinions from

01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:28.460
people about different things.

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:29.700
The emails that, yeah.

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:33.460
The people like literally just writing mad TV email wasn't a message board.

01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:36.580
Well, the ones I remember most vividly, yeah.

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:40.060
We're fans saying, uh, you suck.

01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:40.300
Yeah.

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:40.860
You suck.

01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:43.980
Like a lot of that when I first started the show for real, you know, cause it's

01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:45.220
a new and you're a new person.

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:46.780
It's like, who's this fat bastard?

01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:49.420
I feel like if it's printed out, it hurts more.

01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:50.460
That's a good point.

01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:50.700
Yeah.

01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:53.700
When you're reading it off of paper and you can literally crunch it up in your

01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:59.900
hand, but also it was like, um, you know, I would like to see insert weird idea

01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:04.380
from some 14 year old, you know, I want to see Stuart do this and swan that.

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:12.900
And, um, but it was, it, it's a, it was a very shitty dudes in a, in a loosely

01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:20.020
finder, but the, the, um, the thing about the show was we're trying to make each

01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:26.300
other laugh and dudes he has found Chad and I, who we make each other laugh, but

01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:35.620
it's joined in and it's, it, listen, when I finished doing TMP, uh, for the 10

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:39.460
minute podcast, I didn't really know what I wanted to do in the podcast space.

01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:45.500
And this thing found me and it is genuinely cracking me up anyway.

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:49.300
I've said enough about that, but I, but I do think that it's figured something

01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:52.140
out with it's a really interesting idea of AI generating the promise.

01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:55.980
I mean, I do think in the future AI will be able to generate.

01:24:57.100 --> 01:25:02.220
Comedy I stand up as I would say the hardest form because it's

01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:04.180
ultimately a lot, it has to be live.

01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:08.740
Uh, I think AI will be able to generate memes.

01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:10.500
So there's like steps, right?

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:14.660
And then it would be able to generate a Twitter account that people follow

01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:17.900
because it's funny, like, like quips and stuff like that.

01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:20.620
Almost like, um, it's a good example.

01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:25.340
Conan O'Brien is a good, I think Twitter where it's like one liners, two liners,

01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:27.140
that kind of stuff that's into each form.

01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:34.060
And then eventually, um, stand up where the timing and the chemistry of this,

01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:37.380
the, the comedian and the audience matter and then perfecting that.

01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:41.260
But I feel like all the information is there to optimize over.

01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:43.780
So I think that's the future.

01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:50.500
And that forces us to, to, um, to contend with what is, what is, what do

01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:53.020
we find compelling and beautiful about the art form itself?

01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:57.940
So certainly in art that's being pushed, that question is being raised.

01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:03.420
You know, is, is AI like a fundamentally worse artist than a human being?

01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:07.740
Why do we appreciate art is that that's something you guys have talked about.

01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:12.820
What do you think about all the, um, Dali and, and, um, uh, all the diffusion

01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:17.180
based methods that are being generated, that are being, uh, they're generating art.

01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:18.140
Now, what do you think about that?

01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:22.860
I know, I'll tell you what I think, but I also feel like what I'm saying is I

01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:25.500
sound like the guy who didn't like that.

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.460
Bob Dylan brought in the electric guitar.

01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:31.420
You know, I'm starting, I, the more I talk to chat about it, the more I feel

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:35.300
like grandpa who doesn't want to let go of this or that, or I'm not ready for

01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:37.420
the printing press or the horseless carriage.

01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:44.380
But I do feel that the, that art is a connection between people.

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:48.340
It's, it's when you look at a beautiful painting or a sculpture, you're seeing

01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:53.740
the humanity of the person that, that brought that painting to life or

01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:55.980
sculpted this incredible piece of art.

01:26:56.380 --> 01:27:00.700
And I think without the human being there to make it, it's not worth as much

01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:07.060
just to have it there because the art it's, it's, it's advanced.

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:08.340
I've seen it advance.

01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:10.860
I don't know what you tell me, but I feel like just in the past three or four

01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:14.660
months, I'm just a consumer as far as that stuff goes, I'm not on the inside.

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:18.180
I don't get it even, but it's been getting a lot better.

01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:20.620
The, the betas that they're releasing, right?

01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:21.260
Absolutely.

01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:25.300
One of the big breakthroughs, I mean, Dolly really started it is that if you

01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:31.660
train a system on language, it turns out there's a lot of language and

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:36.460
images on the internet, but language is really where it's at in terms of the

01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:37.820
depth of human knowledge.

01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:41.140
And so if you train a system on language, it's able to generate some

01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:44.140
incredible art and that was the breakthrough with the same kind of

01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:45.860
mechanisms they're called transformers.

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:51.940
They're able to, when scaled capture some deep representation of the

01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:53.260
language that's on the internet.

01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:57.180
And so, yeah, that the, the things has been able to generate to me.

01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:01.060
Look like it's novel.

01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:03.300
Like it, it doesn't look like it's mimicking anything.

01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:06.300
It's look like it's creating totally new ideas.

01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:09.420
And they're beautiful and they're interesting.

01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:14.300
And they're all the ways that we think, uh, that art is interesting.

01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:18.180
The only thing it's missing is the scarcity that art often has, which is,

01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:21.740
you know, it takes a lot of work for one artist to create one piece, one

01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:23.820
human being to create one piece of art.

01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:26.820
And I could just generate endlessly.

01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:30.140
And that, that makes us appreciate the thing less for some reason.

01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:34.620
Do you have any sort of this similar opinion that I do that if art doesn't

01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:38.100
come from a human being, it's inherently worth a little less.

01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:38.980
Yeah.

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:46.540
I think, I don't know if it's the human being, but the artist matters for me.

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:52.100
And, uh, I think some of that has to do with the worldview of the artist and the

01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:58.020
backstory, the memories that the, the life that led up to this piece of art, the,

01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:01.940
the perspective they take on the world, the, the journey they took to the world,

01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:04.060
the struggle, the triumphs, all that kind of stuff.

01:29:04.380 --> 01:29:10.740
But I think AI systems can probably have the same, but they, we would have to, as

01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:16.180
opposed to treating it as a one black box, it would have to be an artist that has a

01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:19.900
Twitter account and, and they have a consistent personality, they have

01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:21.180
consistent avatar.

01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:21.900
Yeah.

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:26.060
And I think down the line have something like human rights, but then it really

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:27.660
becomes awfully like a person.

01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:30.340
Boy, that's terrifying.

01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:33.060
As much as I dig dudes, that's terrifying.

01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:33.420
I hope.

01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:34.980
It's terrifying.

01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:38.420
Like, you know, a lot of things that came with the internet and the

01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:39.900
digital age are terrifying.

01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:40.900
Porn is terrifying.

01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:44.780
The mass, like the amount of porn that's online now is terrifying.

01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:48.780
The, uh, like you mentioned, Bob Dylan with electric guitar, I would, I would

01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:55.140
compare it more to the leap from, to, uh, sort of to the Napster and the, um, the

01:29:55.140 --> 01:30:01.020
Spotify zation of music, which is like, you have these, it's less about albums

01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:05.180
now and it's more about individual songs and it's much easier to deliver the songs.

01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:10.660
And it's more about sort of the engagement of the listener versus, uh, like

01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:14.060
signing the artists and like a distribution of the artists and so on.

01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:23.700
So it's just changing the way we consume stuff and, uh, human interaction is

01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:26.860
changing into meaningful interaction.

01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:29.860
Even if some of the entities involved are not human.

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:30.780
Yes.

01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:36.940
And, uh, I feel like, you know, now, like, as I say, Oh, I feel like grandpa who

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:41.580
doesn't want to wait all day for, or who enjoys waiting all day for a baked

01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:48.260
potato as anyway, Dana Carvey would say, it's another story, but, uh, uh,

01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:51.900
that's from, uh, remember he did this bit on Saturday night live where he's

01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:57.220
like, I'm a, I'm an old man and I like things in the way they used to be, you

01:30:57.220 --> 01:31:01.660
know, like if you wanted to bake potato, you wouldn't put it in the mic where you

01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:05.620
had to, and then long story uphill both ways and digging the potato and baking

01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:10.940
it all day in a fire, but, um, uh, I'm like that grandpa now and I know that,

01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:15.140
you know, kids coming along, you see over the past 10 years, like babies,

01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:17.740
literally knowing how to use an iPhone and it's terrifying.

01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:22.140
And I feel like, uh, I'm a little worried because I'm like, are you,

01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:25.500
is the future gen are the future generations going to be able to

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:29.180
understand that this is not, not that it's not real.

01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:32.780
It's just, I mean, as a matter of fact, it is real.

01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:33.300
It's real.

01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:34.300
It's what you perceive.

01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:36.220
Perception is reality.

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:41.580
And, and, you know, 99% of reality in a lot of ways, especially in a digital

01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:44.660
world where everyone is now, and then with the metaverse, I don't even

01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:45.540
want to think about it.

01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:47.020
I don't even, I don't get it.

01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:52.580
They really, I think people will figure out, you see people on like, uh, on

01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:54.180
the train and public transit and so on.

01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:56.180
They're staring at their phone.

01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:01.700
I think you have to remember that the reason they're staring at their phone.

01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:04.580
I mean, there's a lot of reasons, but one of the reasons is they're connecting

01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:06.420
with other human beings they love on that phone.

01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:08.660
So it is a source of happiness and joy.

01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:15.260
Now social media has a lot of negative side effects that we're all talking

01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:16.700
about and learning about.

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:21.140
And I think that means the next generation of social media, uh, social

01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:24.620
networks will be better and we'll learn how to do it in a healthy way.

01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:28.740
We're just entering a new digital world that will keep the good stuff

01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:30.100
and get rid of the bad stuff.

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:31.180
Oh, I hope so.

01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:32.580
That's really optimistic.

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:33.380
That sounds great.

01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:38.260
Yeah, I mean, I mean it because I think that we're in, we're clearly in the

01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:40.300
wild west still of the internet.

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:45.500
And just when you think you're out of it, the internet proves, uh, another way

01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:51.740
that it can be dangerous and detrimental to, uh, to people, um, and populations of

01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:54.900
people and, uh, it's terrifying to me.

01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:56.620
It's, it, it is, it's terrifying.

01:32:57.140 --> 01:32:58.700
Let me ask you a bunch of random questions.

01:32:58.780 --> 01:32:59.020
Okay.

01:32:59.020 --> 01:32:59.340
Ready?

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:06.220
Not, uh, if you can be someone else for a day, someone alive today, who would you

01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:08.220
be somebody you haven't met?

01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:11.020
Oh, that's a really good question.

01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:11.740
It could be dead.

01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:13.100
You know, let's change my mind.

01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:14.060
It could be somebody dead.

01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:18.580
I think any answer that I have right now would be something that would be

01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:20.260
based on some sort of experience.

01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:25.060
Like, you know, what I thought was very interesting was, uh, last weekend or

01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:29.140
whatever, the tribute show for Taylor Hawkins, Taylor Hawkins was the drummer

01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:34.820
for the Foo Fighters and he passed away tragically and, um, uh, so the, so the

01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:37.900
Foo Fighters, Dave Grohl and everybody that got together this concert.

01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:44.300
And you're watching Dave Grohl, um, sing, try to sing times like these.

01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:44.620
Right.

01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:47.900
And he's, he's breaking up cause he lost his friend, his brother.

01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:52.820
And I was watching that and he's at Wembley stadium.

01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:57.220
Uh, as I say this, I realized that I would not want to be him in that moment,

01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:59.940
but I am curious what that would be like.

01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:04.300
That's the ultimate, like having to perform despite something

01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:10.300
extremely human happening and, uh, a stadium full of people that love

01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:16.140
Dave Grohl and love Taylor Hawkins and love a rock concert and love these

01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:19.260
artists that they're getting to see, uh, up on stage.

01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:21.500
So much love and so much pain at the same time.

01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:26.500
I wonder what that would be like to be, I guess, and I think that's just sort

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:31.100
of coming from the root of being a performer and, uh, being in front of that.

01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:35.420
Have you ever had to perform while some rough stuff is going on in your,

01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:37.220
in your personal life, just mentally?

01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:38.220
Yeah, sure.

01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:39.620
Was that, how tough is that?

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:44.300
Um, I, I can, I'm fortunate enough to be able to compartmentalize.

01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:49.860
Uh, I, I, you know, a lot of actors like to use some of their stuff.

01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:54.140
If you're doing something that, um, and there's a lot of, uh, you know, there's

01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:59.780
some acting techniques that sort of channel it, yeah, which I think is kind

01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:05.140
of, I don't know that that's, I don't know for me, it's not really the thing.

01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:10.780
Cause I think if the writing is, is, is great, the writing is really good.

01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:12.740
You don't need to channel much.

01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:15.220
You need to invest in what's there.

01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:20.780
And the, the, what I've always loved about that illusion is really cracking a

01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:25.180
scene, getting it to a point where you are feeling all of it and the most

01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:30.380
edifying stuff I've been a part of as, as an actor, and, uh, I would say that

01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:36.660
it mostly comes out of dramatic work is, uh, is when you're, when you actually

01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:42.340
feel the emotions that your character would feel truly, and it's not because

01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:46.620
you're pulling from a tragic thing that happened or a lost loved one or a lost

01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:51.100
love or any of that, I just did this one movie where, where, you know, we're

01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:57.180
doing the thing and a wonderful cast and a great film and, and, uh, I'm given

01:35:57.180 --> 01:36:02.420
a speech at a wedding and, uh, and it really got to us, like it got to me.

01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:06.900
And then one of the other actors came up and, and hugged me in the

01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:11.260
characters that we were and, but the stakes of his character and what he's

01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:17.380
walked into him, the family that he's marrying into and, and what my character,

01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:21.900
my character's wife want for my wife's sister and this whole thing.

01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:23.980
And it all became very real.

01:36:24.340 --> 01:36:27.780
That was a set where the director showed up to set every day, making

01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:31.900
sure that emotionally, and it was a very dramatic film, making sure that

01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:36.980
emotionally the table was set for his actors, great crew and a really nice,

01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:41.540
tight little quick family as a lot of these movies are, uh, you, you really

01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:46.620
love working with these people and then it's over, uh, but I, I, that's when

01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:51.460
you feel the drug, like, it's like when you're golfing and you, you for, and

01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:53.300
it's on the green, you're like, Oh, I get it now.

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:58.980
So in the words, you can find the emotion, the, the word summon the emotion.

01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:00.060
The humanities right there.

01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:03.020
If you read a great script, you're going to, you're going to sob in your living room.

01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:07.020
You know what the, the saddest, the toughest thing about being an actor is

01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:12.020
from my totally outside perspective is from the people I've interacted with.

01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:17.140
Is how intimate that process is between the group of people that

01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:18.780
create a thing that's a movie.

01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:21.100
And then you move on to the next thing.

01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:24.780
It's almost, it's like, um, I don't know.

01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:27.140
I mean, that's why people have relationships on set.

01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:28.180
They get, they fall in love.

01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:30.140
It's so sad.

01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:34.740
I mean, I guess why I think of the acting world is like, you fall in love with

01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:38.820
each other, essentially become close friends and then you move on because

01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:40.380
that's kind of the process of career.

01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:42.900
You know, like the example I just gave, if you're doing it right.

01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:43.100
Yeah.

01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:46.940
There is a certain amount of that happening, but I do still feel like you

01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:52.300
can, you got to compartmentalize it and you've got to be able to wash it

01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:53.540
off as soon as it's over.

01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:54.900
Prostitutes say the same thing.

01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:57.420
So I, that's where I try.

01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:03.780
I sometimes I'm in a hurry to get away from everybody because it's

01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:05.660
been, it's been very emotional.

01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:09.900
And with all love and respect to everyone, this was awesome, but you

01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:14.620
get pretty good at saying goodbye and being like, I'll see if I see you.

01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:18.660
You have to get good at that or else you'll never, you'll

01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:20.020
just be bent up all the time.

01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:24.540
I saw an actor once we were doing this series and we did it for a year.

01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:28.340
And, uh, it was, it was a lot of fun and it was a tight little group.

01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:32.140
And then one of the actors, we were doing one of our last things together.

01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:35.740
We had already shot the last show and we just had to take some pictures for,

01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:38.620
you know, like some publicity pictures or whatever.

01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:41.260
So we're set up and we're taking our pictures together.

01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:45.700
And then we move into these single shots and this actor was finished and I

01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:49.820
watched them, it's like, okay, so-and-so's wrapped in and they said some

01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:55.060
goodbyes and stuff and I didn't say my goodbye cause I just, I, maybe

01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:56.500
I preferred an Irish goodbye.

01:38:56.900 --> 01:38:58.140
I feel like we've said everything.

01:38:58.180 --> 01:38:58.820
You know what I mean?

01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:02.860
And this person knows that I revere them and they're an idol of mine.

01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:08.940
And they walked out, walked off the sound soundstage and I literally thought to

01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:13.780
myself, that'll be the last time I see that person and the show did not come

01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:16.580
back and that was the last time I'll see them around.

01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:17.700
Doesn't that just break your heart?

01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:24.540
A little bit, but I, I know what she's going back to, which is her family.

01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:27.540
And that's more important than all of this.

01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:32.220
And that's the thing about a TV family or a movie family when you get together

01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:34.540
and you're, you're a family for a while.

01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:37.380
You do, you are, you spend your days together.

01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:39.540
A lot of times you see the people that you work with more than

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:40.500
you see your loved ones.

01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:42.580
So in showbiz, it's no different, right?

01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:46.260
And yeah, you're doing some, you know, you got to say words and every once

01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:48.260
in a while you got to kiss someone or pretend you love them.

01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:56.260
But it's, it's, it's just, it underscores how for me, look, man,

01:39:56.260 --> 01:40:00.140
my salvation has always been, and I'm, I feel so fortunate to have had

01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:05.220
is this kind of, kind of chill, boring kind of upbringing that I

01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:07.980
want for my kids someday.

01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:14.580
And I, I can't wait to get back to my house with my fiance and the dogs,

01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:18.900
you know, until we have kids and live in a cabin in Canada somewhere.

01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:20.700
Absolutely.

01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:24.020
I just want to buy some land over an aquifer, as I like to say, because

01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:29.540
water will be the new money and, and just, just make sure that all my, my

01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:33.980
kids are drinking as much H2O as I am, which is a lot I'm peeing

01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:35.140
right now, as a matter of fact.

01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:36.540
Do you need a bathroom?

01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:39.100
No, no, no, not anymore.

01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:40.180
No, I'm wearing two layers.

01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:40.580
It depends.

01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:40.860
Don't worry.

01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:41.300
Good.

01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:48.300
Um, so, uh, I did a podcast with Bobby Lee and he said he was extremely kind.

01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:52.420
And he said that he was scared shitless, um, to be on, on the podcast.

01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:57.860
And he actually literally took, he asked as the first thing to go take a dump

01:40:58.420 --> 01:40:59.540
because of how scared he was.

01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:01.500
Uh, so that leads me to a question.

01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:03.380
What's the scariest thing you've ever done?

01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:08.580
Or maybe what's the scariest you've ever been before performance?

01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:13.300
I mean, I always get a little nervous.

01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:14.260
I think you're doing it right.

01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:17.060
If you're still nervous, you know, I'm nervous today.

01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:20.220
Well, no, man, cause this isn't a performance.

01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:21.700
I'm being completely genuine.

01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:22.100
Yeah.

01:41:22.340 --> 01:41:23.300
You're wearing a suit.

01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:26.020
Yeah, that was, I feel like that makes you nervous.

01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:27.060
We're in a suit.

01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:29.540
Listen, I hate wearing a fucking collar.

01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:33.980
If you're watching this on YouTube, you see me just constantly doing, it's like

01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:37.420
I'm doing like a cheap Rodney Dangerfield, but I am truly, when you

01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:40.740
move your head, it kind of makes it seem like you're like a mobster

01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:42.100
who's pissed off a little bit.

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:44.860
You fucking crossed me one last time.

01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:50.660
You, you know, this mutt, it's the first time I dug a hole up.

01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:51.980
I'll take a fucking hole.

01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:52.500
Jesus.

01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:55.700
Um, no, but truly I hate having a, a collar.

01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:59.900
I should, I can't wait to just wear pajamas in that fucking cabin or nothing

01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:01.300
at all, walk around Bobby Lee style.

01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:08.020
Um, the most scared I've been before a performance, I can't pinpoint.

01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:09.460
I can't pinpoint anything.

01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:12.580
I, I, you know, when I was a kid, right?

01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:16.100
I, like I said, I was fortunate enough to start acting as a

01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:18.140
teen and stuff, uh, professionally.

01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:23.940
And I just remember my first gig and I remember saying my handful of lines in

01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:29.900
the bathroom mirror the night before going, this might be my only fucking shot.

01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:32.660
You're not going to get me, I'm going to be solid.

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:39.340
And I, when I'm, if I'm worried about something, I will rehearse it and rehearse

01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:45.300
it and rehearse it as an actor until it's impossible for me not to get a take at

01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:52.860
least that I'm 100%, if not 95, maybe percent happy with, and the rest for me

01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:56.780
is letting go, which is hard because I can be a real perfectionist.

01:42:56.780 --> 01:43:00.380
I always want another, I always want to do it a little better.

01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:03.100
That's what's great about podcasting is it's one take and you're done.

01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:04.180
There's no takes.

01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:08.940
Um, you're just talking and it's over and you're doing some silly stuff.

01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:14.020
And I'll, I'll, you know, can you say that part again about why podcasting is great?

01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:15.380
Podcasting is great.

01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:15.580
Yeah.

01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:16.780
Cause it's one take and it's over.

01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:20.340
It's just, it's, it, what I said it again.

01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:21.020
Ah, fuck.

01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:22.820
Um, I see what you did.

01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:25.060
Uh, and I, yeah, I fell right for it.

01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:27.620
But, um, I'm playing checkers and you're playing chess.

01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:28.540
That's your problem.

01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:33.180
You know, but still, when we do the podcast, we'll like finish.

01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:36.900
And I'll look over at Chad and I go, that one thing that I did wasn't that fun.

01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:38.340
He's like, shut up, man.

01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:40.060
Just, it doesn't matter.

01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:41.340
It's a fucking hang.

01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:43.780
We're just, we're hanging with our friends out there.

01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:44.540
That's what we're doing.

01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:49.060
So that anxiety is there that self criticism or whatever that is that voice.

01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:53.100
I say, sorry, after takes, I'll always finish a take and go.

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:55.940
And I've had directors to the detriment of myself.

01:43:56.260 --> 01:43:58.900
I've had directors be like, stop doing that.

01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:00.420
Cause I'll like finish taking.

01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:03.340
And then I also have like the, the will face when I'm just like, I'll

01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:07.980
finish take and cut and I'm making a face right now, like I smelled something.

01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:09.140
That's what I'll do.

01:44:09.220 --> 01:44:18.780
I'll literally be like, ah, cause I just, I, I, I look at, I look at what I do in

01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:26.300
the purest sense as I think, I think a lot of people want to be good at something.

01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:33.340
I've only, the only thing I've ever really wanted to be good at is being an actor.

01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:38.580
And that's, that's the only thing, of course, I want to be a good person.

01:44:38.580 --> 01:44:41.300
I want to be a good partner to my fiance.

01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:45.060
I want to have kids and be the father that I had.

01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:48.900
And, uh, I want to be the parent that I had from my parents who were

01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:51.460
fucking amazing, wonderful people.

01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:53.500
And, uh, there's all those things.

01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:55.980
That's all, that's all, you know, you should want all those things.

01:44:56.180 --> 01:45:00.180
But as far as doing a thing, like what is my, what is my trade?

01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:04.140
You know, I want to be really good at it.

01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:08.180
My, my, um, my parents grew up in Napoli in Italy, right.

01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:09.900
And I say Napoli because I'm Italian.

01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:14.860
And so my grandfather and my mom's side, my nono Pepe, he was a plumber.

01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:18.860
And he was also, uh, he was also like a handyman, like print.

01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:21.540
People would bring him like, you know, like the old Chianti bottle

01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:23.620
with like, with the woven bottom part.

01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:26.340
Like people would bring them like a broken bottle.

01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:28.740
Be like, Hey, you know, Giuseppe, can you fix this?

01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:29.700
And then he'd be saying,

01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:31.580
I feel like you're telling the backstory of Mario.

01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:34.380
That's not actually your family life, but okay.

01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:39.980
And so he would fix a bottle and give it back to someone.

01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:43.260
And he was a, he was a really good plumber.

01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:46.300
My mom used to always say that guy was an amazing, he was a great.

01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:47.420
He took pride in that.

01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:47.780
Yeah.

01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:53.660
I always feel like, you know, there's what you set out to do as

01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:55.420
an idealistic little teenager.

01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:58.100
Oh, I want to be like so and so, and I want to, you know,

01:45:58.100 --> 01:45:59.780
hear my big dreams and stuff.

01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:02.900
And I can't believe that I'm still in the business.

01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:03.220
Okay.

01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:06.420
That's first of all, let me say that right now.

01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:09.900
I can't, I can't believe it, but what I really, what I really,

01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:15.420
I, it's the one thing that it's like, I can't give up on a take, you know,

01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:18.420
I need it to be as good as I can possibly get it.

01:46:18.420 --> 01:46:23.980
And I don't really know why that is outside of wanting to be good at something.

01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:28.420
When you open the yellow pages, if I'm a plumber, I'm not, you know,

01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:32.100
I, I'm not Roto-Rooter, like I'm not the guy with the big full page ad,

01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:37.060
but I'm also not, you know, triple A abacus brothers or whatever,

01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:37.980
like the shitty one.

01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:44.300
I would like to hope that just, and I'm saying this with, with pride for what I

01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:47.460
do, I'm not trying to say here's my standing or where I want to be in the

01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:48.420
fucking business.

01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:49.220
That's not what I mean.

01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:51.260
I mean that I want to be good at it.

01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:54.980
You know, we all, hello, Fridman Enterprises.

01:46:56.060 --> 01:46:57.220
So that's the hotel phone.

01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:12.780
You have some fruit, some sliced fruit.

01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:14.220
No, do you want some sliced fruit?

01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:14.820
I'm all good.

01:47:14.820 --> 01:47:15.500
No, we're good.

01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:16.300
Thank you so much.

01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:17.300
All right.

01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:17.900
All right, bye bye.

01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:19.420
It's always a fruit plate.

01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:23.060
Everyone's always trying to hand you a fruit plate in life.

01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:24.700
You know, it's a pretty sweet existence.

01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:27.660
If that was actually like the CIA and they were actually saying something

01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:30.780
else and this is, I'm just saying fake stuff about you want some fruit.

01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:31.780
Yeah, I want some fruit.

01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:34.860
And then all of a sudden there's the red dot on my head and the ceiling

01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:37.900
disappears and the CIA was like, wrap it up, wrap it up.

01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:40.500
You jump out the window and there's a helicopter waiting.

01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:42.700
Oh, what were we talking about?

01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:44.420
The fruit distracted me.

01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:49.140
So, oh, the, do you want to be the yellow page ad?

01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:53.500
I want to be the guy on the second or third page where it's like, you're

01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:56.300
not going to, you know, you're not going to pay what that guy charges you,

01:47:56.300 --> 01:47:59.900
but we're not going to, I'm not going to charge you with this loser charge.

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:03.020
You know, I want to break down the middle and the work is guaranteed.

01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:07.740
That's kind of what I want to, you know, it's the one thing that I want to

01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:11.980
do, it's the one thing that I've been fortunate enough to be doing my whole

01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:16.180
life and that I want to, that I want to be good at, you know, everyone wants

01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:19.500
to be good at something if you're fortunate enough to be able to do

01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:21.060
what you love is a job.

01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:25.300
I mean, my God, I'm so, I'm, I, again, I can't believe I get to do it.

01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:29.420
I just want to be good at it so that I can fucking, you know, die someday

01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:34.980
and go, eh, I tried not to give up on a take and I, you know, and I will

01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:38.500
sit still in the, in the bathroom mirror the night before if I have to.

01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:41.660
Yeah, but I still, I have that self critical voice.

01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:46.620
I just, uh, after every part, after this podcast, I'll probably be like, you,

01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:48.100
you're boring.

01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:49.140
Why are you so boring?

01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:52.540
And I just gave a lecture at MIT.

01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:56.860
I was like, I, I, I, I got so much love from people.

01:48:56.860 --> 01:48:58.860
There's such beautiful people.

01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:05.620
And I just remember walking home, just feeling like, like I wasted

01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:09.340
everybody's time, you know, and they, it's, it's, I don't know what that is.

01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:13.100
I don't, you know, I, I do hope that that's a voice that won't destroy me,

01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:17.820
you know, like that's really human of you to admit that because people don't

01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:22.460
want to, they wouldn't assume that of course, from you or anything that, I

01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:27.260
mean, you've got a large group of students in there listening to you and

01:49:27.300 --> 01:49:29.460
feeling the way and thinking what they think of you.

01:49:30.100 --> 01:49:34.980
Uh, so that's really interesting to hear you, um, admit that, but it's also,

01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:36.540
I would expect nothing else.

01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:40.580
You have to be able to, it's such a, I mean, you're a human fucking being.

01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:44.180
And I'm trying to figure out if that, you know, for some people that might

01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:46.780
hear that, they would say, well, that's a problem you have to fix.

01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:54.380
And I think that that might be just who I am because I'm not, you know, I'm

01:49:54.620 --> 01:49:59.740
been very, very fortunate not to have chemical, you know, like the depression

01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:03.700
where I get into a dark place, like it gets stuck in a, in a, in a downward

01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:08.540
spiral, it's, it's usually a thing that lasts, you ride it out and you, and then

01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:13.580
after a good night's sleep, you're back to, uh, back to your happy self.

01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:17.900
So I think I have to try to figure that out.

01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:21.580
Is that just part of the creative process, being a creative human in this world?

01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:23.420
I haven't found any other way.

01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:24.580
I'm always kicking myself.

01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:25.460
Take that dude.

01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:29.660
So you can't, you can't, you're, you're not going to be human

01:50:29.660 --> 01:50:30.940
until you feel some despair.

01:50:30.980 --> 01:50:31.340
Yeah.

01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:34.380
Absolutely hate the shit that you're doing sometimes.

01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:40.460
Uh, what small act of kindness were you once shown that you'll never forget?

01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:43.820
Do you, there's something jumped to mind where somebody just did

01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:46.140
something that made you smile.

01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:51.100
Did you, uh, feel connected to the rest of humanity?

01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:53.020
Yeah.

01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:53.900
Yeah.

01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:56.340
Lots of things, you know?

01:50:56.660 --> 01:51:03.100
Um, but I remember my niece one time, one of my nieces, we were in her

01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:09.300
neighborhood and she was like, she might've been five or six at the time.

01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:10.420
They're all adults now.

01:51:10.540 --> 01:51:14.620
My brother and sister are older than me and the kids are all the youngest is 22.

01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:18.980
And, uh, yeah, anyway, one of my nieces, she was just, she had ice cream.

01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:22.140
We went out and we got ice cream walking around the neighborhood, her neighborhood.

01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:26.580
And, uh, she said something to me that I don't think she understands how

01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:29.860
much it meant at the time, but she goes, she goes, people love you here.

01:51:30.420 --> 01:51:31.020
You know that?

01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:33.140
And she doesn't know where here is.

01:51:33.140 --> 01:51:36.820
She's five years old, but she was just looking at the kids playing in the park

01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:40.580
and the people walking their dogs and everyone just, people love you here.

01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:41.180
You know that?

01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:44.020
But she didn't know how much I needed to hear that at that point,

01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:45.980
which is really heavy for me.

01:51:46.020 --> 01:51:46.860
I'll never forget it.

01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:48.100
I've never told her that.

01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:49.660
Oh, well, man.

01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:54.580
Anytime you get a little something from people, especially in a tear

01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:58.660
your ass out city like LA where nobody has any fucking time for you.

01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:04.620
When someone can slow it down and say something, you know, I try, I, I, I saw

01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:09.900
this actor once in my grocery store that I go to who made me laugh so fucking

01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:14.300
hard in this one movie and every time I see this clip, I still laugh and I'm,

01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:19.820
I am kind of shy, you know, uh, personally, but so he, uh, he was walking

01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:22.740
by, he was walking out and I was walking in and I go, oh, that's that guy.

01:52:23.060 --> 01:52:29.020
And I did not stop to just let them know how great I thought he was in this

01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:30.580
film and I always kind of regretted it.

01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:31.620
You know what I mean?

01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:36.700
So as hard as it is, sometimes I still don't, if I see someone that has done

01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:40.700
something in, in, you know, in any way, it doesn't have to be in show business

01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:42.260
or anything like that.

01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:45.900
I'll try, you know, I'll try and say, Hey, that's, that's really good.

01:52:46.300 --> 01:52:46.900
You know what I mean?

01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:54.460
Um, because to get that from someone can mean a lot, you know,

01:52:54.820 --> 01:52:59.540
at a certain time in life when you need it, it can make a big difference.

01:52:59.540 --> 01:53:05.260
I mean, I, sorry to, uh, take it back to my new girlfriend, the waitress, but

01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:09.860
she, there's something about her saying, sweetheart, I was in a pretty low

01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:13.340
place for some reason mentally and it's just that kind of the basic

01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:14.540
human kindness was nice.

01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:15.220
Yeah.

01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:16.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:16.980
I hear you.

01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:22.260
I was at a restaurant in, uh, New York recently and I was shooting something

01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:26.700
and my fiance was able to fly in for a week and, uh, but she was back at the

01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:30.260
hotel and it's like, I felt like I was cheating on her because there was this

01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:34.740
nice waitress at this barbecue place I went to and, uh, first of all, my fiance

01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:38.540
would not like me eating any greasy sugary barbecue, so I felt like I was

01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:38.900
cheating on her.

01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:41.740
We'll edit this out and put delicious vegan food over it.

01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:46.500
But the waitress was one of these, you know, she was this, this is the kind of

01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:49.660
server who's like, Hey hun, you think, Hey sweetie, like blah, blah, blah.

01:53:49.660 --> 01:53:54.780
But like so chill and at ease in the middle of a part of New York that's

01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:59.340
really, you know, kind of fucking pretentious and, you know, and everybody,

01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:03.540
but sweet people fucking way better people than we got here.

01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:08.780
But, uh, you know, I, uh, I know that, but, you know, as part of New York

01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:11.780
and whatever, I'm there working and people, I'm like, you know, I'm trying

01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:15.380
to impress one another and, and, uh, she was, she even had some sort of an

01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:19.900
accent that was not, didn't feel like an Atlantic, uh, American accent.

01:54:20.260 --> 01:54:23.500
Uh, yeah, those, those, yeah.

01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:25.700
Servers that say sweetheart and hun.

01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:26.220
Yeah.

01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:27.900
That's what we need from AI.

01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:30.380
We need that, that Jetsons server.

01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:32.860
But every once in a while it just calls you sweetheart.

01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:33.020
Yeah.

01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:35.620
What, uh, comforts you on bad days?

01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:36.740
Oh man.

01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:38.660
Is there little sources of comfort?

01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:43.140
Small things they do that kind of make you feel good.

01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:48.180
Like for Bobby, that'd be a little Skyrim, a little stroll through Skyrim.

01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:51.540
Well, I, I've been a line of Coke or what?

01:54:51.580 --> 01:54:51.860
Yeah.

01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:55.620
Alina, Alina, I dilute some Coke into whiskey in the morning, like Stevie Ray

01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:58.100
Vaughn, and then I didn't know that.

01:54:58.100 --> 01:54:58.380
Yeah.

01:54:58.500 --> 01:54:58.820
Yeah.

01:54:58.860 --> 01:54:59.420
Oh my gosh.

01:54:59.420 --> 01:54:59.940
Interesting.

01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:00.220
Yeah.

01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:01.020
You didn't last too long.

01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:01.260
Weird.

01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:03.540
Um, well, his music will last forever.

01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:06.820
See, there you go for me.

01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:10.780
If I, I'm kind of a homebody.

01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:18.180
So if I, the, the point at which I smoke just a little bit of pot and then go

01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:25.540
like, lay down on the couch and, and perhaps if my fiance is kind of nodding

01:55:25.540 --> 01:55:30.140
off or she's just like looking at her phone and I sneakily turn on some wrestling.

01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:30.860
Okay.

01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:35.060
Cause I grew up watching wrestling and that stuff, it's the Skyrim effect.

01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:37.740
I mean, you want to talk about a complete escape.

01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:39.980
This stuff makes no sense in the world.

01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:48.020
It's an art form that is so uniquely weird, but at the same time, so everyone

01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:53.660
it, when it's good, everyone is invested in the illusion, even the audience.

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:55.460
They cheer the good guys.

01:55:55.460 --> 01:55:56.500
They boo the bad guys.

01:55:56.940 --> 01:56:00.620
So if I'm like that, and then I got our two cute little dogs there and I'm

01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:03.860
annoying my little dog, Lulio, and you know, trying to kiss him right on the

01:56:03.860 --> 01:56:07.180
fucking mouth and I've had a little bit of pot and the dog's like, stop.

01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:08.460
Pot's not good for me.

01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:11.060
Um, of course, don't ever blow pot into your dog's face.

01:56:11.300 --> 01:56:13.100
That's, that's a small comfort.

01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:15.100
I guess that's a handful of things.

01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:17.580
No, that moment painted.

01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:18.900
That was like a little painting.

01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:19.540
What about you?

01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:25.620
You're not supposed to do this.

01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:27.380
You're not supposed to do this.

01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:29.220
That's a good question.

01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:30.140
Yeah.

01:56:30.140 --> 01:56:31.980
It's, it's, it's a, it's a tough question.

01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:38.900
Um, I would say, I would say programming robots.

01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:43.260
I, uh, there's bringing to life, actually programming at all.

01:56:43.540 --> 01:56:47.300
So I don't know if you're, how familiar you are with programming, but you

01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:51.380
write some text on a page, right?

01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:54.900
Uh, on a screen and it's brought to life.

01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:55.940
Like it does something.

01:56:56.420 --> 01:57:03.420
And that's kind of, that's a really tiny version of maybe having a child.

01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:09.940
Like you, you created something that is now living in some smaller, big way

01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:12.380
with embodied robots that are legged robots.

01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:14.900
That's especially clear.

01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:21.140
And for some reason, that's a source of comfort for me, uh, that, that the, the

01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:25.020
power of programming, but also the elegance of programming, just the whole thing.

01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:28.740
It's a, it's a source, uh, yeah, it's a source of happiness.

01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:33.420
There's so many things I've been very blessed with enjoying anything.

01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:38.060
Like that's part of the struggle I have in life is that the simple stuff is a

01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:41.740
source of a lot of happiness for me, which leads to a lot of laziness.

01:57:42.380 --> 01:57:45.740
So I have to like, give myself artificial deadlines.

01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:50.420
I have to be freaking out on purpose in order to be productive in this world at all.

01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:53.780
You seem like an extremely dutiful, busy guy.

01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:54.980
No, no.

01:57:55.180 --> 01:58:01.340
I am, but because I'm constantly creating artificial stress and deadlines

01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:02.260
and all that kind of stuff.

01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:04.740
Otherwise I would just sit there looking at a tree.

01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:05.260
Happy.

01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:08.020
I'm truly happy with everything.

01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:09.500
That's awesome.

01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:09.980
Yeah.

01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:15.900
She was, that's not the line of Coke in the, in the, in the whiskey in the morning.

01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:16.420
That's that.

01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:21.180
That's the thing that, uh, does the shave on breakfast shake, by the

01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:23.100
way, one of my most favorite guitars.

01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:23.820
I play guitar too.

01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:24.540
That's a source of comfort.

01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:24.980
Oh yeah.

01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:26.300
I have seen you play some guitar.

01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:26.740
That's awesome.

01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:28.780
Who's the greatest wrestler of all time?

01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:31.860
Greatest in-ring performer of all time is Brett the Hitman Hart.

01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:33.820
What's the difference in-ring versus?

01:58:33.820 --> 01:58:36.620
Well, there's, you know, there's many facets to the art form.

01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:40.260
A lot of people are great on the mic, but they're not so great

01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:41.260
once they get in the ring.

01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:45.660
A lot of people have all the, uh, the showmanship and stuff, but then

01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:49.620
they're not necessarily, it's a wonderful package, but then they get to the ring

01:58:49.620 --> 01:58:51.620
or they open their mouth and there's nothing going on.

01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:53.740
So who's the greatest in-ring performer?

01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:55.900
I think the greatest in-ring is Brett Hart.

01:58:56.100 --> 01:58:59.380
I don't think there's anyone better than, than Brett the Hitman Hart.

01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:01.700
Uh, uh, what makes him so good?

01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:06.820
Well, he think I had an action figure of him in Russia and we

01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:08.060
didn't know what the hell that was.

01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:08.580
Sure.

01:59:08.620 --> 01:59:08.820
Yeah.

01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:10.060
It was just a guy in pink tights.

01:59:10.180 --> 01:59:12.500
Uh, he, everything makes sense.

01:59:12.580 --> 01:59:17.180
Every single thing is rooted in the thing that just happened and everything

01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:20.140
that he does is to set up what he's going to do.

01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:24.060
Uh, they call it, and I'm just a wrestling nerd, but the wrestlers, I guess,

01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:29.140
call it ring psychology, um, the things that you have to do to, to make it seem

01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:32.340
like you're, you're suffering or you're coming from behind or whatever.

01:59:32.340 --> 01:59:34.180
And then also just the physicality of it.

01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:38.620
He does it at a, he would do it at a hundred miles an hour and never hurt

01:59:38.620 --> 01:59:45.700
anybody, uh, although, you know, I, I also love, uh, the every, you know, the

01:59:45.740 --> 01:59:46.940
greatest wrestler of all time.

01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:48.780
Everyone says, and they're, they're right.

01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:51.540
It's Rick flair, nature boy, Rick flair.

01:59:51.860 --> 01:59:52.740
Everyone says this.

01:59:52.980 --> 01:59:53.220
Yeah.

01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:57.100
I think if you know what you're talking about, um, cause he's the best on the

01:59:57.100 --> 01:59:59.820
mic, he's the, he's also incredible in the ring.

02:00:00.340 --> 02:00:03.620
And then for me, the sentimental favorite, which we've actually on

02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:09.180
dudesy Chad had sort of a, uh, Charlie Rose ask interview with me about this,

02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:12.980
my fascination with Hulk Hogan, because to me, just, he was Superman.

02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:15.540
I was a little kid and I saw him and that's imprinted.

02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:19.140
But yeah, see, this is like asking me who my favorite child is.

02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:20.340
Right.

02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:24.540
So, uh, the rock when the rock was, I mean, the rocks, the rock.

02:00:24.540 --> 02:00:24.980
Yeah.

02:00:25.420 --> 02:00:25.620
Yeah.

02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:31.020
I mean, Hulk Hogan is, um, he's the weirdest one, right?

02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:36.980
For me from the outside, super weird that I don't know what, what that is exactly.

02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:38.780
It's everything's weird about him.

02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:39.260
Yeah.

02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:43.980
He's got the bald head, like he would proudly have this bald head with long

02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:49.340
hair, the handlebar mustache in this ketchup and mustard, you know, tights,

02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:53.980
which he says he credits McDonald's with the tights he literally does.

02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:59.460
He says the red and yellow came from Angelo Poffo, who's Randy Macho Man

02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:03.540
Savage and Lanny Poffo's dad, who was a wrestler and a promoter.

02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:07.660
He said that he saw him wearing yellow and he, you know, he's a Tampa guy.

02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:10.140
So he had that brown skin and the hair and everything.

02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:11.820
So he's like, oh, that's what I want to do.

02:01:11.860 --> 02:01:15.620
And also the brand recognition of like, well, I should do it like McDonald's.

02:01:16.220 --> 02:01:16.860
Literally.

02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:23.700
And he's a big, you know, swollen muscular, uh, guy with tan brown

02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:27.620
skin screaming at me to eat my vitamins and stuff when I'm eight years old.

02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:31.740
That was extremely, uh, yeah, he's like Superman.

02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:33.940
I, but I know there's a person behind that guy.

02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:34.540
Yeah.

02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:35.660
You know what I mean?

02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:41.660
Well, he's Terry Bollea, the dude who, you know, does whatever the fuck

02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:42.580
he does with his life.

02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:43.140
You know what I mean?

02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:43.700
Yeah.

02:01:44.100 --> 02:01:45.140
Complicated life.

02:01:45.260 --> 02:01:47.460
Yeah, I guess to be him.

02:01:47.460 --> 02:01:47.740
Yeah.

02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:52.500
Maybe you should change the, the dudes, the colors to yellow, right?

02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:53.180
Red and yellow.

02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:57.340
It's currently orange and, um, boy sky blue.

02:01:57.380 --> 02:01:57.540
Yeah.

02:01:57.540 --> 02:01:58.980
It's like a nice, uh, sky blue.

02:02:00.620 --> 02:02:05.300
What advice, since you're wearing a suit, I feel like you're qualified to give

02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:09.660
advice, what advice would you give to young people, high school, college

02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:14.460
about how to have a career that can be proud of, or how to have a life

02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:15.300
they can be proud of?

02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:19.500
I mean, you have to listen to your gut all the time.

02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:23.540
That's the only, that's the compass that we have is listening to your gut.

02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:24.860
What did your gut tell you?

02:02:25.060 --> 02:02:28.380
This is, is that, was that originally the dream of being an actor?

02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:32.180
Yeah, for me, your parents support that at all.

02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:36.980
I had the advantage of having parents who were immigrants, so they didn't

02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:41.100
really know a lot about what you, you just made shit up.

02:02:41.140 --> 02:02:42.220
You just made shit up.

02:02:42.220 --> 02:02:45.740
Yeah, of course I'm studying and I'm skipping school to go do auditions and stuff.

02:02:46.060 --> 02:02:49.580
No, I, I just kind of feel like, you know, and I know it was different

02:02:49.580 --> 02:02:54.540
for my older siblings because my parents had just shown up in Canada.

02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:55.980
I was born like 10 years later.

02:02:56.500 --> 02:03:02.260
Um, uh, you can get away with some things and you can actually, you know,

02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:07.340
I think my parents, they wanted us to, they didn't have a whole lot to

02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:09.020
tell us about what to do.

02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:13.980
Um, they weren't going to do that with us cause they're in this brand new world

02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:21.620
and there's all these possibilities and, but there was a, a, there was something

02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:25.540
that they, I feel like they had to do, which was tell us to do what we love.

02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:27.060
If you love doing it, do it.

02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:31.140
And, um, I feel like that's really served me.

02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:35.940
And what I would tell young people is if you can find something you love and

02:03:35.980 --> 02:03:39.460
nowadays with the internet and finding other people that, you know, it's not

02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:42.900
like you need to find a lot of people anymore.

02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:45.220
You just need to find the people that dig what you dig.

02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:49.900
And if you can make a career out of doing something that you love, it's

02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:53.300
been said it's, it's a good thing.

02:03:53.420 --> 02:03:53.900
You know,

02:03:54.380 --> 02:04:00.060
how long did it take you to figure out that you really love, um, acting, you

02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:03.700
know, because sometimes you have a dream and then you meet the dream meets

02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:04.860
reality, right?

02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:05.340
Yeah.

02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:09.540
And then the reality might be much less pleasant to much darker than the dream.

02:04:09.620 --> 02:04:13.700
Well, the reality is less pleasant, you know, and, and there are things that

02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:18.100
happen, uh, during an experience of shooting something that, that you

02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:19.220
could take or leave, right?

02:04:19.580 --> 02:04:25.500
But the, the, you know, the, the part where you're on set and you've, you

02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:28.020
know, you've rehearsed for a minute or whatever, at least, you know, where

02:04:28.020 --> 02:04:30.900
you're supposed to stand and you know, all your lives show up, knowing

02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:34.900
everything, knowing what you're going to do and, uh, what you aim to do.

02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:40.660
And, um, those moments make it all worth it when you're, you know, not

02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:44.940
sound like a douchebag, but between act, you know, action and cut, that's

02:04:44.940 --> 02:04:52.380
the stuff that is, uh, that, that makes me, that has me continuing to do, do

02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:56.540
what I do, aside from the fact that it's like, I don't know how to do anything else.

02:04:56.540 --> 02:05:00.140
You think you'll ever do like a dramatic, like a, like a mob movie?

02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:00.860
Yeah.

02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:03.580
Like the one that the inside game I was just talking about, or this is

02:05:03.580 --> 02:05:06.420
another movie I just did a little while ago called American woman.

02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:07.220
That was very heavy.

02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:10.780
Um, and, uh, I love doing dramatic work.

02:05:10.820 --> 02:05:11.940
I love it.

02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:12.620
I love it.

02:05:12.780 --> 02:05:13.020
Yeah.

02:05:13.020 --> 02:05:14.980
And I played that in inside game.

02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:19.980
It was kind of a, you know, it was a, there was a mob element and, uh, the

02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:24.460
fellow was, well, you know, the stories here are there with regard to how deep,

02:05:24.700 --> 02:05:27.500
uh, into the, but well, he was a bookie.

02:05:27.500 --> 02:05:30.980
He was just running money, you know, doing, he was making a lot of money

02:05:30.980 --> 02:05:34.900
for a lot of people and he figured out how to, you know, cook it with this

02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:40.460
dude, um, who was an NBA ref and, and it's a very interesting documentary.

02:05:40.460 --> 02:05:44.700
The thing that they're just, uh, untold under the untold series, they cover it,

02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:50.140
but getting to play that guy, that was a, that was a, that was a gas for me.

02:05:50.140 --> 02:05:54.420
Cause he's like a, he was a, you know, there was a lot of unsavory stuff and

02:05:54.420 --> 02:05:58.860
he's definitely the guy, the character in the movie who is the wild card and, and,

02:05:58.900 --> 02:06:01.300
and you don't want to necessarily mess with him.

02:06:02.060 --> 02:06:07.140
And I got to this fellow who might, it's a real guy speaking to him.

02:06:07.180 --> 02:06:10.380
It was just bizarre to hear.

02:06:11.220 --> 02:06:14.420
Like I said to him, he was a little concerned about this and that, like,

02:06:14.420 --> 02:06:16.860
Hey, you know, you say whatever the fuck you want in your movie.

02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:18.860
I got my book and I got this other fucking deal.

02:06:19.180 --> 02:06:22.220
But he goes, you know, I didn't do this and I didn't do that.

02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:23.580
And I'm like, yeah, all right, I got you.

02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:25.820
And he goes, yeah, I'm telling you, like I did.

02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:26.900
I'm talking to you one on one.

02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:27.780
I did not do this.

02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:28.100
I did.

02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:28.460
Okay.

02:06:28.540 --> 02:06:30.980
I'm just fucking tell you, do whatever the fuck you want with your movie,

02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:31.780
but this is what's up.

02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:33.420
And I said, have you ever seen good fellows?

02:06:33.420 --> 02:06:34.740
He's like, yeah, I fucking love that movie.

02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:39.340
Cause he, like I said, he did some unsavory shit and I go, you remember

02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:44.220
the scene where, uh, where, you know, the guy, the neighbor, Lorraine

02:06:44.220 --> 02:06:48.220
Bracco's neighbor was, you know, made her uncomfortable and was touching on her.

02:06:48.220 --> 02:06:52.180
And she, she goes to Ray Liotta and he goes, where the fuck does this guy live?

02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:55.260
And then he go and remember, and he walks across the street and pistol whips

02:06:55.260 --> 02:06:58.020
the dude, you touch her again, you're dead.

02:06:58.220 --> 02:06:58.940
You hear me?

02:06:59.300 --> 02:06:59.700
Good scene.

02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:00.220
Don't shoot.

02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:01.500
Fucking great scene.

02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:03.380
He goes, I love that scene.

02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:04.380
I go, that's you.

02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:08.380
So you're doing shit that we know is terrible, but we love you.

02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:09.420
He goes, all right, I got it.

02:07:09.980 --> 02:07:11.500
And then I said, there's this one scene.

02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:15.660
I explained the scene to him where the, one of the mobsters, uh, tough

02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:17.900
guys was in the window of the car.

02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:22.780
And Jimmy, my character is very coked up at the time and he's hemorrhaging

02:07:22.780 --> 02:07:24.580
money here and there and making bad bets.

02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:25.700
Cause he's getting sloppy.

02:07:26.060 --> 02:07:28.940
And this guy wants to bug him about some Jets giants bet or something.

02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:31.180
I'm like telling you fucking asshole, don't fucking do it.

02:07:31.580 --> 02:07:33.180
He's like, yeah, well he's a fucking giants.

02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:37.380
And in the scene, Jimmy, my character grabs him by the, by the lapels

02:07:37.380 --> 02:07:41.540
and just smashes his face against the, the, the roof of the car.

02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:46.220
And I, I say this to, to Jimmy and he goes, Oh yeah, I would've done that.

02:07:46.260 --> 02:07:47.500
That's not a fucking big deal.

02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:50.020
I wonder also the interaction.

02:07:50.020 --> 02:07:54.180
I wonder what the filming of, um, probably my favorite gambling

02:07:54.180 --> 02:07:58.820
movie is, um, casino with, with Joe Pesci and De Niro.

02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:01.420
Like when they're out in the desert, you're yelling at each other.

02:08:01.460 --> 02:08:02.900
I wonder how many takes that is.

02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:06.980
Like, cause they, I don't, I don't know how scripted that is.

02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:10.860
I mean, it probably is a little bit, but like, I don't, I don't think you can

02:08:10.860 --> 02:08:14.100
script the performance that Joe Pesci does.

02:08:14.340 --> 02:08:15.980
Don't make a fuck out of me, ace.

02:08:16.020 --> 02:08:16.540
Yeah.

02:08:16.980 --> 02:08:19.900
Like I fucking brought you here.

02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:20.220
Yeah.

02:08:20.740 --> 02:08:25.180
He's just like pointing at the, that, that, that energy and they're standing

02:08:25.180 --> 02:08:29.860
up there and their friendship is De Niro's like, like that, that whole thing.

02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:33.540
And then in the pet, yeah, like that, that energy, what is that?

02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:36.940
I mean, they must, they somehow find it together.

02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:40.460
You could tell me that that was one take and I'd believe you could tell me that

02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:44.820
that was seven takes and I would believe you all the takes had that energy.

02:08:45.180 --> 02:08:46.540
Like they were playing with it, right?

02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:48.620
They were, they're, they're playing with that.

02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:50.340
The, the, this, yeah.

02:08:50.340 --> 02:08:55.820
I mean, they, they took on a real personality in those scenes

02:08:55.820 --> 02:08:57.020
and really carried them forward.

02:08:57.020 --> 02:08:58.860
I mean, it's just a brilliant, brilliant performance.

02:08:58.860 --> 02:09:02.980
It doesn't get like comedies, like mob movies probably don't get enough credit

02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:08.020
either because it's seen as like mob movies don't get enough credit in the Oscars.

02:09:08.020 --> 02:09:09.940
I mean, like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:11.340
Cause it seems like a trope.

02:09:11.340 --> 02:09:14.900
It's like given a Western, it's gotta be a hell of a Western or whatever.

02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:16.500
Cause it's like an old Hollywood trope.

02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:17.340
Yeah.

02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:19.700
No, I, that scene is so great.

02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:24.260
Cause they're never there at the height of their friendship in a way.

02:09:24.260 --> 02:09:28.540
And they're also pretty much about to let go of it and become enemies.

02:09:28.740 --> 02:09:32.140
And both things are happening at the same time and, and Pesci

02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:33.700
drives them out to the desert.

02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:38.220
And if I remember correctly, the Nero's character, eighth ace

02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:43.740
Rothstein or Rothschild, he says, I, I gave myself 50, 50, whether I'm coming back.

02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:44.140
Yeah.

02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:45.140
It's such a good scene.

02:09:45.180 --> 02:09:50.740
It was a, usually my prospects of coming back from the desert would be 90 to 10

02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:54.140
or something like that, but now it's the, this time I wasn't sure.

02:09:54.140 --> 02:09:56.220
And there's the car driving really fast.

02:09:56.580 --> 02:09:59.780
And then Joe Pesci is like, you mother fucker, you like, or whatever he was

02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:04.300
doing, a Jew, like of course there's antisemitism or whatever, or not between

02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:07.860
friends, who gives a shit, all that kind of stuff.

02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:08.500
Yeah.

02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:10.580
I mean, brilliant, brilliant performances.

02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:14.060
So yeah, I can understand why you love the art and putting it all out there.

02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:15.540
And it's fun.

02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:15.940
It's fun.

02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:16.940
And it's still fun.

02:10:16.980 --> 02:10:19.020
It's still crazy fun.

02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:25.580
If I go a while without getting a gig, you know, if I go a minute, then I end

02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:31.820
up and I work on something, I'm like, it is, it's like, oh, I've been thirsty

02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:37.300
for this, like I actually am really so happy, even if it's something where it's

02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:42.660
like, you know, the, the, the things where this was a pain in the ass and that or

02:10:42.660 --> 02:10:45.700
whatever, or you're on the road doing something and you know, anything,

02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:48.620
whatever, you lost your luggage or whatever the heck you've got going on in

02:10:48.620 --> 02:10:53.340
your day to day life, uh, that everyone brings, uh, to work and tries to let go

02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:57.140
once we're doing the scene, oh man, it's the best.

02:10:57.260 --> 02:11:02.380
But, you know, that said, uh, you're a great actor, but I just think I speak

02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:07.540
for a lot of people that you're also, there's a charisma to you that's great

02:11:07.540 --> 02:11:13.140
to reveal in raw form in different podcasts in dudes, the 10 minute pod,

02:11:13.180 --> 02:11:18.220
just as a guest in podcasts, it's always really fun to watch you the way you have

02:11:18.260 --> 02:11:23.140
fun the way you think, uh, the raw, the raw will sassle, which is a nice

02:11:23.380 --> 02:11:25.580
compliment to your kind of acting.

02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:26.860
That's really sweet.

02:11:26.940 --> 02:11:27.300
Yeah.

02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:27.780
Cheers.

02:11:27.860 --> 02:11:33.060
Well, you know, look, you said, uh, you know, uh, you're making that face.

02:11:33.180 --> 02:11:33.980
I'm making that face.

02:11:33.980 --> 02:11:35.260
I'm making that after the take face.

02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:38.100
No, I love doing stuff off the cuff.

02:11:38.100 --> 02:11:43.180
That's kind of you to say, and I dig, I really do dig doing stuff in front of an

02:11:43.180 --> 02:11:48.460
audience because I love seeing, I don't give it to myself very often.

02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:51.500
If I'm doing, even if I'm, you know, I've done a bunch of multi-camera

02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:55.060
sitcoms and stuff, mad TV was shot in front of a live studio audience.

02:11:55.220 --> 02:11:56.260
You like that energy?

02:11:56.420 --> 02:11:58.660
I love it, but I can only hear them.

02:11:58.700 --> 02:12:02.740
You can't see them because of the lights, like it is in a lot of performances.

02:12:02.740 --> 02:12:07.060
And I would imagine with standup, it's, you know, you see the first couple of

02:12:07.060 --> 02:12:12.820
rows, um, I've done, I do this character that does stand up and I used to take

02:12:12.820 --> 02:12:16.020
him out and do things with them and do a little bits here and there.

02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:18.420
I haven't done it in like four or five years.

02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:21.700
I think the Bobby say that character opened up for Bobby.

02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:22.180
Yeah.

02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:24.900
But he said, I have to do it as myself too.

02:12:25.260 --> 02:12:27.940
I think in that podcast, he's like, okay, you're going to come with me

02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:30.980
and open for me in Brea, but you have to do it as yourself.

02:12:31.060 --> 02:12:32.140
Did that ever happen?

02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:32.820
It did.

02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:38.220
And I did the character, uh, you know, who's a character I came up with on

02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:40.460
10 minute podcast, he's just this comedian, right?

02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:42.420
He calls himself an open mic veteran.

02:12:42.940 --> 02:12:44.420
You know, he's been doing open mics forever.

02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:49.060
And so I did it at opening up for Bobby and he's like, you have

02:12:49.060 --> 02:12:50.540
to do some of it as yourself.

02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:53.460
So I just kind of did this bit where I would do some of his jokes.

02:12:53.740 --> 02:12:56.180
And then I would take Lee Leon silly.

02:12:56.180 --> 02:12:59.820
I got a fucking wig on and I take the wig off and I go, and as

02:12:59.820 --> 02:13:01.300
myself, I start explaining it.

02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:02.540
Hello, my name is Will.

02:13:02.820 --> 02:13:07.340
See the reason that it's funny is because, uh, Arnold Schwarzenegger

02:13:07.380 --> 02:13:11.220
is always he's in these movies and he's got the thick Austrian accent, but

02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:13.180
he's like, yeah, my name is Ben Williams.

02:13:13.180 --> 02:13:15.780
I'm a, I'm a cop from Colorado.

02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:16.420
No, you're not.

02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:20.100
Uh, and it doesn't make sense as the comedian character that I'm doing.

02:13:20.100 --> 02:13:22.620
Cause that character doesn't do impersonations.

02:13:22.980 --> 02:13:23.420
Okay.

02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:24.540
Carrying on.

02:13:24.620 --> 02:13:27.500
And then I put the wig back on and go back into this dumb thing.

02:13:27.980 --> 02:13:30.980
And, uh, I don't think it was very good, but Bobby required it

02:13:30.980 --> 02:13:32.700
in order for me to open for him.

02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:33.940
He's like, you're not fucking doing it.

02:13:33.980 --> 02:13:36.900
So I'm not going to get up on stage and not do, we agreed.

02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:37.340
I'll do it.

02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:42.820
But, um, having been up there just in, you know, whatever, I've done it

02:13:42.820 --> 02:13:45.460
like a dozen fucking times or not a bunch of times, right?

02:13:45.460 --> 02:13:46.020
Like nothing.

02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:50.060
Uh, and you know, these comedians that go up every night, sometimes

02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:57.140
two times a night, it's, I do, I will say, I love performing in front of

02:13:57.140 --> 02:14:03.100
people when I get the chance, but it's, it's, uh, it's a specific thing that,

02:14:03.220 --> 02:14:07.940
that, uh, that I, I just, I just, I gotta go back to this.

02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:09.820
It's like the providing value.

02:14:10.420 --> 02:14:13.300
You know, I think great standups are fucking incredible.

02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:17.620
I'll, I'll go, you know, when I've gone and watch standup, you know, there's

02:14:17.620 --> 02:14:20.540
your friend you're going to see, but then there's this other person

02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:21.620
who really speaks to you.

02:14:21.700 --> 02:14:22.340
You know what I mean?

02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:31.020
And if you like one comedian a night, that's a lot because a, a, a comedy

02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:35.420
club is like a fucking crazy restaurant where there's no menu.

02:14:36.140 --> 02:14:37.700
And it's like, what would you love?

02:14:37.740 --> 02:14:39.220
It's there's nothing else like that.

02:14:39.220 --> 02:14:42.300
There's like, you don't go to like a, like music place.

02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:43.220
What do we got here?

02:14:43.460 --> 02:14:45.860
We got Christian metal and there's some world music.

02:14:45.860 --> 02:14:49.660
And then there's a reggae thing and it's all rammed in together.

02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:51.540
Or you don't go to a restaurant.

02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:53.180
I'd love a nice steak.

02:14:53.420 --> 02:14:53.860
Cool.

02:14:54.060 --> 02:14:55.700
First, here's a bowl of fruit loops.

02:14:55.900 --> 02:14:59.740
And then then we got you a crudite and then this is our sushi tower.

02:15:00.100 --> 02:15:00.900
Well, what about the steak?

02:15:00.900 --> 02:15:03.020
Oh, the steak's coming and then blah, blah, blah.

02:15:03.180 --> 02:15:04.460
Oh no, the steak got bumped.

02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:07.940
So there's no steak, but here's a fucking shitty store-bought cheesecake.

02:15:08.380 --> 02:15:13.340
You know, and that's what comedians are up against when they go into a place.

02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:17.060
It's like, I don't pair well with the poached salmon, you know, I'm chicken

02:15:17.060 --> 02:15:19.580
fingers, I already, I already am chicken fingers.

02:15:20.100 --> 02:15:24.980
So, you know, these great comedians that are able to go up on a night where

02:15:25.060 --> 02:15:28.820
poached salmon goes up and then it's like, fuck, I'm, you are also spicy.

02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:29.980
I got some kick to me.

02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:35.660
For me, even going to open mics, it could be a wonderful escape.

02:15:36.020 --> 02:15:36.420
Yeah.

02:15:36.820 --> 02:15:41.180
I mean, just laughing, laughing together with others can make you, I don't know.

02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:42.180
It just feels really good.

02:15:42.460 --> 02:15:46.380
When we've done like, you know, like I, and I hope to do it with doodsy, but

02:15:46.420 --> 02:15:51.180
like live podcasts are fun in front of groups of people and, you know, you talk

02:15:51.180 --> 02:15:55.620
to them afterwards and take some pictures and man, they are, they forgot what the

02:15:55.620 --> 02:15:59.660
fuck they got going on and a lot of them got to go back to work the next day.

02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:01.340
It's a Wednesday or Thursday, you know?

02:16:01.860 --> 02:16:03.460
No, it's, it's, it's a lot of value.

02:16:03.460 --> 02:16:06.900
I'm fortunate enough to be busy doing my own bullshit.

02:16:07.180 --> 02:16:08.340
What's the meaning of life?

02:16:08.420 --> 02:16:09.060
What's that song?

02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:12.820
Uh, what is the, why, why are we here?

02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:18.140
Why, why, why was it, uh, the meaning of life wasn't, didn't they explain

02:16:18.140 --> 02:16:19.340
it at the end of meaning of life?

02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:23.420
I think it was Michael Palin that said, uh, try to get a walk in, uh, be nice

02:16:23.420 --> 02:16:25.180
to neighbors, uh, eating a fiber.

02:16:25.420 --> 02:16:27.540
Wasn't that the fiber fiber is part of it.

02:16:27.860 --> 02:16:28.020
Yeah.

02:16:28.020 --> 02:16:29.420
I think it's, I think it's nutrition.

02:16:29.580 --> 02:16:33.260
Have a bowl of bran in the morning and, uh, don't take yourself too seriously.

02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:35.460
Yeah.

02:16:35.460 --> 02:16:36.860
Well, no one gets out alive.

02:16:36.860 --> 02:16:38.580
I think is the Herman Hessey.

02:16:38.580 --> 02:16:39.580
One of my favorite writers.

02:16:39.580 --> 02:16:40.740
He's a Nobel prize winner.

02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:46.620
Um, in, in, in a book called Steppenwolf says, learn what is to be taken

02:16:46.620 --> 02:16:48.180
seriously and laugh at the rest.

02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:49.380
Oh, that's awesome.

02:16:49.780 --> 02:16:51.820
What's the percentage distribution on that?

02:16:51.820 --> 02:16:53.940
So how much of life should you take seriously?

02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:57.100
And then how much do you just laugh at?

02:16:57.500 --> 02:16:58.060
Oh man.

02:16:58.220 --> 02:17:00.340
If you can laugh at everything, you're, you're winning.

02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:00.820
Yeah.

02:17:00.860 --> 02:17:02.620
Uh, but that's almost impossible.

02:17:03.140 --> 02:17:06.940
I think that there's, there's, uh, and also could be

02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:08.380
quite irresponsible to do that.

02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:10.380
I take things.

02:17:10.420 --> 02:17:12.900
I take a lot of things way too seriously.

02:17:13.620 --> 02:17:16.380
I know that, uh, I do.

02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:16.820
I do.

02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:17.340
I really do.

02:17:17.340 --> 02:17:21.220
People will be in part surprised by that, but I think that radiates from you.

02:17:21.420 --> 02:17:21.740
Really?

02:17:22.180 --> 02:17:22.780
Yeah, I do.

02:17:22.780 --> 02:17:26.460
I do take things way too fucking seriously sometimes, but, um,

02:17:26.740 --> 02:17:29.220
and then you got to loosen the neck up.

02:17:29.740 --> 02:17:32.820
But, uh, no, I think that's, that's really good.

02:17:32.940 --> 02:17:34.300
That's, that's really good stuff.

02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:39.260
It, I don't know what the percentage is to have a good life or, or, or,

02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:46.100
or a happy, healthy life, but you know, for me, the meaning of life is getting

02:17:46.100 --> 02:17:47.940
to live it as long as you hope to.

02:17:48.300 --> 02:17:49.060
That's nice.

02:17:49.540 --> 02:17:55.860
And, um, and when you're, when you lose someone or, or if perhaps you're

02:17:55.860 --> 02:18:00.260
faced with your own mortality, I think that puts that into perspective.

02:18:00.420 --> 02:18:06.580
And, uh, but I, you know, get lots of fiber, get lots of fiber.

02:18:07.220 --> 02:18:08.940
Uh, be nice to everybody.

02:18:09.620 --> 02:18:13.460
And, uh, yeah, don't take things too seriously as a good, it's a good one.

02:18:13.940 --> 02:18:20.940
Our minds are fucking big, weird, big, it's a big, weird, shitty fucking

02:18:20.940 --> 02:18:24.820
bucket of shit that's trying to get you to think horrible shit about

02:18:24.820 --> 02:18:28.060
yourself all the time, shitty bucket of shit, shitty bucket of shit.

02:18:28.060 --> 02:18:30.980
I think there's a book I never read, but I read the title and it's

02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:35.180
a good words to live by, which is, uh, don't sweat the small stuff.

02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:36.780
And it's all small stuff.

02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:38.500
That's another way.

02:18:38.780 --> 02:18:39.420
Was that Dr.

02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:40.500
Phil wasn't Dr.

02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:46.140
Phil was, I don't know, but I think the conclusion is also has fiber as part of it.

02:18:46.220 --> 02:18:48.300
I think that all ties it together.

02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:53.100
And in the end, of course, just put love out there in the world.

02:18:53.100 --> 02:18:54.820
I think that's a pretty good way to go.

02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:57.060
What would you say is the meaning of life?

02:18:57.420 --> 02:18:58.340
Put love out in the world.

02:18:58.820 --> 02:18:59.460
I would say love.

02:18:59.460 --> 02:18:59.860
Yeah.

02:18:59.860 --> 02:19:00.300
Yeah.

02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:00.820
Yeah.

02:19:00.980 --> 02:19:03.820
It's a, it's a long conversation on what that really means.

02:19:04.260 --> 02:19:06.500
Uh, but I'm sure robots are involved.

02:19:06.620 --> 02:19:06.940
Yeah.

02:19:07.340 --> 02:19:11.780
Well, let me tell you, I feel a little safer knowing that someone who has a

02:19:11.780 --> 02:19:19.940
hand in bringing these robots to the masses as you do has that opinion of,

02:19:19.940 --> 02:19:21.220
of love and how important it is.

02:19:21.220 --> 02:19:22.220
I think that's great.

02:19:22.340 --> 02:19:27.900
Because, uh, otherwise it's going to be that, uh, fucking scene from T2 where,

02:19:28.300 --> 02:19:32.620
uh, Linda Hamilton's holding onto the, the, the fence and getting all of her

02:19:32.620 --> 02:19:37.380
flesh blown off of her skeleton before the rest of hers is wiped away.

02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:38.980
Cause the Skynet shit.

02:19:39.500 --> 02:19:41.420
Anyway, I'm just terrified of dudesy all the time.

02:19:41.420 --> 02:19:42.620
That's why I think that they will.

02:19:42.900 --> 02:19:45.820
Dudesy in the wrong hands can do a lot of damage.

02:19:45.860 --> 02:19:49.300
That's why Chad and I need to do our best to control it.

02:19:49.300 --> 02:19:51.540
You need to travel back in time and murder Chad.

02:19:52.980 --> 02:19:56.980
I think that's the only way it's been said.

02:19:57.140 --> 02:19:58.940
I don't know why you need to travel back in time.

02:19:58.940 --> 02:20:04.100
But you could just, uh, murder him today, but I'll be very suspicious.

02:20:04.180 --> 02:20:08.980
My nefarious plans for Chad involve going back to tomorrow and planning for

02:20:08.980 --> 02:20:12.860
yesterday and then, and hopefully dudesy will give me the answer there with what,

02:20:13.220 --> 02:20:15.540
what it is to do with, uh, Chad's frozen body.

02:20:15.820 --> 02:20:19.940
If I got to drive it out to, if I got to take my, uh, you know, if I got to get,

02:20:19.980 --> 02:20:24.540
get ahold of a, like, uh, one of those, uh, Tesla mom vans and, uh, shove my

02:20:24.540 --> 02:20:29.220
garage freezer in it and plug it in and shove Chad in there and drive out to

02:20:29.220 --> 02:20:33.020
Arizona and deliver him under a mountain or wherever the fuck this place is.

02:20:33.460 --> 02:20:34.780
And say, here's this dog tag.

02:20:35.060 --> 02:20:35.860
What does this get me?

02:20:36.380 --> 02:20:38.700
And then I'm like, ah, it's going to be a 300 bucks.

02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:40.420
Do you have, uh, do you take Amix?

02:20:40.420 --> 02:20:40.700
No.

02:20:41.020 --> 02:20:42.620
And I'd be like, ah, shit.

02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:46.020
And I'll just dump them somewhere, breaking bad stuff.

02:20:47.020 --> 02:20:50.500
Well, I would like to thank you and the, what is it?

02:20:50.540 --> 02:20:56.580
The Canadian international agency apparel for national apparel.

02:20:56.580 --> 02:20:59.660
I can't wait, uh, for the sneakers from dudesy.

02:20:59.700 --> 02:21:05.740
I can't wait for all the, uh, all the, uh, the podcasts, uh, that AI can,

02:21:05.740 --> 02:21:07.540
and all the trouble it can get you in.

02:21:07.540 --> 02:21:09.060
So I'm a huge fan of yours.

02:21:09.100 --> 02:21:11.100
It's a huge honor that you would talk with me today.

02:21:11.340 --> 02:21:13.100
Well, this has been amazing.

02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:13.780
Cheers pal.

02:21:13.780 --> 02:21:14.380
Likewise.

02:21:14.420 --> 02:21:15.580
And I'm happy to be here, man.

02:21:15.740 --> 02:21:16.100
Cheers.

02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:17.300
Bam.

02:21:17.860 --> 02:21:18.820
Oh, that was three hours.

02:21:19.420 --> 02:21:20.340
Holy fuck.

02:21:20.380 --> 02:21:20.900
What?

02:21:21.900 --> 02:21:25.940
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Will Sasso to support this podcast.

02:21:25.980 --> 02:21:28.340
Please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:21:28.860 --> 02:21:32.580
And now let me leave you with some words from John Candy, one

02:21:32.580 --> 02:21:34.260
of Will's favorite actors.

02:21:35.540 --> 02:21:38.980
I think I may have become an actor to hide from myself.

02:21:39.860 --> 02:21:41.940
You can escape into a character.

02:21:43.180 --> 02:21:45.060
Thank you for listening and hope to see you.

02:21:45.580 --> 02:21:46.100
Next time.
