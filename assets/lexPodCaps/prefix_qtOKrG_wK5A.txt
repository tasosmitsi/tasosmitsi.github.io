00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
So contempt is criticism on steroids.

00:02.400 --> 00:07.360
This is what John Gottman calls sulfuric acid for love.

00:07.360 --> 00:10.720
Nothing will erode a relationship quicker than contempt.

00:10.720 --> 00:13.240
Contempt is when you are looking at your partner

00:13.240 --> 00:15.120
from a superior position.

00:15.120 --> 00:18.860
So you are eye rolling, you are name calling,

00:20.120 --> 00:23.740
there's a mockery, mocking, even physical mockery,

00:23.740 --> 00:26.440
imitating them, imitating their voice.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.600
Contempt is meant to just take the legs out

00:28.600 --> 00:31.820
from your partner, make them feel pathetic, ridiculous.

00:32.700 --> 00:37.700
And it can be abusive, but most people have engaged

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
in contempt at some point in their relationship,

00:40.000 --> 00:42.280
lower level would be sort of the eye rolling,

00:42.280 --> 00:44.660
but that is the biggest predictor of a split.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.600
The following is a conversation with Shannon Curry,

00:49.600 --> 00:51.600
a clinical and forensic psychologist

00:51.600 --> 00:53.640
who conducts research, therapy,

00:53.640 --> 00:56.580
and psychological evaluations pertaining to trauma,

00:56.620 --> 00:59.260
violence, and relationships.

00:59.260 --> 01:03.100
She received worldwide attention in April of last year

01:03.100 --> 01:05.420
by giving a lengthy televised testimony

01:05.420 --> 01:08.820
on her psychological evaluation of Amber Heard

01:08.820 --> 01:11.660
during the Johnny Depp Amber Heard trial.

01:11.660 --> 01:14.900
I found her testimony to be an eloquent description

01:14.900 --> 01:16.820
of complex psychological concepts

01:16.820 --> 01:19.100
and evaluations procedures.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.840
So I reached out for a chat.

01:21.840 --> 01:24.740
In person, she was brilliant, funny, thoughtful,

01:24.740 --> 01:26.420
and truly kind.

01:27.260 --> 01:29.020
I really, really enjoyed this conversation.

01:29.020 --> 01:30.940
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:30.940 --> 01:32.980
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:32.980 --> 01:34.180
in the description.

01:34.180 --> 01:37.460
And now, to your friends, here's Shannon Curry.

01:38.540 --> 01:41.380
Charles Bukowski said that love is a fog

01:41.380 --> 01:43.860
that burns away with the first daylight of reality.

01:43.860 --> 01:45.240
I love that quote.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.940
Do you think romantic love fades away in this way?

01:47.940 --> 01:49.540
Bukowski.

01:49.540 --> 01:50.820
Does it have to fade?

01:50.820 --> 01:53.220
The truth is that you have all of these chemicals

01:53.220 --> 01:54.340
pumping through your body.

01:54.340 --> 01:55.900
You're essentially high on heroin

01:55.900 --> 01:57.700
in the beginning of a romance.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.940
And you're going to have these rose-colored glasses on.

02:00.940 --> 02:03.700
Everything your partner does is magical.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.200
But really, it's the novelty.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.580
It's just like going on a vacation.

02:06.580 --> 02:07.780
You're fully present.

02:07.780 --> 02:10.480
You're just attuned to the magic of another human being,

02:10.480 --> 02:11.820
moment to moment.

02:11.820 --> 02:13.780
And then on top of that,

02:13.780 --> 02:15.200
you're just flooded with dopamine.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.700
So you're high on drugs.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.600
And we can't go on like that.

02:18.600 --> 02:22.100
You will die if you are using these kinds of chemicals

02:22.100 --> 02:24.020
all of the time, all day long.

02:24.580 --> 02:28.500
So eventually, our bodies are sort of made to dial it down.

02:28.500 --> 02:29.340
We've made it.

02:29.340 --> 02:31.700
I mean, we're evolutionary beings.

02:31.700 --> 02:34.820
We are doing the same thing we did 200,000 years ago

02:34.820 --> 02:36.380
to find a mate, procreate,

02:36.380 --> 02:37.640
spend enough time with each other

02:37.640 --> 02:41.060
that we have sex a whole bunch of times and make babies.

02:41.060 --> 02:42.980
Now we've changed the rules of the game.

02:42.980 --> 02:46.680
We're living almost till we're 100 years old in some cases.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.820
We're making these marriage commitments

02:48.820 --> 02:51.900
that last half a century.

02:51.900 --> 02:56.780
And we're expecting it to be all because of love.

02:56.780 --> 02:59.340
And we're signing these contracts based on how we feel

02:59.340 --> 03:00.460
when we're high on these drugs.

03:00.460 --> 03:04.220
So the reality is we know based on the,

03:04.220 --> 03:05.580
and I'm also talking about

03:05.580 --> 03:07.420
certain Western civilizations here,

03:07.420 --> 03:10.460
because as you know, there are arranged marriages.

03:10.460 --> 03:12.800
And a lot of times those marriages,

03:12.800 --> 03:14.460
if we're looking at longevity,

03:14.460 --> 03:16.660
are actually way more satisfied

03:16.660 --> 03:18.620
than people who are marrying for love,

03:18.620 --> 03:20.840
which logically makes sense.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.680
If you're making a decision based on a feeling

03:23.680 --> 03:26.080
that is basically based on endorphins

03:26.080 --> 03:28.680
and dopamine and oxytocin,

03:28.680 --> 03:31.940
I wouldn't sign a contract just because of a feeling,

03:31.940 --> 03:33.880
necessarily, you know, for 50 years.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.320
Whereas an arranged marriage,

03:35.320 --> 03:37.680
if you have your elders kind of deciding for you

03:37.680 --> 03:39.960
that this partner has a bunch of traits

03:39.960 --> 03:43.560
that you're going to appreciate more and more over time,

03:43.560 --> 03:45.560
I think there's some wisdom there.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.560
So you don't think that feeling could be a foundation

03:47.560 --> 03:50.040
for a 50 year relationship?

03:50.040 --> 03:52.760
Well, I don't think that specific feeling

03:52.760 --> 03:55.480
you're having based on drugs

03:55.480 --> 03:58.560
is going to be the same feeling you have

03:58.560 --> 04:00.800
20, 30, 40 years down the line.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.000
If you're gonna wake up and turn to your partner

04:03.000 --> 04:05.120
when you're 70 and think,

04:05.120 --> 04:08.600
oh my God, I'm so glad you're hot, you are so hot,

04:08.600 --> 04:10.680
then sure, marry for hotness.

04:10.680 --> 04:13.680
But if you've been through life a little bit,

04:13.680 --> 04:16.800
and I think most people who are on a second marriage know,

04:16.800 --> 04:18.320
shit happens in life.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.840
It is hard, you're gonna have, you know,

04:20.840 --> 04:22.560
maybe a kid with special needs,

04:22.560 --> 04:25.520
or your dad gets dementia,

04:25.520 --> 04:28.160
or you get diagnosed with cancer.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.800
Who are you gonna wanna come home to?

04:30.800 --> 04:34.420
Who is going to hold you when you are sobbing on the floor

04:34.420 --> 04:36.560
and tell you we're gonna get through it together?

04:36.560 --> 04:39.720
Who's gonna know the names of your kid's special ed teacher

04:39.720 --> 04:42.340
and the process for getting a 504 plan?

04:42.340 --> 04:43.960
Or is it gonna be you on your own?

04:43.960 --> 04:45.160
I think those things matter.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.320
But doesn't that hotness,

04:47.320 --> 04:49.960
don't those drugs kind of solidify

04:49.960 --> 04:52.580
into a deeper appreciation of the other person,

04:53.720 --> 04:56.280
into something you could call beauty?

04:56.280 --> 04:57.760
Yes.

04:57.760 --> 04:58.600
They can.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.800
But isn't that the same thing?

05:00.800 --> 05:03.320
When you notice the beauty of another human being,

05:03.320 --> 05:05.720
aren't you high on drugs still?

05:05.720 --> 05:08.200
You're making it sound like there's like a brief

05:08.200 --> 05:12.340
rock star period of going on heroin and then it's over,

05:12.340 --> 05:14.680
but like, can't you be on heroin your whole life?

05:14.680 --> 05:15.720
I have some good news.

05:15.720 --> 05:16.800
Michael Kudowsky. I have some good news.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.960
That was something, I think one of the reasons

05:18.960 --> 05:21.200
I got into studying relationships

05:21.200 --> 05:23.200
was because I wanted that, right?

05:23.200 --> 05:25.640
So I'm a scientist, but I also love art

05:25.640 --> 05:27.840
and I love writing and I love literature.

05:27.840 --> 05:31.640
I wanted to know that true love could be real,

05:31.640 --> 05:36.160
but as a scientist, I am cynical, I just need some data.

05:36.160 --> 05:39.240
And so I practice a type of therapy

05:39.240 --> 05:40.560
called the Gottman method.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.920
And I love that because it tends to be,

05:43.920 --> 05:47.040
well, it is one of the most evidence-based therapies

05:47.040 --> 05:50.080
we have based on John and Julie Gottman,

05:50.080 --> 05:53.120
two psychologists who have been researching relationships

05:53.120 --> 05:55.120
for now about 50 years.

05:55.120 --> 05:58.320
And this therapy happens to be for couples.

05:58.320 --> 06:03.320
They found that you absolutely can make longevity work

06:03.480 --> 06:04.360
in a relationship.

06:04.360 --> 06:07.760
You can build, you are not just settling for companionship,

06:07.760 --> 06:10.320
but you can have passion and intimacy

06:10.320 --> 06:12.740
and growing love and appreciation.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.940
But there is a blueprint, a set of skills

06:14.940 --> 06:15.980
that we were never given.

06:15.980 --> 06:17.620
We're not taught it in school.

06:17.620 --> 06:18.980
We changed the rules of the game

06:18.980 --> 06:21.300
and we haven't learned the rules yet.

06:21.300 --> 06:24.100
And the Gottman method for couples therapy

06:24.100 --> 06:25.860
kind of gives you a few guidelines,

06:25.860 --> 06:28.140
the rules for longevity in a relationship.

06:28.140 --> 06:31.660
Yeah, they did a beautiful job at taking these findings

06:31.660 --> 06:36.160
they had through decades of research, quantifying it,

06:36.160 --> 06:39.940
and then codifying it into a therapy method.

06:39.940 --> 06:41.380
It's really skills-based.

06:41.940 --> 06:43.540
I tell couples when they're starting out with me

06:43.540 --> 06:46.160
that they're essentially gonna be starting a class.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.420
So what's the five-to-one golden rule?

06:48.420 --> 06:51.740
What I read is there's a kind of balance you can achieve

06:51.740 --> 06:56.740
of how many interactions you have in a relationship

06:56.740 --> 06:58.500
that are positive versus negative.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.680
And I think that's what the five-to-one means.

07:00.680 --> 07:05.440
But basically, there should be kind of an empirical,

07:05.440 --> 07:07.860
like if you just look back over a month,

07:07.860 --> 07:09.500
how many of the interactions were positive,

07:09.500 --> 07:10.860
how many were negative? Or the day.

07:10.860 --> 07:12.580
Look at the day, right?

07:12.580 --> 07:17.220
So the idea of this ratio, well, it's not an idea.

07:17.220 --> 07:18.180
It was a finding.

07:18.180 --> 07:21.460
It is a research finding that the Gottmans got

07:21.460 --> 07:24.020
after looking at thousands of couples

07:24.020 --> 07:27.800
and codifying these interactions that they were observing.

07:27.800 --> 07:32.800
Couples that tend to be satisfied in their relationships

07:33.060 --> 07:35.920
that are happier, they have better health, et cetera,

07:35.960 --> 07:40.880
they are having approximately five positive interactions

07:40.880 --> 07:42.480
to each negative.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.600
And I wanna be clear about what I'm defining

07:44.600 --> 07:46.000
as positive and negative here.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.080
So this doesn't necessarily mean that you're,

07:49.080 --> 07:51.700
these don't need to be big sweeping romantic gestures,

07:51.700 --> 07:53.920
buying flowers, having sex.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.040
These are things like paying attention

07:56.040 --> 07:59.280
to what we call your partner's bids.

07:59.280 --> 08:03.100
We make these bids for affection, for connection,

08:03.100 --> 08:04.800
all the time in our relationships,

08:04.800 --> 08:05.880
not just with our partners,

08:05.880 --> 08:08.040
but with our friends, our coworkers.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.200
And we may not even know what our style of bid is,

08:10.200 --> 08:11.500
but if you see them on a sheet,

08:11.500 --> 08:13.440
you can pretty quickly identify them.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.120
Bids could be wanting to show your partner,

08:16.120 --> 08:19.040
tell your partner something and have them be proud of you.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.120
It could be wanting to go buy groceries

08:22.120 --> 08:23.680
with your partner, doing things together.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.960
Hey, you wanna come with me?

08:24.960 --> 08:28.640
It could be telling a joke and hoping that your wife

08:28.640 --> 08:32.620
looks up from her email on the computer and acknowledges it.

08:32.620 --> 08:35.260
If she laughs, then you've got a positive.

08:35.260 --> 08:39.020
But if I don't even look up, that's a negative, right?

08:39.020 --> 08:40.620
So it's not necessarily that I'm calling

08:40.620 --> 08:42.100
my husband an asshole.

08:42.100 --> 08:44.420
It's just, am I connecting with him?

08:44.420 --> 08:48.420
Am I meeting those bids for connection and vice versa?

08:48.420 --> 08:49.980
But do those also give you a guide

08:49.980 --> 08:51.280
of how you should behave?

08:52.180 --> 08:54.300
Well, I think what's really important

08:54.300 --> 08:56.620
is actually asking your partner

08:56.620 --> 08:59.220
or paying attention to what your partner's bids are

08:59.220 --> 09:02.100
because what matters to tie my husband

09:02.100 --> 09:03.340
may not matter to you.

09:03.340 --> 09:06.260
For instance, I mean, tie his bar is so low with me,

09:06.260 --> 09:08.300
I thank God for him.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.780
What defines a positive interaction?

09:09.780 --> 09:13.420
Right, like he just wants me to ask him

09:13.420 --> 09:17.180
if he wants a water when I get up to get myself one.

09:17.180 --> 09:19.960
Just be a basic, decent, considerate person

09:19.960 --> 09:22.060
is all he asks of me.

09:22.060 --> 09:25.020
Whereas mine might be sort of like stay up later with me,

09:25.020 --> 09:28.380
watch a show, go to bed at the same time as me

09:28.380 --> 09:31.260
or know about the people in my life,

09:31.260 --> 09:32.660
that sort of a thing.

09:32.660 --> 09:34.700
I should highlight this and hopefully it's okay

09:34.700 --> 09:36.620
that you were running a little bit late

09:36.620 --> 09:40.700
and you sent me this text which people do really rarely

09:40.700 --> 09:44.140
and there's a subtle act of kindness within that text.

09:44.140 --> 09:49.140
So the text you sent was that I just decreased

09:49.260 --> 09:51.140
the amount of stress in your life or something like this

09:51.140 --> 09:52.540
by saying it's cool.

09:52.540 --> 09:56.220
But that means that you're signaling

09:56.220 --> 09:59.820
that you were stressed because you care enough

09:59.820 --> 10:01.660
to be there on time.

10:01.660 --> 10:03.540
And that was like, that made me feel really special.

10:03.540 --> 10:08.540
I was like, oh, people don't often don't always do that

10:09.220 --> 10:12.380
because that puts you also, that makes you vulnerable.

10:12.380 --> 10:13.220
And that-

10:13.220 --> 10:15.420
I actually thought that after I sent it,

10:15.420 --> 10:17.140
but I feel that most of the day,

10:17.140 --> 10:20.760
any interaction like, oh God, I just exposed myself.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.820
But absolutely, I was excited to be here

10:22.820 --> 10:27.060
and I didn't want you to think that I didn't care.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.620
I think being a therapist has shown me

10:30.620 --> 10:33.620
that it's so lucky to be in that position

10:33.620 --> 10:36.380
because you meet people that you would have thought

10:36.380 --> 10:38.420
are cooler than you or smarter than you

10:38.420 --> 10:41.940
or just somehow impervious to life.

10:41.940 --> 10:44.140
And you realize that we are all in it together.

10:44.140 --> 10:47.520
We all want to be cared about and liked.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.380
We all want to be liked as a baseline.

10:50.380 --> 10:53.460
Some people will say they don't care, but everybody does.

10:53.460 --> 10:55.180
It's human.

10:55.180 --> 10:57.820
And I've gotten much better being a therapist,

10:57.820 --> 10:59.700
much more comfortable showing caring,

10:59.700 --> 11:02.820
showing love and genuineness and vulnerability

11:02.820 --> 11:04.660
than I think I ever would have been otherwise.

11:04.660 --> 11:06.700
And that kind of vulnerability is what's required

11:06.700 --> 11:09.540
to do a positive interaction in a relationship?

11:09.540 --> 11:10.460
I think so.

11:10.460 --> 11:13.020
And people have different levels of comfort, right?

11:13.020 --> 11:16.380
So, but as long as it's working for both partners,

11:16.380 --> 11:18.480
and typically you have to communicate

11:18.480 --> 11:20.620
to figure out what your partner,

11:20.620 --> 11:22.260
what makes your partner feel cared about.

11:22.260 --> 11:24.580
However, you might be working, for instance,

11:24.580 --> 11:27.180
with an older couple and I have a couple

11:27.180 --> 11:29.780
that's perfectly happy and they sort of have a system.

11:29.780 --> 11:31.140
It works for them.

11:31.140 --> 11:33.140
If there's some sort of a rupture,

11:33.140 --> 11:35.020
if they get in some sort of a disagreement,

11:35.020 --> 11:36.380
they don't talk it out.

11:36.380 --> 11:38.700
She might go to the store, run an errand,

11:38.700 --> 11:39.980
do a little shopping.

11:39.980 --> 11:42.980
He'll work in the wood shop and then they'll come back.

11:42.980 --> 11:45.220
And there is a repair attempt though,

11:45.220 --> 11:48.340
but it's maybe she'll say, hey, do you want to have dinner?

11:48.340 --> 11:50.860
Or come, you know, I made your favorite dinner.

11:50.860 --> 11:52.960
Or he'll say, hey, I recorded your favorite show.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.240
You want to watch it tonight?

11:54.240 --> 11:55.940
So they don't need to process it,

11:55.980 --> 11:57.900
but there is an understanding between them

11:57.900 --> 11:59.260
that we're still in this together.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.780
We care about each other and there's a repair attempt.

12:02.780 --> 12:05.460
Most people need to be able to process it verbally

12:05.460 --> 12:07.660
and talk about what happened, but not all.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.740
So for most people, if there's a conflict

12:09.740 --> 12:12.500
you should talk about and resolve it and repair it

12:12.500 --> 12:15.220
versus like just put it behind you?

12:15.220 --> 12:16.860
I don't want to say should.

12:16.860 --> 12:19.060
I guess it depends on the couple.

12:19.060 --> 12:21.380
Everybody processes emotions differently.

12:21.380 --> 12:24.020
Everybody handles emotional expression differently.

12:24.020 --> 12:26.860
I mean, I have couples where I have one person

12:26.860 --> 12:30.460
in the partnership who has autism and the other doesn't.

12:30.460 --> 12:33.380
And so they're obviously going to have different ways

12:33.380 --> 12:36.100
of communicating or processing what happened.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.220
We all have different perspectives.

12:38.220 --> 12:41.580
It really depends on what makes a person feel

12:41.580 --> 12:43.020
like it's been repaired.

12:43.020 --> 12:45.020
What makes a person feel understood?

12:45.020 --> 12:46.380
Does that need to be verbal?

12:46.380 --> 12:48.700
Or in the case of that older couple I have

12:48.700 --> 12:51.220
where they know they understand one another

12:51.220 --> 12:54.020
because there's a gentleness toward one another after.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.220
What are some common ways relationships fail

12:57.220 --> 12:59.860
that you've observed in all the therapy you've done?

12:59.860 --> 13:02.580
Well, the Gaumans identified what they call

13:02.580 --> 13:04.540
the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

13:04.540 --> 13:09.220
So, I mean, I could just keep it simple

13:09.220 --> 13:10.740
and go off their research.

13:10.740 --> 13:14.140
So those are four different behaviors

13:14.140 --> 13:15.980
that they identify in couples

13:15.980 --> 13:17.980
or that you can identify in couples

13:17.980 --> 13:20.180
that are really highly predictive of a divorce.

13:20.180 --> 13:23.700
Some more than others, but I'll start with the lower ones.

13:23.700 --> 13:26.820
So one thing that we, by the way, actually,

13:26.820 --> 13:28.780
we all do these things.

13:28.780 --> 13:31.740
These would be in that five to one ratio.

13:31.740 --> 13:33.580
You'd wanna stay away from some of these.

13:33.580 --> 13:34.420
These are the ones.

13:34.420 --> 13:36.100
So as they pile up,

13:36.100 --> 13:38.220
now that ratio is gonna get imbalanced

13:38.220 --> 13:40.860
and then you are headed for a split, okay?

13:40.860 --> 13:43.140
So the first is criticism.

13:43.140 --> 13:45.700
So criticism is when we have a complaint,

13:45.700 --> 13:46.820
complaints are normal,

13:46.820 --> 13:51.180
but instead of owning our own problems, our own feelings,

13:51.180 --> 13:52.700
we assume that our perspective

13:52.700 --> 13:56.180
is the only valid, accurate perspective.

13:56.180 --> 13:58.620
And so we take it upon ourselves

13:58.620 --> 14:01.780
to tell our partner what is wrong with them, okay?

14:01.780 --> 14:05.620
So there's essentially no real belief

14:05.620 --> 14:08.100
that they might have a valid perspective too.

14:08.100 --> 14:12.820
So this could look like you never helped me out

14:12.820 --> 14:16.660
with the house or even you're so lazy,

14:16.860 --> 14:18.620
can't I just get you for five seconds

14:18.620 --> 14:21.060
to help with the kids or something like that?

14:21.060 --> 14:25.420
And then what happens is horseman number two, defensiveness.

14:25.420 --> 14:28.340
So not everybody is defensive

14:28.340 --> 14:29.820
just because they were criticized.

14:29.820 --> 14:33.020
Some people just are more prone to defensiveness than others.

14:33.020 --> 14:35.860
None of us really like admitting our faults.

14:35.860 --> 14:37.900
So it's pretty natural,

14:37.900 --> 14:41.260
but defensiveness is essentially making excuses or worse,

14:41.260 --> 14:43.020
turning it around on your partner,

14:43.860 --> 14:45.820
not accepting any responsibility

14:45.820 --> 14:48.620
and definitely not validating what they're feeling.

14:49.660 --> 14:52.020
Now, if you get criticized enough

14:52.020 --> 14:53.740
or if you get really flooded,

14:53.740 --> 14:56.500
the flooding is what happens when our heart rate goes up

14:56.500 --> 14:58.580
kind of around a hundred beats per minute,

14:58.580 --> 15:00.100
our frontal lobe shuts down.

15:00.100 --> 15:03.260
That's our thoughtful brain, our logical brain,

15:03.260 --> 15:07.220
and our reptilian kind of hind brain takes over our thinking

15:07.220 --> 15:09.540
and we just go into fight or flight in a way.

15:09.540 --> 15:11.380
We just wanna annihilate our partner

15:11.380 --> 15:13.540
instead of say anything

15:13.540 --> 15:15.660
that would be helpful to the relationship.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.220
So if you're getting flooded,

15:18.220 --> 15:19.300
you could do a couple of things.

15:19.300 --> 15:20.700
You could get super critical.

15:20.700 --> 15:21.900
You could get contemptuous,

15:21.900 --> 15:24.380
which I'll talk about in a second, it's the last horseman,

15:24.380 --> 15:28.140
or you do the third horseman, which is stonewalling.

15:28.140 --> 15:30.140
And in their research, the Gottmans found

15:30.140 --> 15:33.060
that men are actually more likely to stonewall.

15:33.060 --> 15:35.340
I also am someone who stonewalls,

15:35.340 --> 15:40.340
but it's where you just sort of disconnect

15:40.420 --> 15:41.860
from the conversation.

15:41.860 --> 15:44.380
You shut down, you turn away.

15:44.380 --> 15:47.940
You can physically even turn away kind of arms crossed,

15:47.940 --> 15:49.860
but you're just, you're shut off.

15:49.860 --> 15:53.220
And stonewalling happens usually because you get flooded.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.500
You feel like you can't win.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.500
You don't know what to do to make the situation better.

15:56.500 --> 16:01.340
It feels pretty hopeless and talking feels unproductive.

16:01.340 --> 16:05.380
So you can see how in a typical heterosexual relationship,

16:05.380 --> 16:09.220
the gender dynamic, we know that women tend to use criticism

16:09.220 --> 16:10.580
more often because they're the ones

16:10.580 --> 16:13.260
that typically raise issues verbally.

16:13.300 --> 16:16.420
And then if men are feeling more criticized,

16:16.420 --> 16:18.220
that they tend to stonewall.

16:18.220 --> 16:21.860
And it becomes this vicious cycle of then more criticism,

16:21.860 --> 16:24.900
but the criticism is really just a plea to be loved

16:24.900 --> 16:27.340
and get your partner to show you they care.

16:27.340 --> 16:30.220
And then the man tends to feel

16:30.220 --> 16:31.860
like he can't do anything right.

16:31.860 --> 16:32.940
This isn't even productive.

16:32.940 --> 16:35.700
If I say anything, I'm just gonna make it worse.

16:35.700 --> 16:37.340
And they don't have any real,

16:37.340 --> 16:40.180
you haven't given them a specific need, a solution,

16:40.180 --> 16:42.140
something they can do to shine for you.

16:42.140 --> 16:43.460
So they turn away.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.460
And where does the contempt come in?

16:45.460 --> 16:48.100
All right, so contempt is criticism on steroids.

16:48.100 --> 16:53.060
This is what John Gottman calls sulfuric acid for love.

16:53.060 --> 16:56.420
Nothing will erode a relationship quicker than contempt.

16:56.420 --> 16:58.940
Contempt is when you are looking at your partner

16:58.940 --> 17:00.820
from a superior position.

17:00.820 --> 17:04.560
So you are eye rolling, you are name calling.

17:05.820 --> 17:09.460
There's a mockery, mocking, even physical mockery,

17:09.460 --> 17:12.140
imitating them, imitating their voice.

17:12.140 --> 17:14.320
Contempt is meant to just take the legs out

17:14.320 --> 17:17.540
from your partner, make them feel pathetic, ridiculous.

17:18.420 --> 17:20.880
And it can be abusive,

17:20.880 --> 17:24.300
but most people have engaged in contempt

17:24.300 --> 17:25.700
at some point in their relationship.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.980
Lower level would be sort of the eye rolling,

17:27.980 --> 17:30.700
but that is the biggest predictor of a split.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.860
If you allow yourself to think, yeah,

17:32.860 --> 17:36.660
that mockery or contempt, just a little bit,

17:36.660 --> 17:38.660
it's like this weird slippery slope.

17:38.660 --> 17:39.620
It sure is.

17:39.620 --> 17:42.020
And the opposite is true,

17:42.020 --> 17:45.460
where I just look at a person and think, wow,

17:45.460 --> 17:47.780
isn't that the most wonderful creature

17:47.780 --> 17:49.140
I've ever seen in my life?

17:49.140 --> 17:50.140
Like, just think that.

17:50.140 --> 17:52.700
And you notice the little details about who they are.

17:52.700 --> 17:55.220
That's why I just observe them the way you observe

17:55.220 --> 17:57.340
a weird peacock at a zoo or something like that.

17:57.340 --> 17:58.980
Intention is powerful, isn't it?

17:58.980 --> 18:00.540
Yeah, and it changes.

18:00.540 --> 18:02.300
You start to notice beautiful things

18:02.300 --> 18:05.900
and then let the things that annoy you.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.140
Yes, you're exactly right.

18:08.140 --> 18:10.660
You're touching on some really important things.

18:10.660 --> 18:13.340
So in relationships, we actually know

18:13.340 --> 18:16.340
that wearing rose-colored glasses is important.

18:16.340 --> 18:18.860
It's healthy, we need it.

18:18.860 --> 18:20.780
And it's a choice you're making, right?

18:20.780 --> 18:25.500
So there is a saying that getting married

18:25.500 --> 18:28.900
is just choosing one person's faults over another.

18:28.900 --> 18:32.900
And the reality is that we may become infatuated

18:32.900 --> 18:34.460
with somebody else as human beings.

18:34.460 --> 18:37.260
Love is an emotion, attraction is an emotion.

18:37.260 --> 18:38.540
And as you go through life,

18:38.540 --> 18:40.700
even if you're in a committed relationship,

18:40.700 --> 18:42.580
you might see beauty in another.

18:42.580 --> 18:46.340
And that person who is novel might seem attractive to you.

18:46.340 --> 18:48.900
But if you can remember that they too

18:48.900 --> 18:52.860
have a set of problems that you would be marrying,

18:52.860 --> 18:57.580
it really helps you to see the beauty in your partner again

18:57.580 --> 19:00.220
and recognize all of their incredible strengths

19:00.220 --> 19:01.980
and all the ways we meld with a person

19:01.980 --> 19:04.460
and become our own family.

19:04.460 --> 19:08.140
Almost become, I mean, our lives intertwine

19:08.140 --> 19:09.980
and we grow those oak trees.

19:09.980 --> 19:10.820
So to you, by the way,

19:10.820 --> 19:12.300
there's a line I read somewhere

19:12.300 --> 19:15.900
that when you're wearing rose-colored glasses,

19:15.900 --> 19:18.820
all the red flags looks just like flags.

19:18.820 --> 19:22.100
I think it's a good line.

19:22.100 --> 19:26.380
So you think that humans are fundamentally,

19:26.380 --> 19:29.900
all of us are fundamentally flawed or have flaws.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.100
They're unique flaws.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.740
And that basically relationships is just a way

19:33.740 --> 19:37.460
to figure out how the two can fit together.

19:37.460 --> 19:38.660
Right, and we're different.

19:38.660 --> 19:41.460
So no matter what, we're going to have differences.

19:41.460 --> 19:43.460
We are raised differently than our partner.

19:43.460 --> 19:44.860
We have different stories,

19:44.860 --> 19:48.060
different experiences that shaped our value systems,

19:48.060 --> 19:50.020
especially when it comes to the big ones

19:50.020 --> 19:52.060
like parenting, love, money,

19:53.420 --> 19:56.300
these principles that are based in our history.

19:57.140 --> 19:58.340
We're gonna have differences.

19:58.340 --> 20:00.900
So is this a set of differences

20:00.900 --> 20:02.940
you can accept from somebody and work with?

20:02.940 --> 20:05.820
Do the benefits and do their strengths,

20:06.700 --> 20:07.900
do they make it worth it?

20:07.900 --> 20:11.620
Or are they deal breaker differences?

20:11.620 --> 20:15.300
Tricky question, but in the couples you've worked with,

20:15.300 --> 20:18.820
is there like the feminine and the masculine,

20:18.820 --> 20:21.900
is there different dynamics that come into play

20:21.900 --> 20:23.460
like dominant, submissive?

20:23.460 --> 20:25.700
Is it like a dance where it just changes

20:25.700 --> 20:26.900
from minute to minute?

20:26.900 --> 20:29.980
Is there dynamics that you observe

20:29.980 --> 20:34.980
that both limit and enable successful relationships?

20:35.780 --> 20:40.460
Yes, so there are, if we're talking about masculine feminine,

20:40.460 --> 20:42.420
then how also are we could get into,

20:42.420 --> 20:45.540
are we talking about actual gender, identified gender,

20:45.540 --> 20:47.260
or are we just talking about these traits?

20:47.260 --> 20:48.780
Because like I said, I stonewall,

20:48.780 --> 20:50.820
which is typically in couples,

20:50.820 --> 20:53.620
something that is more associated with straight men,

20:55.300 --> 20:58.500
but that's my style of coping when I get overwhelmed.

20:59.340 --> 21:02.140
That is not tied to any sort of success

21:02.140 --> 21:04.180
or non-success of a relationship,

21:04.180 --> 21:07.820
but what we do know is that gay couples,

21:07.820 --> 21:10.260
so lesbians and gay men,

21:10.260 --> 21:12.140
tend to be gentler with one another

21:12.140 --> 21:15.260
when they are having conflict discussions.

21:15.260 --> 21:17.260
So that's actually been identified in the research

21:17.260 --> 21:20.380
and it's something I've witnessed and it's just fascinating.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.500
So with my straight couples,

21:22.500 --> 21:24.460
I'll be going through one of these,

21:24.460 --> 21:26.500
if we're processing the conflict that occurred,

21:26.500 --> 21:27.980
I'll be going through the sheet

21:27.980 --> 21:29.420
and it's very, very structured

21:29.420 --> 21:31.700
because you don't want couples doing more damage

21:31.700 --> 21:32.540
when they're there with you.

21:32.540 --> 21:34.580
You want them practicing skills

21:34.580 --> 21:37.100
that protect them from criticism,

21:37.100 --> 21:40.020
that protect them from contempt.

21:40.020 --> 21:42.620
And when I'm working with a straight couple,

21:42.620 --> 21:46.700
I am like a referee or sometimes I'll relate it

21:46.700 --> 21:49.620
to being like a ski coach and keeping people on a bunny hill

21:49.620 --> 21:52.500
and you tell them, you let them make like two turns

21:52.500 --> 21:54.780
and then you stop them and you meet up again

21:54.780 --> 21:56.660
because you don't want them to veer off.

21:56.660 --> 21:59.420
With straight couples, you are doing very short turns

21:59.420 --> 22:02.500
before you need to kind of intervene and rescaffold.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.580
I had a lesbian couple recently

22:04.580 --> 22:06.460
and they were so lovely with each other.

22:06.460 --> 22:08.620
They skipped like seven steps

22:08.620 --> 22:10.540
to the advanced final portion

22:10.540 --> 22:12.460
where they were already coming up with solutions

22:12.460 --> 22:14.860
and suggesting things that they might be able

22:14.860 --> 22:16.100
to do differently next time

22:16.100 --> 22:17.740
to make it better for their partner.

22:17.740 --> 22:19.660
They were asking each other questions

22:19.660 --> 22:22.260
about how their partner felt with no agenda,

22:22.260 --> 22:24.340
no attempt to sort of be like,

22:24.340 --> 22:25.780
well, do you think you're feeling that way

22:25.780 --> 22:28.420
because, which straight couples do all the time,

22:29.420 --> 22:32.220
you just see this humility and openness.

22:32.220 --> 22:33.100
It's lovely.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.380
Yeah, it's lovely.

22:34.380 --> 22:38.500
But I wonder if maybe watching too many Hollywood films,

22:38.500 --> 22:41.860
if some of the drama, some of the tension

22:41.860 --> 22:45.060
is required for a passionate lifelong romance.

22:45.060 --> 22:46.340
No, it's not.

22:46.340 --> 22:48.060
And that's great news.

22:48.060 --> 22:52.980
So we actually know that the closer you feel

22:52.980 --> 22:53.820
to your partner.

22:53.900 --> 22:57.180
So if, I mean, you've talked a lot about beauty

22:57.180 --> 23:02.180
and you can ignite that beauty, that interest, right?

23:02.900 --> 23:04.780
So when you're falling in love,

23:04.780 --> 23:07.340
it's usually that a person is sort of a mystery to you

23:07.340 --> 23:08.820
and you're uncovering these layers

23:08.820 --> 23:10.420
that you find really appealing.

23:11.980 --> 23:14.540
There are continual layers that you can uncover

23:14.540 --> 23:15.780
with your partner over time.

23:15.780 --> 23:17.260
I don't think we realized that.

23:17.260 --> 23:18.740
I think we get complacent

23:18.740 --> 23:21.100
and we think we've had every conversation imaginable.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.140
What else are they gonna do to surprise me?

23:24.140 --> 23:27.300
But we don't know the questions to be asking.

23:27.300 --> 23:29.220
One of my favorite questions,

23:30.380 --> 23:32.980
I like turning these conversations kind of into a quiz

23:32.980 --> 23:34.980
because I get bored easily.

23:34.980 --> 23:38.260
So rather than just asking an open-ended question,

23:39.180 --> 23:41.260
there's a way you can do this with your partner

23:41.260 --> 23:43.380
where it's sort of like the dating game.

23:43.380 --> 23:46.500
Like what is my, as of yet,

23:46.500 --> 23:49.580
fondest but unrealized life dream?

23:49.580 --> 23:50.700
And see if your partner knows.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.100
You might not even know.

23:52.100 --> 23:54.140
They might know you better than you know yourself.

23:54.140 --> 23:57.420
That in and of itself is a beautiful reminder

23:57.420 --> 24:01.220
of the relationship and how special it is.

24:01.220 --> 24:06.220
But then also when they say it

24:06.220 --> 24:08.540
or when you realize or have to think critically,

24:08.540 --> 24:11.700
like what is my husband's as of yet unrealized

24:11.700 --> 24:12.900
but fondest life dream?

24:12.900 --> 24:14.540
And then you can talk about it.

24:15.740 --> 24:18.660
You just, I don't know, you just kind of transcend

24:18.660 --> 24:21.140
into this new area and you feel tight again.

24:21.140 --> 24:23.220
You feel like, you feel close.

24:23.220 --> 24:25.900
Well, you really talk to each other.

24:25.900 --> 24:30.900
Like I've recorded and without intending to publish

24:32.580 --> 24:36.020
podcasts like this with microphones, with friends,

24:36.020 --> 24:37.340
with people close to me.

24:37.340 --> 24:39.020
Because it's literally that.

24:39.020 --> 24:42.140
You get to ask questions like as if it's an interview.

24:42.140 --> 24:42.980
And we don't do that.

24:42.980 --> 24:44.300
That's exactly it.

24:44.300 --> 24:46.420
The way you're talking with me.

24:46.420 --> 24:47.500
Sit down with your partner.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.860
Have that conversation.

24:48.860 --> 24:50.020
Like years later.

24:50.020 --> 24:51.500
Right, show interest.

24:51.500 --> 24:52.940
Actually be curious.

24:52.940 --> 24:54.940
See what they surprise you with.

24:54.940 --> 24:57.860
And actually what you learn is you don't know

24:57.860 --> 24:59.180
the answers to most of these questions.

24:59.180 --> 25:00.500
100%.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.500
Exactly.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.620
Like what's your favorite movie from the 80s?

25:04.620 --> 25:06.180
You might not know the answer to that.

25:06.180 --> 25:08.340
It's like those first date questions or whatever.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.740
Or what's your favorite movie this year and why?

25:10.740 --> 25:12.140
And why, yeah.

25:12.140 --> 25:13.300
It's fascinating.

25:13.300 --> 25:14.140
It is.

25:14.140 --> 25:15.500
It's hard to do that because I think

25:15.500 --> 25:17.260
you'll probably be offended at first.

25:17.260 --> 25:19.380
How little the other person knows.

25:19.380 --> 25:21.340
So I think you have to work through that.

25:21.340 --> 25:25.300
You know, I actually find that there's this rekindling

25:25.300 --> 25:28.980
because partners are shocked that their partner

25:28.980 --> 25:31.260
does know so much about them.

25:31.260 --> 25:33.460
Especially if they've been feeling dissatisfied

25:33.460 --> 25:34.740
or disconnected.

25:34.740 --> 25:37.380
It's a reminder of all the good that's still there.

25:38.700 --> 25:41.380
What, I know we've said some of those things,

25:41.380 --> 25:43.100
but what's on the opposite side?

25:43.100 --> 25:44.860
What's the key to a successful relationship?

25:45.340 --> 25:48.540
What are the things you see time and time again

25:48.540 --> 25:51.100
that to you designate that they're on a good path?

25:51.100 --> 25:51.940
Yeah.

25:51.940 --> 25:53.980
There's a real attunement, honestly.

25:53.980 --> 25:57.740
Just it's sort of an us against the world feeling.

25:57.740 --> 26:00.500
Nobody, neither partner's gonna talk shit on them.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.900
The other, there's a loyalty.

26:03.780 --> 26:07.660
They handle each other in the relationship with care.

26:07.660 --> 26:10.340
You can tell that they've worked some things.

26:10.340 --> 26:13.940
To me, it usually indicates that these are some people

26:13.940 --> 26:16.700
who have figured they've had to work some things out.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.500
They know that this is delicate.

26:18.500 --> 26:22.740
They know that you're on thin ice.

26:22.740 --> 26:24.580
You take a wrong step and you can be back

26:24.580 --> 26:26.180
in a tough place in your relationship.

26:26.180 --> 26:29.140
Or you treat it with care and it can be amazing.

26:29.140 --> 26:31.380
So they're careful with one another.

26:31.380 --> 26:33.420
They give each other compliments.

26:33.420 --> 26:35.460
They are considerate.

26:35.460 --> 26:39.700
So you'll see, he'll bring the car around for her

26:39.740 --> 26:40.620
because it's raining.

26:40.620 --> 26:45.540
Or she'll bring him home some takeout.

26:45.540 --> 26:47.740
She'll order for him too at the restaurant.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.740
They keep each other in each other's minds.

26:49.740 --> 26:51.780
But that us against the world thing,

26:53.060 --> 26:54.620
that definitely is there.

26:54.620 --> 26:55.460
100%.

26:55.460 --> 26:56.300
You've seen that, right?

26:56.300 --> 26:57.420
Yeah, you've seen it.

26:57.420 --> 26:59.220
And you've seen it like,

26:59.220 --> 27:01.580
I like it when couples have been together for a long time

27:01.580 --> 27:05.580
and when one is talking, the other one looks at them.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.340
If you don't do that, that's not a bad sign,

27:07.340 --> 27:09.300
but it's a good sign when you do that

27:10.020 --> 27:14.260
and I think it's actually a really good exercise to do

27:15.580 --> 27:17.460
because I enjoy when I see in others.

27:20.500 --> 27:25.020
It's a way to show that you don't take him for granted

27:25.020 --> 27:27.980
and then you still find them like this mysterious,

27:27.980 --> 27:29.540
wonderful creature to observe.

27:30.660 --> 27:33.260
I think too often, we have that with our parents,

27:33.260 --> 27:36.980
we have that with people close to us.

27:36.980 --> 27:39.060
You think, yeah, I've heard what they're about to say.

27:39.900 --> 27:40.740
I know you can complete that sentence.

27:40.740 --> 27:41.580
Take him for granted.

27:41.580 --> 27:43.460
And then if you just look at them and say,

27:43.460 --> 27:45.980
wow, this is the most brilliant person

27:45.980 --> 27:47.900
I've ever seen in my life.

27:47.900 --> 27:52.900
I can't just appreciate every word that comes out of them

27:52.980 --> 27:54.260
and look at them in that way.

27:54.260 --> 27:56.020
You actually begin to believe it

27:56.020 --> 27:58.820
and you actually begin to see the beauty

27:58.820 --> 27:59.660
of what they're saying.

27:59.660 --> 28:00.620
You are exactly right.

28:00.620 --> 28:02.660
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

28:02.660 --> 28:03.500
And they feel really good.

28:03.500 --> 28:04.940
And it's caring, yeah.

28:04.940 --> 28:05.980
It's very caring.

28:05.980 --> 28:09.500
So that's, I mean, that's, I think the beauty

28:09.500 --> 28:12.820
of what the Gottman research showed us,

28:12.820 --> 28:16.700
taught us, provided us is that we can do these things

28:16.700 --> 28:20.020
that become cyclic and just keep growing this relationship,

28:20.020 --> 28:22.140
making it stronger, more powerful, more loving.

28:22.140 --> 28:24.420
You would never want to cut it down.

28:24.420 --> 28:26.380
Well, you were talking about the sheet

28:26.380 --> 28:28.500
for conflict processing.

28:28.500 --> 28:29.340
What are we talking about?

28:29.340 --> 28:31.300
So like a couple will come and say,

28:31.300 --> 28:34.020
like there was this conflict and you put it on the table

28:34.020 --> 28:35.380
and then what does it mean to process it?

28:35.380 --> 28:37.740
So in that Gottman method of therapy,

28:37.740 --> 28:39.420
there are all these different, I mean,

28:39.420 --> 28:41.060
hundreds of different interventions.

28:41.060 --> 28:44.500
And based on what the issue is in that session,

28:44.500 --> 28:47.340
you can decide the most appropriate intervention.

28:47.340 --> 28:49.700
And so this is a specific intervention

28:49.700 --> 28:52.860
for if it is a conflict that occurred

28:52.860 --> 28:54.180
and there are different types of conflicts.

28:54.180 --> 28:56.700
So this would be more like an incident.

28:56.700 --> 28:59.860
It's not a perpetual recurring problem,

28:59.860 --> 29:01.900
which has actually a different intervention

29:01.900 --> 29:04.340
where you kind of look at the underlying

29:04.380 --> 29:06.060
belief systems, values,

29:06.060 --> 29:09.540
and the goal is not to solve that problem.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.700
The goal in that situation is to actually

29:11.700 --> 29:13.740
just get a better understanding of each other

29:13.740 --> 29:16.220
and your positions and just,

29:16.220 --> 29:19.180
you stop seeing your partner as the adversary

29:19.180 --> 29:22.100
and you start seeing them as a person who makes sense.

29:23.260 --> 29:25.580
But if there's been a specific event,

29:25.580 --> 29:28.460
a specific fight that's just sort of situational,

29:29.580 --> 29:31.020
but it's left bad blood,

29:31.020 --> 29:34.300
things were said or you didn't feel understood,

29:35.260 --> 29:36.740
this intervention I was talking about is one

29:36.740 --> 29:38.940
that you would go through a series of steps

29:38.940 --> 29:42.140
where first you identify the emotions that you were feeling,

29:42.140 --> 29:47.140
then you describe play by play your movie, your perspective.

29:48.060 --> 29:50.300
If your partner were looking through your eyes,

29:50.300 --> 29:54.220
this is what they heard, saw, thought,

29:54.220 --> 29:57.020
then they saw this, then they heard this.

29:57.020 --> 29:58.980
So you're not saying, yeah,

29:58.980 --> 30:01.140
then you came in and were yelling and acting crazy.

30:01.140 --> 30:04.020
You're saying, so then I saw you come in,

30:04.700 --> 30:07.900
I heard you say, and I thought to myself,

30:07.900 --> 30:10.700
well, great, now everything's ruined, right?

30:10.700 --> 30:12.420
So you're showing them your movie,

30:12.420 --> 30:15.860
then they have to summarize the movie for you

30:15.860 --> 30:17.940
and then vice versa.

30:17.940 --> 30:21.500
And then there's this step where each person validates

30:21.500 --> 30:23.900
some part that they can understand.

30:23.900 --> 30:26.220
Like based on what you saw, heard,

30:26.220 --> 30:29.820
I can actually understand how you felt one of those feelings

30:29.820 --> 30:30.660
that you said.

30:30.660 --> 30:33.980
And then my favorite part is you rewind sort of the movie

30:34.980 --> 30:38.220
from that day back through into childhood

30:38.220 --> 30:39.900
and you land on a time, a memory

30:39.900 --> 30:42.500
when you felt a similar set of feelings.

30:42.500 --> 30:44.780
And this is like the most beautiful part ever

30:44.780 --> 30:48.700
because let's say the feeling was I felt misunderstood,

30:48.700 --> 30:53.700
I felt misjudged, uncared about, unloved,

30:53.940 --> 30:55.380
like you didn't even like me.

30:55.380 --> 30:58.180
And I'll say, when did you feel that way?

30:58.180 --> 31:01.140
Land on a time and they're like, my whole childhood.

31:01.140 --> 31:03.140
My parents were, my mom was always accusing me

31:03.140 --> 31:04.540
of doing things I wasn't doing.

31:04.540 --> 31:06.460
And it would set me up and my dad would come home,

31:06.460 --> 31:08.980
he'd hear about it, he would just believe her.

31:08.980 --> 31:12.380
And then you have like a partner climbing up on the couch

31:12.380 --> 31:13.700
like gives their partner a hug

31:13.700 --> 31:14.700
while they're sharing the story.

31:14.700 --> 31:15.540
It's beautiful.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.860
And it changes the way you interact

31:17.860 --> 31:20.100
in future disagreements.

31:20.100 --> 31:21.060
So you have those moments.

31:21.060 --> 31:22.780
Yeah, you can't unlearn.

31:22.780 --> 31:24.260
Now you know this about your partner,

31:24.260 --> 31:26.020
you know what they're sensitive to.

31:27.860 --> 31:29.980
Yeah, and again, you kind of see the beauty

31:29.980 --> 31:31.060
and the flaws then.

31:31.060 --> 31:31.900
Right.

31:32.860 --> 31:33.860
It all makes sense.

31:33.860 --> 31:35.500
Yeah, it all kind of makes sense.

31:35.500 --> 31:38.540
Yeah, so you maybe were in this dumpster dive in your head

31:38.540 --> 31:39.660
of how your partner sucks

31:39.660 --> 31:41.060
and all the things that are wrong with them

31:41.060 --> 31:42.300
and it's so hopeless.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.340
And then you get this light shining through

31:44.340 --> 31:45.900
and you realize, oh my God,

31:45.900 --> 31:48.100
of course they would be sensitive to that.

31:48.100 --> 31:50.740
And suddenly it's not about all the ways

31:50.740 --> 31:52.940
your partner is wrong and proving that they're wrong.

31:52.940 --> 31:54.980
It's just, how can I in the future

31:54.980 --> 31:56.900
make sure they do not feel this again?

31:56.900 --> 32:00.900
I would never want this person I love to misunderstand me

32:00.900 --> 32:03.220
and feel so unloved.

32:03.220 --> 32:05.060
What do you, the early days of that,

32:05.060 --> 32:07.380
what do you think about the whole dating,

32:07.380 --> 32:09.420
modern dating process?

32:09.420 --> 32:11.940
How do you find a partner that you can

32:14.060 --> 32:15.660
stay with for the rest of your life?

32:15.660 --> 32:18.420
So we are absolutely doing it wrong.

32:18.420 --> 32:21.340
And, but there is a way you can do it.

32:21.340 --> 32:24.260
And I am such a fan of the psychologist Ty Tashiro.

32:24.260 --> 32:25.260
I adore him.

32:25.260 --> 32:26.100
He's brilliant.

32:26.100 --> 32:26.940
He's lovely.

32:26.940 --> 32:28.860
He's also very humble.

32:28.860 --> 32:31.580
Just a wonderful salt of the earth guy.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.900
I'm gonna tell you a very true story here.

32:33.900 --> 32:34.740
Okay. Let's go.

32:34.740 --> 32:36.140
I was in a bad relationship

32:36.140 --> 32:39.620
and I was at a psychology conference

32:39.620 --> 32:42.180
with my partner at the time.

32:42.180 --> 32:43.900
We were both at this conference

32:43.900 --> 32:46.900
and we were sitting in a lecture hall

32:46.900 --> 32:49.940
there for Ty Tashiro to do his talk that day

32:49.940 --> 32:52.060
on his phenomenal research

32:52.060 --> 32:54.780
on relationship satisfaction and dating.

32:55.900 --> 32:57.740
And I was sitting next to him

32:58.740 --> 33:01.380
it was just always unpleasant on trips.

33:01.380 --> 33:02.700
There were always fights.

33:02.700 --> 33:03.540
We're sitting there

33:03.540 --> 33:06.500
and Ty Tashiro starts talking about his research

33:06.500 --> 33:08.500
and how he found that most people

33:08.500 --> 33:11.740
are signing this agreement, getting married

33:11.740 --> 33:14.660
and doing it based on the love endorphins.

33:14.660 --> 33:17.900
And really only about 35% of anybody who's married

33:17.900 --> 33:19.340
is actually happy.

33:20.700 --> 33:22.460
And he said, so then,

33:24.380 --> 33:25.220
Pretty low number.

33:25.220 --> 33:26.060
Exactly.

33:26.060 --> 33:27.460
But here's what I love about Ty Tashiro

33:28.300 --> 33:29.140
is he didn't stop there.

33:29.140 --> 33:32.140
He wanted to know what those people who were happy

33:33.140 --> 33:34.060
had in common.

33:34.940 --> 33:37.020
And then same thing with the people who were unhappy.

33:37.020 --> 33:39.660
He found a couple fascinating patterns.

33:40.900 --> 33:44.460
So the couples who were happy

33:44.460 --> 33:47.180
tended to rate their partners higher

33:47.180 --> 33:48.860
in three different traits.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.420
And I love talking about this

33:50.420 --> 33:54.340
because if you are somebody who can follow instructions

33:54.340 --> 33:56.020
you can find this.

33:56.020 --> 33:57.900
I mean, very easily.

33:57.900 --> 34:02.660
Those three traits tend to be conscientiousness, okay.

34:02.660 --> 34:05.020
And I love the word conscientiousness

34:05.020 --> 34:07.460
because it's not just kindness.

34:07.460 --> 34:09.140
Kindness is a good way to think of it

34:09.140 --> 34:12.260
but you can be kind and kind of be a pushover

34:12.260 --> 34:13.660
and that's not attractive.

34:13.660 --> 34:17.580
Conscientiousness is smart, attentive.

34:17.580 --> 34:20.220
It's somebody who reads into a text message

34:20.220 --> 34:21.780
and thinks, wow, she was making herself

34:21.780 --> 34:22.900
very vulnerable there.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.300
That's conscientiousness.

34:25.300 --> 34:26.860
I like how you just threw in a compliment.

34:26.860 --> 34:27.700
I appreciate it.

34:27.700 --> 34:28.540
It's true.

34:28.540 --> 34:32.180
It's a certain intelligence, awareness and attunement.

34:32.180 --> 34:35.660
And then on top of that, conscientiousness is motivated.

34:35.660 --> 34:38.260
So you can't be on your ass all day and be conscientious

34:38.260 --> 34:41.380
because then you can't meet the needs

34:41.380 --> 34:43.180
that you anticipate about the person.

34:43.180 --> 34:45.980
So conscientious is that guy who drives the car around

34:45.980 --> 34:48.380
in the rainstorm so his wife's hair doesn't get met.

34:48.380 --> 34:51.140
It's my husband who checks my alarm for me every morning

34:51.140 --> 34:53.060
because he knows I'm terrible at time management

34:53.060 --> 34:56.100
and he makes sure that I set it a reasonable amount

34:56.100 --> 34:57.780
of time before my first meeting

34:57.780 --> 35:00.700
and not the 20 minutes I think I need.

35:00.700 --> 35:02.940
And then he'll come wake me up with a cup of coffee.

35:02.940 --> 35:05.700
That is ultimate conscientiousness.

35:05.700 --> 35:06.780
And it is true.

35:06.780 --> 35:08.380
I mean, I will tell you,

35:08.380 --> 35:10.060
as somebody who's with a conscientious partner,

35:10.060 --> 35:12.820
your love increases over time

35:12.820 --> 35:14.860
as you continue to feel grateful

35:14.860 --> 35:16.500
and admiring of that person.

35:17.540 --> 35:21.260
The second one, you want somebody who is low

35:21.260 --> 35:25.540
in a big five personality trait called neuroticism.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.500
You want somebody emotionally stable in a way.

35:28.500 --> 35:29.900
Now this doesn't mean you can't have somebody

35:29.900 --> 35:31.060
who doesn't get the blues

35:31.060 --> 35:32.580
or struggle with mental health issues.

35:32.580 --> 35:35.340
Trust me, Ty is with somebody who I get,

35:35.340 --> 35:36.500
I'm all over the place.

35:36.500 --> 35:41.380
But you want somebody who kind of owns their shit

35:41.380 --> 35:46.380
and isn't going to just be emotionally unstable all over.

35:47.340 --> 35:50.860
You want somebody who is generally happy

35:50.860 --> 35:52.620
and has some life satisfaction.

35:53.660 --> 35:57.540
Having a partner who has serious, not mental health issues,

35:57.540 --> 36:00.740
but unmitigated emotional distress

36:00.740 --> 36:04.980
and instability is really hard on the partner.

36:04.980 --> 36:06.700
And it's really hard on other family members,

36:06.700 --> 36:08.820
including children, if you have children.

36:08.820 --> 36:11.300
So it's just a predictor of happiness.

36:11.300 --> 36:14.140
So there's a certain threshold of chaos

36:14.300 --> 36:15.300
that if you exceed it,

36:15.300 --> 36:18.300
it's going to be destructive to a long-term relationship.

36:18.300 --> 36:21.740
That is a perfect description about chaos.

36:21.740 --> 36:25.740
Not the mystery chaos you love with your little poet brain.

36:25.740 --> 36:29.180
I'm talking more like just somebody who,

36:29.180 --> 36:30.980
there's just no peace.

36:30.980 --> 36:31.820
There's no peace.

36:31.820 --> 36:34.020
There's a problem with everything.

36:34.020 --> 36:35.740
Everything becomes more difficult.

36:35.740 --> 36:37.980
Going to a party is a chore.

36:37.980 --> 36:39.540
You don't know if they're going to have a meltdown

36:39.540 --> 36:42.740
at the party or how many complaints about your friends

36:42.940 --> 36:45.900
or everything is a problem.

36:45.900 --> 36:49.340
So you want somebody who has just some resiliency,

36:49.340 --> 36:50.580
I think is a good term for it.

36:50.580 --> 36:51.420
Some flexibility.

36:51.420 --> 36:53.580
Some spice is okay, but not too much.

36:53.580 --> 36:56.620
Right, flexibility, resiliency, easygoing.

36:56.620 --> 36:57.460
Yeah.

36:57.460 --> 36:58.300
Okay.

36:58.300 --> 37:02.420
The third is really interesting, I think.

37:02.420 --> 37:06.220
So he found that having a partner

37:06.220 --> 37:08.380
with sort of moderate adventurousness,

37:08.380 --> 37:10.500
not high adventurousness,

37:10.500 --> 37:12.780
not high adventurousness,

37:12.780 --> 37:15.260
actually leads to greater satisfaction.

37:15.260 --> 37:16.700
And the reason for that is

37:16.700 --> 37:20.580
high adventurousness equals novelty seeking,

37:20.580 --> 37:21.980
shiny new things.

37:21.980 --> 37:25.060
And so if you're in a monogamous relationship,

37:25.060 --> 37:27.300
if that is what's important to you,

37:27.300 --> 37:29.740
it's going to be very hard for a partner

37:29.740 --> 37:33.180
who is novelty seeking to be faithful.

37:33.180 --> 37:34.940
So that will cause a lot of pain.

37:34.940 --> 37:37.940
But also novelty seeking people

37:37.980 --> 37:40.460
tend to always have new projects,

37:40.460 --> 37:41.660
new interesting things.

37:41.660 --> 37:45.420
And so their attention is drawn away from the relationship.

37:45.420 --> 37:48.820
And so you can just feel pretty neglected or unimportant.

37:49.820 --> 37:51.100
By a little bit.

37:51.100 --> 37:52.700
But you want a little bit of adventurousness.

37:52.700 --> 37:56.940
So you want your person to be sort of self-motivated,

37:56.940 --> 37:58.700
individuated, have their own interests,

37:58.700 --> 38:00.340
not completely dependent on you.

38:00.340 --> 38:03.420
But also, I mean, low adventurousness is not a bad thing.

38:03.420 --> 38:04.460
Ultimately, what you're getting

38:04.460 --> 38:06.980
with low to moderate adventurousness is that rock,

38:06.980 --> 38:09.020
that feeling of stability, that home.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.060
And I made some references earlier,

38:11.060 --> 38:13.300
like when you're 70 and you turn to your partner,

38:13.300 --> 38:14.820
do you want him to be hot?

38:14.820 --> 38:18.420
Or, for instance, my dad has dementia right now.

38:18.420 --> 38:20.100
And my husband turned to me on the plane,

38:20.100 --> 38:21.500
we were all coming back from a trip

38:21.500 --> 38:24.660
and where we really saw how severe it's getting.

38:24.660 --> 38:26.580
And he just turned to me,

38:26.580 --> 38:28.540
he knew how much pain I was in,

38:28.540 --> 38:30.140
even though I wasn't showing it.

38:30.140 --> 38:31.980
And he said, I want you to know

38:31.980 --> 38:33.100
that if it comes to a point

38:33.100 --> 38:34.740
where we need to take care of your dad,

38:34.740 --> 38:36.060
he needs to live with us,

38:36.060 --> 38:37.620
you don't even need to ask.

38:37.620 --> 38:40.980
It is, I am 100% on board and will help.

38:40.980 --> 38:45.980
And those are the things that matter, that home feeling.

38:46.060 --> 38:48.260
And technically, that's a trait that's usually,

38:48.260 --> 38:50.060
that's sort of a,

38:50.060 --> 38:52.980
my husband caring so much about family and home

38:52.980 --> 38:54.980
and taking care of things that matter,

38:54.980 --> 38:57.060
those are things that tend to be associated

38:57.060 --> 38:58.860
with that low to moderate adventurousness.

38:58.860 --> 39:02.820
Somebody who really cares about simple things and family.

39:02.860 --> 39:04.100
I wonder if those things,

39:04.100 --> 39:07.660
those three things are something you can work on.

39:07.660 --> 39:09.460
Conscientiousness, you can probably.

39:09.460 --> 39:10.660
You can.

39:10.660 --> 39:12.500
Proactively observe yourself

39:13.740 --> 39:16.140
and do it more regularly.

39:16.140 --> 39:16.980
Right.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.980
Neuroticism might be the hardest one probably.

39:18.980 --> 39:19.820
I think so.

39:19.820 --> 39:24.700
Well, I mean, I was pretty neurotic in my early 20s.

39:24.700 --> 39:25.820
And when you wake up to it,

39:25.820 --> 39:28.060
maybe if you're self-aware about it,

39:28.060 --> 39:29.340
maybe you'll be able to control it.

39:29.340 --> 39:31.220
Yeah, I think self-awareness is key.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.740
I think that's why I love therapy so much.

39:33.740 --> 39:36.900
I think life is about growth and our potential for growth

39:36.900 --> 39:39.580
and to make our own lives better,

39:39.580 --> 39:41.220
to make the lives of others better,

39:41.220 --> 39:42.740
to serve others, to heal.

39:42.740 --> 39:44.460
All of us are this collective healing.

39:44.460 --> 39:47.220
And I think we're all capable of growth.

39:47.220 --> 39:48.540
And the same with adventurousness.

39:48.540 --> 39:53.460
You can, I'm somebody that's pretty low on adventure,

39:53.460 --> 39:55.540
but I keep throwing myself out there

39:55.540 --> 39:58.300
just for the extra adventures so you can grow in that way.

39:58.300 --> 40:00.460
Yes, and I am high in adventurousness

40:00.460 --> 40:03.380
and I was not really ready to settle down.

40:03.380 --> 40:05.940
I was married earlier in my 20s,

40:05.940 --> 40:08.660
but I would say that I am much more prepared

40:08.660 --> 40:11.780
to be in a committed long-term relationship now in my 40s

40:11.780 --> 40:13.380
than I was when I was younger.

40:13.380 --> 40:14.540
But in that same way for me,

40:14.540 --> 40:17.420
I like to connect myself to high adventure people

40:17.420 --> 40:20.140
so that it brings me out.

40:20.140 --> 40:22.780
It's like they're a horse and I get to ride them.

40:22.780 --> 40:23.940
Yeah, and that's the thing.

40:23.940 --> 40:25.820
So high adventure people are attractive.

40:25.820 --> 40:27.540
They're interesting, exciting,

40:27.540 --> 40:29.660
but it can be a world of heartbreak

40:29.700 --> 40:32.780
because you're only under that spotlight for a few minutes

40:32.780 --> 40:34.500
and then they're on to the next shiny thing.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.980
Yeah, but heartbreak is part of love.

40:36.980 --> 40:38.100
But that might be the drug thing

40:38.100 --> 40:39.460
that you were talking about.

40:39.460 --> 40:42.180
Speaking of adventurousness, what about sex?

40:42.180 --> 40:45.460
What role does sex play in a successful relationship?

40:45.460 --> 40:48.420
Well, okay, so I'm saying it's important,

40:48.420 --> 40:49.820
but I wanna qualify that.

40:49.820 --> 40:52.740
Everybody has different levels of sex

40:52.740 --> 40:54.380
that are satisfying to them.

40:54.380 --> 40:56.620
Sex can definitely bond you to your partner.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.060
Orgasms are amazing.

40:58.060 --> 40:59.100
They de-stress us.

40:59.100 --> 41:00.940
They're healthy.

41:00.940 --> 41:02.940
I mean, you can have an orgasm

41:02.940 --> 41:06.780
and have a lower level of stress for 48 hours.

41:06.780 --> 41:08.380
I think that's pretty incredible.

41:10.820 --> 41:12.620
If you have, I mean,

41:12.620 --> 41:14.900
just that kind of physical contact with your partner,

41:14.900 --> 41:17.300
even a 20-second hug with your partner

41:17.300 --> 41:19.620
has similar benefits to an orgasm.

41:19.620 --> 41:21.060
You're gonna have a lower stress level.

41:21.060 --> 41:23.020
You're gonna feel immediately close to your partner.

41:23.020 --> 41:25.540
You're gonna get a rush of oxytocin,

41:25.540 --> 41:27.700
which is gonna make you feel happier,

41:28.380 --> 41:29.500
more grounded throughout the day.

41:29.500 --> 41:31.500
So that's a 20-second hug.

41:31.500 --> 41:33.300
You extrapolate that to sex

41:33.300 --> 41:35.100
and things are gonna be great.

41:35.100 --> 41:36.980
So it's just physiological.

41:36.980 --> 41:38.380
But I wonder, there's probably metrics

41:38.380 --> 41:40.380
about how often you have sex,

41:40.380 --> 41:43.020
how that correlates to successful relationships and so on.

41:43.020 --> 41:45.780
Well, there are, but it really has more to do.

41:45.780 --> 41:47.220
It's sort of like, remember I was talking

41:47.220 --> 41:50.940
about processing conflict and what matters is,

41:50.940 --> 41:53.180
do people feel like it's been resolved?

41:53.180 --> 41:54.780
Do they feel like there's been a repair?

41:54.780 --> 41:56.940
Not necessarily how they go about doing it.

41:56.980 --> 42:01.180
Same with sex, does each partner feel sexually satisfying?

42:02.260 --> 42:04.900
So that could be once a month for one couple.

42:04.900 --> 42:06.940
It could be five times a week for another couple.

42:06.940 --> 42:10.420
It could be never for other couples, truly.

42:11.580 --> 42:13.500
I mean, so sex has a ton of benefits,

42:13.500 --> 42:17.060
but its absence isn't necessarily detrimental, I guess,

42:17.060 --> 42:19.620
would be the qualifier, depending on who you are.

42:19.620 --> 42:23.140
And I know couples that use sex

42:23.140 --> 42:25.460
as part of the conflict resolution process.

42:25.460 --> 42:27.180
It's hugely effective for that,

42:27.180 --> 42:30.300
if it works for both parties, all parties,

42:30.300 --> 42:31.700
not just both, all.

42:31.700 --> 42:33.180
That's true.

42:33.180 --> 42:35.740
What do you think about infidelity?

42:37.580 --> 42:39.980
You know, what's the cause of infidelity?

42:39.980 --> 42:41.700
Why do men and women cheat?

42:41.700 --> 42:43.380
It's different for everybody,

42:43.380 --> 42:47.020
but I mean, even earlier I was saying with adventurousness,

42:47.020 --> 42:49.460
like if monogamy is something you're doing.

42:52.100 --> 42:53.700
I've seen, in my own practice,

42:53.700 --> 42:57.380
I've seen the entire range of couples who are open

42:57.380 --> 43:00.340
about having sexual relationships with other people

43:00.340 --> 43:01.660
and fine with it.

43:01.660 --> 43:03.420
Couples who wanna be fine with it,

43:03.420 --> 43:04.700
but find out they're not.

43:06.460 --> 43:07.780
Couples who aren't just couples,

43:07.780 --> 43:09.140
couples with multiple people,

43:09.140 --> 43:12.180
you know, multiple romantic relationships.

43:12.180 --> 43:15.780
I've had couples where affairs are tolerated

43:15.780 --> 43:17.220
and not talked about.

43:18.180 --> 43:19.820
They're not enjoyed,

43:19.820 --> 43:22.220
but they are not the type of betrayal

43:22.220 --> 43:24.180
that will destroy the relationship.

43:24.180 --> 43:27.860
A sort of a understanding and keep it out of my face.

43:27.860 --> 43:29.420
And then also we won't talk about it.

43:29.420 --> 43:33.300
So an affair that happened without getting permission first

43:33.300 --> 43:35.340
and as long as you don't talk about it,

43:35.340 --> 43:37.540
it's not going to do a damage to the relationship.

43:37.540 --> 43:40.260
Right, but we can't even talk about it like that, right?

43:40.260 --> 43:44.100
So nobody's going to admit that the affair is happening.

43:45.660 --> 43:47.300
There can't be any evidence of it.

43:47.300 --> 43:50.700
It's sort of a just look the other way type of a situation.

43:50.700 --> 43:55.180
But the partner who is not having the affair, right?

43:55.180 --> 43:57.460
They typically know.

43:57.460 --> 44:00.620
They certainly know that their partner is capable of that.

44:01.660 --> 44:02.660
They just kind of know,

44:02.660 --> 44:04.420
but they don't want it in their face.

44:04.420 --> 44:06.980
It would become a problem if it was in their face.

44:08.620 --> 44:10.380
As long as certain needs are met

44:10.380 --> 44:12.500
and everything else is okay at home,

44:12.500 --> 44:15.780
it's just one of those things where don't ask, don't tell.

44:15.780 --> 44:17.180
Well, that's an interesting point

44:17.180 --> 44:19.900
because I had a bunch of arguments with people.

44:19.900 --> 44:23.940
I tend to hang out with, especially in the tech sector,

44:24.900 --> 44:28.420
people who really value honesty and radical honesty.

44:28.420 --> 44:30.460
And I keep arguing with people about this

44:30.460 --> 44:33.660
because to me, it's not that simple.

44:33.660 --> 44:36.020
That's an example right there

44:36.020 --> 44:38.460
that honesty can be really destructive.

44:39.780 --> 44:42.180
Honesty is also a really complicated thing

44:42.180 --> 44:44.540
to get to the bottom of because what is really honest?

44:44.540 --> 44:45.380
Yes.

44:45.380 --> 44:47.780
And how do I look in this dress?

44:48.180 --> 44:50.460
Like there's a million ways to answer that.

44:50.460 --> 44:51.300
It's perspective.

44:51.300 --> 44:52.140
Yeah.

44:52.140 --> 44:53.820
It can be a cesspool in my mind.

44:53.820 --> 44:56.140
If I'm in a bad place or my partner and I haven't,

44:56.140 --> 44:58.820
like if Ty and I haven't been connected lately,

44:58.820 --> 45:02.060
my honesty of what I actually think about him

45:02.060 --> 45:04.740
would be horrifically damaging

45:04.740 --> 45:06.540
and completely unfounded also.

45:06.540 --> 45:09.140
And it can change on a dime.

45:09.140 --> 45:11.780
And that's also not actual honesty

45:11.780 --> 45:14.540
to the big picture of how you feel about him.

45:14.540 --> 45:16.740
I have interacted with a few folks

45:16.780 --> 45:18.700
who talk about their previous sexual partners,

45:18.700 --> 45:22.300
for example, the numbers of sexual partners they've had

45:22.300 --> 45:26.940
and they feel like that kind of honesty

45:26.940 --> 45:30.100
is actually empowering and reaching to the relationship

45:30.100 --> 45:33.980
because all the sexual experiences you've had in the past

45:33.980 --> 45:35.940
make you a better sexual partner,

45:35.940 --> 45:38.140
better partner in the present.

45:38.140 --> 45:40.660
And to me, from the culture I've come from,

45:40.660 --> 45:42.300
that's like anti-romantic.

45:42.300 --> 45:44.260
Yep, yep.

45:44.260 --> 45:47.500
You kind of throw the past kind of away.

45:47.500 --> 45:49.340
You don't really talk about it.

45:49.340 --> 45:51.940
It's kind of there in this amorphous shape,

45:51.940 --> 45:55.100
but it's almost as if you've met together

45:55.100 --> 45:58.980
for the first time and this is a beautiful new thing,

45:58.980 --> 46:01.980
like you're creatures that have woken up

46:01.980 --> 46:03.540
from a long slumber.

46:03.540 --> 46:05.260
Right, you're starting anew.

46:05.260 --> 46:06.100
I'm starting anew.

46:06.100 --> 46:08.820
Right, and you want some mystery there.

46:08.820 --> 46:10.180
Right, I think the mystery,

46:10.180 --> 46:12.140
and like you have to figure that out about each other.

46:12.140 --> 46:15.460
So I'm not exactly sure that honesty is always.

46:15.460 --> 46:16.300
It's different for everyone.

46:16.300 --> 46:18.820
And then also is honesty harmful or helpful

46:18.820 --> 46:19.740
at certain points too?

46:19.740 --> 46:20.580
Yeah.

46:20.580 --> 46:23.500
So you're talking about sort of like disclosing

46:23.500 --> 46:24.980
prior sexual history.

46:24.980 --> 46:26.660
I thought you were going to go to,

46:26.660 --> 46:28.740
so if you've had an affair,

46:28.740 --> 46:30.980
do you hold, do you keep that under your hat?

46:30.980 --> 46:32.500
Oh yeah, that's a really tough question.

46:32.500 --> 46:35.660
Or are you obligated to disclose it?

46:35.660 --> 46:36.500
It's a really, that's a really nice.

46:36.500 --> 46:40.180
It is a very tough question, very tough.

46:40.180 --> 46:41.620
Well, what do you think is the right answer?

46:41.620 --> 46:43.140
I have my own personal beliefs.

46:43.140 --> 46:46.220
I also then like, I have my therapeutic beliefs.

46:46.220 --> 46:50.420
I think frankly, and this is just me as a human being,

46:50.420 --> 46:52.820
not Shannon, the psychologist,

46:52.820 --> 46:55.180
I believe that if you have fucked up,

46:55.180 --> 46:58.100
and again, I'm coming from a framework right now

46:58.100 --> 47:01.940
of monogamy, if you are committed to somebody you love

47:01.940 --> 47:03.580
and you have fucked up,

47:03.580 --> 47:07.820
you don't get to shed your guilt onto them.

47:07.820 --> 47:09.660
You need to carry that burden.

47:09.660 --> 47:11.180
It's not necessarily,

47:11.180 --> 47:14.580
I think it's simplistic and unsophisticated to be like,

47:14.580 --> 47:16.860
but then you're being dishonest.

47:16.860 --> 47:19.780
I think it's actually selfish to unload it

47:19.780 --> 47:23.820
on somebody else and give them the trauma of imagining.

47:23.820 --> 47:27.460
What we do know about infidelity is that it can create

47:27.460 --> 47:30.780
an actual post-traumatic stress-like experience

47:30.780 --> 47:32.500
for the betrayed partner,

47:32.500 --> 47:36.180
where they are having intrusive thoughts about it.

47:36.180 --> 47:38.780
Those are unwanted thoughts and it's uncontrolled.

47:38.780 --> 47:40.420
It comes in at multiple times a day.

47:40.420 --> 47:41.580
They'll have depressed mood.

47:41.580 --> 47:43.500
They'll have nightmares about it.

47:43.500 --> 47:45.980
Their entire sense of security, safety,

47:45.980 --> 47:50.620
self-esteem gets shattered because of your actions.

47:50.620 --> 47:55.620
I think it's kind of, yeah, moralistic and naive to think,

47:56.780 --> 47:58.300
well, they deserve to know the truth

47:58.300 --> 47:59.820
if you actually know the harm

47:59.820 --> 48:01.500
that that sort of betrayal does,

48:03.300 --> 48:07.980
especially if you truly mean to stop it, right?

48:07.980 --> 48:10.460
So if it was a one and done,

48:10.460 --> 48:12.740
or if it happened and you've stopped it

48:12.740 --> 48:15.020
and you do not intend to do it again,

48:15.020 --> 48:17.860
frankly, I think you live with that burden.

48:17.860 --> 48:19.340
You live with that discomfort.

48:19.340 --> 48:21.740
Thank you for saying that because I totally agree,

48:21.740 --> 48:24.100
but it's like, logically,

48:25.180 --> 48:28.980
it doesn't quite make sense to give that advice,

48:28.980 --> 48:31.540
but psychologically makes complete sense

48:31.540 --> 48:34.900
because you really are destroying another person's mind,

48:34.900 --> 48:37.940
their faith in love, in relationships,

48:38.900 --> 48:40.060
their trust, everything,

48:40.060 --> 48:43.500
and then you're imprisoning them to be stuck with you

48:43.500 --> 48:46.100
for months or years if you're trying to work through it,

48:46.100 --> 48:47.660
through that torture.

48:47.660 --> 48:49.220
So you should be carrying that burden

48:49.220 --> 48:50.700
and working through it, I think.

48:50.700 --> 48:53.060
Why do you say that that's your personal opinion

48:53.060 --> 48:54.140
versus your therapeutic?

48:54.140 --> 48:54.980
Like, what?

48:54.980 --> 48:55.820
Therapeutic is more apparent.

48:55.820 --> 48:57.260
Well, I think everybody has different values.

48:57.260 --> 49:00.100
So I think that's a value-based decision

49:00.100 --> 49:03.020
because to me, the hierarchy is kindness

49:03.020 --> 49:05.740
and do no further harm

49:06.580 --> 49:11.580
over, in that case, over truth, right?

49:12.620 --> 49:16.100
Whereas other people, my husband, for instance,

49:16.100 --> 49:18.100
he is like truth above all else.

49:18.100 --> 49:21.060
You don't get to decide what I know,

49:21.060 --> 49:23.060
or you don't get to decide whether or not

49:23.060 --> 49:24.220
I can handle that knowledge.

49:24.220 --> 49:26.980
So he would even see my determination

49:26.980 --> 49:31.180
of that I should carry the burden arrogant.

49:31.180 --> 49:33.140
Well, why don't you let your partner decide

49:33.140 --> 49:35.780
whether or not they, you know, why do you get to choose?

49:35.780 --> 49:36.620
I don't know.

49:36.620 --> 49:38.900
I think there's value to both arguments.

49:38.900 --> 49:40.820
I absolutely see his point.

49:40.820 --> 49:41.660
It's fascinating.

49:41.660 --> 49:42.860
I absolutely see his point.

49:42.860 --> 49:45.860
And his, I think, is like a very humble sort of option.

49:45.860 --> 49:48.940
Like, you don't get to choose what's better.

49:48.940 --> 49:51.420
You just need to give them the information

49:51.420 --> 49:53.260
and they can choose.

49:53.260 --> 49:56.300
But I think, I don't know, I think it's kinder to hold.

49:56.300 --> 49:59.420
I think it's going to cause your conscience more discomfort

49:59.420 --> 50:00.260
to hold it.

50:00.260 --> 50:02.740
And I think there's sort of a cleansing we do

50:02.740 --> 50:04.220
when we share that information.

50:04.220 --> 50:05.540
I think in real life,

50:05.540 --> 50:08.140
most people disclose it because they can't stand

50:08.140 --> 50:10.220
the secret anymore themselves.

50:10.220 --> 50:11.980
That to me is a selfish act.

50:11.980 --> 50:14.700
I have unemployment applications and so on.

50:14.700 --> 50:17.820
And just with friends would ask people,

50:17.820 --> 50:20.660
would he care more about truth or loyalty?

50:20.660 --> 50:22.780
Just to get to see how they think about

50:22.780 --> 50:24.940
those different questions.

50:24.940 --> 50:29.740
And yeah, I was surprised how much variance

50:29.740 --> 50:30.580
there is on that.

50:30.580 --> 50:32.660
And also conceptually, I bet,

50:33.620 --> 50:36.260
conceptually, I don't think we actually know where we stand

50:36.260 --> 50:38.540
until we're faced with a situation like that.

50:38.540 --> 50:41.260
Yeah, I think people, a lot of people,

50:41.260 --> 50:43.420
especially when they're younger, say,

50:43.420 --> 50:45.420
especially if they're kind of intellectual,

50:45.420 --> 50:47.420
they'll say truth above all else.

50:47.420 --> 50:48.260
Yeah.

50:48.260 --> 50:49.100
It's like, all right.

50:49.100 --> 50:50.060
You're exactly right.

50:50.060 --> 50:50.900
All right.

50:52.900 --> 50:54.340
It's a platitude.

50:54.340 --> 50:57.340
Until you get to hear a truth that truly breaks you,

50:57.340 --> 51:00.300
that truly hurts you or causes suffering to you.

51:01.140 --> 51:03.220
And then you realize, or a truth you give to somebody else

51:03.220 --> 51:04.860
will cause them suffering.

51:04.860 --> 51:08.300
And then you get to see that suffering destroy their life

51:08.300 --> 51:10.020
and maybe your relationship and so on.

51:10.020 --> 51:10.860
And then you're like, oh.

51:10.860 --> 51:12.740
Yeah, like should I sit my dad down right now

51:12.740 --> 51:16.100
and be like, dad, you have dementia again today.

51:16.100 --> 51:18.060
I'm gonna tell you, dad, you're not making sense.

51:18.060 --> 51:20.940
No, it's not going to be discussed.

51:20.940 --> 51:22.180
We're gonna make him uncomfortable.

51:22.180 --> 51:25.140
And I mean, yeah, I think truth can be a little bit

51:25.140 --> 51:26.380
of a platitude sometimes.

51:26.380 --> 51:29.500
Some of those complexities are all the things involved

51:29.500 --> 51:32.820
in the challenges of what makes a relationship work.

51:33.980 --> 51:37.420
What do you think about open relationships in general?

51:37.420 --> 51:40.380
My worldview is such that I see the beauty

51:40.380 --> 51:43.140
and value in monogamous relationships just for me,

51:43.140 --> 51:46.780
but I'm also open to the possibility

51:46.780 --> 51:48.540
of what works for other people.

51:48.540 --> 51:49.780
Have you done any kind of work

51:49.780 --> 51:51.900
with the people in open relationships?

51:51.900 --> 51:53.020
As clients or research?

51:53.020 --> 51:53.860
As clients.

51:53.860 --> 51:55.140
Oh yeah, yeah.

51:55.140 --> 51:56.700
Is there some interesting differences

51:56.900 --> 52:00.660
between open relationships and monogamous relationships?

52:00.660 --> 52:03.060
You know, I think that may have been actually

52:03.060 --> 52:07.100
what was behind my question about the satisfaction

52:07.100 --> 52:08.180
with them being on the extremes.

52:08.180 --> 52:11.620
My hypothesis essentially was, is it because they,

52:11.620 --> 52:13.540
if you are really all in,

52:13.540 --> 52:15.060
you've worked out some of the kinks.

52:15.060 --> 52:20.060
I think I've seen couples who are trying it out

52:21.420 --> 52:24.780
for the first time, it tends to get a little haywire.

52:24.780 --> 52:26.420
There's some excitement in the beginning.

52:26.420 --> 52:28.300
Everybody's really excited about it.

52:29.180 --> 52:31.940
I think the philosophy makes sense to a lot of people.

52:32.820 --> 52:35.100
The science of it makes sense to a lot of people.

52:35.100 --> 52:38.300
And, but we have been raised in a society

52:38.300 --> 52:39.740
that is pretty monogamous.

52:39.740 --> 52:43.260
So there isn't a lot of scaffolding around it.

52:43.260 --> 52:45.820
And there's a lot of inner conflict, I think,

52:45.820 --> 52:47.380
for people to go away from the values

52:47.380 --> 52:49.580
that they've been taught since they were kids.

52:49.580 --> 52:52.020
And so jealousy arises a lot.

52:52.020 --> 52:56.940
And also it's very difficult to be, I think,

52:56.940 --> 52:59.420
as truthful and direct as you need to be,

52:59.420 --> 53:02.460
which you're describing in these polyamorous situations

53:02.460 --> 53:05.980
where everybody is laid out on the table.

53:05.980 --> 53:08.180
So I think that's something that may be practiced

53:08.180 --> 53:10.460
in my own work with clients.

53:10.460 --> 53:15.460
I've just noticed that the partners who are happier

53:17.580 --> 53:20.100
in these situations who I've worked with,

53:20.100 --> 53:21.900
they are more experienced at it.

53:23.180 --> 53:24.540
They seem to have it down.

53:25.540 --> 53:29.580
You testified in the Johnny Depp Amber Heard trial

53:29.580 --> 53:32.700
based on your role as a clinical and forensic psychologist.

53:32.700 --> 53:34.780
It was watched by, I don't know how many people,

53:34.780 --> 53:37.500
maybe tens, maybe hundreds of millions of people.

53:37.500 --> 53:38.820
What was that experience like?

53:38.820 --> 53:41.460
Thank God I didn't know that at the time.

53:41.460 --> 53:43.180
Were you scared?

53:43.180 --> 53:44.060
Oh yeah.

53:44.060 --> 53:45.380
Given the size of the platform,

53:45.380 --> 53:47.180
how many people are watching?

53:47.180 --> 53:49.500
Scared typically isn't the word when I testify.

53:49.580 --> 53:54.060
I'm always excited and a little trepidatious

53:54.060 --> 53:57.660
before I testify because the stakes are so high

53:57.660 --> 53:59.660
for everybody's life in that room.

54:01.180 --> 54:02.580
This was different.

54:02.580 --> 54:06.340
I, anxiety isn't usually my brand.

54:07.380 --> 54:09.740
And I just skipped anxiety that morning

54:09.740 --> 54:10.940
and went straight to terror.

54:10.940 --> 54:11.780
And I was mad.

54:11.780 --> 54:13.260
I was mad at the legal.

54:13.260 --> 54:14.100
I was funny.

54:14.100 --> 54:15.500
Like I was having all these strong emotions.

54:15.500 --> 54:17.420
I couldn't find my bobby pins.

54:17.420 --> 54:20.060
I almost started crying because I couldn't find them.

54:20.940 --> 54:22.580
I was pretty unhinged that morning

54:22.580 --> 54:25.340
and in a way that was really unfamiliar to me.

54:26.180 --> 54:27.820
And it was right when I cried

54:27.820 --> 54:29.820
because I couldn't find my bobby pins

54:29.820 --> 54:32.620
that I realized I needed to get a grip

54:32.620 --> 54:33.740
and that I was a professional

54:33.740 --> 54:35.300
and that my hair didn't matter,

54:35.300 --> 54:36.700
even though it ended up mattering,

54:36.700 --> 54:38.460
people noticed that it was crazy.

54:39.660 --> 54:43.180
But I got a grip and I went in and I just did my job.

54:44.100 --> 54:47.420
So the terror in the end helped you focus

54:47.420 --> 54:48.820
and do your job well.

54:48.820 --> 54:49.780
I think it does.

54:49.780 --> 54:51.020
And it's a little scary though

54:51.020 --> 54:53.900
because I know what fear does cognitively.

54:53.900 --> 54:58.540
And there is a sweet spot where you want some stress

54:58.540 --> 55:02.300
and then you can be really acutely focused and attuned.

55:02.300 --> 55:05.140
But then if you go over this threshold,

55:05.140 --> 55:08.300
you get sort of that frontal lobe shutdown

55:08.300 --> 55:09.620
where you're not thinking clearly.

55:09.620 --> 55:10.900
And everybody knows that experience

55:10.900 --> 55:12.980
from taking a really stressful test at some point,

55:13.780 --> 55:14.620
like in high school.

55:14.620 --> 55:15.580
And then they're going over the answers

55:15.580 --> 55:17.140
with the teacher in class later.

55:17.140 --> 55:18.860
And they're like, how did I miss that question?

55:18.860 --> 55:21.780
I know that you're just in a different state.

55:21.780 --> 55:24.260
That's when you have too much stress.

55:24.260 --> 55:26.580
I think this day I actually was bordering

55:26.580 --> 55:29.900
on too much stress, if not clearly in that threshold.

55:29.900 --> 55:34.060
But once you're sitting there for a little bit

55:34.060 --> 55:35.020
and you're asked the questions,

55:35.020 --> 55:36.620
you can kind of go into a routine

55:36.620 --> 55:39.460
of just wanting to talk about your work.

55:39.460 --> 55:44.460
So what is the work, the job of a forensic psychologist

55:44.620 --> 55:46.420
in that context?

55:46.420 --> 55:51.420
In the DEPHRD trial, I was serving as an expert witness

55:52.540 --> 55:57.020
based on a psychological evaluation of one of the parties.

55:57.020 --> 56:00.460
So forensic psychologists can serve the court

56:00.460 --> 56:02.700
or in legal matters in a number of ways.

56:02.700 --> 56:04.700
They can act as a confidential consultant

56:04.700 --> 56:09.100
for an attorney on a case, or they can,

56:09.180 --> 56:10.780
even assist with jury selection.

56:10.780 --> 56:13.380
They might testify without doing an evaluation

56:13.380 --> 56:14.860
if they're just coming to testify

56:14.860 --> 56:17.820
about sort of a subject matter.

56:17.820 --> 56:20.460
And then they wouldn't be answering specific questions

56:20.460 --> 56:21.420
to either of the parties,

56:21.420 --> 56:25.580
but just talking more hypothetically about a field area.

56:25.580 --> 56:30.580
In this case, because I was ordered to conduct an evaluation,

56:31.100 --> 56:32.940
I evaluated one of the parties,

56:32.940 --> 56:36.220
and then you provide a report to the court

56:36.220 --> 56:40.020
with your findings, and then you testify

56:40.020 --> 56:41.900
as to what your findings were.

56:41.900 --> 56:43.660
But from my perspective, just watching you,

56:43.660 --> 56:46.100
you seem to have held it together really well.

56:46.100 --> 56:48.420
So what do you attribute that to?

56:48.420 --> 56:50.100
So you said like it calmed down

56:50.100 --> 56:51.980
after you were able to ask the questions.

56:51.980 --> 56:55.540
So to me, if I were just to put myself in your place,

56:57.540 --> 57:00.300
it seems like the internet and the world

57:00.300 --> 57:03.540
would be very nitpicky about individual words.

57:03.540 --> 57:08.540
You're speaking from a place of scientific rigor,

57:09.980 --> 57:12.820
and so you have to be very precise with your wording.

57:12.820 --> 57:15.060
I would feel like so much pressure

57:15.060 --> 57:17.380
about each single word I choose.

57:17.380 --> 57:18.460
Did you feel that pressure

57:18.460 --> 57:21.820
that you have to be extremely precise with the words?

57:21.820 --> 57:23.100
Always.

57:23.100 --> 57:26.340
The pressure is so high going into testifying.

57:26.340 --> 57:29.700
I think that's where I feel the most pressure is preparing,

57:29.700 --> 57:34.220
and literally the moment until I start having to answer.

57:34.220 --> 57:37.540
And then I don't even have the luxury

57:37.540 --> 57:41.100
of thinking about myself because it is so important

57:41.100 --> 57:45.700
that that answer be clarified and understandable

57:45.700 --> 57:48.020
to the court that that becomes my focus.

57:48.020 --> 57:51.780
And that's the godsend is that I can stop thinking

57:51.780 --> 57:55.460
about how scary it all is because I need to pay attention

57:55.460 --> 57:57.300
to explaining something.

57:57.300 --> 57:59.340
So if it's okay, I would love to talk to you

57:59.340 --> 58:02.140
about the personality assessment test

58:02.140 --> 58:04.780
because I think it's actually super fascinating.

58:04.780 --> 58:07.380
The personality assessment inventory or the MMPI-2?

58:07.380 --> 58:09.060
You're probably referring to the MMPI-2,

58:09.060 --> 58:10.740
which is one I talked a lot about.

58:10.740 --> 58:12.180
MMPI-2, yeah.

58:12.180 --> 58:15.980
So maybe can you explain the MMPI-2?

58:15.980 --> 58:17.620
Seems fascinating.

58:17.620 --> 58:20.460
It has like its output, the results,

58:20.460 --> 58:23.140
has some basic scales as code types.

58:23.140 --> 58:24.980
It's just reading through the different.

58:24.980 --> 58:25.820
It's so complex.

58:25.820 --> 58:26.660
It's the thing of beauty.

58:26.660 --> 58:29.620
Because the human mind is really complicated.

58:29.620 --> 58:34.620
Even depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,

58:35.540 --> 58:37.980
all of these things are really complicated.

58:37.980 --> 58:41.660
There's like many of them we don't understand well.

58:41.660 --> 58:43.460
There seems to be a huge amount of variance.

58:43.460 --> 58:47.020
And yet you have to be able to stitch together

58:47.020 --> 58:49.620
a bunch of characteristics that give you intuition

58:49.620 --> 58:53.860
about the unique aspects of each person.

58:53.860 --> 58:55.380
You want to be able to have tests

58:55.380 --> 59:00.380
that get you closer to identifying the peculiar flaws

59:00.740 --> 59:03.620
or beauties of a particular mind.

59:03.620 --> 59:05.740
So this seems to do a good job.

59:05.740 --> 59:08.020
Just reading through the different descriptions

59:08.020 --> 59:08.860
of the code text. Can I borrow that?

59:08.860 --> 59:09.700
Can somebody testify?

59:09.700 --> 59:11.500
That was the best description.

59:11.500 --> 59:12.740
I don't know, I'm being poetic.

59:12.740 --> 59:13.580
I apologize.

59:13.580 --> 59:15.340
No, that was a beautiful description.

59:15.340 --> 59:17.380
You have to be in part poetic about the human mind.

59:17.380 --> 59:19.620
It's not math, it's psychology.

59:19.620 --> 59:20.820
Okay.

59:20.820 --> 59:22.900
So what is the MMPI-2?

59:22.900 --> 59:25.540
Like what are we talking about here?

59:25.540 --> 59:28.420
Like it's a questionnaire?

59:28.420 --> 59:29.860
Yes, that's a great start.

59:29.860 --> 59:34.860
So it is a questionnaire, yet 567 yes, no questions.

59:36.500 --> 59:39.260
I'm gonna tell you what's most beautiful about this test.

59:39.260 --> 59:42.780
So they use an empirical keying method to develop it.

59:42.780 --> 59:46.200
What that means is that they didn't have a bunch

59:46.200 --> 59:48.100
of psychologists get together and say,

59:48.100 --> 59:52.620
let's ask them, let's make sure that we identify people

59:52.620 --> 59:55.340
who have somatic complaints or physical complaints

59:55.340 --> 59:59.340
by asking them questions about like numbness in their hands,

59:59.340 --> 01:00:00.300
nothing like that.

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.860
What they did instead was they threw,

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:04.740
you know, like take a thousand questions

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.060
at a group of people who they know

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:07.420
had a certain mental illness

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:10.060
and a group of people who didn't have that mental illness.

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:13.100
And then they looked for patterns

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:16.820
in what the people with the mental illness endorsed

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:21.060
as yes and no of those random questions.

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.740
So it would be, for instance,

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.940
there's a bronze light fixture right there.

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:27.480
One of the questions out of the thousand might be,

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:32.220
I like light fixtures that are bronze, true or false.

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.420
And they looked for correlations

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.740
in the way people would answer

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:39.780
to these completely innocuous, just boring questions.

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:43.460
So there was no real way that a test taker

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:46.700
could foresee the point of answering.

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.100
Mm-hmm.

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:50.460
And so because they can't foresee,

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.780
it's very difficult to cheat to get to a conclusion

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:53.620
that you brought up. Very difficult.

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:57.580
And not only that, but you can imagine using that approach,

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:00.420
you can then look for patterns

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:04.820
for almost any type of response style

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.660
for any type of personality trait,

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:08.180
any type of mental illness.

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:10.180
You just get a comparison group

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:12.920
and then a group who's using that specific strategy

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.000
or has that specific mental illness

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.700
or has that personality trait.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.000
And you just look for patterns.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.720
And there's a scale output of different kinds.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.400
So I think- And there's code types.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.600
Yep, so you've got validity scales

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.200
and those are just fascinating

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.620
and often one of the most useful parts

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:37.520
of this test in forensic contexts

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.400
because they show you how a person is approaching the test,

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.120
how they're answering questions about themselves.

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:49.120
So for instance, you can see if they are tired,

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:52.060
you can see if they're kind of responding randomly,

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:55.480
you can see if they are in an unsophisticated manner

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.840
trying to make themselves look perfect,

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.240
but not very nuanced.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.480
You can see if they may be deceiving themselves

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:05.560
and truly believe that they are perfect,

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.500
whereas others don't see it that way.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.120
You can see if they're exaggerating,

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.360
you can see if they're exaggerating

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.740
because they're truly, it's a cry for help.

01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:15.100
They are in extreme distress,

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:18.240
but they feel as though they need to really punctuate it

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.640
to get people to notice.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.080
Or you can see if they're exaggerating

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:26.080
in a way that is driven for a specific outcome or gain.

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.440
It's just fascinating

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.040
and it's the most well-developed assessment we have

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:35.080
for a person's approach

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.200
to answering questions about themselves.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.520
So it gives you the context of-

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.720
How honest they're being.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.400
The state of the person is their answer to them.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.400
Yeah, yeah, their honesty.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.480
How forthcoming they're being

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.160
and how accurate they're being.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.640
And then the result of the classification

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.080
based on the test are these code types.

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:56.560
Right, well, so you have these clinical scales as well.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:00.040
You have 10 clinical scales that look for different

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:03.740
kind of primary clinical pathology issues.

01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:06.280
This test doesn't tell you anything good about yourself.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.800
At best, it just tells you that you're not responding

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.280
in a way that is dishonest

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.960
and that you are not hugely problematic,

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.320
but it's not looking for strength.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.880
So you have these 10 clinical scales

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:24.160
that look for variations above the mean of the population

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:28.940
in certain areas, anywhere from depressive symptoms,

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:33.480
manic symptoms, physical complaints, anxiety, nervousness,

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.160
aggression, social engagement,

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.120
whole scope of human experience.

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:42.560
And then there are much more nuanced scales from those,

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.480
so little subscales.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:48.400
And then the real power though of the MMPI-2 is in,

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.000
as you said, these code types.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.400
And these code types are additional patterns

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.760
that have been detected

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.840
that really can be more defining of a personality.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.680
So you look for peaks.

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:04.640
There can be either two extreme peaks or three typically

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.920
that make a code type.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.520
And those peaks are higher scores

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:10.800
on these personality traits.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:14.240
And specific code types can give you a very nuanced picture

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.680
of a person's general approach to life

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:20.560
and their personal relationships, just their personality.

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:23.640
So you can build on top of those code types

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.880
and understanding, yeah,

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.280
how that person's going to deal

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.600
with different kinds of situations.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.600
And then there's, by the way, a lot of code types.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.440
There are a lot of code types.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.280
I was looking at them.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.100
They're pretty interesting.

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:32.940
It is truly fascinating.

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.880
I want to take this test.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.440
I wanted to see which one I would-

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.360
I have given it to some people in my life.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:39.880
It's just phenomenal.

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:42.920
How hard is it on your side of the table to give the test?

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.100
Oh, it's easy.

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:44.940
You just proctor it.

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:47.700
You just make sure that somebody, there's no distraction,

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.640
that they're well rested, they are sitting there

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.960
and they can just take it in front of you.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.300
So I guess the question is,

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.980
because the questions are well designed

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:57.400
and that it's hard to mess with them,

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.240
do you just give the-

01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.540
It's very hard to beat it.

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:00.840
You just hand it to them.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.100
And it's yes and no.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.000
It's yes and no.

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.120
Okay.

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.680
But I should also add to this,

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:11.040
that this test, as much as I love it,

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.240
and it is the most researched

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.080
and widely used personality assessment in the world,

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.280
it is not in and of itself definitive.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:24.140
So you use it like you already have sort of a hypothesis

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.560
and you use this for clarification.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.600
Yeah.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:31.840
And it has a ton of value for showing somebody's response

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.040
or their approach, how forthcoming they're being.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:35.960
But other than that,

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:39.040
you really need to consider it as a piece of the puzzle.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.800
You had said stitch together earlier

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.600
and that was just one of those points you made

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.340
that was perfect for describing this.

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.840
There's probably no one perfect test, right,

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.000
for personality?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:50.840
No.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:56.860
I wonder, especially with advancements of AI,

01:05:56.860 --> 01:06:00.800
there could be more and more sophisticated ways

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:04.160
of measuring, of collecting data about your behavior.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.000
Absolutely, there could be.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.560
And being able to measure some kind of more productive,

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:10.660
kind of, especially not in a forensic context,

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:13.800
but more in trying to figure out

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.280
how to improve your lifestyle,

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.800
improve your relationships, all that kind of stuff.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:22.840
So the results of the test with Amber Heard,

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.920
if you can speak to the public stuff,

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:29.280
you said that the results of Ms. Heard's evaluation

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.720
supported two diagnoses, borderline personality disorder

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:36.720
and histrionic personality disorder.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.520
Can you speak to each one of those?

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.360
What are they?

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.880
What are the basic characteristics

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.880
of borderline personality disorder?

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:44.720
Sure.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.120
Well, so right now, the DSM-5,

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:51.120
which is sort of the Bible for mental disorders,

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:53.560
it's what we go to, our diagnostic manual,

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:57.720
it classifies personality disorders according to clusters.

01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:01.360
And cluster B is one that involves

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.200
the emotionally erratic,

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.720
interpersonally erratic emotional disorders.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.600
And those include histrionic personality disorder,

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.760
borderline personality disorder,

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:14.160
narcissistic personality disorder,

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:17.160
and antisocial personality disorder.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.960
Eventually, there's been some research on this,

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.960
and I think it's important to think about

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.840
and a lot of support for us eventually moving

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.920
into a more spectrum type approach

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.840
to considering personality disorders

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:34.800
where you'd essentially be looking at dysfunction

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.000
in different domains of somebody's functioning

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.720
that has persisted over time.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:42.280
And again, the really important part is

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:46.240
it seems to be a stable trait part of their personality

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.200
that it's in their interpersonal relationships,

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.560
it's in how they handle their own life,

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.200
their own functioning, their mood,

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.080
and it's not just situation-based,

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.560
it seems to be all areas.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:02.320
I don't love the title histrionic personality disorder.

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:07.240
I think its history is, it's pretty controversial

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:09.840
and there's some misogyny in it.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:13.800
But that all being said, as a servant to the court

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:17.000
and somebody who is there to just provide the science

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.560
as it exists today, my job is to relay

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.200
and in this specific case I was ordered

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:26.240
to provide my diagnostic impressions a diagnosis

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.840
and I don't get to decide which diagnosis,

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.320
whether I like a certain diagnosis or not.

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:35.160
Ultimately, if the criteria are met,

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.920
that diagnosis is given.

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.080
So as we have it right now

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.640
with the current personality disorder categories,

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.080
histrionic personality disorder

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.560
is probably the most controversial.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.280
Some people believe that it is

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:50.120
narcissistic personality disorder light.

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.080
So sort of a less obvious,

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:58.560
less malicious version of narcissistic personality disorder.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.880
And I think that will probably get sussed out

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:05.240
if we do move to a more spectrum-based approach

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.800
because then you would be describing

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.200
sort of a personality disorder

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:10.240
and then you would add the traits to it.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:15.000
So with issues in interpersonal functioning and et cetera.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.120
So you could be a little bit more specific

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.600
rather than having to just put somebody in a category.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.880
So that's where things are moving, you're saying?

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.480
That's where things are moving.

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:26.840
From a clusters-based view of NPD,

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.280
antisocial personality disorder.

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:32.360
To more of a spectrum with personality dysfunction

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:35.360
then you list the traits that are there.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.520
And I think that'll be more accurate,

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.480
especially there's so much overlap

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:41.360
between these personality disorders right now,

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.200
especially cluster B, it is not uncommon for people

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.040
to have two or three personality disorders

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.680
to meet criteria for two or three at the same time.

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:53.640
So speaking about borderline personality disorder

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.560
and histrionic personality disorder,

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.480
borderline personality disorder can best be thought of

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:03.880
as a disorder of instability and impulsiveness,

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:05.920
emotional instability,

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:09.960
instability in a person's self-identity, sense of self,

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:12.600
instability in a person's relationships,

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.680
and then underlying all of this

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:17.400
is an intense fear of abandonment.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:21.960
Histrionic personality disorder is more of a disorder

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:26.120
of emotionality, dramatics, and attention-seeking.

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:33.680
Histrionic disorder typically is known for the dramatics,

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.520
and people who are observing or interacting with somebody

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:38.560
with this disorder may even feel themselves

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:41.160
almost kind of wanting to turn away.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:44.320
There's a sense of play acting as the person is speaking

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.440
or engaging with you.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.720
Something just feels a little bit disingenuous,

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.440
and a lot of attention-seeking.

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.280
Similar to borderline personality disorder,

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.200
you might see with histrionic personality disorder,

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.680
attempts to manipulate.

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:01.600
However, the motivation with histrionic personality disorder

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.560
is that attention,

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.960
whereas with borderline personality disorder,

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.920
the underlying motivation for almost everything

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.840
is to avoid abandonment.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.880
So you'll see frantic attempts to avoid abandonment,

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.680
frantic attempts to keep people close,

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:18.000
and those frantic attempts can be really harmful

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.480
to the person and to others.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:21.760
To the person themselves.

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:27.400
So the fear of abandonment can result

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.920
in the very thing you're afraid of.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:33.600
Right, and there has been some research also

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.160
to suggest that borderline personality disorder

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.560
has different types as well,

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.280
and I think this is really important

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.920
because in my own work,

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.320
I have encountered many people

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.320
with borderline personality disorder in my own life, right?

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.680
And there are different types, right?

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.520
I'm thinking specifically of a girl

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:58.160
I really love who I've worked with for years

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:02.320
who is so self-aware about this and endearing,

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:06.400
and she owns her shit.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.120
I can forgive almost anything

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.240
if somebody just owns their shit.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.400
She might lose her temper, she might lash out,

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.080
she can be erratic, but she will come back

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:23.160
and apologize, own it, and accept full responsibility,

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:27.480
and not only that, but identify it and make changes.

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.680
She doesn't want to be harmful.

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:30.840
I adore that about her.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.520
I think it's an admirable quality more of us could have.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:39.000
That's very different than when you think about it,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.080
there are nine different symptoms,

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.000
and you only need five to meet criteria.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.480
So depending on which symptoms you have,

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:48.720
you might be far more calculated,

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.280
conniving, manipulative,

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:52.600
or you may just be more of the impulsive,

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.960
kind of messy, emotionally erratic type.

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.360
And so there's some new research also coming out

01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:01.080
that's even suggested that among women,

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.680
those that score higher

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:05.040
in some of these more calculated traits

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.040
of the disorder may actually be,

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:11.480
it may be a certain presentation of female psychopathy.

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:13.600
Yeah.

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:16.760
Are some of these personality disorders,

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.680
again, probably impossible question to answer,

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:21.240
but how much of it is nature?

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.080
How much of it is nurture?

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.440
Or how much of it is in the genetics

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.080
and you just can't do much with?

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.720
Maybe another question, a different way to ask that is,

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.800
how much can you help that?

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.560
How much can you become better?

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:37.720
That is a tough question.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:40.720
So there's been a ton of change

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.000
in the way we've thought about the etiology

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.320
of these personality disorders,

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.880
specific to borderline personality disorder.

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:52.720
I think in general, the view is that most people believe

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:57.360
that it was associated with neglect or trauma in childhood.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.280
While there is a correlation there,

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.880
there's a correlation between that

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.800
and many mental health issues,

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:05.160
not just borderline personality disorder.

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:09.040
We also, there is evidence to support a genetic basis

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:10.720
for this personality disorder.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:14.120
And there are people who have borderline personality disorder

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.360
that report no childhood trauma or difficulty.

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.160
Sometimes things just happen.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.680
So I think it's a mix.

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.160
I think we need to think of it as biopsychosocial,

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:30.320
which is generally the answer to most things

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:31.200
when you're talking about

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.680
how a mental health issue comes to be.

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:38.840
I certainly think that in most cases,

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.920
and here's just me speaking personally again,

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:45.600
I think in my own work, in most cases, what I see

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:49.760
is that somebody may have some sort of predisposition,

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.840
then they go through certain life events

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.680
and learn patterns of behaving

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:57.280
that may serve them well as a child

01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.600
in a dysfunctional situation,

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.800
but end up being very problematic later on.

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:04.400
Or they just have enough hardship that gene,

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.280
whatever it was, lying dormant,

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.800
that little borderline personality disorder gene

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:09.840
expresses itself.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.240
And you'll see that with things like schizophrenia,

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:14.360
depression, anxiety disorders,

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:15.880
there tend to be certain ages

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:18.840
where you'll just see that expression happen.

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:23.400
All right, for the record, it got cold in here,

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.560
so we upgraded with a blanket.

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:28.880
You look cozy.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:33.400
Just as a question for me, just observing the trial,

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:37.480
it was interesting that, first of all,

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.400
it was a really raw and honest exploration

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:45.240
of intimate relationship between two people.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.560
It was interesting to watch.

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:49.600
I suppose I haven't watched that kind of thing.

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.120
It made me think about

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.400
what makes for a good relationship.

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:55.640
All the many things we already talked about

01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:00.040
in this conversation, it was useful for that.

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.240
But also there was raw recordings

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:05.200
of two humans' interaction.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:08.080
What did you think about that, that there's recordings?

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:08.920
It's kind of interesting.

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:10.560
The act of recording your partner?

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:14.080
Yeah, not the ethics of that or so on,

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.840
but the fact that you have this data.

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:18.600
It made me wonder, if I recorded myself,

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.400
how would I sound?

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.640
Well, you do record yourself.

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:23.040
No, but here with microphones.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:26.360
When you're in private, you wonder,

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:33.320
I had a bit of a fight with a friend last week,

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:38.080
and I wondered which one of us was the asshole.

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.040
I would love to hear the recording,

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.640
because we were a little bit,

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.680
I think we were a little bit rude to each other,

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.760
and I wonder how it went wrong.

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:48.000
I love that you asked yourself that question.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.040
That's so useful.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.160
We made up the next day,

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.080
and I think both agreed to not ever talk about it.

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:54.920
But I want the data.

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.400
Just bury it deep.

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.600
I record my couple sessions,

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:01.320
and one of the primary purposes of that

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:05.800
is so that if they start to get nasty with each other

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:08.680
in the session, I can stop it,

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:11.040
and I can say, what was that?

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:14.960
And most of the time, what you're describing is so useful

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.480
because we don't see ourselves.

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:19.280
We have no idea that we just came off as critical.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:23.080
We think we're being completely reasonable and thoughtful.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:26.400
Whenever somebody is sort of retelling an argument

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.240
they got in, they said,

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:30.360
and then I was just scaring and just asked,

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:33.120
I mean, why, is there a reason you didn't?

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.200
Something like that.

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.720
If they can actually see themselves,

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.960
they realize, no, their jaw was clenched,

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:41.280
their voice was raised, they actually called a name.

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.720
Sometimes they're shocked.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:46.440
So just a quick, just to linger on it,

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.760
the, you labeled Amber Heard as a three-six code type,

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.400
going back to our discussion,

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.520
which can mean that, quote,

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.040
she's heavily concerned with the image,

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.840
prone to treating others with cruelty,

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.840
unable to admit responsibility for wrongdoing,

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:05.080
and prone to externalizing blame.

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:10.080
And then I also went into the MMPI2 list.

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:13.200
Three-six includes anxiety, tension,

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.120
rigidity, fear of criticism,

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.440
suppressed hostility, merging impassive,

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:22.360
or episodic aggression, suspiciousness,

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:25.800
egocentricity, what else, projection.

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.840
What can you say about that code

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.880
that is not captured in the different personality disorders?

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:33.480
What are we supposed to do that

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.360
from a forensic psychology perspective?

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.520
And what are we supposed to do that in general?

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:39.680
Forget the three-six.

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:42.600
In general, these kinds of code types in that context,

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:43.920
in the context of a trial.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.320
If I'm understanding you correctly,

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.680
it's sort of what's the point of these code types.

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:48.520
Yeah.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.520
Thank you for asking the question better.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:54.320
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.880
I just actually honestly really find MMPI2 fascinating.

01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.320
I love that you do.

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:01.920
I love that you get it because I just,

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:04.120
to me, it's such a,

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.440
it's almost unbelievable that humans created it,

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:10.160
but I think that goes back to that empirical key method

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:12.960
of creating something that enabled it

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.440
to be as robust as it is,

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:17.320
and something that is very difficult to beat,

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:18.520
if not impossible.

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.120
But the code types really,

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:25.960
so it depends on, in any forensic case,

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:29.680
what really matters is the legal, psycho-legal question.

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:31.280
So what is the legal question,

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.800
and then what is the psychologist's responsibility

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.040
in assisting with whatever question they're being asked?

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.800
And there's some questions we can't answer,

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:39.900
some that we can.

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:43.360
You don't always need to provide a diagnosis

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.840
when you're asked to provide a report.

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.280
It depends on the jurisdiction.

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.320
It depends on the statute.

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:51.000
Some jurisdictions actually require a diagnosis.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.920
In this case, I was asked to provide a diagnosis.

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:56.720
So when I'm considering a diagnosis,

01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:00.520
you're integrating multiple different sources of information.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.800
You're integrating an examinee self-report.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:07.400
You are adding collateral data, usually.

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:11.760
I wasn't able to obtain collateral interviews in this case,

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.400
and that was the decision of the court.

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.240
They said no collateral interviews,

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:19.280
but typically that would be something that you would add.

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:22.080
You're looking at records, ideally, from birth

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:26.280
up until the date that the alleged injury occurred,

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.760
and I'm speaking now specifically

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.480
to a personal injury evaluation,

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:31.280
or something where somebody is claiming

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:34.040
that they were harmed psychologically.

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:36.000
But you want as many records as possible

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.960
to show how a person functioned before that event occurred

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.800
and how they functioned after.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:44.280
And you want it to show financial functioning,

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:46.880
physical functioning, academic functioning,

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.880
basically where is there evidence

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:51.880
that something in their life changed?

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.000
Where is there evidence that harm occurred

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.560
other than from what they're telling you?

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:00.800
And in addition to all of those records

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:03.480
that you're reviewing, in addition to their self-report,

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.920
then you're also going to give some of these tests,

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:07.280
like the MMPI.

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:12.280
So the code types are really that strength of the MMPI-2.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.160
It gives you really nuanced information

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.840
about a person's personality.

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:18.520
Now, again, you're not going to use the MMPI-2

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:22.720
or any other test by itself to diagnose someone,

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:25.680
or decide that the person is telling the truth,

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.520
not telling the truth.

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.800
It is just another piece of data.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.160
And when it's working the way it's supposed to,

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:35.840
it lines up really nicely with all of the other data

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:38.040
that you're getting, including what you've observed

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:40.280
from the person during your interview with them,

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:41.840
the information they're giving you,

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:44.920
or inconsistencies with the information they're giving you,

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:48.200
the consistency or inconsistency of their self-report

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.480
from the records, what the records themselves say,

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:52.680
et cetera, et cetera.

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.760
So it's adding, it's helping you clarify

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.720
and clarify and clarify the picture you have of the person.

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.240
Yep, just dialing it down more and more.

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:02.760
You're just making sure that it is as accurate as possible.

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.320
Okay, so given how huge this trial was,

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:08.120
given how eloquent you were,

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:09.640
I know you don't think of it that way,

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:14.200
but from a public perspective, you were like the star

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:15.040
because of how well you did.

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:15.880
That's insane.

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.320
I'm pretty sure Camille's the star.

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.440
Camille is also incredible.

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.360
I've gotten a chance to interact with her.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:28.360
She's somebody that really inspires me

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:31.600
by how good she is at her job, how much she loves her job,

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:34.640
and how much the fame, the money, whatever,

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:37.720
has not affected the basic core integrity

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.080
of who she is as a human being.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.920
So she's also incredible.

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:46.920
Okay, what's the takeaway for you personally

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:48.560
from the trial?

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.760
How has it made you a better person?

01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:55.320
How has it changed or solidified who you are

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:58.520
as a psychologist, as a forensic psychologist,

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.160
clinical psychologist, and so on?

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:06.160
Wow, I mean, a lot happened in my life around that trial,

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.720
leading up to the trial, after the trial.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.400
So let's tackle forensic psychologists first.

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:14.320
Sure. Okay.

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:17.560
So in terms of forensic psychology,

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.200
I am grateful to that trial

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.640
for really strengthening my abilities.

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:26.120
The stakes were so high that I took,

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.760
I was retained about two years prior to the trial,

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:35.280
so I really delved deep into the academic side

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:38.080
of forensic psychology and making sure

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:42.080
that I was adhering as closely as possible

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:45.560
to standard practices, best practice recommendations

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:48.720
for this specific type of an examination.

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:51.640
It was intellectually awesome and challenging.

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.280
I felt like my brain was on fire

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:56.400
for a full year leading up to the trial,

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.600
and that can be really, really fun.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.480
It was just challenging,

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:02.080
but I am really proud of the work I did.

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:04.160
I think the stakes were really high.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.920
It's serious work.

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:09.880
It's important that it's done well and accurately,

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:12.640
and I felt really good about it.

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:14.560
So have some of those lessons carried through

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:17.080
to your practice now, to both research

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.920
and some of the things you're doing

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.360
in terms of helping couples?

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:27.400
No, I mean, my practice hasn't changed that much.

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.480
This was more just something that was more,

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:34.280
it demanded so much more of my time

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:36.480
than my typical forensic work does,

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:40.160
and personal injury cases where there is an allegation

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.680
of trauma or psychological harm

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:44.240
tend to be super labor intensive.

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.320
This, given the magnitude and how long it had been going on

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.160
in the back and forth, required a ton of work

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.440
before the trial as well.

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.600
So it pulled me away from the practice.

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:58.200
I think it's been nice to go back a bit.

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:01.560
Okay, so now personally, I've learned some things.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:04.520
I've learned that I need to slow down a little bit.

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:07.320
So this took a lot from you.

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:10.160
It took a lot, but it was really the culmination.

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.080
I feel like there are these hoops we jump through

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.880
again and again, academic challenges

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.960
that we continue to meet, and then there's a next one

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.480
and a next one and a next one.

01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:25.040
And in the beginning, like when you're getting into college

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:28.560
or applying to grad schools, you don't really realize

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.600
this is going to be a never ending thing,

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:33.760
especially if I continue with research or forensic work.

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:35.840
I love it because it is so academic.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:40.040
You're writing these 75 page reports and with citations

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:42.680
and you have to be accurate.

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:46.200
It feels like I'm doing giant board exams

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.080
again and again and again.

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:53.600
It never ends, but that feeling, I think you and I

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:56.080
were talking about how it's fun to doubt yourself

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.720
because it pushes you to do better work.

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:02.480
But so if you keep having high stakes,

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:05.080
you're going to work all the time, work yourself

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.760
into the ground, constantly be thinking about,

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.640
oh, this question, I'm not sure if I fully know the answer

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.680
and all the research behind that, so I should go there.

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:18.680
And again, super fun, but I don't just do

01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:20.800
forensic psychology all day.

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:24.440
I also own a clinic.

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.160
I provide therapy.

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.480
I've been providing therapy for 15 years.

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.720
So what happens is you have clients

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:32.560
who maybe you've stopped seeing,

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.480
but when they have a crisis in their lives,

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.480
they reach out to you again, even if it's seven years later.

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:40.840
So you've accumulated hundreds of clients

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:43.520
who at any given time are going to reach out

01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.160
when they're in crisis, whether or not

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.680
you're working on a federal case or in Virginia for this.

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:54.480
And that is never going to be something easy to grapple with

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.280
because I feel that I am letting somebody down.

01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.720
I know I am because these are people I genuinely care about

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:03.200
and they care about me and they trust me.

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.640
And I want to be able to be there for them.

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:08.160
I know that it's disappointing if I can't be.

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:12.320
And it's also very difficult to separate out

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:16.480
the professional therapy relationship from loving someone

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:19.360
who you've seen through some of the most difficult parts

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.560
of their lives.

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:23.360
And I can explain that to people all day long,

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:26.320
but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's gonna be easy

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:29.480
for someone to accept when I can't talk to them

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:31.160
and they just found out their husband

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:35.120
was leading a double life or their sister just died

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.840
and I can't even get on a call

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:40.760
because I'm getting maybe 15 messages like that a day

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:45.480
and have to testify and have to run my practice.

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:49.360
So I think that was why I needed to slow down.

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.160
This case, I was doing all of that.

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:56.120
And then like the academic load

01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:58.600
or the work involved was just tremendous.

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:01.920
And some stuff happened like my dad,

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.880
he started having his cognitive decline.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:06.800
I got a medical diagnosis that is stress induced.

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:10.000
I really thought I was getting away with it.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.320
I really believed that people who talked

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:15.600
like a lot about self care were kind of full of shit

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.920
and just didn't know how to push themselves.

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:20.400
I still believe in pushing ourselves,

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:25.400
but I think I kind of traversed into an area

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.000
without realizing it where I was no longer pushing myself

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.560
to challenge myself or see what I was capable of.

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:34.800
I was almost pushing myself like as a necessity

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:37.560
because I didn't know what else to do anymore,

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.800
just an obligation.

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:42.720
It wasn't even, yeah, I wasn't pushing myself to do.

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:46.040
The Deb Hurd case reminded me of that feeling

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:47.320
of pushing myself to do something

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:49.120
I wasn't sure I was capable of

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:50.600
and overcoming that challenge.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:52.480
That was rewarding.

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:55.240
But when you're piling that on with like running a business

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.400
and all these other things

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:59.160
and trying to be perfect at all of them,

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:02.520
that just starts to become like a feeling of necessity

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.200
and it's not healthy.

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:08.840
That said, you somehow managed to hold it all together,

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:11.040
to put forward a masterful performance

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:14.320
and like you said, still take care of all these clients

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.520
because you're the most important person in their lives

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:17.400
for many of them.

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:21.840
Is there a secret to that?

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:23.760
Is there any hacks?

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:24.600
Is there a-

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:25.960
I don't sleep a lot.

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:26.800
I don't get a lot.

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:31.000
No, and honestly, it's not a hundred, it's not,

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000
I, it's a work in progress, right?

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.360
I don't have an answer for,

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.680
I wouldn't want my life to be any other way.

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:42.760
I, you know, I wouldn't have had the opportunity

01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:45.800
to work on this case if I hadn't established my practice

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:50.800
and had outreach and so I can't figure out

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:54.040
like which piece you take it out without it all crumbling,

01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:56.400
but I would love to have a little more downtime.

01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.000
So it all kind of works together

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.000
and there's passion as the fuel that's behind all of it.

01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:04.560
Probably, that's probably the reason

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:06.760
you haven't lost your mind quite yet.

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:11.560
Maybe, yeah, maybe, unless, I mean, it depends who you ask.

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:16.920
What about the stress of just being in the public eye?

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:18.960
Has that been difficult for you?

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.000
That's a lovely question.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.080
Thank you for asking it.

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:24.680
Cause I'm, it is nice to talk to you about this

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.520
cause I feel like you probably understand it a little bit.

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:32.280
That was something I was absolutely unprepared for.

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:34.600
Like I said, I had no idea how many people were watching

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:35.760
when I testified.

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:40.760
I had no idea and I got off the stand,

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:43.800
I kind of staggered to the back room

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:46.720
and truly thought about lying down on the floor

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:49.640
cause I was so exhausted.

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:52.840
And, you know, I'd been up studying all my stuff,

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:55.680
terrified that I was going to forget some statistic

01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.280
about the MMPI too.

01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.400
It's going to be so great.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:00.080
It's great for me, it's going to be great for people

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.080
to hear this, that you're human.

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:03.520
You're too flawless.

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:07.640
That you're, that's extremely stressful

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:08.600
for many, many hours.

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:11.360
I wondered how you can sit there for so many hours

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:13.960
and stay so focused and listen so well.

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:14.840
It's so difficult.

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:16.720
Well, I mean, I could talk about that too.

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:19.720
The moment I came to almost like came back to my body

01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:21.920
and realized where I was and just wanted it to stop

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:23.800
and felt like I was burning alive.

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:26.800
I just was thinking, I don't want to do this anymore.

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:28.080
I don't want to do this anymore.

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:29.040
Is this going to stop?

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.240
And then another question came

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:32.640
and I just had to get back to it.

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:35.240
But, so after I testified,

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.760
the first time I went in that back room,

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:38.880
I might've laid down on the ground.

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:39.920
It's kind of a blur.

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.240
I mean, I might have.

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:43.680
I do remember that Wayne Denison,

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:46.040
one of the senior managing partners at Brown Redneck,

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:49.160
who is a phenomenal guy and absolutely brilliant.

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:50.800
I will be indebted to him for life

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:53.560
because I trusted him.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:55.480
I trusted him and that made all the difference

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:57.160
in probably how I testified.

01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:59.880
But he came in the back and he was looking at his phone

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:02.240
and he said, you're on the cover of Time,

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:04.640
something on Apple News.

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.880
And I thought, I mean, I really,

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.200
I thought he was messing with me.

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:12.960
I thought it was his joke way of saying like, I did great.

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:15.640
You've worked with veterans.

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.720
What is PTSD in that context?

01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:22.640
What's the landscape of psychological sufferings

01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:25.680
that veterans, soldiers go through?

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:35.720
Well, if we're talking about combat exposure,

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:40.400
you're seeing things you're not meant to see.

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.520
You're seeing the worst of humanity,

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.680
people harming other people.

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:48.680
It's not natural for others to intend to harm us.

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:51.880
It's not natural for us to harm others.

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:55.240
And this dehumanization can occur

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.240
that's so troubling and disturbing

01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:59.640
that people have a hard time living with it later,

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:04.040
or they just feel this ongoing anger.

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:07.960
It depends.

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:09.480
It depends on the trauma they're exposed to.

01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:14.440
It depends on whether their convoy was ambushed

01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:16.760
by weapons that were purchased from money

01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:19.600
that was given to this village from the US government.

01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:25.760
It depends on whether they did something

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:29.400
that they have a hard time reconciling outside of war

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:31.840
now that they're back home in civilization.

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:36.760
Depends on whether they lost a lot of their comrades

01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:39.080
and feel that guilt of being a survivor.

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:42.160
And again, not everybody develops PTSD.

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:44.000
It really, it's a mental disorder.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.480
It's serious.

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:47.240
We talk so much about trauma

01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:50.120
and PTSD gets thrown around lightly

01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:52.000
when actually it's very difficult

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:55.280
to meet the full criteria for that diagnosis.

01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:59.040
And many people experience severe trauma in their lives

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:03.480
and only about 14% are likely to actually develop PTSD.

01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:06.080
It's an exception, not the norm.

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:08.480
Traumatic stress is absolutely normal

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:11.040
after something traumatic happens.

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:12.440
You'll likely have nightmares.

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:13.600
You'll likely have anxiety.

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:16.520
You'll feel depressed because you're a human being

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.440
and something abnormal happened.

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:23.440
But PTSD is a longer standing condition

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:28.400
that is significantly impairing in a person's life.

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:30.120
And I think we've lost that

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:32.280
in some of the sort of narrative in society.

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:35.080
It just, everybody has PTSD.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:36.960
But no, you can have traumatic stress.

01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:38.120
You can be distressed.

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:39.480
You can be affected by trauma

01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:41.960
and not have that particular diagnosis.

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:45.920
PTSD significantly impairs people's lives.

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:50.280
How do veterans, how do soldiers who suffer from PTSD

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:54.160
or are close to that kind of diagnosis begin to heal?

01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:56.520
What's the path for healing?

01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:58.680
Well, I will hand it to the military

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:00.760
because I think in terms of working

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:02.440
with their active duty service members,

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:05.640
they really invest heavily in mental health.

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:09.280
The US Department of Defense was one of the first

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:12.120
to bring animal assisted therapy

01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:15.040
into any type of treatment in the early 1900s

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:19.240
with bringing farming into certain hospitals

01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:21.560
and letting veterans help with the farms

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:25.840
and brush the horses, which is so advanced

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.560
because now we have all this research

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:31.520
on animal assisted therapy and how beneficial it is.

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:33.040
And just looking in the eyes of a dog

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:34.600
can increase your pain threshold

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:38.000
and speed healing after a cardiac arrest,

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:40.640
help people with dementia to ambulate more freely.

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:43.400
It's incredible stuff, simple.

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.200
And the military was ahead of the game on that.

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:46.480
And I don't think that's changed.

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:50.440
I did my training at a military hospital in Hawaii,

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:51.960
Tripler Army Medical Center.

01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:54.640
It was phenomenal training.

01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:57.440
And our psych department,

01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:59.960
there was so much interesting research going on.

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:02.760
We had, and it was so integrated.

01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:05.600
So you might not imagine

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.280
that the military would be doing this,

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:09.520
but we had an acupuncture department.

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:12.200
We had a chiropractic department.

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:14.080
We had a yoga section.

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:16.080
We were doing yoga sessions there.

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:22.000
I mean, anything that has evidence to support its efficacy

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.280
was being utilized.

01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:26.880
And I think that's pretty cool about our government.

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:27.920
They have a lot of funding,

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:30.480
so I'm glad they're using it on that.

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:34.760
The real challenge I think comes with the large scale need

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:36.200
of the veteran population.

01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:39.800
And they slipped through the cracks.

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:42.120
I know that the DOD had a campaign going

01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:44.200
where they were doing outreach to anybody who served,

01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:46.640
for instance, in the Vietnam War.

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:49.360
The problem is they were trying to get

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:51.720
all of these people assessed for PTSD.

01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:52.560
And it was great.

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:54.600
Like they were getting phone calls, mail.

01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:57.120
It was sort of saying, hey, we know that you serve.

01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:59.680
Come on in, or let's schedule you an exam

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:03.040
with a psychologist and just see if you're owed benefits.

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:04.480
The idea of it's great.

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.960
The problem is that they outsourced

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:08.640
to this third-party company.

01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:10.720
They're paying really low rates

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:13.880
for a one-hour meeting with a vet.

01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:17.040
And you don't need to be specifically trained

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.560
in assessing PTSD.

01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:23.040
And so you're getting these variations and opinions

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:24.080
that are coming through.

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:27.000
And I've had clients who, to me,

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.440
who I've worked with for years

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:30.920
who have clear combat-related PTSD

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.960
according to gold standard measures,

01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:36.000
according to my knowing them and observing their symptoms

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.280
and how impaired they are.

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:39.320
And it is clearly associated with combat,

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:41.200
the content of their intrusive thoughts,

01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:42.600
their nightmares, et cetera.

01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:46.760
And they are having a one-hour meeting,

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:50.160
sometimes by phone, with one of these psychologists

01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:53.880
who's been contracted by this third-party organization.

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:55.520
That's not even enough for me to get through

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:57.640
the first few symptom questions

01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:00.360
on the CAPS-5 assessment for PTSD.

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:04.240
But in that hour, the psychologist is saying definitively,

01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:05.960
no PTSD.

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:08.280
And it's been a travesty for some people,

01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:11.520
especially for those who need an advocate the most.

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:14.040
It tends to happen to my veterans

01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:16.480
who are maybe a little bit less sophisticated

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:18.600
in presenting or advocating for themselves,

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.280
more humble, less...

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:24.320
The guys who deserve it the most, right?

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:28.400
They're just getting passed over and it's a maze.

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:30.200
I'm not quite sure what the solution is though

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:33.040
I've worked for government agencies,

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:35.480
it's a massive population.

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:37.520
I love that the outreach is even happening

01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:39.840
and trying to get these guys in for assessment.

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:42.680
I think we can criticize any system.

01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:45.000
I'm glad that system is even happening,

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.520
but it still needs to be better.

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:51.040
So I've gotten a chance to interact with a lot of soldiers

01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:52.880
that served in Iraq and Afghanistan,

01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:54.840
and now a lot of soldiers

01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:57.120
from all different kinds of nations in Ukraine

01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:58.680
went to the front.

01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:02.960
There's a bond between soldiers unlike any other.

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:06.840
I don't know if you can speak to why do you think that is

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:10.160
on the opposite side of PTSD,

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:12.760
there's a deep human connection.

01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:14.160
There's like a love for each other.

01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:15.000
What is that?

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.280
What is that about war and combat

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:19.640
that creates that kind of...

01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:21.560
Well, you're seeing...

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.960
We've talked earlier about that vulnerability, right?

01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:27.800
So I believe that combat,

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:30.560
I believe that most survival situations

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.840
strip away all ego.

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:37.840
And I mean, there are a couple of different layers to this,

01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.680
but I have not served in war.

01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:43.400
So I wanna be cautious here,

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:47.120
but from what I know just about psychology

01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:49.360
and also from my own experience of survival,

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.400
survival type experiences,

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:52.840
when you're with a group of people

01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:56.880
and all the ego stripped away,

01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:57.840
nothing else matters.

01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:01.600
The focus is on the here and now and a specific mission

01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.520
or your day to day.

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:05.000
You can get really close.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.440
You're very, very vulnerable.

01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:12.240
And also in my experience,

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:15.000
the guys I work with who have served,

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.040
there aren't a lot of people who understand

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:18.280
what they've been through,

01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:20.560
not only some of the unspeakable things

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:21.720
they've been through in combat,

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:24.400
but some of the things that they feel are unspeakable

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:25.680
about returning,

01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:28.800
especially if they are experiencing trauma.

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:33.520
A lot of them, some of the things that service members

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:36.720
with PTSD are the most reluctant to disclose

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:38.680
is the feeling like they may not know

01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:41.560
if they love their children anymore or their wife,

01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:44.000
that they don't even know if they can love anymore,

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.240
that they feel emotionally numb,

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:49.800
that they wanna kill someone,

01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:53.440
that they have a whole lot of racist beliefs and thoughts.

01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:57.760
There are a lot of things that can be associated with PTSD

01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:00.240
that aren't as clear or expected.

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:04.520
And these guys don't have many people who understand it

01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:06.120
or they don't think they would,

01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:09.560
but a lot of their fellow service members do.

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:16.480
Man, so I'm going back to Ukraine and,

01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:19.160
boy, nothing makes,

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:26.880
nothing makes, reveals the human condition

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:29.000
in a more pure form than war.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Especially the kind of war you get

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.600
in that part of the world,

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:37.920
especially the war in Ukraine,

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:40.840
which is a very 20th century kind of war.

01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:43.200
Brutal.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:44.840
Brutal.

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:50.600
Well, like I mentioned in a few different ways,

01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:53.240
you're exceptionally successful

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:56.360
by I think the best definition of success.

01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.320
You're doing what you love

01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:03.320
and you're one of the best people in the world at doing it.

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:06.520
And so what advice would you give to young people

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:09.400
that look up to you, that saw you in the trial,

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:11.360
which is your most public facing thing?

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:14.920
And are just looking,

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:16.560
young people that are looking to find

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:19.080
what they wanna do with their life career wise or?

01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:20.400
I love that question.

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:21.240
What would you tell them?

01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:23.400
I'm gonna tell them something my dad told me.

01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:27.320
He said to me, Shani, just pick anything.

01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:30.360
Pick anything.

01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:34.160
If you like it at all, studying it, just pick it.

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:37.760
He was like, look, don't worry about the job.

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:40.520
You don't even know all the jobs that exist.

01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:43.880
Pick something you like, you will make it your own.

01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:46.400
And that is exactly what happened.

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.000
I like psychology.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
I was reading some self-help books.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.320
It's not like I had this calling where I,

01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:57.600
looking back, I can actually create that story

01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.960
because I think now it makes a lot of sense

01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:01.360
that I do what I do.

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:03.720
But I was lost and scared.

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:06.560
I started studying psychology.

01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.920
I met a professor who was really inspiring,

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:11.600
who wasn't even a psychology professor.

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.600
He was public policy.

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.720
I stayed in touch with that professor.

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:17.880
He is a dear friend still to this day.

01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:19.680
That was 20 years ago.

01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:22.640
We do research together in Mexico, integrative research

01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:26.520
with public policy officials and environmental engineers.

01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.760
And I get to be the psychologist on the trip.

01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:32.000
I never ever dreamed that that sort of stuff could happen.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.400
I didn't know about forensic psychology.

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:36.320
I also wanna warn anybody who's interested

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:37.840
in forensic psychology that it's not like

01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:42.000
you're solving crimes all day and getting calls by the FBI.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.280
You are going to be sitting alone in your home office

01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:48.200
with your husband bringing you bowls of cereal

01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:49.840
and reminding you to go to the bathroom

01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:54.240
because you haven't gotten up in 24 hours from the computer.

01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:57.640
And you're gonna have papers all around you

01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:02.440
and you're just gonna write 75 dense pages

01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:05.560
with citations of science.

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:06.520
It's brutal.

01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:10.880
It's academic, but it's fulfilling.

01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:14.000
My friend, my friend Franny posted a meme

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.120
of one of the girls from Glears that they crying

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:19.880
and saying like, I'm the happiest I've ever been.

01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:22.040
And she said it reminds her of when I try to convince her

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:23.080
to do forensic psych,

01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:25.200
cause I think her mind is perfect for it.

01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:27.280
You have to be strategic and thorough,

01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:30.560
but it's a slog, but it's wonderful.

01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:31.400
It's wonderful.

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:33.680
The image of your husband bringing you cereal

01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:35.480
while you work on the 75 pages

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:38.720
is maybe the most romantic thing I've ever heard.

01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:40.520
So we started on love.

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:43.960
Let me ask one last question about the same topic.

01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:46.640
What's the role of love in this whole thing

01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:48.120
in the human condition

01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:51.560
and this whole experiment we've got going on on earth?

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:54.040
I think it's all there is like that jewel song.

01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:56.840
How does that go?

01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:58.800
I don't sing it, don't sing it, don't get it in my head.

01:44:58.800 --> 01:44:59.640
Please don't.

01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:03.560
There have been some profound moments in my life

01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:08.960
where I feel like I am closest to kind of the truth of life

01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:11.320
or what it's all about.

01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:15.600
And usually there's this resonating sense of love and ease

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:19.720
and love for myself, love for other people,

01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:20.880
sort of like it's all okay.

01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:21.720
We're all okay.

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:23.080
We're gonna get through this.

01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:28.480
I liked what you said about the harm caused

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:32.040
by the misinformation or negative things

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:35.120
that about you because you're right,

01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:36.760
it harms that bigger picture.

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:41.760
I think it holds us back, takes us back from that truth.

01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:43.920
That there's a love that connects all of us

01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:46.880
and that if you remember about that love,

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.520
it's all going to be okay.

01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.480
I really hope it's going to be okay.

01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:51.920
Me too.

01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:53.160
I believe it will be.

01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:55.160
Thank you so much for talking today, Shannon.

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.440
You're an incredible person.

01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:57.720
Thank you for everything you do

01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:59.520
and for everything you stand for.

And now let me leave you with some more words

01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:18.440
from Charles Bukowski.

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:21.680
Sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning

01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:24.960
and you think, I'm not going to make it,

01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:26.560
but you laugh inside,

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:29.040
remembering all the times you felt that way.

01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:31.400
Thank you for listening.

01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:33.400
I hope to see you next time.
