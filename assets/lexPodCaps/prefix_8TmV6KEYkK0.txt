WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.800
You know who drank? It's Churchill.

00:02.120 --> 00:05.040
That's my, hold on. That's my guy. Yeah. You know, that's my guy, right?

00:05.120 --> 00:06.920
So he, uh, he did champagne.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.280
You don't have to tell me a thing about Winston Churchill. He,

00:11.320 --> 00:15.560
I found out about his daily routine. Yeah. So his daily routine was a big breakfast,

00:15.560 --> 00:20.480
cigar, coffee, eggs, sunny side up toast, bacon, sausage,

00:20.640 --> 00:25.440
tomato beans, uh, fruit, orange juice, soft scotch,

00:25.600 --> 00:27.840
cigar in bed. And he'd sit there for three hours.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.200
And then he'd get in the bathtub and drink champagne.

00:30.440 --> 00:34.160
And then he'd go to lunch and have some goose with more champagne.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.440
And then he'd take a nap. And like, I love that.

00:36.440 --> 00:39.120
So every year on hit the day of his death and he's January 24th,

00:39.400 --> 00:42.120
I celebrate Winston Churchill's life by living the way he did.

00:42.640 --> 00:46.440
And so I have breakfast in bed with a soft scotch and I just party all day.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.120
That would be the guy to drink with.

00:50.520 --> 00:53.400
The following is a conversation with Bird Crusher,

00:53.880 --> 00:54.960
a standup comedian,

00:55.120 --> 00:59.000
podcast or actor and a man they call the machine.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.840
I've been a fan of his comedy and podcasts for many years,

01:03.240 --> 01:07.840
and I highly recommend you watch him on BirdCast to Bears One Cave with

01:07.840 --> 01:10.960
Tom Segura, his cooking show called Something Is Burning.

01:11.040 --> 01:14.960
And finally the new movie that tells the story of the man,

01:15.400 --> 01:17.160
the legend, the machine.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.880
This is the Lex Friedman podcast. Disaborted.

01:20.880 --> 01:24.920
Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,

01:25.400 --> 01:26.960
here's Bird Crusher.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.360
I read somewhere that you like Ernest Hemingway.

01:30.480 --> 01:31.320
Love him.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.080
There's a quote, there's nothing to writing.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.680
All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed. Do you agree with that?

01:38.880 --> 01:42.720
I agree. I agree. Well, I agree with that with journaling. So I can't write,

01:42.720 --> 01:46.680
um, I can't write standup. Like I can't write a bit,

01:46.720 --> 01:49.520
but if I journal, I'll find something that I go just right.

01:50.480 --> 01:51.320
Kind of writing where you're,

01:51.680 --> 01:54.920
the pen's moving faster than your brain and they're kind of like doing it

01:54.920 --> 01:58.720
together. The thing I liked about Ernest Hemingway, this is so stupid.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.240
I'm a little dyslexic and so I'm not a good reader.

02:02.360 --> 02:06.760
And so he wrote very simply and it wasn't until after I read a bunch of Ernest

02:06.760 --> 02:10.560
Hemingway, I was working at Parts of Noble and this person said,

02:10.560 --> 02:13.840
don't you love his titles? And I was like, yeah, Sun Also Rises. And they're like,

02:13.840 --> 02:18.440
yeah, but no, the sun also rises. And I was like, yeah, Sun Also Rises.

02:19.160 --> 02:24.160
And they're like, no, the, no, the sun also rises. And I went, oh,

02:25.240 --> 02:27.880
oh yeah, that is fucking bad ass. Yeah. And then I,

02:27.880 --> 02:31.200
but I'm like always late to the party with anything. And then that night,

02:31.200 --> 02:34.880
we were all doing Coke and, uh, it was like five in the morning.

02:34.880 --> 02:38.000
And we ended up on the roof of my apartment in Greenwich village.

02:39.480 --> 02:43.560
And it's like, I'm a sunset guy, I grew up in Florida,

02:44.000 --> 02:48.720
but sunrises in New York are electric blue, like electric blue.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.360
And I was like, the sun also rises.

02:54.640 --> 02:58.800
Yeah. He was so good with just a handful of words,

02:59.120 --> 03:02.160
the simplicity, the choice of words. Like, uh,

03:02.200 --> 03:06.000
basically his process is carving down. Right. Drunk, edit, sober.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.080
Right. Drunk, edit, sober. Yeah.

03:08.120 --> 03:12.600
But he was good at like, at like a small amount of words to,

03:12.600 --> 03:16.200
to get a point across. I'm the exact fucking opposite.

03:16.360 --> 03:20.720
Well, he's also said, uh, the first draft of anything's always shit.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.000
Is that, uh, is that true for you?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.760
I think so. It's the best one I have.

03:27.600 --> 03:28.760
It goes downhill from there.

03:28.920 --> 03:31.920
So for you editing is destroying the original.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.560
The first time I tell it, the first time I tell it, it's perfect.

03:36.440 --> 03:39.680
It's perfect. It just, it works. And then I go great.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.080
And then I take it and I try to fix it and make it better and jazzier.

03:43.200 --> 03:47.000
I just joke and razzle dazzle about my daughters and I drive them past a deaf

03:47.000 --> 03:51.440
child sign. And, uh, I just told it on stage. It just happened.

03:51.600 --> 03:56.280
And Louie was in the audience. He was, I love that joke. I said,

03:56.280 --> 03:58.840
really? He was, yeah. And I just told it. I went done.

03:58.880 --> 04:02.520
Louie CK says he likes a joke. It's fucking, it's in the special.

04:03.640 --> 04:08.440
And I tried to fucking razzle dazzle that joke into like a 15 minute bit.

04:08.680 --> 04:13.440
It got to the point where it was so, it was so bad that I, I told him,

04:13.560 --> 04:16.800
I did a podcast with him. I said, what did you like about that joke?

04:16.800 --> 04:19.720
Cause I can't get it to work anymore because it was just simple.

04:19.880 --> 04:23.320
It was simple that your daughter didn't know how they figure out where deaf kids

04:23.320 --> 04:26.520
lived. I went, that's it. He's like, yeah. I was like,

04:26.520 --> 04:29.920
nothing about gun control. And he was like, huh? I was like, Oh fuck man.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.800
I really fucked that joke up. And then I had to,

04:31.800 --> 04:35.120
I had to go back to the beginning of it. But that first time that's when,

04:35.120 --> 04:36.800
that's when the joke comes out purest for me.

04:36.800 --> 04:40.040
And then it's always chasing back to get that, get that first telling.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.720
Some jokes are different. Like the machine obviously was a much longer story and

04:42.720 --> 04:47.000
like, and like escape room for this one, the longer stories take a little work,

04:47.000 --> 04:49.480
but the simple ones like,

04:49.720 --> 04:54.160
like the deaf child and pajamas and those first times are perfect.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.800
What do you think is, is it about the machine story that works?

04:58.160 --> 05:00.200
That was so captivating for people.

05:00.200 --> 05:05.200
I think it's a, I think, I don't know.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.520
I really wish I, I don't know. I think it's a good story.

05:11.040 --> 05:11.880
I think it's a good story.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.720
I think everyone has something similar that happened in their life where they

05:15.720 --> 05:20.360
had a crazy night and that no one believed and they told their friends and

05:20.360 --> 05:21.160
their friends and, and, and,

05:21.160 --> 05:23.960
or they experienced that with a friend like that. And, and,

05:24.840 --> 05:29.520
and I think, I think that's gotta be it. I really don't know.

05:29.520 --> 05:30.480
I think there's a part of,

05:30.760 --> 05:34.880
I think there's a part of the like our community of com of comedy fans that

05:34.880 --> 05:39.800
were that early desk squad that was fun to watch someone take something from the

05:39.800 --> 05:43.840
podcast and turn it into a bit on stage. I think there was a lot of that,

05:43.840 --> 05:47.160
but I think people identify with a wild,

05:47.160 --> 05:51.840
crazy night that got out of control that they've probably had too.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.720
I think I don't fucking know.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.520
Do you think Putin knows who you are because of that story?

05:57.640 --> 06:01.360
I hope so. I fucking hope so. I hope so.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.320
But there's a part of me that you got to understand is like, I'm not,

06:07.040 --> 06:09.400
I say stuff like that. I'm sure there's someone hears that and they go,

06:09.400 --> 06:11.960
who is this fucking narcissist? You're like, no, that's not it.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.240
I'm just telling you the truth. Like, I understand what I'm supposed to say.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.600
Well, you know, I don't know. I, you know, I, I don't know.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.120
That's hard to say, but I don't fucking give a shit about that guy.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.480
I'm not that guy. I'm telling you everything that comes out of my mouth.

06:24.520 --> 06:27.120
The second it comes out, I'm going to be a hundred percent honest.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.680
I don't know any other way to live. I kind of hope so.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.600
That would be fucking cool. And I look, I know he's a bad,

06:32.640 --> 06:34.480
I guess he's a bad dude. I don't follow politics, Don,

06:34.800 --> 06:37.960
but it'd be cool if like one day someone's like, uh, he's,

06:38.000 --> 06:41.200
he's on his computer and somebody goes, and he's like, yeah, yeah.

06:42.120 --> 06:46.920
And he's like, and he's like, and it shows it to him. And,

06:47.240 --> 06:50.040
and then he's like, fucking this guy, huh?

06:50.520 --> 06:54.920
It's not out of the realm of possibility that Putin has watched it. And this,

06:54.920 --> 06:57.960
this podcast, this has kind of made me realize how like small the world is.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.160
I've gotten to meet some incredibly like,

07:01.280 --> 07:05.680
especially the people you've had, like that's, I mean, that's the thing where I go,

07:07.960 --> 07:09.440
it's gotten really crazy.

07:10.160 --> 07:14.560
The internet's really insane and Netflix is really insane and the reach of like

07:14.560 --> 07:17.040
people that like, this is really simple,

07:17.520 --> 07:19.640
but like I'm a big fan of the show drink champs.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.280
I didn't think in a million years nor would ever know who I was.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.560
And then he offered me to come do his podcast. And then when I got there,

07:25.560 --> 07:27.840
he told me he was a fan of mine. And I went, like,

07:27.840 --> 07:32.040
I remember moving to New York, listening to you and Capone,

07:32.040 --> 07:34.920
like I'm sitting there going, wow.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.360
Like, and then,

07:36.360 --> 07:39.800
and the phone calls I've gotten since the movie came out and uh,

07:40.320 --> 07:44.360
since razzle dazzle came out have been really insane when you realize

07:45.680 --> 07:48.520
as much as I know about people. And I, I like,

07:48.600 --> 07:52.480
there's people I'm fans of that don't know who I am that like, that are like,

07:52.720 --> 07:56.880
they're like some pitcher in Florida that I follow the kids. I like,

07:57.280 --> 08:01.000
I was fun to watch him pitch. There was a softball player in Tempe,

08:01.400 --> 08:02.920
that she's do catching drills.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.240
And I was really into softball with my daughter and we watched her catching

08:05.240 --> 08:05.800
girls.

08:05.800 --> 08:10.240
There's a girl deglazer who me and my daughters will watch her dance videos.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.080
And then I hit her up and she's like, you know who I am. And you're like,

08:12.120 --> 08:13.320
oh yeah, that's the way the world works.

08:14.040 --> 08:17.280
What world leader would you drink with if you could see Russian Putin?

08:19.080 --> 08:23.200
So Putin doesn't drink much. Yeah. Zelensky drinks more, but also not much.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.440
He would have been a fucking good one. I mean, like I, I, I go,

08:28.920 --> 08:33.120
Hitler was a pussy. Like he, he drank wine with a, with a cut,

08:33.120 --> 08:37.360
with a spoonful of sugar in it. Never drank what Churchill. That's my,

08:37.360 --> 08:39.800
hold on. That's my guy. Yeah. You know, that's my guy, right?

08:39.920 --> 08:44.040
No, I don't know. That's your guy. So he, uh, he did champagne.

08:44.880 --> 08:48.400
You don't have to tell me a thing about Winston Churchill. He,

08:48.440 --> 08:52.680
I found out about his daily routine. So his daily routine was a big breakfast,

08:52.680 --> 08:57.520
cigar, coffee, eggs over eggs, sunny side up toast, bacon,

08:57.520 --> 09:01.960
sausage, tomato, beans, uh, fruit, orange juice,

09:01.960 --> 09:06.760
soft scotch cigar in bed. And he'd sit there for three hours and he'd hold

09:07.040 --> 09:10.920
morning breakfast and that's, they'd come in and he'd run through his day.

09:10.920 --> 09:14.320
And then he'd get in the bathtub for fucking an hour and drink champagne.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.920
And then he'd go to lunch and have some goose or whatever the fuck they ate back

09:17.920 --> 09:22.320
then with more champagne. And then, and then, and then, I mean,

09:22.480 --> 09:24.440
and then he'd take a nap and like, I love that.

09:24.440 --> 09:27.120
So every year on hit the day of his death and he's January 24th,

09:27.400 --> 09:30.120
I celebrate Winston Churchill's life by living the way he did.

09:30.640 --> 09:34.480
And so I have breakfast in bed with a soft scotch and I just party all fucking

09:34.480 --> 09:36.480
day. That would be the guy to drink with.

09:36.880 --> 09:40.120
That would be the guy if you could pick anyone to drink with.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.320
He drank every day throughout the day.

09:42.400 --> 09:47.520
He lived like 94 and was one of the most heroic

09:47.520 --> 09:51.920
figures in human history. Never, never surrender. I mean,

09:51.960 --> 09:54.720
what a fucking bad ass thing. You know, he taught, he taught the queen,

09:54.720 --> 09:58.640
the queen was like a, like a, like a window licking idiot, right? Like she was,

09:59.040 --> 10:04.200
she had a third grade education. So like her dad dies and she's like 10 or

10:04.200 --> 10:06.960
12 or whatever. The first thing they do is they pull her out of school.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.680
They're like, you're done learning. You're just going to be the queen.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.320
You're going to know this is what you need to learn. Don't make,

10:11.360 --> 10:14.520
let people make eye contact with you. Put your hand out like this.

10:14.560 --> 10:17.360
Don't let people touch you. So she like, she had like a really,

10:17.360 --> 10:21.160
I saw the, by the way, I didn't do this research. I just watched the crown.

10:21.200 --> 10:25.040
Okay. And Winston Churchill kind of taught her about world politics.

10:25.440 --> 10:28.000
And was that they like coming and she'd be like, Winston,

10:28.320 --> 10:31.640
what did we do in Africa? And he's like, this is going to be a tough one.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.760
And so, yeah, so, but Winston Churchill is the bad ass.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.440
But if I had to drink with someone living, like drink,

10:37.640 --> 10:41.560
there's like, there's a too obvious one. Like obviously it's fucking Kim Jong-un,

10:41.640 --> 10:44.480
right? You kind of want to be drinks. No, he does.

10:45.320 --> 10:49.080
You think my IVs are good in the morning. You know,

10:49.080 --> 10:52.800
Kim Jong-un's IVs are next. You're like, I feel up. And he's like,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.840
it's unfit. I mean, he would be a bad ass to drink with.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.040
I think he drinks hard liquor.

10:57.680 --> 11:01.200
I think it's Scotch, Johnny Walker blue. That's what I've heard.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.640
I don't know where you heard this, but I like this. Okay.

11:04.640 --> 11:08.000
So I say things like that, but then I'm sure I, I, I, I, I,

11:08.520 --> 11:10.400
I don't know if you've ever partied with someone who just parties a little

11:10.400 --> 11:13.280
different than you. And then you notice like, like sometimes celebrities,

11:13.320 --> 11:16.600
like athletes and then like you're at a strip club and then they,

11:16.920 --> 11:20.040
they talk weird to a woman. You're like, oh, that's not me. I'm so sorry.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.640
So that'd be the thing. The atrocities would be hard to get past with them.

11:22.840 --> 11:25.520
Not just the atrocities, but the way of being. I agree with you.

11:25.520 --> 11:30.520
I actually don't like drinking with rich and powerful people

11:30.520 --> 11:34.120
often. There's something weird about them. Yeah. Not, not all of them.

11:35.080 --> 11:38.800
And I don't like, I don't like a drinking meeting. Like when someone goes,

11:39.440 --> 11:43.480
like, like when people go like, Hey, uh,

11:44.120 --> 11:46.680
I'm taking you out tonight. We're drinking. Yeah. And then I go, Oh,

11:46.720 --> 11:50.160
that's not the way I like to do it. It gives me anxiety. Like, um,

11:50.880 --> 11:54.600
our lives are very different. You and I, yeah. Were you in a fraternity?

11:56.920 --> 11:58.640
We could start there yet. No, I was not.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.800
And the differences continue from there. I'm sure.

12:03.840 --> 12:07.480
So when you get your pledge of pen, they take you out and their whole thing is

12:07.480 --> 12:11.080
you're going to, we're getting you fucked up. That energy is not my energy.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.960
I don't like that. Like it's, I just go,

12:12.960 --> 12:15.120
why don't we just get drunk and feel really good about ourselves?

12:15.720 --> 12:18.080
Like I never liked took mushrooms to see Jesus.

12:18.280 --> 12:22.160
I just wanted to enjoy rain X on a windshield. Like, so like that,

12:22.240 --> 12:26.720
that for me, uh, is like one of my things. So if,

12:26.760 --> 12:30.200
if Kim Jong-un flew me to North Korea to drink with him, I'd be like,

12:30.200 --> 12:33.400
I'd have to start really getting blackout drunk on the plane to enjoy drinking

12:33.400 --> 12:34.240
with him that day.

12:35.240 --> 12:39.360
What's your favorite, like different occasions? What's your favorite drink?

12:39.360 --> 12:41.280
What's your favorite way of drinking?

12:42.120 --> 12:45.440
It's, it's, I've got, it varies.

12:45.680 --> 12:50.120
So what are the different contexts here? It's like one-on-one. One-on-one.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.440
Like you sit down with, I don't know,

12:52.920 --> 12:57.160
Rogan invites you like it's a Godfather to sit down and finally have a talk about

12:57.160 --> 13:00.640
something. It's going to be whiskey. It's going to be like a nice whiskey. Neat.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.400
No, I like it on the rocks. I like lots of rocks.

13:03.960 --> 13:08.280
It won't be something expensive cause Rogan is not, he's not a fancy boy.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.680
You know, like he's a real regular, he's a really regular dude.

13:12.320 --> 13:15.120
He's gotten less regular, the more millions of dollars he has.

13:16.120 --> 13:19.800
There's parts of him where you're like, like where you're like, Oh wow,

13:19.800 --> 13:20.640
we can do this.

13:22.080 --> 13:25.760
But he's a regular, he'd be like Jack on the rocks or like Buffalo Trace or one

13:25.760 --> 13:30.160
of the, maybe a little whiskey he's buying. Rogan be a whiskey rocks.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.320
And then like, that's a good, I haven't hung out with Joe by ourselves.

13:34.360 --> 13:37.200
I take that back. I was with him the other night, but like, I would be cool.

13:37.240 --> 13:40.960
My times with Joe's are always on podcasts. Yeah. And his,

13:41.000 --> 13:44.520
I missed the times where it was where you just have you and him at the store

13:44.520 --> 13:45.360
late night.

13:45.520 --> 13:50.440
Yeah. I'm okay with podcasts. Like I used to think this is like a performative

13:50.440 --> 13:53.560
or something like this, but it's not really, it's just the chance to really sit

13:53.560 --> 13:53.960
down.

13:53.960 --> 13:58.160
I enjoy it because of the people I could never sit down with like David Cross.

13:58.160 --> 14:01.480
I wouldn't never sit down with David Cross because we don't run in the same

14:01.480 --> 14:04.360
circles. And, but it's nice. He has something to promote.

14:04.360 --> 14:08.080
And then he comes to my house and then we can sit down for an hour and talk.

14:08.080 --> 14:11.680
And then I, and then, or Kevin Smith, like people I would never really hang out

14:11.680 --> 14:13.920
with Tom. Um,

14:15.640 --> 14:19.240
I enjoy being alone with Tom more off Mike.

14:20.480 --> 14:24.520
Yeah. We have a lot of history. There's a lot of things,

14:24.560 --> 14:27.400
secrets we know about each other and there's a lot of secrets going on in each

14:27.400 --> 14:30.480
other's lives that I would never share on podcasts that I,

14:30.560 --> 14:33.920
that I can talk to him about. And I really appreciate his,

14:34.400 --> 14:37.080
and I know this isn't on brand of us beating each other up,

14:37.120 --> 14:39.840
but like I really appreciate his insight as a,

14:40.040 --> 14:43.600
as a dad and as a dude and as a son, but,

14:43.640 --> 14:46.920
but he makes me giggle harder than anyone. So doing a podcast is fun.

14:47.160 --> 14:50.360
So there's something on a podcast that's performative for you with him.

14:50.600 --> 14:51.760
And then there's a part.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.200
Cause we're trying to make each other laugh, but I'll tell you,

14:55.200 --> 14:56.800
if we're going back to drinks, I'll tell you,

14:58.240 --> 15:02.600
like a great, a great afternoon drink is a Campari spritz.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.200
That's my, one of my favorite drinks in the world.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.920
I don't even know what that is. Campari spritz.

15:06.960 --> 15:11.680
Campari is an interesting alcohol because I think it's a bitter, uh,

15:11.720 --> 15:15.720
or it's a liqueur and it's got a weird rooty earthy taste. It's red.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.680
So it looks like Kool-Aid. That's why I got into it.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.400
I thought Campari on ice would be oh so nice. It was an old commercial,

15:21.640 --> 15:26.160
but man it's fucking like sucking the green giant's dick. It is earthy.

15:26.680 --> 15:30.640
What's earthy? It's like, it's, it tastes like roots. It's, it's not,

15:30.640 --> 15:34.160
it's not, it's there's a bitterness and like, it's just not great.

15:34.960 --> 15:37.080
And then someone introduced me to a Negroni,

15:37.080 --> 15:40.480
which is Campari and gin and a little soda water.

15:40.480 --> 15:44.680
And then Campari spritz Campari spritz is Campari

15:45.280 --> 15:48.920
Prosecco and soda water and like a wine glass.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.960
And it is so enjoyable.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.640
It's got so many different profiles to it where you get the bitterness,

15:56.920 --> 15:59.880
but the sweetness of the Prosecco and then it flattens it out with the soda

15:59.880 --> 16:02.600
water and it looks like Kool-Aid. So I love it.

16:02.960 --> 16:06.360
That's one of my favorite drinks to share in what context? Oh, uh,

16:06.400 --> 16:11.400
you're in Italy and you've been walking around Venice and everyone went their

16:11.480 --> 16:16.240
own ways and the whole family comes back together and you meet at a statue and

16:16.800 --> 16:20.400
and your wife's sweating and she's uncomfortable and your daughters are 16 and

16:20.400 --> 16:23.200
18 and they're like, are, what are we going to,

16:23.240 --> 16:26.760
what are we doing with the rest of the day? And you go, Hey guys, it's Europe.

16:27.360 --> 16:30.200
Does anyone want to Campari spritz? And everyone goes, I don't know what that is.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.360
And you go for Campari spritz. Now it's, it's a minor in alcohol.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.400
So it's not going to light them up,

16:34.680 --> 16:37.320
but it gives them a little bit of a buzz where they're like, dad,

16:37.320 --> 16:41.160
these are nice Island didn't drink her. So I drank hers. I, Georgia had hers,

16:41.320 --> 16:45.000
Leanne had hers and we ordered another round. I ordered an, and they're

16:45.680 --> 16:50.680
just fucking refreshing. And the buzz is perfect.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.520
It's not too much because it's just a little bit of champagne.

16:53.520 --> 16:57.280
It's some Campari is the buzz is perfect. And then a couple of them,

16:57.400 --> 17:00.320
and then they kind of disappear. And then you're just walking around again.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.400
That's a great fucking drink.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.520
You have a drink alone.

17:07.160 --> 17:11.720
So there's a two kinds of alone. One is alone, like at a bar,

17:12.600 --> 17:16.200
there's other people, but they're strangers, right? They're kind of like out there.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.360
Keep going.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.440
Walk me through all the alone and then I'll tell you the rest.

17:22.320 --> 17:26.440
There's all kinds of, there's a alone on a train or transporting.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.600
I'm dragging alone on a train, train, plane.

17:29.120 --> 17:34.000
And then there's just the loan in a, in an empty home or a hotel room,

17:34.080 --> 17:36.640
hotel and it's Sunday night, Sunday night.

17:36.680 --> 17:40.560
And you're packing your bag and you got a flight at 6 AM. Yeah.

17:41.040 --> 17:44.040
But road houses on and you're like, shit.

17:44.480 --> 17:48.000
So you get out of the front desk and go, is the bar still open? And they go, yeah,

17:48.000 --> 17:51.960
can I order some to take to my room? Sure. How about six Heineken's six Heineken's?

17:52.120 --> 17:56.360
Yeah. My wife wanted one too. She's not up there. You murdered her.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.800
And you just say to yourself, I'm just getting six. So that if I have four,

18:00.280 --> 18:03.080
I just know I have two extra ones. And then you go through six and you're like,

18:03.440 --> 18:05.160
Oh man, I'm not done yet. Dude.

18:05.160 --> 18:09.600
I've drank in every alone scenario you can possibly think of. I've drank,

18:09.720 --> 18:14.720
uh, I've drank alone in a helicopter with a dude who didn't know I was drinking.

18:15.640 --> 18:18.160
Uh, he was, I was like, can I drink in here? And he was like, absolutely not.

18:18.160 --> 18:21.520
And then I poured it into a flask and opened it and drank it. And he's like, dude,

18:21.720 --> 18:23.840
we're in a fucking helicopter. You don't think I smell that?

18:24.440 --> 18:27.720
The best alone drinking you can ever do in my opinion,

18:27.880 --> 18:31.360
now we're getting to the weeds on it is alone behind someone's back.

18:32.680 --> 18:35.960
What do you mean? Like when they don't know you're drinking, but you're drinking,

18:36.800 --> 18:39.760
like, uh, like Christmas shopping.

18:42.680 --> 18:45.160
And your wife says, all right, let's all split up. And you go, cool.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.960
And it's like, it's like 11 o'clock on a Sunday.

18:48.120 --> 18:51.040
And they just opened that bar by the elevator in the Beverly center.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.960
And you just sneak over and you go, Hey man,

18:53.760 --> 18:56.040
can I get a double jack on the rocks rocks rocks? And they're like, sure.

18:56.040 --> 18:59.000
And you just have it and you just go, let's just, and then you're off.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.640
And then you're like, yeah. And then you just a little sneak one, sneak it,

19:02.680 --> 19:03.640
sneak it. And then you're,

19:04.040 --> 19:05.200
buzzed and nobody knows.

19:05.240 --> 19:06.960
And then your wife's like, wait, have you been drinking? You're like, do I?

19:07.960 --> 19:11.640
Yeah, I'm drinking by myself in a fucking mall on Christmas.

19:11.720 --> 19:14.360
How sad do you think I am? And then you go, yeah, I am.

19:14.840 --> 19:18.840
Uh, what about mood? Do you ever drink in a dark place?

19:19.240 --> 19:23.760
So I broke, I had a chick break up or a chick cheat on me. Uh, when I was,

19:23.760 --> 19:27.800
when I came back from Russia and she slept with my best friend and I didn't know

19:27.800 --> 19:30.400
how to deal with the emotions I had. And my buddy, Mike Osborne said,

19:30.400 --> 19:35.000
I can tell you this, if you drink, they go away. And I went, okay.

19:35.720 --> 19:40.720
And that was the first and kind of last time I ever did that because I did it.

19:41.960 --> 19:46.520
I've done it. I've done it a couple of times, but I try to avoid,

19:46.720 --> 19:50.520
I try to avoid if there's emotion going to alcohol, like meaning I'd not want to

19:50.520 --> 19:52.880
say anxiety, but like depression.

19:53.400 --> 19:57.400
I kind of sit in the depression cause or anxiety. I lean towards alcohol,

19:57.400 --> 19:59.640
like anxiety, like about flying or, or,

20:00.400 --> 20:04.760
or just like getting worked up on over something. But with depression,

20:04.760 --> 20:08.840
I try to avoid alcohol and just sit in it. Um, cause I,

20:09.200 --> 20:13.920
because I've gone there before I've, but anxiety is, I land, I land all the time.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.480
But depression, heartbreak, all that. You just sit in the feeling.

20:18.280 --> 20:20.480
Yeah. Heartbreak is a weird one for me.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.760
So like the last time I got my heart broken at Leanne dumped me, um,

20:23.800 --> 20:26.120
we were dating for like four months and she broke up with me.

20:26.640 --> 20:30.920
And my instinct was to have a drink. My friends went to this, uh, this, uh,

20:30.960 --> 20:33.280
Middle Eastern restaurant. And I told him what was going on.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.920
And my buddy core's like, let's get a cocktail. And I was like, I don't want one.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.200
I got to figure this out cause I want this chick.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.160
And if I start drinking, I'll be like, ah, fuck it.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.280
So I got to figure it out. Like I wonder,

20:44.360 --> 20:47.600
I'm going to find out my dad dies one day or my mom,

20:47.840 --> 20:50.840
but my dad will be the rough one. My mom will be equally as rough.

20:50.880 --> 20:55.880
My dad and I were really close and I wonder if I've thought about this a lot,

20:56.520 --> 21:01.520
if I'll have a drink dealing with that. Like I think about that a lot.

21:02.160 --> 21:06.720
I keep saying everything I get with my dad is extra. My dad,

21:06.720 --> 21:11.200
my dad had a a hundred percent blockage in his widow maker twice and both times

21:11.200 --> 21:15.560
they saved his life and he got a stint I think 12 or 13 years ago.

21:15.560 --> 21:18.960
And then he just got a stint this last year.

21:19.840 --> 21:23.880
But so everything I get to do, I feel like is extra. And so, you know,

21:23.880 --> 21:26.600
he was just at the premiere of my movie and he got to see that and he had a very

21:26.600 --> 21:30.840
emotional response and I got to, I got that from him. And I was like, that,

21:30.840 --> 21:33.480
that's a little icing on the cake. I did, you know,

21:33.480 --> 21:35.960
the arena in Tampa was the first time he ever saw me do standup.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.560
That was like a little extra.

21:37.960 --> 21:41.040
So all these things I'm getting with him are all extra. So I have, you know,

21:41.440 --> 21:45.600
at least 74. So yeah,

21:46.360 --> 21:50.240
that'll be a tough one. Well at the premiere, he was what? Proud. Yeah.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.960
He came out, he was sobbing, crying, and he goes,

21:52.960 --> 21:56.520
I've underestimated you your whole life. And I was like, what? And he was like,

21:56.520 --> 21:59.560
and he just, and he was shaking. He goes, I just underestimated you.

21:59.560 --> 22:03.320
I didn't know. I didn't know you, I didn't know you were this, I didn't know,

22:03.320 --> 22:05.800
whatever. It was really hard to understand him to be honest with you.

22:06.480 --> 22:09.120
I don't know totally what he said. He might've just not liked the movie.

22:09.120 --> 22:14.120
I think you were hearing what you wanted to hear.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.720
What'd you learn about life from your father?

22:21.800 --> 22:22.960
It's not going to make sense.

22:23.640 --> 22:26.920
I want to feel like sometimes I'm like a professional fucking wrestler because

22:26.920 --> 22:29.080
all I care about is you come and see me do standup.

22:29.080 --> 22:32.480
So whatever I got to do to get you there. But the number one thing,

22:32.640 --> 22:37.080
my one takeaway from that man's humility and I applied,

22:37.120 --> 22:41.360
I've applied it in different ways throughout my career. On my 26th birthday,

22:41.360 --> 22:45.240
he gave me a really aggressive speech.

22:46.160 --> 22:51.160
He, I was hungover and I just thought he was going to say happy birthday.

22:51.360 --> 22:54.280
So I picked up the phone and I was like, Hey, and he was like,

22:54.280 --> 22:58.640
you are a tremendous piece of shit. And then he broke me off.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.480
You have no humility. You have no this, you have never succeeded in anything.

23:01.480 --> 23:04.480
You, you're, you're lying to yourself. You're lying to everyone around you.

23:04.520 --> 23:07.200
You're not doing what you're going after your dream. I broke you.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.920
I failed you as a father, this and that. I was like,

23:08.920 --> 23:10.280
I thought you're going to wish me happy birthday.

23:11.560 --> 23:15.160
And so in that speech,

23:15.160 --> 23:18.800
he told me if I wanted something I had to go at it and I had to go after it as,

23:18.880 --> 23:22.880
as hard as I could. And I had to do whatever it could.

23:22.880 --> 23:25.160
I could do to achieve that. In this case,

23:25.160 --> 23:28.080
it was working offering to do anything at the comedy club to get on stage.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.080
He told me, I told him, I saw how it works. And he said, no,

23:32.440 --> 23:34.480
that's how it works for some poor kid from Harlem.

23:35.800 --> 23:38.840
Cause that kid needs it. He goes, you've grown up with privilege your whole life.

23:38.840 --> 23:40.800
You don't need it. You think you're going to be fine.

23:41.760 --> 23:45.920
And so I went and I ended up getting a job at the door, but I,

23:46.760 --> 23:49.720
it was, it was, it was, it's humbling. It's, it's really like, uh, it's,

23:49.720 --> 23:53.960
it's makes me feel, it made me feel uncomfortable. And so that humility,

23:55.200 --> 23:58.040
uh, is why it's the first time I really understood humility.

23:58.040 --> 24:01.160
And I've applied that in many respects in like,

24:01.800 --> 24:05.280
in like getting to be a paid regular at the comedy store that happened late in

24:05.280 --> 24:09.040
life for me, which I think most people would give up and be like, fuck that.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.360
I'm already a touring comic. I'm on TV. I don't need that,

24:11.760 --> 24:13.520
but it's something I wanted and I knew I wanted.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.560
So I just humbly went after it.

24:17.440 --> 24:22.080
And then I think I still apply it when it comes to selling

24:22.080 --> 24:25.440
tickets or selling a project to the fans

24:26.040 --> 24:28.520
or even to doing podcasts.

24:28.520 --> 24:31.840
I try to be as honest as I can about whatever I'm going through or whatever

24:31.840 --> 24:34.560
I'm dealing with. But when it comes to like selling things, I don't have,

24:34.560 --> 24:39.120
I don't have a problem trying to make fun of myself or,

24:39.120 --> 24:43.120
or get in front of people so that they know that,

24:43.120 --> 24:45.120
that I have a show. Cause the thing I'm good at,

24:46.080 --> 24:50.320
the one thing I know I'm good at stand up. And, and I say that humbly,

24:50.320 --> 24:52.560
but like, I want them to come there. So like,

24:52.800 --> 24:55.960
I've heard people make fun of me. Like before they're like, yeah, I'm not some,

24:56.400 --> 24:59.640
I'm not some clown in a speedo who's one is going to, I'm a real comic.

24:59.640 --> 25:02.200
And I go, okay, but I'm, I want it.

25:02.240 --> 25:05.440
I want them to have my shows and you can be that guy and I'll be this guy.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.480
Yeah. The clown in the speedo.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.240
Yeah. It's like, what are you going to do?

25:10.000 --> 25:13.360
Funny people make fun of me for taking my shirt off. Like, I guess behind my back,

25:13.360 --> 25:15.680
no one ever does it to me. Like no one would ever,

25:17.200 --> 25:20.000
comics aren't, comics aren't, comics aren't that manly.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.600
Yeah. Yeah.

25:23.720 --> 25:27.520
But I always go like, I always go like, who, what do you care? What am I doing?

25:27.520 --> 25:28.360
What do you care?

25:29.240 --> 25:31.800
And you love taking shirt off more than anything.

25:32.960 --> 25:37.280
You know, when something becomes meme and becomes super popular, it, um,

25:38.240 --> 25:41.640
it becomes easy to not love the thing anymore to get tired of it.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.600
You still love it more than anything.

25:44.520 --> 25:49.080
I like being shirtless more than having a shirt.

25:49.080 --> 25:53.040
I'm very uncomfortable in a shirt. Like right now, and I've tactile issues,

25:53.280 --> 25:55.320
like I've legit tactile issues.

25:56.680 --> 26:01.080
I'm most comfortable in stretchy jeans with a loose fitting belt.

26:01.680 --> 26:05.400
And then these shirts exactly, but I don't, I like more like a V neck.

26:05.400 --> 26:08.440
I feel, I can feel this on my neck right now and I can feel it on my arms.

26:08.960 --> 26:14.160
And so I'm, I'll sit a certain way cause it, I, it just rubs me wrong.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.080
But yeah, I'm more comfortable shirtless. I can never wear what you're wearing.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.600
Yeah. Well, this is my shirtless.

26:22.600 --> 26:25.840
Each of us have to find our place in this world in terms of fashion.

26:25.880 --> 26:30.360
I would love to be able to wear what you wear. Yeah. Cause it looks good.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.800
It feels like an escape from convention.

26:34.120 --> 26:38.400
Well, you or me, both of us. Yeah. Cause this, nobody wears this.

26:39.680 --> 26:43.120
Unless you work security for somebody. Yeah. But it looks good on you.

26:43.440 --> 26:47.000
Does it? I don't know. You know, I think people think,

26:48.000 --> 26:51.160
but I don't know. Like they would say, like, what, what if you lose weight?

26:51.680 --> 26:54.440
You can't take your shirt off anymore. Go, no, I can take my shirt off.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.120
If I can out of your mind, I'm gonna take my shirt off all the time.

26:58.200 --> 27:03.040
You mentioned early on heartbreak after the Russia trip with a girl who slept

27:03.040 --> 27:06.960
with your friend. Let's go back to Hemingway quotes.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.440
The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.

27:12.080 --> 27:16.600
So to go all in with the trust. I love Hemingway so much.

27:17.040 --> 27:21.080
Um, have you been betrayed in your life?

27:21.280 --> 27:23.520
Yeah. What do you think about trust?

27:25.720 --> 27:28.640
That's an interesting question. Um,

27:29.880 --> 27:33.160
I've been betrayed in my professional life a couple of times by really close

27:33.280 --> 27:35.720
friends and, uh,

27:38.440 --> 27:42.200
I'm not someone who can't, like, I have a mantra that, I mean, I'm,

27:43.080 --> 27:45.160
I don't know if people have heard it or not. And I'm, I hate,

27:45.240 --> 27:49.320
I hate sharing it, but it's, but it's true. The mantra is,

27:49.320 --> 27:53.440
so you think I'm weak. Like, do you think it's like, that's my thing.

27:53.440 --> 27:57.040
Cause I feel like people take advantage of me and I go, so you think I'm weak.

27:58.240 --> 28:01.360
You forget everyone that like the, and I'm named the,

28:01.560 --> 28:05.440
the people that have betrayed me, I'm a larger man than all of them. And,

28:05.440 --> 28:09.400
and, and so that's what really fucks with me is I go, so you think I'm weak?

28:09.680 --> 28:13.600
Like where I grew up, when you do stuff, there was physical consequences.

28:13.600 --> 28:16.280
I grew up in Florida. Like I've been beaten up a bunch.

28:16.720 --> 28:19.840
I'm not saying I can fight, but like I'm not scared of getting beaten up.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.320
And the, the times that I've been betrayed, I, and, and,

28:24.960 --> 28:26.920
and even, I know even like by Ari, whichever,

28:27.120 --> 28:31.000
people see that drugging as a betrayal and I did for a period, but it was,

28:31.000 --> 28:32.600
it was only because it was Ari and he was my,

28:32.600 --> 28:36.240
one of my best friends and me and him had to work through that. Cause I, I,

28:36.320 --> 28:40.080
I couldn't not love him. Like I couldn't not have him in my life.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.160
He means a lot to me. He really does.

28:42.560 --> 28:45.840
He's a great friend to have, but he's also,

28:46.440 --> 28:48.240
I don't know what was going on with him at that time,

28:48.240 --> 28:50.840
but he made a bad decision and I had to forgive him for that because I knew he,

28:50.880 --> 28:55.360
he knew my mantra. I think I'm harder to trust people now.

28:56.040 --> 29:01.000
I'm not as apt to trust people at all, but there was a moment,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.680
I don't know if I've ever shared this and I don't know how this will sound,

29:04.280 --> 29:07.920
but there was a moment that information got leaked about a thing and all my

29:07.920 --> 29:11.680
managers and agents, both, both,

29:12.720 --> 29:16.480
Tom and my Tom and our managers and agents would like to separate,

29:16.520 --> 29:20.920
either separate us or one of us, one of them get both of us.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.240
It's just more lucrative for them.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.080
So they have always kind of pitted us against each other a little bit and they

29:27.080 --> 29:32.080
do it subtly. They'll do it to me and my team,

29:32.320 --> 29:35.040
and then his team will do it to me and then my team will do it to him and his

29:35.040 --> 29:35.880
team will do it to him.

29:36.800 --> 29:39.200
And there was a moment where information got leaked about this thing I was

29:39.200 --> 29:42.800
doing. And my team was like, just so you know, your,

29:43.400 --> 29:48.000
your boy Tommy is the rat. And I had to,

29:48.960 --> 29:53.800
it was the one time and Leanne said, do you think Tom would do that? I said,

29:53.880 --> 29:58.760
I don't know how faith works. Like I'm not a super religious person,

29:59.320 --> 30:03.000
but I will tell you that I believe in Tom and I don't think he did it.

30:03.040 --> 30:07.200
And I will stand by that ignorantly and,

30:07.760 --> 30:11.360
and I will ride or die with him because I cannot live in a world where I don't

30:11.360 --> 30:15.480
trust him. If I don't trust him, then I am so fucked.

30:16.360 --> 30:18.880
And it wasn't him. It wasn't him.

30:18.880 --> 30:22.120
And it was such a cool feeling to know that you could like,

30:22.920 --> 30:25.840
that you could blindly trust someone, blindly have faith in someone,

30:25.840 --> 30:29.280
know that they have your best interest at heart. But yeah,

30:29.280 --> 30:30.200
it took me a while to get there.

30:30.200 --> 30:33.640
Rogan helped me get there cause I wasn't trusting him or Joey or Tommy or

30:33.640 --> 30:34.840
anyone. I wasn't trusting anyone.

30:34.840 --> 30:37.960
I'd gotten in a bad thing and I just wasn't trusting anybody.

30:38.840 --> 30:42.360
And Rogan was like, yeah, man, we're trying to be your fucking friend.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.640
And I was like, yeah, I don't, I don't need friends.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.800
I couldn't understand what, why Rogan was interested in me. And I was,

30:48.880 --> 30:52.600
I said to like someone, I was like, is he gay? Like, what the fuck? Yeah.

30:52.720 --> 30:55.520
And then he was just a nice guy. He was just a nice guy.

30:57.760 --> 31:01.040
It'd be hilarious if Joe was sexually attracted to this whole time.

31:01.240 --> 31:03.760
This whole time is the reason he keeps inviting you back.

31:03.760 --> 31:04.960
I would be more excited.

31:05.120 --> 31:09.520
I would be more excited if just if he tried to kiss me on the lips once just in

31:09.520 --> 31:13.520
just like in a Scotty Scotty J way from boogie nights where he's like,

31:13.520 --> 31:17.280
what do you like my car? Yeah. You know, nobody would believe that story.

31:17.320 --> 31:21.040
No one. Yeah. If I was Joe, I would kiss dudes all the time.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.480
And then be like, and then, and then when they didn't kiss back, oh,

31:23.480 --> 31:25.040
you know, no one will ever, no one will ever believe you.

31:25.360 --> 31:29.560
Yeah. Well, when you trust people like that and they fuck you over,

31:29.560 --> 31:31.360
that can really, really, really hurt.

31:32.160 --> 31:36.600
You end up on a treadmill in a hotel room, fighting with them.

31:36.600 --> 31:39.360
You fight with them all the time. You fight with them all the time.

31:40.400 --> 31:44.040
You fight with them constantly. And it's, and I,

31:44.040 --> 31:48.200
and I have this thing like where I go ruminate on an idea and I can't get it

31:48.200 --> 31:51.400
out of my head and I hear the words they say. And I, and I, and.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.440
So all in your head on a treadmill in your head, just fighting,

31:55.640 --> 31:58.640
just fucking fighting. And then, yeah.

31:58.640 --> 32:03.400
And then one day you get past it. Like one day you just go,

32:04.160 --> 32:06.680
fuck them. I'm not going to give them real estate.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.040
And then you just forget about them.

32:08.440 --> 32:11.480
And then they reach out and they'll try to be a Dick or a bully because they're

32:11.480 --> 32:13.760
bullies. They're bullies is what they are. Don't ever forget it.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.760
They're fucking bullies and they got bullied. It's not their fault.

32:16.760 --> 32:17.600
They got bullied.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.400
And then they try to bully you and you're,

32:20.400 --> 32:22.360
and you don't have any connection anymore. And you're like, Oh,

32:22.360 --> 32:25.880
you can go fuck yourself. You can actually go fuck yourself. You're not my boss.

32:26.080 --> 32:27.800
You're not my wife. You don't fuck me. You don't pay me.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.120
Get the fuck out of my life.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.680
But this kind of mantra of the, you're not weak.

32:33.200 --> 32:36.920
You still want to be able to be fragile to the world and appear weak almost.

32:37.240 --> 32:38.280
Well, I am. I am. I mean,

32:38.280 --> 32:40.360
that's the problem is I think I am pretty fucking weak.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.840
I'm not the strongest dude out there. I have really thin skin.

32:44.840 --> 32:49.080
I get my feelings hurt all the time. And so, but like,

32:49.720 --> 32:54.720
but it sucks when you watch like your friend see something in you that you go

32:55.560 --> 32:59.080
or they go, fuck him. He's not paying attention. Fuck him.

32:59.120 --> 33:01.920
Let's just fuck him. Let's take his money. You know what? Fuck him.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.960
He doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. Look at me. He's a drunk alcoholic.

33:04.960 --> 33:08.200
And you go, Oh no, bitch, I pay attention. Like I'm, I'm, I'm wide awake.

33:08.200 --> 33:11.760
I'm here. I'm working my ass off. You're not going to fuck in.

33:12.680 --> 33:15.200
Well, that's the tough thing about like you and Tom Segura,

33:15.200 --> 33:17.520
you're at the top of your game on the top of the world.

33:17.560 --> 33:22.560
Some of the most famous comics in the world and you could see money start to

33:22.560 --> 33:27.560
creep in like a business decisions. I don't know. It's a tough,

33:27.960 --> 33:30.560
it's a tough place. It's really tough. It's really tough for it.

33:30.560 --> 33:34.560
You know, especially as we're growing and, and, uh,

33:37.360 --> 33:38.960
I'll tell you what it,

33:39.960 --> 33:42.960
I don't know how much I'm allowed to say, but I can tell you this.

33:44.560 --> 33:45.960
We had a business deal

33:47.560 --> 33:52.160
where feelings were getting involved and money was getting involved.

33:52.560 --> 33:55.360
Money was involved in that and the money was causing the feelings.

33:56.760 --> 34:00.560
And one of us said to the other person,

34:00.560 --> 34:04.560
our feelings are more important than the money. So let's just split the money.

34:05.560 --> 34:09.160
And it was, and it was, and it was, and, and, and it was,

34:09.160 --> 34:13.160
it was really like a solid moment where I were, both of us were like,

34:13.560 --> 34:15.160
that is how we should run this. Yeah.

34:16.160 --> 34:18.360
That's the interesting things that like with bands,

34:18.560 --> 34:22.560
you'll have like popular bands that split and even,

34:23.360 --> 34:27.560
even though it's clear that the contribution is not even, it's like, uh,

34:27.560 --> 34:29.360
there's a front man and all that kind of stuff,

34:29.360 --> 34:31.760
but it's ultimately the right thing to do to say,

34:31.760 --> 34:36.760
fuck you to the money for the most part and prioritize the feelings.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.760
Especially because like I couldn't do it without him.

34:40.960 --> 34:44.360
He couldn't do it without me. We do it separately. We'll have guest bears on.

34:44.560 --> 34:47.360
Some will blow up. Some won't. You can never figure it out,

34:47.360 --> 34:48.760
but when we're together, it does well.

34:49.460 --> 34:53.560
And so we need each other for it to work. And we've, you know, like I said,

34:53.560 --> 34:57.660
we're on a handshake deal with two bears and no one likes that.

34:58.260 --> 35:01.960
But we're like, Hey, I mean, we, I don't like to the point where I like,

35:02.260 --> 35:06.160
he'll call me and go, yo, we have a deal to do this for X amount. Are you in?

35:06.660 --> 35:10.160
And I go, yeah, I don't check the books. I don't need to. I don't, I don't,

35:10.160 --> 35:11.460
I know him. I just know him.

35:12.760 --> 35:14.760
What do you love most about Tom Segura?

35:14.760 --> 35:19.760
We saw a gay couple one time.

35:20.360 --> 35:21.160
It was a good start.

35:21.560 --> 35:25.460
And there was one guy was in khakis and one guy was in jean shorts with a

35:25.460 --> 35:29.860
Python around his neck. And Tom goes, if we were gay, which one would you be?

35:29.960 --> 35:34.460
I said, I'm fucking Python. And he was like, yeah, I'm khaki. And I go, really?

35:34.460 --> 35:35.460
And he goes, yeah, that's why we work.

35:36.060 --> 35:38.860
And he goes, all relationships are for pythons and khakis. And I went, really?

35:38.860 --> 35:41.760
And he goes, look at you in the end. Who do you think you are? I go, I'm Python.

35:42.060 --> 35:45.860
And he goes, she's khaki. And he goes, me and push. I go, oh, she's Python.

35:45.860 --> 35:48.360
He goes, and I'm khaki. He goes, I'll always be khaki.

35:48.660 --> 35:51.760
And sometimes I'll have a relationship around the Python, but it's,

35:51.860 --> 35:56.760
I'm usually a khaki. And I was like, yeah, I am a little bit of a lunatic.

35:56.760 --> 36:03.160
I'll tell you the one, the moment that explains me and him that the world will

36:03.160 --> 36:05.060
never see. It was just a great moment.

36:05.060 --> 36:10.260
We got stem cells with Rogan one weekend and one day and I'd had surgery in my

36:10.260 --> 36:11.460
arm and I didn't want to do it.

36:11.460 --> 36:13.660
I was terrified. And Tom just said, just come out and meet up with us.

36:13.660 --> 36:14.960
Tom knew he was going to make me get them.

36:15.760 --> 36:21.060
And so I got them and he, you know, Joe's there.

36:21.060 --> 36:23.160
And so we're just all talking. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

36:23.160 --> 36:25.560
And I'm, and Tom can see that I'm spinning out a little bit.

36:26.360 --> 36:29.860
And I get in the car and you know, Tom's got a Porsche.

36:29.860 --> 36:31.060
So we're like right next to each other.

36:31.860 --> 36:35.960
And I just want to feel if it's swollen and it is a little swollen.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.260
Cause I just got an injection.

36:37.860 --> 36:40.660
And then in Tom's driving and he's got his hand on the thing.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.760
He just puts his hand on my arm and he goes, you're okay.

36:44.260 --> 36:45.560
He just, he's watching.

36:45.660 --> 36:50.060
He knows me so well that he knows that I'm spinning out of control.

36:50.060 --> 36:51.060
He's like, you're okay.

36:51.660 --> 36:53.360
And then I was like, and I felt okay.

36:53.360 --> 36:54.060
I was like, you're right.

36:54.060 --> 36:54.560
I'm okay.

36:54.560 --> 36:55.560
What the fuck am I doing?

36:55.560 --> 36:56.460
My brain's that brain.

36:58.260 --> 37:00.060
Man, that guy got so much love in him.

37:00.960 --> 37:01.760
Dude, he does.

37:01.760 --> 37:08.160
He has, uh, you know, he had a fantastic relationship with his dad.

37:09.060 --> 37:14.860
And, and, and I think whatever that did, that dude did to create that dude,

37:15.460 --> 37:17.060
he hit it out of the fucking park.

37:17.060 --> 37:24.460
Cause he has so much, uh, love that he doesn't need reciprocated

37:24.560 --> 37:26.460
like at all, like he can just love.

37:27.060 --> 37:31.360
And then he feels good for him to give and to like take care of someone.

37:31.760 --> 37:34.260
And like, you know, he started the whole birthday gift thing.

37:34.260 --> 37:37.060
Cause and he didn't need to, he just was like, Hey man, I had this bike.

37:37.060 --> 37:37.860
I thought you'd like it.

37:38.660 --> 37:42.060
And then of course I've turned it into a fucking bit and now we're

37:42.060 --> 37:44.860
upside down on 120 upside down on a fucking race car that we can't

37:44.860 --> 37:45.760
make our money back on.

37:46.060 --> 37:46.860
Uh, I love it.

37:47.160 --> 37:50.460
Uh, what do you love most about Joe Rogan?

37:50.660 --> 37:55.060
Oh, that dude, I could go on and on about Joe Rogan.

37:55.260 --> 37:59.960
Joe Rogan is the most selfless individual I've ever met.

38:00.060 --> 38:03.560
He doesn't care if he has you on the podcast.

38:03.760 --> 38:06.760
He wants you to be the funniest person in the room.

38:06.960 --> 38:09.460
He wants you to be the smartest person in the room.

38:09.660 --> 38:10.360
Let me tell you something.

38:10.360 --> 38:12.660
Joe Rogan is 10 times smarter and funnier than me.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.460
He wants you to shine.

38:14.760 --> 38:17.060
He wants, he wants to put you over to his fans.

38:17.260 --> 38:21.060
He, that shit did not exist before he started doing his podcast.

38:21.260 --> 38:23.060
People didn't share you with their fans.

38:23.160 --> 38:25.060
No one was like, Hey man, come on on the road with me.

38:25.160 --> 38:25.860
They brought you on the road.

38:25.860 --> 38:28.760
Cause they wanted you to suck and they put you in bad scenarios.

38:28.760 --> 38:30.760
Joe Rogan wanted you to shine.

38:31.260 --> 38:37.860
He gave, he gave so many people, beautiful career, gave them careers, gave them.

38:38.360 --> 38:41.260
Joe could have looked at his podcast as his thing.

38:41.660 --> 38:42.360
This is my thing.

38:43.060 --> 38:44.260
I bring on these guys.

38:44.260 --> 38:45.760
I'm going to be the funniest guy in the fucking room.

38:45.860 --> 38:46.860
I know some guys that have done that.

38:47.760 --> 38:48.260
It might be me.

38:49.260 --> 38:51.560
Might be time I talk over people and not listen really well.

38:51.860 --> 38:53.060
Joe had did the opposite.

38:53.060 --> 38:55.960
Now I look, I've tried to learn from Joe on my podcast and do the same.

38:56.460 --> 38:59.360
That guy, when you think about it, you named 10 of his friends.

38:59.460 --> 39:01.660
I bet eight of them are doing arenas right now.

39:02.460 --> 39:03.460
They're all doing theaters.

39:03.460 --> 39:04.660
All his friends do theaters.

39:04.660 --> 39:06.860
All his friends do theaters.

39:07.160 --> 39:08.860
He is, he is just.

39:10.660 --> 39:13.260
You know, I, I, he, and he won't accept this compliment.

39:13.260 --> 39:14.360
I tried paying it to him.

39:14.960 --> 39:19.720
Uh, in, in Austin, when I was in Austin last night, he's not

39:19.720 --> 39:20.960
good at accepting compliments.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.060
I gave him a gift too.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.060
And I said, Hey, I need it.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.160
I need to show you.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.660
I can't just tell you this because it's going to fall in deaf ears.

39:26.660 --> 39:27.660
I need to give you a minute.

39:27.860 --> 39:32.760
So you have something so you know that I think about you and I'm grateful

39:32.760 --> 39:35.360
for having you in my life a lot for many reasons.

39:35.660 --> 39:38.060
I have more friends in my life because of you.

39:38.260 --> 39:39.860
He taught me how to trust people again.

39:40.060 --> 39:41.860
I have a career because of you.

39:41.860 --> 39:44.360
I have a major motion picture because of you.

39:44.360 --> 39:47.660
I do arenas because of you without you in my life.

39:47.860 --> 39:50.260
A lot of these things maybe never would have happened.

39:50.260 --> 39:51.660
I never would have told the machine on stage.

39:51.860 --> 39:54.460
I wouldn't have gotten, I would have never started a podcast.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.160
I wouldn't have three podcasts.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.560
Like, I mean, all these things are things.

39:59.060 --> 40:03.360
He not just, he didn't just take me to the water one time and give me a drink.

40:03.360 --> 40:06.160
He, he gave me a machete and he said, this is how I get to the water.

40:06.260 --> 40:08.860
You got to put your own path, but just give me a heads up.

40:09.360 --> 40:10.860
You can also use my path whenever you want.

40:11.660 --> 40:14.760
I mean, he, he is the most selfless individual.

40:14.760 --> 40:18.660
He will go down in history as one of the 10 most important people

40:18.660 --> 40:20.360
in standup comedy without a doubt.

40:20.560 --> 40:21.360
He changed the game.

40:21.860 --> 40:23.360
It didn't exist like this before him.

40:23.960 --> 40:25.960
And, uh, and he won't accept that compliment.

40:26.260 --> 40:27.160
What was the gift you gave him?

40:27.360 --> 40:28.060
I can't tell you.

40:28.360 --> 40:28.960
Is it a dildo?

40:29.160 --> 40:29.960
No, it was a dildo.

40:30.360 --> 40:31.260
It was a double-sided dildo.

40:31.260 --> 40:34.660
I go, Hey, when you get free time, can we scissor fuck each other?

40:36.360 --> 40:39.260
Uh, you're happily married, uh, for 19 years.

40:39.960 --> 40:42.960
So I think you're a good man to ask, how do you find love?

40:43.360 --> 40:47.560
How do you find, how do you date in order to find a love of your life, of a lifetime?

40:47.860 --> 40:50.960
This is going to sound off.

40:52.660 --> 40:56.760
But don't, don't tie yourself down.

40:56.760 --> 41:02.660
Meaning like, don't spend time fucking with those little mini

41:02.660 --> 41:06.160
shrimp and peel them every night when you know, you're looking for a lobster.

41:06.560 --> 41:06.960
Yeah.

41:07.160 --> 41:10.260
Like, and so I think what happens with a lot of guys, they just, they're

41:10.260 --> 41:13.560
so busy and like just getting pussy and going from here to here to here.

41:13.760 --> 41:14.660
I was never that guy.

41:14.760 --> 41:17.960
I always wanted, I always wanted to find someone who understood me.

41:18.060 --> 41:18.960
I always wanted that.

41:19.260 --> 41:23.260
And so, you know, granted, I haven't had sex with a lot of chicks, but that's,

41:23.860 --> 41:25.260
and it's, and it's not by choice.

41:25.260 --> 41:28.360
I'm saying like, maybe there was times I would have done it, but I, but I

41:28.360 --> 41:31.860
know that I was always looking for someone to figure out, to get me.

41:32.060 --> 41:36.860
And then, and then I will say this when you know, you know, when you know,

41:37.160 --> 41:42.060
you know, when you think there's, I can't imagine a life without this person.

41:42.860 --> 41:44.160
That, that, that happened to me.

41:44.160 --> 41:47.260
And I can only say my experience is I had Leanne.

41:47.260 --> 41:48.060
I had Leanne.

41:48.560 --> 41:51.660
I loved her and I, and I didn't even realize it.

41:52.060 --> 41:54.860
And the second she dumped me, I went, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

41:55.360 --> 41:58.160
Oh, I, I don't get to live a great life without her.

41:58.160 --> 42:00.560
She's the thing that's going to give me a great life.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.560
I knew it undisputed.

42:02.560 --> 42:04.860
I went for a run and she dumped me.

42:05.260 --> 42:06.560
I went to my shower.

42:06.560 --> 42:07.060
I cried.

42:07.060 --> 42:07.860
I went to Barnes and Noble.

42:07.860 --> 42:09.560
I bought menna from Venus, women from Mars.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.160
I watched Fight Club in my closet.

42:11.360 --> 42:11.960
I didn't drink.

42:11.960 --> 42:14.360
I drank a lot of Nyquil to sleep.

42:14.760 --> 42:17.460
And then I went for a hike in Runyon Canyon.

42:17.460 --> 42:20.260
I was running back down outpost by Ben Affleck's house and,

42:20.860 --> 42:22.160
and the sun was setting.

42:22.460 --> 42:25.160
And I just said, God, if you're listening,

42:27.460 --> 42:28.760
just give me this chick back.

42:28.860 --> 42:30.060
I'll never fuck it up.

42:30.460 --> 42:31.260
This is the one.

42:31.360 --> 42:32.460
I won't fuck it up.

42:32.660 --> 42:33.460
I won't cheat.

42:33.660 --> 42:35.060
I'm not going to be a bad dude.

42:35.260 --> 42:36.360
I want to have kids with her.

42:36.460 --> 42:37.360
I'll be there.

42:37.460 --> 42:38.960
I'll be a great fucking dude.

42:39.360 --> 42:40.460
I'll take her out on dates.

42:40.860 --> 42:42.460
Like I'll love this chick.

42:43.060 --> 42:45.960
And I got home and she was in my room in a sundress.

42:46.660 --> 42:48.060
And I was like, oh fuck you.

42:48.060 --> 42:48.960
I didn't know he was real.

42:49.560 --> 42:50.360
I was like, shit man.

42:50.360 --> 42:51.360
Give me like one more night.

42:52.560 --> 42:55.360
You have some strange tail real quick before I commit forever.

42:55.560 --> 42:59.160
But I think when you know, you know, this is so silly, but I follow

42:59.160 --> 43:03.960
that in business, like when you know, you know, and like my assistance

43:03.960 --> 43:06.160
with us and someone goes, how did you, how do you find a good assistant?

43:06.160 --> 43:08.960
And I go, when you know, you know, like people will show you who they are.

43:10.160 --> 43:11.960
I can tell you when I fell in love with my assistant.

43:13.360 --> 43:16.960
We were doing a TV show and, and, and we worked past dinner and all

43:16.960 --> 43:18.160
the dinner places were closed.

43:18.660 --> 43:20.360
And he just said, Hey, I got like four meals.

43:20.360 --> 43:21.160
I didn't know which one you'd want.

43:21.160 --> 43:23.060
So I got four different meals for you.

43:23.260 --> 43:23.860
I ordered them.

43:23.860 --> 43:25.960
They're up in your room and just let me know whichever you want.

43:25.960 --> 43:27.060
I'll take care of the rest of them.

43:27.460 --> 43:30.460
And I was like, Oh, that, that dude thinks about other people before himself.

43:30.860 --> 43:31.960
He didn't even get himself dinner.

43:32.460 --> 43:33.660
He just got me four dinners.

43:33.660 --> 43:35.260
And I was like, fuck.

43:35.860 --> 43:38.160
I did the same thing with my, my social media manager.

43:39.060 --> 43:41.260
The way she was operating was I was like, I feel like she's

43:41.260 --> 43:42.160
thinking about me.

43:43.160 --> 43:45.360
And we connected on so many levels on so many levels.

43:45.360 --> 43:48.060
I could talk to her about things and ideas I had.

43:48.060 --> 43:49.160
And then I was like, okay, I want her.

43:49.160 --> 43:49.660
I want him.

43:49.660 --> 43:53.560
I want, I think you, I think it's got to be that thing when you know, you know,

43:53.560 --> 43:59.560
and it can be so simple as like, like a personal trainer or like a

43:59.560 --> 44:03.460
jujitsu class or like just where you go, Oh, I'm connecting right now.

44:03.660 --> 44:06.260
But you have to allow yourself to notice that person.

44:06.360 --> 44:07.660
You, I think you do.

44:07.760 --> 44:09.960
I mean, I think you have to put yourself out there and you have

44:09.960 --> 44:12.360
to be available for it, you know?

44:12.460 --> 44:14.960
That's the hardest part is just being available for it.

44:15.760 --> 44:19.160
Cause so people, so many people just want to be busy, just dating.

44:19.760 --> 44:20.760
I just want to have someone in my life.

44:20.760 --> 44:21.360
I don't want to be bored.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.860
I don't want to, what if I die alone?

44:23.160 --> 44:25.460
I don't want to, I like just be available for it.

44:26.060 --> 44:26.760
Uh, what is it?

44:26.760 --> 44:30.860
You said peeling the baby shrimp when you could be having a lobster.

44:32.560 --> 44:33.760
Lobster is still a lot of work.

44:33.760 --> 44:34.360
I have to say.

44:34.460 --> 44:36.760
Yeah, but yeah, but it's lobster.

44:37.360 --> 44:40.360
So this is a fucking baby shrimp or like, and you ever get, so you ever

44:40.360 --> 44:41.860
get the ones in Brazil where you just go fuck it.

44:41.860 --> 44:42.560
I'll eat the shell.

44:42.560 --> 44:43.360
I don't care anymore.

44:44.060 --> 44:45.060
Like, I'm so fucking hungry.

44:45.060 --> 44:48.360
You just handful of lobster, like it's popcorn or baby shrimp, like it's popcorn.

44:49.860 --> 44:50.860
I've done that in Vietnam.

44:50.860 --> 44:51.260
I've done that.

44:51.260 --> 44:51.960
Where did I just go?

44:52.060 --> 44:53.060
It's too much work.

44:53.560 --> 44:56.560
So when you're in it, what's the secret to successful marriage?

44:57.460 --> 44:59.360
What, what do women want?

45:00.060 --> 45:00.660
Or pressure.

45:00.660 --> 45:01.360
Oh fuck.

45:01.360 --> 45:03.060
That's I'm the wrong guy to answer that.

45:03.460 --> 45:06.460
I think how to make love to a woman by bird crusher.

45:06.560 --> 45:07.660
How do you make love to a woman?

45:07.860 --> 45:08.760
I'll tell you how I do it.

45:09.160 --> 45:09.460
Yeah.

45:09.860 --> 45:16.660
Uh, I go down on her first, make sure she has an orgasm.

45:16.660 --> 45:17.060
Yeah.

45:17.560 --> 45:19.860
And then I get my turn and that's over pretty quick.

45:20.660 --> 45:22.460
It's like, it's like getting your ears pierced.

45:22.460 --> 45:23.860
It'll feel a little prick and it's over.

45:25.360 --> 45:32.760
I, um, I don't know if I've done a great job keeping her happy.

45:32.760 --> 45:34.460
I think I keep her interested.

45:35.060 --> 45:39.860
Like I think I, I, I, I keep her occupied.

45:39.960 --> 45:42.060
Like I'm like a road, a little bit of a rodeo clown.

45:42.560 --> 45:43.460
Like, I don't know.

45:43.460 --> 45:45.760
I mean, like I know we're happy right now.

45:45.760 --> 45:52.560
I know we're really happy, but I don't know if I ever did as good a job as

45:52.560 --> 45:55.560
she did, like she's always been.

45:56.560 --> 45:59.860
Like she's always been a gangster, like done it, did everything.

45:59.860 --> 46:00.560
Just does everything.

46:00.560 --> 46:01.260
She does it all.

46:01.360 --> 46:03.460
She does everything like fucking everything.

46:03.460 --> 46:04.060
And she loves it.

46:04.060 --> 46:04.860
She just does it.

46:05.360 --> 46:08.260
And then she shows love for you by taking care of you.

46:08.660 --> 46:12.160
And so like, I have a lot of times just been this like, almost like

46:12.160 --> 46:16.560
step and repeat husband where it's like, I come in to take a picture

46:16.660 --> 46:18.460
like, Hey, Monday, Tuesday.

46:18.560 --> 46:18.760
All right.

46:18.760 --> 46:19.560
I'm on the road Wednesday.

46:19.560 --> 46:20.260
Take care guys.

46:20.760 --> 46:21.660
Or like travel channel.

46:21.660 --> 46:22.860
I'd live for two weeks at a time.

46:22.860 --> 46:24.260
I left for the movie for three months.

46:24.560 --> 46:29.760
So like, I don't know that I've ever done a bang up job.

46:30.560 --> 46:31.060
I buy it.

46:31.060 --> 46:34.660
Like I go, I remember one time I was just like, I don't cheat on her.

46:34.860 --> 46:35.560
I don't hit her.

46:35.860 --> 46:36.660
I don't yell at her.

46:37.060 --> 46:38.060
I'm a pretty good fighter.

46:38.060 --> 46:39.060
I'm a really good fighter.

46:39.060 --> 46:43.260
Like, like I'm good at like going like, Hey, we're on the same team.

46:43.660 --> 46:45.160
Oh, you mean de-escalation.

46:45.360 --> 46:48.460
I'm really good at like, I'm very self, I'm very accountable.

46:49.060 --> 46:50.460
I'm very self-correcting.

46:50.760 --> 46:53.560
Like if, if we're in a fight and she points something out and I go, Oh,

46:53.560 --> 46:54.960
you're right, I go fuck.

46:54.960 --> 46:55.660
You're right about that.

46:55.660 --> 46:56.060
You're right.

46:56.060 --> 46:56.460
You're totally right.

46:56.460 --> 46:57.060
In the moment.

46:57.160 --> 46:57.560
In the moment.

46:57.560 --> 46:58.460
I'm really good at that.

46:59.560 --> 47:00.360
And my wife's not.

47:00.360 --> 47:01.660
She's not a good apologizer.

47:01.660 --> 47:04.860
Like she needs to sleep on an apology and then she can do it.

47:04.860 --> 47:06.360
I can apologize in the moment.

47:06.360 --> 47:10.460
If I realize I'm wrong and I'm really quick to find my fault.

47:11.060 --> 47:11.360
Yeah.

47:11.360 --> 47:12.260
I look for my fault.

47:12.260 --> 47:16.160
Cause I go, tell me what I did adversely as a parent.

47:17.760 --> 47:21.660
I have pulled my daughters aside and been like, yo, that wasn't you.

47:22.360 --> 47:23.060
That was mom.

47:23.460 --> 47:23.660
Yeah.

47:23.760 --> 47:24.860
I'm giving you a heads up.

47:25.260 --> 47:27.660
Cause I don't want, cause I got, I got really confused as a kid.

47:27.660 --> 47:30.160
Cause my dad always made sure I knew I was wrong.

47:31.260 --> 47:32.260
And sometimes I wasn't.

47:32.460 --> 47:32.760
Yeah.

47:32.960 --> 47:34.260
And then as a kid, you're kind of fucked up.

47:34.260 --> 47:35.260
You're like, well, how do I know if I'm wrong?

47:35.260 --> 47:36.160
And I think that raises.

47:36.460 --> 47:40.260
So I was really good with my girls going like, yo, and then, and then

47:40.260 --> 47:42.460
parenting Georgia taught me a lot about self-correcting.

47:42.760 --> 47:44.960
Self-correcting was that my oldest.

47:46.760 --> 47:50.360
I had only five parented, like my dad parented, like just like raise

47:50.360 --> 47:51.260
your voice, get up to here.

47:51.260 --> 47:51.760
That's it.

47:51.760 --> 47:53.060
No, that doesn't fuck this.

47:53.460 --> 47:55.960
How come the dogs don't have goddamn leashes on the collars on their necks?

47:56.860 --> 47:59.360
And so with Georgia, I had to learn through therapy.

48:01.360 --> 48:05.960
That if the, if the, if the consequences here and it, and the

48:05.960 --> 48:09.160
highest it goes is here, then why the fuck wouldn't they lie and do everything?

48:09.160 --> 48:12.460
Cause they go, well, I know what it's like to hear, but if you can vary

48:12.460 --> 48:18.660
your consequence with a child and find some conversation in it, then all

48:18.660 --> 48:20.360
of a sudden they're like, well, fuck.

48:21.260 --> 48:22.160
Well, I don't want to lie.

48:22.160 --> 48:23.460
Cause this does, this does suck.

48:23.560 --> 48:24.360
I like this.

48:24.360 --> 48:25.160
I like where we talk.

48:25.160 --> 48:28.560
And he says, write a thousand words on why driving around your kids

48:28.560 --> 48:30.160
in a car, kids in a car is bad.

48:30.760 --> 48:32.860
So threaten extreme violence every once in a while.

48:34.060 --> 48:34.260
Yeah.

48:34.260 --> 48:35.860
Let them know the dog can fucking bite.

48:36.460 --> 48:37.160
The dog can bark.

48:37.160 --> 48:37.860
The dog can bite.

48:38.460 --> 48:40.360
But if you pet him on his belly, a wag his tail.

48:41.060 --> 48:41.660
Yeah.

48:42.760 --> 48:45.760
Uh, do you worry about being a way too much?

48:45.760 --> 48:51.660
I mean, you're one of the most creative content pushers and creators out there.

48:51.660 --> 48:54.060
You're just constantly innovating, constantly putting stuff out there.

48:54.060 --> 48:58.560
But do you worry that pulls you away from like, uh, the mundane experience

48:58.560 --> 49:01.560
of life that can bring contentment and happiness?

49:01.660 --> 49:02.060
Yeah.

49:02.160 --> 49:05.960
I feel like sometimes it cannibalizes your real life where you start going.

49:06.560 --> 49:10.160
You start thinking in promo videos or you start looking at a vacation as a bit.

49:10.560 --> 49:10.760
Yeah.

49:10.860 --> 49:12.060
We should go zip lining.

49:14.360 --> 49:16.760
Why don't you do, uh, what shoes you wear?

49:16.760 --> 49:19.960
And I like, it can, it can definitely cannibalize your life.

49:20.960 --> 49:25.460
My wife's really good at going like, no, like no phones.

49:26.260 --> 49:27.160
The girls are really good.

49:27.160 --> 49:30.260
The girls, when I started Instagramming stuff, they started saying stuff like

49:30.760 --> 49:33.460
dad hits mom and then I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, guys.

49:33.460 --> 49:34.460
They're like, no, put your phone away.

49:34.560 --> 49:34.960
Yeah.

49:34.960 --> 49:36.360
Dad, dad loves boys.

49:36.360 --> 49:37.260
And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

49:37.260 --> 49:38.260
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

49:38.260 --> 49:38.560
Yeah.

49:39.060 --> 49:44.460
Uh, what's, um, what are some secrets, words of wisdom you can say for how to

49:44.460 --> 49:48.060
be successful online and all the, everything you've learned, you're kind of

49:48.560 --> 49:49.460
like the Mr.

49:49.460 --> 49:55.460
Beast of comedy, just innovating constantly in terms of how to promote

49:55.460 --> 49:59.060
stuff, in terms of how to present stuff across the different social media,

49:59.460 --> 50:01.360
across YouTube, podcasts, all that stuff.

50:02.160 --> 50:05.960
I think the number one thing is don't be afraid to suck.

50:07.160 --> 50:08.160
No one sees the shit.

50:08.160 --> 50:08.760
This sucks.

50:09.560 --> 50:10.360
Doesn't get views.

50:10.760 --> 50:11.560
It just gets forgotten.

50:11.660 --> 50:11.960
Yeah.

50:12.060 --> 50:12.660
Gets forgotten.

50:13.060 --> 50:13.960
The good stuff they remember.

50:13.960 --> 50:15.060
And then that's all they bring up.

50:15.660 --> 50:17.760
The stuff that sucks just goes away and they're like, oh yeah.

50:17.760 --> 50:18.460
Did you do that?

50:18.560 --> 50:19.860
I don't even think I saw that.

50:20.760 --> 50:21.060
Fuck it.

50:21.060 --> 50:21.560
Who cares?

50:21.960 --> 50:22.260
Yeah.

50:22.260 --> 50:24.660
You know, it's like, it's like, I watched, I, I, one of my

50:24.660 --> 50:29.260
favorite stories about this is, uh, a guy named, uh, Sean Patton.

50:30.060 --> 50:33.060
I was explaining Instagram stories to him and Ari and Mark Norman.

50:33.060 --> 50:36.860
And I was explaining that you can set now sell tickets on Instagram stories.

50:36.860 --> 50:39.460
It was back when they swiped up instead of tap the button to swipe up.

50:40.260 --> 50:41.260
And they didn't understand it.

50:41.260 --> 50:42.260
And I said, let me show you.

50:42.360 --> 50:43.860
And I put up tickets for sale.

50:44.660 --> 50:46.360
And I said, you know, Hey guys, swipe up.

50:46.360 --> 50:47.560
And then I just showed him in 10 minutes.

50:47.560 --> 50:48.760
Look, there's not many people swiped up.

50:48.760 --> 50:49.860
It was 145 people.

50:50.260 --> 50:52.360
It's a lot of people to buy tickets for a fucking comedy club.

50:52.360 --> 50:53.660
And they were like, Whoa.

50:54.360 --> 50:55.660
And they're like, what do you do stories about?

50:55.660 --> 50:56.460
I go fucking anything.

50:56.460 --> 50:57.060
Who gives a shit?

50:57.460 --> 50:57.960
Just anything.

50:57.960 --> 50:58.760
And some things work.

50:58.760 --> 50:59.460
Some things don't.

51:00.260 --> 51:01.560
And I watched Sean Patton.

51:01.860 --> 51:03.060
Shout out to Sean Patton.

51:03.660 --> 51:08.860
Try for about 15 minutes to do an Instagram story about, uh, his cup of tea.

51:09.460 --> 51:12.660
He was making a cup of tea and he was making, and he kept going, Hey, you

51:12.660 --> 51:14.260
got, okay, hold on, hold on to me.

51:14.960 --> 51:16.360
I was filming him from the couch.

51:16.560 --> 51:18.060
I was filming all these, the whole thing.

51:18.060 --> 51:18.260
Yeah.

51:18.260 --> 51:21.860
I filmed every single one of my, like 15 different stories of him trying to do that.

51:21.860 --> 51:24.960
I had 145,000 views on each story.

51:25.060 --> 51:25.860
He never posted it.

51:27.060 --> 51:27.860
He never posted it.

51:27.860 --> 51:31.060
And I was like, I was like, man, if he had just posted that one, he never

51:31.060 --> 51:32.160
posted anything in his stories.

51:32.160 --> 51:32.360
Yeah.

51:32.560 --> 51:36.660
That one 145,000 people would have gone to his story to see that cup of tea

51:36.660 --> 51:38.660
being made and see which one he finally went with.

51:39.160 --> 51:42.860
And so sometimes I think the biggest mistake you can make is just not doing it.

51:43.260 --> 51:45.560
Just do it, just post it, turn the camera on.

51:45.560 --> 51:48.360
The idea will show up and that's, that's the number one thing.

51:48.760 --> 51:50.260
Just turn the camera on and it'll come up.

51:50.360 --> 51:51.260
You'll figure it out.

51:51.260 --> 51:52.460
Do you do multiple takes or no?

51:52.860 --> 51:56.460
I maybe I do three, like, and I'm talking even like in the dance video I

51:56.460 --> 51:58.260
did where I did the hip hop dance.

51:58.260 --> 51:59.660
I did two takes on that.

52:00.160 --> 52:03.960
Um, when I had the marching band come to my house, I did two takes on that.

52:04.660 --> 52:09.060
Um, once you start doing more takes, you lose the fun of it, I think.

52:09.560 --> 52:14.160
And, uh, and then the fun ones, I mean, my favorite one I've ever done

52:14.660 --> 52:21.760
without a doubt, my favorite promo I've ever done is, uh, I needed, they

52:21.760 --> 52:26.760
added a second show in some city and, uh, and, and they had a second show

52:26.760 --> 52:29.160
like Friday and Saturday and our third show.

52:29.760 --> 52:31.760
And I said, all right, they just told me, I was like, fuck, I'm leaving

52:31.760 --> 52:33.160
like tomorrow, I need to sell tickets.

52:33.660 --> 52:35.360
So I said, real quick girls, meet me outside.

52:35.360 --> 52:36.460
And Leanne's like, girls are doing homework.

52:36.460 --> 52:37.560
I go to take five seconds.

52:37.960 --> 52:38.660
I put on a speedo.

52:38.660 --> 52:39.660
I got the American flag.

52:40.260 --> 52:41.660
I gave Isla the hose.

52:41.660 --> 52:44.160
I gave Leanne the leaf blower and I gave Georgia the drone.

52:44.960 --> 52:49.760
And I just had Georgia drone it back to reveal the leaf blower.

52:49.860 --> 52:53.460
And the mist you were seeing was coming from Isla and Leanne.

52:53.860 --> 52:55.260
I'm in a speedo with American flag.

52:55.560 --> 52:58.360
I have Bob Seeger playing rambling, grambling man.

52:59.960 --> 53:03.760
And, and that night Larry, the cable guy texted me and he goes,

53:03.760 --> 53:05.360
this is fucking genius.

53:05.860 --> 53:08.060
And I was like, it was just, and it was just like, yo, just, let's

53:08.060 --> 53:09.960
just shoot something who gives a fuck.

53:10.760 --> 53:11.860
Like just shoot something.

53:11.860 --> 53:15.860
Just, just, just say something and, and, and, and put a little, just

53:15.860 --> 53:17.360
do a little movement into it.

53:17.360 --> 53:19.560
And, and those are my back.

53:19.560 --> 53:22.260
And that was, I used to be, I watched a bunch of my promo clips back from

53:22.260 --> 53:22.860
back in the day.

53:22.960 --> 53:23.860
I used to be really good.

53:23.860 --> 53:27.460
Now it's like, I'm promoting so fucking many things.

53:27.460 --> 53:30.160
I'm just like, I'm almost like, I'm exhausted by my promotions.

53:31.360 --> 53:31.560
Yeah.

53:31.560 --> 53:34.460
Because you know, the, the well can dry up in terms of ideas.

53:34.860 --> 53:34.960
Yeah.

53:34.960 --> 53:37.060
And it's like, how many times am I going to show a picture of my ass?

53:37.060 --> 53:38.360
My ass sells really good.

53:38.660 --> 53:43.060
Whatever my ass is on Instagram, fucking million views guaranteed a million

53:43.060 --> 53:47.760
views, your ass and, and, and, and, and it's, and it's an active post.

53:47.760 --> 53:49.560
Like people are like, I did the best one.

53:49.560 --> 53:53.260
I did the other day was where I superimposed my ass on my front and

53:53.260 --> 53:54.460
it just looked beautiful.

53:54.460 --> 53:54.760
Yeah.

53:54.860 --> 53:55.560
No views.

53:56.860 --> 53:58.260
Oh, so you got reported.

53:58.660 --> 53:59.260
Oh, I see.

53:59.260 --> 54:00.360
It looked like a front vagina.

54:00.860 --> 54:01.860
Oh, is that what it was?

54:01.860 --> 54:02.560
Yeah, I think so.

54:02.560 --> 54:08.160
But like, but yeah, my ass, I'm at a place right now where I am promoting.

54:10.260 --> 54:11.460
I'll be promoting this movie.

54:11.660 --> 54:14.660
I'll be promoting this movie until it goes to a streamer.

54:14.960 --> 54:15.760
I'll be promoting it.

54:16.460 --> 54:17.460
Uh, shamelessly.

54:17.460 --> 54:18.260
I am proud of it.

54:18.260 --> 54:19.860
I had a great time shooting it.

54:20.060 --> 54:20.960
It's in theaters.

54:21.560 --> 54:23.060
It'll be on video on demand.

54:23.060 --> 54:24.060
It'll be on a streamer.

54:24.060 --> 54:24.460
I'm sure.

54:24.460 --> 54:28.160
I don't know, but I'm sure I'm promoting fully loaded my summer

54:28.160 --> 54:29.660
festival with 19 different comics.

54:29.660 --> 54:33.660
I'm promoting the tops off world tour that starts again this fall.

54:33.660 --> 54:35.960
I'm promoting my cruise, the fully loaded cruise.

54:36.260 --> 54:37.460
I'm promoting red rocks.

54:37.860 --> 54:42.460
I'm promoting so many things that today was the very first time in my

54:42.460 --> 54:46.660
career where I said in January, I'm going to take a break.

54:46.760 --> 54:49.860
I'm going to take a break and go like, Hey man, let's, let's get

54:49.860 --> 54:51.760
your resting heart rate down.

54:52.260 --> 54:53.560
Let's, let's get some sleep.

54:54.160 --> 54:56.660
Let's, let's maybe take off like three months from drinking.

54:57.360 --> 55:02.360
Like, let's just really like slow it down and also not think when

55:02.360 --> 55:06.660
you're thinking in promo all the time, it can be a little exhaust.

55:06.660 --> 55:08.960
I mean, you think you think it's exhausting to look at my feet.

55:09.060 --> 55:10.460
It's exhausting to be my feet.

55:10.660 --> 55:11.360
I'm my feet.

55:13.060 --> 55:14.260
That's not as less as more.

55:15.260 --> 55:20.960
One of the things that one, one of the things that inspires me about

55:20.960 --> 55:27.160
Rogan, for example, is, um, he almost never does this kind of stuff.

55:27.260 --> 55:27.760
Yeah.

55:28.060 --> 55:29.860
And the hell suddenly does this podcast.

55:29.960 --> 55:30.360
Cause you're right.

55:30.360 --> 55:30.960
Less is more.

55:30.960 --> 55:31.460
How would you do it?

55:31.460 --> 55:32.460
Like once a month?

55:32.760 --> 55:34.260
No, he does it three times a fucking week.

55:34.260 --> 55:37.160
Yeah, more is more is more is perfect.

55:37.360 --> 55:40.660
But for example, when he does like a story or something like this, he

55:40.660 --> 55:43.560
does one take it's kind of shitty.

55:44.560 --> 55:45.560
It's the same day.

55:45.560 --> 55:46.060
It's the same.

55:46.160 --> 55:50.360
It's elk with a bunch of jalapenos, a knife that he had sent to him by

55:50.360 --> 55:53.460
a fucking knife maker and him going, look at this.

55:53.560 --> 55:55.260
Look at this Traeger smoker.

55:55.460 --> 55:56.660
I reverse seared this.

55:56.760 --> 55:57.460
This is what's great.

55:57.460 --> 55:57.760
Look at this.

55:57.760 --> 56:00.560
I'm about to put it in the butter and like, this is grass fed butter.

56:00.660 --> 56:02.460
This elk really raises my testosterone.

56:02.660 --> 56:06.160
Rogan is it's you're right with guys like Rogan.

56:06.160 --> 56:08.660
When he does do a story, they're a little precious.

56:08.760 --> 56:09.260
Yeah.

56:09.560 --> 56:13.360
And there's, I don't think he's, he's ever done a second take

56:13.960 --> 56:15.660
at any of those stories.

56:15.760 --> 56:19.060
No, there's a, you have to really admire that.

56:19.060 --> 56:23.160
Like if the shot is framed poorly, if the audio sucks, doesn't matter.

56:23.360 --> 56:27.460
Does you remember when he, this is like, like I can get in the weeds on

56:27.460 --> 56:30.560
Rogan, but, and especially when it's Instagram, do you remember when he

56:30.560 --> 56:33.960
got his polar plunge and he couldn't sit in a minute and then the next

56:33.960 --> 56:36.660
day and then he must have gotten it on the internet bad.

56:36.860 --> 56:37.160
Yeah.

56:37.560 --> 56:38.660
He must've gotten it bad.

56:38.760 --> 56:38.960
Yeah.

56:39.260 --> 56:43.860
The next day he sat in for 20 minutes and he lowered his core temperature

56:43.860 --> 56:46.560
by like two degrees and it took him like a month to get that back.

56:46.560 --> 56:46.860
Yeah.

56:47.360 --> 56:48.760
That is that fucking man.

56:48.960 --> 56:51.460
What an interesting, you know, it's, I told you at the

56:51.460 --> 56:52.560
beginning, we were just talking.

56:53.260 --> 56:56.360
I like, I really enjoy, I draw inspiration for men.

56:56.360 --> 57:03.560
I'm not like, um, you, David Goggins, cam Haynes, um, Andrew

57:03.560 --> 57:04.960
Huberman, Huberman.

57:04.960 --> 57:10.060
I love, uh, uh, uh, fucking, I mean, there's so many guys like that.

57:10.060 --> 57:13.260
Rogan, you know, you can do Tim Kennedy.

57:13.560 --> 57:16.860
Like there are a lot of guys that are like just very different men than

57:16.860 --> 57:18.760
me and I love Jocko Wilnick.

57:19.260 --> 57:24.960
Like I love, I love reading their stuff or listening to their audiobooks

57:24.960 --> 57:29.260
or while listening to their podcasts because I'm so not like that, but that

57:29.260 --> 57:31.860
to, for me, when I add a little bit of that in my life, like I remember you

57:31.860 --> 57:35.760
went, I don't know what you were doing, but you were walking us through your

57:35.760 --> 57:40.460
day and it was so fascinating.

57:41.660 --> 57:44.960
It was like, it was like, I ran eight miles today.

57:44.960 --> 57:46.160
I listened to an audio book.

57:46.160 --> 57:49.160
I was running eight miles and then I came and I worked for about

57:49.160 --> 57:51.060
three hours straight on AI stuff.

57:51.060 --> 57:54.860
And I'm like, and I was like, wait, you sat at a desk?

57:54.860 --> 57:58.460
Like you like sat at a desk and like, and I, I actually, I

57:58.460 --> 57:59.660
wouldn't even know what to do.

57:59.760 --> 58:01.160
I would start doing crafts.

58:01.260 --> 58:03.360
Like I wouldn't like that.

58:03.360 --> 58:06.060
You went, I was like, is your computer like, yeah.

58:06.460 --> 58:12.260
Have you sat for like four hours focused on a single task?

58:12.360 --> 58:12.960
Me?

58:13.060 --> 58:13.360
Yeah.

58:13.460 --> 58:13.860
No.

58:15.460 --> 58:17.360
Oh, I have a hard time sleeping for four hours.

58:17.960 --> 58:18.360
Yeah.

58:18.460 --> 58:20.060
Like I don't have that.

58:20.760 --> 58:25.660
I don't have a brain that like, I really admired it when I listened to you do

58:25.660 --> 58:28.660
it, cause then you were like, you were talking, you were fasting at the time.

58:28.660 --> 58:32.960
You were doing your fast and then you talk about what you ate and I was jealous.

58:32.960 --> 58:34.560
So I wanted to be able to be like that.

58:35.060 --> 58:37.660
And I think at that time we started, I think you were doing maybe bone broth

58:37.860 --> 58:42.660
or something and we started doing bone broth pretty religiously and adding that

58:42.660 --> 58:43.360
into a fast.

58:43.360 --> 58:47.460
Cause I was like, it does for someone like me, it does feel cool to add a

58:47.460 --> 58:48.860
little bit of control into life.

58:50.060 --> 58:53.760
So integrating a little bit of a way of being from another

58:53.760 --> 58:54.960
person that you're not like.

58:55.060 --> 58:55.160
Yeah.

58:55.160 --> 59:00.560
Like, like, uh, like, so, so David Goggins is consistently pushing himself.

59:01.160 --> 59:02.160
I love, I did it.

59:02.160 --> 59:06.360
I did it over the pandemic more, but I loved going today.

59:06.360 --> 59:07.260
I'm running a marathon.

59:07.860 --> 59:10.860
I'm going to get on the treadmill and it's not going to be all at once, but

59:10.860 --> 59:12.960
I'm going to get through a marathon today.

59:13.260 --> 59:16.260
So let's get up, give us six months from coffee and let's see if we can

59:16.260 --> 59:18.560
do like five miles and then know that we started there.

59:19.160 --> 59:24.460
And that was really fun to like, um, Cam Haynes does that too, where he goes

59:24.460 --> 59:28.860
like, he almost just sets the limit and then, and then achieves that.

59:28.960 --> 59:31.160
His son Truett is really fascinating.

59:31.460 --> 59:34.260
Cause his son Truett's right now is trying to get the, and like, I bet

59:34.260 --> 59:37.360
people would never think that this is who I watch, but I get real

59:37.360 --> 59:42.060
inspiration from those people because I showed Jaco, I showed a clip to

59:42.060 --> 59:49.460
Jaco to Isla cause Isla is like me, like, like a person of her fluids impulse.

59:50.060 --> 59:51.960
I w I walked in on her one time.

59:52.160 --> 59:58.160
She was in the pantry in a bathrobe in the dark drinking a root beer.

59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.060
And I opened the door and she went, I said, what?

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.660
She goes, I thought you were mom shut the door.

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.860
And I shut the door to let her finish the root beer.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.660
She has a hard time waking up.

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:09.660
So I look, come in here.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:11.860
I want you to see this clip from Jaco.

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:13.460
She goes, who's Jaco?

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:14.860
I say, he's a Navy SEAL.

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:15.860
She goes, he works at the zoo.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:19.160
I went, no, it's a Navy fucking seal.

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:20.860
I go, it's a bad-ass job.

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:21.860
She goes, it's a silly name.

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:22.760
And I went, no, it's not.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:23.660
It isn't a silly name.

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:25.760
These guys are the toughest dudes in the world.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:28.360
She goes, she's kind of right though about the silly name.

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.360
I never even realized that.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.660
Well, yeah, you talk to a child.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.460
And so I go, watch this, what he says about waking up.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.960
So it hits the thing and Jaco goes, first thing you do when

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.660
you hear that alarm clock, you could roll over.

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:40.460
You could go back to bed.

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:42.460
You could hit snooze, but you get out of bed.

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:44.060
And that's your first victory.

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:47.960
And Isla hits pause and she goes, how great is that nap right

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.460
after you hit snooze though?

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:50.560
It is pretty funny.

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:52.360
I go, you're missing the point.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.560
You're missing this whole speech.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.060
He's with Casey Neistat when he's telling this speech.

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:57.060
He's with Casey Neistat.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.360
And so I hit it and then he goes, and then you've got a victory

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.560
under your belt, then you go to the gym and you work out and I

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.160
go, you listen to Isla and she goes, yeah.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.360
And he goes, and then when you go to work, now you've got two

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.560
victories, you've worked out and you've woken up on time.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.660
You didn't hit that snooze button.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.460
So when you go into that break room and you see donuts and she

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:15.460
hits pause, she goes, um, if he's about to say no to donuts,

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:16.260
I'm done listening.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:18.260
I go, he's definitely going to say no to donuts.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.060
Do you think he's going to have a donut?

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.060
And she goes, you like this guy?

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:23.060
I go, I fucking love him.

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:25.260
And she goes, do you think he'd like you?

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:26.760
And I go, what do you mean?

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.660
She goes, dad, you hit snooze, you skip working out and you

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.260
love donuts.

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:32.460
And I'm like, yeah, you're making a good fucking point.

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:35.660
I go, but I, but I do love that.

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:41.160
Like I love to watch that brain work and go like, like I don't,

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:43.760
I don't hit snooze, like I don't hit snooze.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.260
Now I go fuck it.

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:49.360
Cause I'm up, but I, and then, and then I go to the gym every

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:51.860
single morning, I go to the gym every single morning and today's

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.860
national donut day, I didn't have a donut.

01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:57.060
And so like, I, I like, I try, I like, try to apply these a

01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:59.660
little bit, cause I mean, the other side of me is like tonight,

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.860
after we do this, I'll do another podcast and then I'm going to

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:04.860
call Leanne and go, yo, we're in Beverly Hills.

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:05.660
Meet me out here.

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:06.960
Let's go have drinks.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.360
Let's go have fucking couple Campari spritz.

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.660
I was over at a friend's house and overnight, let's get some

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:14.360
edibles and let's fucking have a night about it.

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.660
Get some sushi, go have sex in the hot tub.

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:18.360
And I got to work out at fucking 10 in the morning.

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:24.660
I got to tell you that nap when you press snooze is the sweetest.

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.160
That's, that's my victory.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.060
First victory is pressing snooze and getting the nap onto the

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:30.360
belt.

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:33.960
I have you ever had, I had, so this, this morning I didn't

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:34.160
work.

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:34.960
I didn't work out.

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:38.560
I'd press it like five in the morning until about six.

01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:40.360
You're going hard right now.

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:40.660
Yeah.

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:40.960
Yeah.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.160
Yeah.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.060
And then I had a podcast flew to Austin.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.760
I was like, what, huh?

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:46.360
Yeah.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:50.060
Why just run around theaters and now you're back.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:50.560
Yeah.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:54.360
Run around theaters to do, to promote the movie and then look,

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:55.860
you only get one shot at these movies.

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:56.760
So you might as well do it.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:58.560
And look, it's really hard to get people to go into movie

01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.160
theater right now.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:04.960
And so I woke up at like six, did five or six to seven did

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:05.460
press.

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:11.560
And then I went and I said, and I'm really into a podcast,

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.160
history podcast right now.

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:16.060
And I was listening to this one about the conquistadors and I

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:19.560
was, and I was like, before when I woke up, I was like, I

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.660
wouldn't mind going back to that.

01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:23.460
And I said, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna take a little nap

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:24.860
and go there.

01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:26.060
I slept good last night.

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:27.460
I slept like seven hours last night.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:33.660
Boy, that 30 minute nap, it felt like five hours and I woke

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:36.560
up going, I gotta readjust my sleep score.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.760
That has to be in the 97.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:38.760
That was the best fucking nap.

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:42.060
Those little snooze naps are monsters.

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:43.860
You know, there's I don't care.

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:45.560
That's probably for me.

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:49.760
One of the peak experiences of life is those naps.

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.260
I don't know what that is.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.260
Have you ever slept in a tour bus?

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:57.760
A tour bus versus a regular bus like a tour bus, like meaning

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.360
like it's in a bunk.

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:00.560
No.

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:04.260
I've taken a lot of buses in my life though.

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:04.760
What do you mean?

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.260
Like just like a, like a greyhound, those are very

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.360
different and public transit.

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:15.760
Listen, they, that's just part of part of life and a greyhound.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.760
I was on a greyhound one time, I was on a greyhound one

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.360
time, right?

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:22.560
When Notorious B.I.G.'s album came out in college and I was

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:26.760
going from Tallahassee down to Tampa and the dude got on

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:30.260
the tour bus, got on the bus next to me, black dude, and

01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:31.160
he sat down.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.260
He said, where you headed?

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:34.060
And I said, Tampa.

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:34.960
He said, you grew up in Tampa?

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:35.460
I said, yeah.

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:37.560
I said, you and he goes, yeah, I said, you go to school

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:40.160

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:42.960
He goes, no, I just got out of prison.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.560
I said, you got a prison?

01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:45.460
And he goes, yeah.

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:46.660
Yeah, man.

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:47.360
I got out of prison.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.260
I stabbed a dude and and and I've been in prison.

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.060
I just got out today.

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.060
He goes, what are you listening to?

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.660
I said Notorious B.I.G.

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.860
and he goes, oh shit, that's out.

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:58.360
And I went, yeah.

01:04:58.360 --> 01:04:59.360
And he goes, I want to hear it.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.060
Can I hear it?

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.360
And I was like, yeah.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.260
And he used my headsets.

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.460
The whole bus ride to Tampa.

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:06.160
I didn't have the bombs like he stabbed a man.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:06.660
They're yours now.

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:10.560
I just sat next to him and I was like, is it you enjoying it?

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.660
He's like, this is good.

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:13.560
No tour bus naps.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:14.060
Yeah.

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:19.460
When you're in a bunk, it's ice cold bus isn't moving five

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:19.960
o'clock.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.160
You got like we work out from like up until like five o'clock

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:26.460
530 show starts at seven, but that five o'clock to six six

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:27.260
thirty nap.

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.260
It's pitch black.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:34.160
It's like a coffin and it is ice cold and you got all your

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.860
pillows and blankets in there and you put a little history

01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:41.760
podcast on in the corner and you just listen to like Kurt

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:45.160
Mombashi or like, oh my God.

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.060
So you're talking about like 5 6 p.m.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:47.760
for 7 p.m.

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:52.560
Show the best nap you'll ever have you wake up so refreshed.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:56.560
Yeah, like I've woken up from naps like where I'm like fuck

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.660
you like they're those those tour bus naps are the best

01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:00.060
naps.

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:05.860
I think having a full productive day and then like 5 6

01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:06.360
p.m.

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:09.960
To get a nap and then you do something really stressful after

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.860
that like really hyper like like a show.

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.360
But if I do like I really like doing podcasts like late at

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:20.560
night after a nap, I think I fucked up my podcast rhythm

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:22.160
because we're doing them in the day.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.960
Yeah, and so sometimes I'm just like I like if I work out

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.260
the morning.

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:27.760
I'm good on a podcast, but if I don't work out I suck on

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.360
a podcast.

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.560
I'm just like, uh-huh.

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:30.860
Yeah.

01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:32.960
Yeah, that's cool.

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.960
No, I am.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.160
My favorite is I used to do this a lot.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:45.760
I haven't done it in a while is full busy day nap at home box

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:49.960
of wine on the treadmill and do that until like midnight watching

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.560
TV box of wine box of wine on a treadmill.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.060
It's the best highway.

01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:55.860
How are you sipping it?

01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:58.360
Jake you have a glass, but you have a box the box fits on

01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.360
the corner on the treadmill.

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:00.760
So you just got a little spigot.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:04.160
Yeah, and you sit there and just put on like guys grocery

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.560
games or like just something just like a you walking or

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.160
you running I walk I walk like a three five.

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:11.560
So what will happen is if you started three started three

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:14.460
casual walk 20 minutes again a mile in and then you and

01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:17.060
you're going to feel loose get up to a three five.

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:20.560
You can do seven miles on these things and just and just and

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.260
you're just enjoying your night, especially like my wife back

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.660
in the day when we lived in our old house.

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:26.360
My wife would come into the man cave and she sat on the

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.760
couch and we watched TV together.

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.860
And like watch Game of Thrones and use like for an hour and

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:32.160
you just get on the treadmill and do it.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:32.760
Oh man.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:36.160
I I loved having done that as much lately.

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.460
That was the fucking you can lose yourself.

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:39.560
You can forget yourself.

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:42.060
You forget going to treadmill and you just are like walking

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:45.060
and you're sweating and you're and you're having wine and

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:50.460
then at certain points you're like like you like you start

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:54.060
jogging especially like we were watching not all quiet on

01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:54.760
the restroom front.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:57.960
What's the one where they've got to they've got to get the

01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.160
message to the front line.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.860
I would run like I was in World War two.

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:04.260
Yeah, I would run when they would run and it was fucking

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:07.060
awesome and I would be like because they were doing drinks

01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:07.760
and be like take a drink.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.160
You got to run up there and be like, okay.

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:11.360
Yeah, I'm really into it.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.060
I'm really into history podcast right now.

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:16.960
Like I've been in them for a while 20th century or everything

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:19.260
everything everything I listen to.

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:26.260
Was it Marcus Aurelius and Cleopatra today?

01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:28.760
In the middle of the podcast.

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.560
They're like, you know, just you know, Cleopatra wasn't as

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.460
hot as everyone says.

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.560
I was like, why are you saying that you guys tell me she's

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:33.960
a sick.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:34.960
She looks like snooki.

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:37.460
Yeah, like I want why let me let me dream that she looked

01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:38.360
like Kim Kardashian.

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:38.660
Yeah.

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.360
And then I listen to that one today.

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.060
I listen to World War two a lot.

01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:47.660
Oh a lot of books on World War two a lot of podcasts about

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:47.860
it.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.460
What's your favorite theater?

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.060
The Pacific or European?

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:54.760
No European Pacific.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:57.960
Well, because my family's so much of it has died in that

01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:58.360
theater.

01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:00.260
So to the person so much of it.

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:03.160
I hate to sound cliche like I'm Arnold Schwarzenegger an

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.760
80s movie, but it's personal.

01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:08.460
Well, you know what I find funny about that is Lenin.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:10.360
It was Lenin, right?

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.560
John Lennon.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:12.260
No, no, no.

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:14.960
Was it Lenin was World War two, right?

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:15.760
Or was it Stalin?

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:17.160
Stalin.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:17.760
Stalin.

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:20.060
Stalin thought him and Hitler would be friends.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:23.160
Yeah, I think that's so cute that he was like, we're going

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:23.860
to be buddies.

01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:25.360
Yeah, like we're boys.

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:25.660
Yeah.

01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:27.660
And then Hitler's like, oh fuck you.

01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:28.860
I'm Hitler, bro.

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:29.660
This is what I do.

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.060
Well, at first he was like fuck.

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:31.460
Yeah.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:32.060
Yeah.

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:32.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:33.160
We'll be friends.

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:33.860
Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:36.460
And then call me call me better yet.

01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:37.460
I'll show up in winter.

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:38.160
How's that sound?

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:44.960
Yeah, that that I find that I find all of that so fascinating

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:45.460
when I was a kid.

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.560
I had a hard time understanding how because we were always

01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:51.060
at war with Russia when I was a kid and I had a hard time

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:53.360
understanding how we could be on the same team as Russia

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:54.260
in World War two.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.660
And I was like, wait, how did that turn south?

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:58.260
And then you listen to podcast.

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:01.660
Yeah, I'm that all of that.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:06.360
All of that like all of the World War two.

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:10.460
I got really into the Pacific shit for a while, but I'm

01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:16.460
really deep in the in in the whole we went to Normandy

01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:20.460
from the Cliffs of Dover and to think so.

01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:21.860
That's the fucking beach.

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.460
That's the fucking beach.

01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:25.260
Oh shit.

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.360
This is cold as fuck.

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:29.060
These dudes jumped in ice cold water.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:31.060
Yeah, and this isn't like a cool beach.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:36.260
Like this is and it's just so insane to and then to see

01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:39.260
like the that it's pretty intense.

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:41.660
I don't know why I got into history late in life.

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:44.460
I wasn't I was kind of into it, but I'm really into it

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:48.060
now and I love just learning a little something about you

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:52.360
know today was I listened to like the Noiser has a great

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.160
history stuff.

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.560
It's like history for dummies.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.960
I think like I get I can't listen to the really smart

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:00.260
stuff starts losing me too many names.

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:00.960
I'm gone.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.560
Yeah, well Dan Carlin is always the best.

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:08.460
Your podcast with Dan Carlin was so fucking good.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:13.760
He's he is I mean, I only know about Martin Luther because

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:14.560
of Dan Carlin.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:18.060
I only know like I would have I made a joke about some

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:21.560
Lutheran the other day and everyone laughed and I was like

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.960
did you guys listen the same podcast I did because I just

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:27.460
am quoting Dan Carlin I that his podcast.

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:33.160
I mean we all quoted the same shit about Genghis Khan about

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:37.860
how he could shoot a dove off a horseback, but we knew that

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:41.960
all four hoofs had to be off the ground at the same time

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:46.160
they shot they would sometimes take their meat and stick it

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:50.560
under their saddles and that I mean Dan Carlin is he is

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.760
the motherfucker.

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:55.560
Yeah, God those were ma'am discovering podcast was the

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:59.160
coolest time of my life and the interesting thing about

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:03.060
him is his audio and so it's the voice.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.260
So for me, I mean everybody has a story with a prostitute

01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:10.560
in a motel Dan Carlin was my prostitute in the motel.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.860
I invite him to a motel.

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:13.660
I don't even remember in the middle of nowhere.

01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:17.660
He shows up with that voice and the rest the rest is history

01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:18.660
so good things.

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:20.460
They will never know what happened to you.

01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:21.560
Oh boy.

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:22.760
Did he like I'm just kidding.

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.460
I'm really running with it.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:26.360
Yes, we did.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.160
We got along really.

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:30.460
I mean, he's an incredibly kind and thoughtful person constantly

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:31.460
self-critical thinking.

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:32.360
He's not good enough.

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:37.760
He just works on those episodes for ever ever and he just

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.460
thinks that there's these just like with Goggins.

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:45.760
There's these other historians that I think like way on him

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:48.060
like they're going to judge him or something like this in his

01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:48.560
mind.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:51.860
I talked about I talked to it with them, but then you're

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:57.660
telling and I guess his thing is he I guess I guess his hang

01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:02.560
up is Carlin's is he's not a he's not like this like he

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.060
doesn't feel like he's a real historian.

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:05.360
Yeah, but he is.

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.260
Yeah, I mean he's just the way he shares the story.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.660
Look we had a history teacher in seventh grade who was a

01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:14.160
con artist and he came and taught her seventh grade and

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.860
it was told con artist all he taught us about was

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:19.660
barnstorming barnstorming and the JFK assassination.

01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:23.560
I walked away having such an appreciation for barnstorming

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:27.360
a very small blip on Americana, but I know a lot about

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.560
barnstorming because of this guy and he because he was

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:30.860
passionate about barnstorming.

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.760
It was a fun to say seventh grade history class.

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.860
I've ever taken my entire life.

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:36.960
You mentioned tour bus.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.460
What's the best road trip you've been on?

01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:42.560
Have you have you driven across the country just you know,

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:49.860
We had one road trip in college where a bar had burned

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:53.360
down and we found out that the alcohol was still in the

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:53.760
bar.

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:58.360
Yeah, so we took my Jetta over to the bar and we emptied

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.460
out the bar of all the burnt up liquor.

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:01.660
We didn't know what anything was.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.560
We threw it into the trunk with no clothes like no no

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.960
clothes and we said let's just start driving.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:13.160
And we drove from Tallahassee and ended up in West

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:16.860
Virginia and just just drove just drove.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.160
It was like five dudes.

01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:19.860
We drank one person drove.

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:24.960
I wasn't a big drinker in college until I went to Russia

01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:27.660
and so I drove the majority of the way and then we get

01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:32.760
somewhere and and we get a hotel room and it was one of

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:37.260
the most epic fucking weekends of just debauchery and

01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:43.660
chaos and I think we took mushrooms and we went down

01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.060
a river in tubes.

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:47.460
So it's most about the bond between the five people

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:51.460
versus like throwing yourself into meeting like strangers

01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:52.460
and this kind of stuff.

01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:54.560
Yeah, and it was when it was when I was like I was trying

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.760
to be a poet at that time.

01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:57.660
And so like we were actual poetry.

01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.560
Yeah, it's really bad part of my life.

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.560
We were like is like music is there to somewhere.

01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:04.260
Yeah, I tried to be in a band too.

01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:06.660
That didn't work out the way I wanted it to I just was

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:09.660
never I always was I was never the I'm not a good serious

01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:11.860
person like I'm a good funny person.

01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:14.460
I'm good to be the fool, but I'm not good when I try to

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:15.160
be serious.

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:16.260
It looks foolish.

01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:20.560
And so even like, you know, someone said showed me throwing

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:23.260
out the first pitch the other day as something and all I

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:24.760
could see is my gut flying everywhere.

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.360
And I was like, that's why it went viral.

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:27.560
I was like fuck.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:28.960
I thought it was my throwing style.

01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:30.660
That was a pretty epic one.

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:33.960
The best road trips I ever took was during the pandemic during

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:37.460
the pandemic when we were when when we would we're doing

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:38.960
that drive-in movie theater tour.

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:42.060
I created a drive-in movie theater tour when no one was

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:48.060
working and the very first one we all no one had left our

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:48.560
houses.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.460
We all went to my house.

01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:50.560
We got my tour bus.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.360
We had just wrapped the day the tour bus showed up.

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:57.460
We just wrapped the cabin just wrapped doing the cabin on

01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:00.460
Netflix and we got COVID tested.

01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:02.860
We got in the tour bus and we said let's create our bubble

01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:03.660
and stay safe.

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:10.560
And that night we drove I think just outside Gallup and we

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:16.860
stayed in a no one had been outside and we stayed at a koa

01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:20.260
camp on arrival and we watched thunderstorms come in on a

01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:24.360
lake and we were all smoking cigars and drinking IPAs and

01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:29.060
and it was fucking Matt and that whole road trip we road

01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:32.360
tripped across the country to start the tours and then we

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.660
just and we were outside for the first time when we were

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:37.360
and it was that period of my life.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.260
I'm so grateful.

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.260
I didn't make a ton of money.

01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:41.960
So we had a big crew and I've made sure I was trying to

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:44.460
make sure everyone because no one had paid bills in a while

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:48.860
but that fucking tour was the funnest.

01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:50.060
We took up pickleball.

01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:51.960
We took up disc golf.

01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:54.460
Everything was wide open in the middle of the country.

01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:56.860
You could do things, but we were still in our bubble and

01:16:56.860 --> 01:17:00.160
we lived in that tour bus and at night we just get back in

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:05.060
the tour bus by ourselves and get fucking wasted and and

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:07.360
I mean that fucking run.

01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:09.060
It'll nothing will ever be like that.

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:12.160
Yeah, because you like rediscovered the humanity of

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.160
the camaraderie because the pandemic kind of killed that

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:18.060
really suffocated us from like the basic connection.

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.660
Yeah, and it and there was this.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:24.960
You always had an anxiety attack halfway through that

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.460
you got coven this one, you know, cover was killing people

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:30.060
and you were like, I know I've got covid and then and

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:34.260
then we come in to Sedona is also why I didn't make a

01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:34.660
ton of money.

01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:37.260
We'd come in to Sedona and we get a house in Sedona for

01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:40.960
five days at Airbnb and we'd all isolate there before

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.060
we went home to our families.

01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:42.760
Yeah.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.760
I remember I remember the first time we did it.

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.460
We didn't isolate.

01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:48.760
We just pulled back into LA and all our families were freaked

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.060
out.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:52.760
So I had to stay live on the tour bus in at a different

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.960
house and it was 4th of July and I came in and they were

01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.360
doing an egg toss and they're like, well you can do an egg

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.960
toss and this is how bad my anxiety gets you can do an

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:02.960
egg toss with your daughter Isla.

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:06.260
So I and I did an egg toss and we fucking got it to like

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:11.360
legit like 40 fucking feet where I was doing overhand

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:15.160
lobbing them to her and the egg cracked in her hands and

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.360
it broke over her face and I got in bed that night high

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:21.360
on weed fucking drunk and I went what if I gave my daughter

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.060
covid from an egg toss?

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:26.560
I go that would be the most horrific way to kill a child.

01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:28.160
She got from an egg toss.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.960
It broke in her face or dad did covid.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:34.060
Yeah, I mean that's the scariest thing about covid.

01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:39.260
I think is not you dying but because of you somebody else

01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:39.860
dies.

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:42.860
Oh my god, that's that's that's that's the fear.

01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:45.960
I think that really like took hold on people.

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:49.260
That's why they're they were way more cautious than perhaps

01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:52.160
they needed to be just like I don't want to be the guy that's

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.360
responsible for killing somebody I love or somebody that

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:56.860
somebody else loves.

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.760
Leanne gave everyone in our family covid.

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.760
She came up to me and she gave me a hug.

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:04.060
Yeah after Christmas.

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:07.660
And gives me a hug.

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:08.360

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.460
She was I think I have covid I go bitch six feet.

01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:23.060
okay, what we still go to Park City.

01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:26.460
So we all go to Park City then Georgia gets covid and then

01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:28.760
Georgia starts crying and she goes, I think I gave you covid

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:29.460
and I was like, I'm fine.

01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:31.560
She goes, you're at high risk and I'm like what she's like

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:32.760
you're a fat alcoholic.

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:33.660
I'm like, whoa easy.

01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:36.260
Where the fuck what about feelings and then Georgia got

01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:39.560

01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:42.360
My tour bus came up pick George up George and Leanne took

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.760

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.160
and then we get on the plane and I cough and Isla's got

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.660
her mask on and I was just looks at me.

01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:53.960
You know the best the one thing we miss are the eyes over

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:54.460
masks.

01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:58.160
Yeah, the the and then we get home and I had covid and I

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:01.460
was like if you gave me fucking covid and then she never

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:02.060
got covid.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.060
She never got covid.

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:06.260
You mentioned IPAs.

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:11.760
What's the lay of the land of great beers in in this expansive

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:12.560
world of ours?

01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:13.660
I like pilsners.

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:14.560
I'm a pilsner guy.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:17.560
I'm an ice-cold beer guy ice-cold pilsner.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.260
I like an ice-cold beer.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:23.460
I like an ice-cold one of the best beer buzzes I ever had

01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:28.260
is we had bought a new house, but we weren't building it

01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:29.360
and I and over covid.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:32.460
I didn't drink for like three months four months until we

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:35.660
decided to go back out on tour and we figured that out and

01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:38.760
I was in the backyard Leanne came back with like two tall

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:41.560
boy German pilsners and cracked him.

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.760
She goes have a beer and I was like fuck.

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:48.460
Yeah, and man that second that beer buzz is different than

01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:49.060
anything.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:53.360
The second it it touches you you feel the sparkle and you're

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.460
just like yeah, baby.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:58.360
I'm back and then she's like you want another one.

01:20:58.360 --> 01:20:59.160
I'm like fuck.

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:02.560
Yeah, and then we have another one and then and that beer

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:07.160
buzz is especially afternoon beer buzz is just so pretty.

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:09.560
It's different than a night beer buzz night beer buzz is

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.860
like I guess we'll have a beer and then I'm a couple I

01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:12.560
gotta go to work tomorrow.

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:17.860
All right, but that afternoon irresponsible beer buzz Pilsner

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:18.360
Pilsner.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.460
There's I don't mind an IPA but it's got to be added.

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.160
It's got to I got to be at somewhere.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:24.460
I got to be at somewhere.

01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:26.860
I got to have an IP like I like a local IPA.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:30.460
It's got to be food involved and then I'm enjoying an IPA.

01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:36.860
I threw up an IPA in a bathtub in Salt Lake City one time.

01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:37.960
It was bad.

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:38.560
What do you mean?

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:39.560
Oh, you throw up in the bathtub.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:39.960
Okay.

01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:40.760
No, no, no.

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:43.660
I was drinking in the bathtub like bath up with some water

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:44.160
in there.

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.160
No, no, no, no, no.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.060
You're sitting in the bathtub.

01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:47.760
No, I'm getting ready to take a shower.

01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:51.160
I had a growler of IPA about six in the morning.

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:54.460
I have to fly that day to Vegas to jump off the stratosphere.

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:57.760
Yeah, all I need is a little bit of a buzz to get myself

01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:58.760
on this fucking plane.

01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:01.560
I have anxiety going through my fucking head because I'm

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.560
jumping to be the first person to jump off stratosphere.

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:07.560
And so I'm drinking an IPA out of a growler in a bathtub

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:11.960
at six in the morning and it just didn't sit right and I

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:15.760
threw it up and I was off IPAs for like 10 fucking years.

01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:19.860
I didn't have another IPA until I was like 46 because I

01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:23.160
was like all I could think about was throwing up that IPA

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:27.360
in a bathtub in a shower and being like I'm gonna throw

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.160
up thinking about it.

01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:30.760
But yeah, I don't I didn't fuck with IPAs for a while and

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:31.960
then during the pandemic I got it.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.260
I got back into IPAs.

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:36.760
I was that way with Jack and Coke Jack Daniels and Coke

01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:42.160
really got so drunk many many years ago that just couldn't

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:42.660
look at it.

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.460
I can't touch I can't touch.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:49.460
What's Janice Joplin's drink Southern Comfort?

01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:50.560
I can't touch Southern Comfort.

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:51.660
She just drank it straight.

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:54.260
Well, Southern Comfort is that 40% that's hard.

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:55.960
No, it's almost like a liqueur.

01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.460
Honestly, it's really sweet.

01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:00.960
Yeah, Jack Jack double Jack on the rocks lots of rocks.

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:03.660
Yeah, I mean I had a quote that I got a video that went

01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:05.760
viral about I'll never quit drinking.

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:09.960
Yeah, and I have not gotten on a plane since that without

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:12.060
having a flight attendant not even asked what I want.

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:14.760
Walk up with a double Jack on the rocks lots of rocks.

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:17.160
I mean it happens so on times.

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:17.960
I don't want to drink.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.860
Yeah, I flew to Austin the other day.

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:21.560
I was like, I'm not drinking on the plane.

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:22.560
What could I felt sick?

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:26.460
Yeah, and man he walked up and he goes double Jack on the

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:27.260
rocks lots of rocks.

01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:28.460
I was like, fuck, you know it.

01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:30.760
Yeah, but yeah, that's that's my drink.

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:33.860
Wait, what's your drink?

01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:35.360
I thought you'd be a vodka guy.

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:41.860
Well, vodka I associate with a lot of moments in my life

01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:45.560
of happiness because vodka is associated with shots and

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:50.760
camaraderie and there's Eastern Europe in general a bunch

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:55.160
of guys get together and you celebrate life intensely.

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:59.660
Yeah, people fight people just feel people experience

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:04.560
life in a deep way just get too drunk for like for a

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:08.960
reason but I don't see that as like drinking drinking.

01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:12.960
That's like a journey towards the destination.

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:17.660
It's like to me drinking is like whiskey neat or beer.

01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:18.860
Like you said ice cold beer.

01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:21.760
Yeah, there's that afternoon beer like for a person like

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:24.760
me who's extremely regimented and disciplined.

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:27.560
Sometimes you get the situation.

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.060
I just remember.

01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:32.560
I mean just I remember there's a bar at MIT where I just

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:33.460
remember in the afternoon.

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:34.760
It was like a business meeting.

01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:35.660
I sat down.

01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:38.860
We started with a beer and they're like really crisply

01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:43.360
cold some kind of lager and then just one beer and two

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.460
beers and all of a sudden you say fuck it.

01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:48.660
Let's just the rest of the day.

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:52.260
This is what this is and you said bright like you just

01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:55.460
life and nature is beautiful out there and you just

01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:57.460
said fuck it to all the meetings.

01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:58.860
Fuck it to everything else.

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:03.860
Just the camaraderie the just talking about life being

01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:06.760
silly being, you know all of that see that see you're

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:07.660
describing something.

01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:10.060
I'll never get because I'm not regimented.

01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:15.660
I would love I would love I would love only for the moment

01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:18.460
that you get to have you get the most precious little

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:22.060
angels breath that anyone's going to get because you live

01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:24.860
this life that's dialed in and it's scheduled.

01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:28.760
And so when you say fuck it, it's like that's like me

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:29.360
doing coke.

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:32.860
Like it's like oh fuck it like and you can just do that

01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:33.460
with beer.

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:35.960
That is fucking amazing.

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:39.860
I would love to live a regimented life just to get

01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:40.960
the chance to go.

01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:44.360
Hey guys, I'm not performing surgery today.

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:45.460
Fuck it.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:49.260
Hey guys, this bus full of kids kids got it.

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.660
It's got to drive itself home.

01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:51.260
Fuck it.

01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:54.360
I couldn't even I couldn't even tell you, you know, so

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.760
interesting about me and you is that you know, I'm a

01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.460
fan of yours.

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:02.560
I couldn't even I don't really know what AI is like

01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:05.160
other than like dildos or AI, right?

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:09.860
Like like if I had some electronics in it, electronics

01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:13.460
is no, I don't think a dildo classifies as a robot because

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.260
I thought that's how they were going to take over fucking

01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:16.060
mankind.

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:19.660
Just they start with these the fucking womanizer that

01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:21.360
knows how to eat a pussy and then they're like, we don't

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:22.160
need men anymore.

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:25.260
But like it's so interesting that I couldn't even like I

01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:27.460
can barely tell you what my dad does for a living.

01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:28.060
He's a lawyer.

01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:30.360
I could kind of like he's called me and say, hey man,

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.860
you gotta stop talking about what I do because you're

01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:32.660
not doing it right.

01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:33.960
I go, what do you mean?

01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:34.660
He's like, that's not you.

01:26:34.660 --> 01:26:35.460
Whatever you're saying I do.

01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:40.460
I don't do and so but like I couldn't even begin to

01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:42.160
explain your job to my daughter.

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:46.260
Well, I think there's the way you do the job, which is

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:47.860
the way you experience life.

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:51.560
The regimented just even just a nine to five job, right?

01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:52.860
You have to do work nine to five.

01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:55.560
No, but I work much more than that.

01:26:55.860 --> 01:27:00.760
But there's no every kind of lifestyle has its complexities.

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:03.160
I think nine to five means you have to wake up at a

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.460
certain time every day.

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.960
Do people tell you to pull it back and then I can't

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:07.860
you're working too hard.

01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:10.860
Yeah, a lot of people what I want in my life, what I

01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:13.160
love in my life, especially people close to me are the

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:16.360
ones that say work harder because everybody how do

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:16.960
you get them?

01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:18.060
How do you get them?

01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:19.660
I don't have anyone in my life that does that.

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:21.560
Everybody's always worried about me.

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:23.560
Everyone's worried about me.

01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:25.260
Everyone's always worried about me.

01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:28.160
The only thing no one ever says if I showed you my

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.160
DMS right now on my my text all it is is like hey man,

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:31.960
I'm worried about you.

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:34.660
Like Joe, I love Joe to death.

01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:38.560
Not once has he he always I don't know if you've seen

01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:41.460
the caring Joe eyes where like I'm worried about you

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:42.260
where it's like

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:46.960
and you're like man don't do that.

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:49.060
He's like I'm worried about you and you're like don't

01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:49.960
fucking worry about me.

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:50.560
I'm working.

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:51.660
It's I'm just working.

01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:52.760
I love working.

01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:53.860
I love what I do.

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:55.460
I love what I do.

01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:58.160
I can only imagine that you love what you do as much

01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.260
as I love what I do because that's all I ever want

01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:00.660
to think about.

01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:01.760
It's all I ever want to talk about.

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:06.360
It's all I ever want to be like I I when my wife wants

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:10.760
me to take August and whatever the August whatever

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:14.060
the fucking other number that's no but like July

01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:18.360
and August off after we do fully loaded and I was

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:21.160
like no I was like what do you mean like so like

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.360
well, I'll just what am I like sit in a chair and

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:23.760
stuff.

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:25.860
She said no, you can do like take up a hobby.

01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:27.460
I go writing jokes.

01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:28.860
Can I get on stage?

01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:30.160
Can I do sets in the city?

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:32.360
Because I'm not going to fucking do you want me to

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.260
like like I don't understand what I don't understand

01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:36.060
people who don't I don't understand people don't

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.460
have the drive to work all the time.

01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:40.360
I don't understand that I envy it.

01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:42.960
I envy it because I go I would love to just be

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:44.660
like I'm going to play video games.

01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:45.760
I can't play a video game.

01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:49.060
If I did I'll be on Twitch trying to make money like

01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:51.560
I love how do you find someone who goes you need

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:52.360
to work harder?

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.660
Yeah, especially when they see like I I don't know

01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:58.560
what you look like but I I look tormented when I'm

01:28:58.560 --> 01:28:59.560
working very hard.

01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:04.360
Like it means like it's easy to worry for my well-being.

01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:07.260
It's not like I'm happy go lucky, but I'm happy

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:08.160
underneath it.

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:12.560
My working too hard is like on a plane every other

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:16.760
day or every day getting up at 6 working out and

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.960
then going into like 2 in the morning or 1 in the

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:21.760
morning and then going to sleep and then getting

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:24.360
up at 6 working out getting on a plane going to

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:25.260
another place.

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.960
Like that's what my working is just a lot of travel

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:28.560
in mind.

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.360
If I didn't drink on planes, I don't think anyone

01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:31.560
will probably worry about me at all.

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.160
They'd be like no you're doing great, but the

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.160
working out is there.

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:36.360
So I got to ask you because you and I seem to have

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:37.960
a similar relationship with the running.

01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:40.760
I like this idea of slow treadmill.

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:42.060
I like running slow.

01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:46.060
Yeah, you know like a 10-minute mile or something

01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:46.460
like this.

01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:48.260
So I'll just run forever.

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.860
Just listen to an audiobook listen to brown noise

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.060
think I love it.

01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:54.260
What's brown noise?

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:57.960
It's actually Brownian noise, but short brown

01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:58.160
noise.

01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.660
It's kind of like white noise, but deeper.

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:03.560
So it's just noise like that.

01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:04.160
Wow.

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:05.760
It's kind of sounds like a waterfall.

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.860
I'll just listen to it and something happens to

01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:08.060
me.

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:10.260
I think there's you can ask Kuberman about this.

01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:12.360
I don't but apparently there's some science.

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.160
It kind of focuses the mind and so on.

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:18.260
It's funny because I think sometimes when people

01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:21.260
don't get about running is they go they get on

01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:23.460
and they put it on like a 6 right away on like a

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.660
treadmill and they go I can't do this for fucking

01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:28.760
30 minutes, but you can if you build yourself up

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:31.060
to your six and you play games.

01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:32.760
I play games with myself a lot like I'll play

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:36.660
games where I go and I can do this.

01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:37.260
I can do this.

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.460
I can do this almost not all day long, but I can

01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:40.560
do this a lot longer.

01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:43.660
Like I did it for two hours the other day before

01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:46.060
my workout or no hour and a half before my workout

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:51.660
where I started a 3.5 walking and then I and

01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:53.660
then I get my jog up to like a 5 and then I'm

01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:56.460
like 5.5 then I go 6 and then I go and once I'm

01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:58.360
at a 6 my body's really loose.

01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:00.160
And so then I'll go all right bring it down to

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:02.760
a 3.5 and then I go punch it to a 7.5 for a

01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:05.560
quarter of a mile and then let's walk at a 4.

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:08.460
Let's jog at a 5 right that I can do that.

01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.760
I love they're called fartlets.

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.760
I think and I love those like where they it's

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:17.560
like it's regimented running and sprinting at

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:18.560
certain levels.

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:22.260
I love that and I love also when I work out to

01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:24.260
listen to music but put on foreign language

01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:25.760
cooking shows on Netflix.

01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:28.860
Can you explain that they just put it on mute.

01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:30.260
You don't need to hear it for some reason.

01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:31.660
They're sexier the way they're shot.

01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:32.360
They're sexier.

01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:35.360
Yeah, and it's like street food Asia and they're

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.260
just watching them make street food in Asia.

01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:38.360
There's one called broth.

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:41.060
It's called broth the nation of broth and they're

01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:43.460
just making broths and you're like fuck.

01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:44.260
I want some broth.

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:45.560
So this is South America.

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:46.860
This is Asia South America.

01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:47.560
Asia.

01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:50.260
They do one on pizzas.

01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:53.060
I've watched this one on pizzas that I've watched

01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:53.460
it.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:54.960
There's like four episodes.

01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:57.060
I've watched every episode so many times that my

01:31:57.060 --> 01:31:58.760
trainer goes God.

01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:00.460
That's that fucking I would I could watch that

01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:00.860
again.

01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:04.360
Yeah, I love watching foreign language cooking

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:07.160
shows on mute when I work out while blasting

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:07.660
music.

01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:11.860
All right.

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:14.560
Well, I usually run outside but I do I can't think

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:16.760
I don't mind hiking and I like I do.

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:18.760
Like, you know what my fun thing the fun thing I

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:21.660
would do and this is a this is ripped off totally

01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:24.360
from campaigns is I like to go.

01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:28.260
There's a great hike called Freiman Canyon out in

01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:30.860
the valley where I live and I'd be like, all right,

01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:32.460
I'm going to run to frame Freiman Canyon.

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:33.660
I'm going to jog to Freiman Canyon.

01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:35.260
I'm going to hike Freiman Canyon and then I'm

01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:36.060
going to jog back.

01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:39.660
And I wonder how long that is.

01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:41.160
I go don't think about it.

01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:42.460
Just know that that's your thing.

01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:44.560
Just know that that's your thing and then all

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:45.260
sudden you're like shit.

01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:48.060
That was eight miles like that's a fucking beast.

01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:50.560
The hike doesn't even feel like anything the hike

01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:52.960
once you do the jogs the hard part there the jog

01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:55.860
home is a fucking cakewalk.

01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:58.360
I had the best job when I was in Serbia.

01:32:58.760 --> 01:32:59.860
I had the best job.

01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:01.360
I think was in Hyde Park.

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:02.960
I think the name of the parks Hyde Park.

01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:06.860
It was get this it was 80% downhill.

01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:07.860
Wow.

01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:11.160
So this jog you started the park and it was like

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:12.360
and I'll do it like this for you.

01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:15.960
You went like downhill like this downhill like

01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:19.060
this downhill like this and then it was like a

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.760
little steep incline to get to the beginning of

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:22.060
it.

01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:25.360
So it was like a little like nice like lower back

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:25.760
pain.

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:26.360
You're like, okay.

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:26.760
Okay.

01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:29.460
And then the jog was perfect and you did it four

01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:29.660
times.

01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:30.460
It was four miles.

01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:31.260
I loved it.

01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:34.060
My very first day I did it a butterfly got in

01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:34.660
front of me.

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:37.660
It's like six in the morning six in the morning

01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:40.060
a butterfly got in front of me and it ran the

01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:42.060
whole first mile in front of me and I just was

01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:44.260
like so surreal it would disappear and then it

01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:45.460
would show back up in front of me.

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:48.160
You sure was real definitely real and then the

01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:50.560
next day and so I go I'm on the right path.

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:51.460
I'm on the right path.

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:53.860
The next day I go for a jog six in the morning

01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:56.860
and it rained and as I'm doing the steep uphill

01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:59.660
incline a tree collapsed in front of me just

01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:03.560
went and I went whoa a tree fell in the woods

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.560
and I was here to see it.

01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:05.860
Shut the fuck up.

01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:07.860
I was like that's crazy and it didn't hit me.

01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:09.960
I'm on the right path and then I started getting

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:11.260
overthinking it like the next day.

01:34:11.260 --> 01:34:12.560
I saw a condom and I was like this is a good

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:14.660
place to go I was like people fucked here last

01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:16.860
night, but but yeah, that was one of the best

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:17.560
jogs I've ever had.

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:17.860
I could do that.

01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:19.560
I could run that park every single day and no

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:20.960
one jogged that park in Serbia.

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:25.060
I actually recently had a condom on my doorstep

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:29.660
and I wanted to ask whoever is up there above

01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:34.860
what what that means what the you know what the

01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:36.060
story behind that is.

01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:39.860
Yeah, they you know just a pissed off UPS guy.

01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:43.460
I was it compromised what do you mean compromised

01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:44.860
like was there stuff inside it?

01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:47.460
Oh, I didn't look I mean very few people put on

01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:48.660
the condom and go it's not for me.

01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:49.460
I'm going to take it off.

01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:50.560
Yeah, it's a little tight.

01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:53.260
It could be to send a message like a horse's head

01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:53.760
kind of thing.

01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:55.060
Oh, yeah, I don't know.

01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:56.660
I don't know what the message is exactly.

01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:57.460
Do you use condoms?

01:34:57.460 --> 01:34:59.260
If you had one next time would you use a condom?

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.660
I don't know what a condom is.

01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:04.460
I never heard call I'm learning good call.

01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:04.860
I'm learning.

01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:06.660
I've learned about sex from you today.

01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:09.460
If my wife dies, there's no condoms in my future.

01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:09.960
I'll get it.

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:10.960
I don't care how babies.

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:11.760
I don't give a shit.

01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:14.460
Your man of principle.

01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:15.160
I like it.

01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:19.560
Mark Marin wrote something about your book many many many

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.060
ages ago life of the party.

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.760
I think is there's an interesting question in there.

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:26.360
So first of all wrote eloquently about you.

01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:32.160
Burt Kreischer is one of the great American wild men a

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:34.960
gonzo warrior driven not by cynicism or desire to

01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:37.960
reveal a dark truth but instead by a deep almost

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:41.360
essential need to have a good time no matter what his

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:44.460
stories track the trials and tribulations of a big-hearted

01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:48.160
dude trying to fit in help out and party and find himself

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:51.460
after all is said and done we arrive with him at the

01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:52.860
true humility of joy.

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:58.060
So when was this desire for pure joy born in you?

01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:03.260
It seems like you are driven towards this joy.

01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:13.260
Yeah, I think I think I arrived at it in college.

01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:14.560
I wasn't always the guy I am.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:16.560
I was really a serious pretty serious dude.

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:19.160
Like when I got to college like dark brooding serious.

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:21.560
Yeah, I wanted to be like I want to be like Eddie Vedder

01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:25.160
and to be like a poet and a fucking lead singer and I

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.360
wanted to be taken seriously and I wanted to be attractive

01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:31.660
and I wanted to be you know, like I wanted to be wanted

01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:36.660
by chicks and and respected by dudes and you know and

01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:40.960
slowly but surely I think the bird I really am chipped

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:45.160
away at that and was like hey man, like I would say funny

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:47.160
I would say funny things that would surprise me.

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:49.860
They were so funny meaning like in my fraternity.

01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:53.560
I'd say things that were the funniest thing that I go.

01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:58.060
How did I think of that and then slowly I was like and

01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:01.360
I remember as that as I chipped away at that and as I

01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:08.260
got older I would I would I would lean towards that.

01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:11.460
We would go on a bus trip to like Clemson and I would get

01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:15.460
on the the walkie-talkie on the bus and I would do stand

01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:16.460
up for like an hour.

01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:22.060
I just make jokes for an hour and I loved the impulse of

01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:23.460
like, you know, you get on the bus and everyone's like

01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:25.060
we're going to drink and you get that one group of girls

01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:27.760
that wasn't going to drink and then to break them and

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:28.960
like a fuck it fine.

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:33.060
Let's drink and then that to to watch that happen.

01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:36.160
And I think then once I and then when I went to Russia,

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:40.060
this is so cliche for me to say but interacting with

01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:45.160
those young banditi they were they were pretty serious

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:45.560
dudes.

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:49.960
They didn't have like they were pretty stoic dudes and

01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:52.560
when you could make them laugh, it was like a real it

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:55.160
was a real joy the silliest things.

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:58.560
I remember, you know, we were told there was a club

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:02.660
that's called it was called Cafe Europa or maybe Cafe

01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:03.360
Americana.

01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:05.560
There's where everyone really hung out like all the

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:07.160
real dudes the real dudes.

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:12.960
In St. Petersburg and they had told us that like they

01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:16.460
told us in our class that Russian women didn't have

01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:17.160
tampons.

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:21.260
So they were like bring tampons to give to the Babushka

01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:24.860
the the Dabushka that ran the floor after all this

01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:27.960
time the fact that your Russian sucks is awesome.

01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:30.760
Yeah, it's you keep mispronouncing words horribly.

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:33.160
I horribly I'm so fucking bad.

01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:34.460
I am so bad.

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.860
You know, that's how you know, that's how I got the

01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:36.960
name of the machine, right?

01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:38.660
Yeah, I was trying to say I'm a sheena.

01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:40.160
Yeah, and I said I'm a car.

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:41.960
Yeah, and they just were like, huh?

01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:46.260
And so I came into the room one night with a top

01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:47.760
pocketful of tampons.

01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:49.760
And they were like, what are those for?

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:52.560
I said girls how we gonna pick up girls and the look

01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:56.960
on their face was so it was so pure joy.

01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:59.060
I remember the first night I pulled out lemons and

01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:02.060
this is it sounds it sounds make-believe now to say

01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:04.160
it because it's been in the movie and I brought out

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:04.560
lemons.

01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:05.460
We were in lemon drops.

01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:08.860
I vodka and lemons and sugar and a pocket knife and

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:12.660
a fanny pack and I put out lemons and and this guy

01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:16.060
Igor goes, oh the machine runs on lemons like it was

01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:18.360
just so foreign that you would need lemon for them.

01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:21.560
And so I think and I made friends with those guys

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:24.260
like I'm like friends whatever you can but like

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:26.960
definitely me and that guy Igor were legit friends

01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:30.860
legit friends like but from a place of joy like

01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:33.560
yeah, it was like it was like real seeing them light

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.460
up and then I remember backpacking through Europe

01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:39.160
after that and realizing I could bring a spark of

01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:42.760
fun to like a campfire and I had little tricks like

01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:44.960
I learned all the currencies around the world.

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:48.160
And so I I challenged people to a currency game.

01:39:48.260 --> 01:39:51.460
I go let's go head-to-head you say you

01:39:51.460 --> 01:39:53.160
you name a country in the currency and I'll name a

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:56.060
country in a currency and I would I would slow roll

01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:56.260
them.

01:39:56.260 --> 01:39:58.860
I just do all the dollars right the Chinese dollar

01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:00.460
the American dollar the Australian dollar I run

01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:02.060
through all the dollars and they'd be like you only

01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:03.860
know the dollars and then and then I get start

01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:04.760
getting really deep.

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:09.660
I could make an event out of a night in in Europe.

01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:10.560
I could make an event.

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:14.860
I remember we were in Strasbourg and the bar was

01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:16.760
supposed to close but I had friends coming to the

01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:17.060
bar.

01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:23.160
The train hadn't gotten in yet and I said I said

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:24.060
don't close the bar.

01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:26.860
I'll stand on the bar and I'll entertain everyone

01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:27.260
in this room.

01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:27.760
I'll dance.

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:30.360
I'll do whatever if you just keep the bar open and

01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:32.360
the guy goes if you can keep me laughing.

01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:37.660
I'll keep the bar open and I danced and and made

01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:40.360
this guy laugh on a bar for legit.

01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:44.460
I'm not even like legit 30 minutes until my friends

01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:46.660
walked in and they're like what the fuck's going on?

01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:51.860
I had this ability to without humility.

01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:54.460
I had mine looking like a fool and like doing and

01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:56.660
there were really stupid jokes at the time.

01:40:56.660 --> 01:41:00.560
Just very like base American frat boy jokes, but

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.560
I had a spark and when I came back, I feel I feel

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:05.860
like I learned how to like to do that and do funny

01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:07.160
things that were like fun.

01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:10.060
Like I would we go to a football game and I'd I'd

01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:11.560
I brought a camera around with me a lot.

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:14.960
I like to take pictures and I remember one of the

01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:15.260
jokes.

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:17.760
I go hey everybody I told my parents.

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:18.560
I have a lot of friends.

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:20.460
Can you guys gather around and we'll take a picture?

01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:22.960
And so you're like 50 people would lean around

01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:27.060
like and like just the dumbest silliest things

01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:30.660
and and and and I know and I wasn't a big self

01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:31.060
promoter.

01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:32.860
So these would happen and I would just I was just

01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:34.660
doing them for me and my friends.

01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:39.060
I bring a guitar out and I just make up songs and

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:39.660
and

01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:45.960
and so I think in in watching this this serious

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:48.860
bird get chipped away at until my like six and a

01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:51.460
half year of college where it was just this silly

01:41:51.460 --> 01:41:54.660
guy and then Rolling Stones written about me and

01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:56.960
I'm like and then I'm like well and I remember a

01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:59.560
couple serious dads going you know, you got a chance

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:01.960
to turn this into something you need to go to need

01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:03.460
you need to follow your dream and I tried to stand

01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:06.760
up the first night and I was like maybe not wasn't

01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:08.960
the funniest guy but man they laughed and we had

01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:11.460
a good time for 30 minutes and it worked and it

01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:14.060
was stream of consciousness and I was like yeah

01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:16.060
and then of course, you know that same little path

01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:18.860
you take gets convoluted in in New York because

01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:20.260
you want to be a serious comic and you want to

01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:22.360
be taken seriously and you want to be edgy and

01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:24.260
you want to say the and then slowly but surely

and let them forget about their fucking day and

01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:01.560
the the interesting thing about alcohol that I

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:04.560
don't really like drinking in terms of the actual

01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:06.860
physical like how it makes me feel but there's

01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:08.860
the the camaraderie that happens.

01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:12.460
I wish there's another way to get there, but I

01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:15.060
don't think there is that joy you get of just

01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:17.460
everybody getting together to taking shots or

01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:19.760
drinking not the polite kind of drinking, but

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:22.760
just everybody just the the fuck it kind of

01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:23.260
drinking.

01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:23.860
Yeah.

01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:26.060
And when someone goes, all right, I'm in like

01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:26.460
that right.

01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:28.860
Yeah, that's the funnest and then especially

01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:30.760
when you have a big group and there's like a

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:32.660

I don't give a fuck.

01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.360
This is what life's about and that moment where

01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:57.160
they're like, yeah, that's the funnest fucking

01:43:57.760 --> 01:43:59.560

01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:04.860

Look at the fucking trees here the wind going

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:34.360
backyard.

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:35.760
That's where the cigar comes out a little more

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:36.460
privacy.

But yeah, red wine red wine mall back keep our

01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:41.460

Yeah, wine is a whole nother one too.

01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:47.160

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:11.560
I was going to start writing poetry to the

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:12.360

01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:16.060
There's a like a glass of wine in Italy and

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:24.060
most beautiful fucking day of my life.

01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.360
Just outside Florence.

01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:30.260
They have all the vineyards and stuff and we

01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:31.460
took a Vespa tour.

01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:37.260
And and it was fucking and Isla's too young to

01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:37.660
ride.

01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:40.160
So she's on the back and now everyone can drink

01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:42.360
there, you know, you're not supposed to drink

01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:44.460
and drive Vespas, but they don't they got a

01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:45.760
glass of wine is nothing.

01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:48.560
And you're like, okay, I guess I'll have a

01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:50.360
couple then if you think one's nothing then I

01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:51.460
think two's nothing also.

01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:54.160
This is drunk Burt on a Vespa drunk not even

01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:58.060
drunk, but just lightly lightly feathered.

01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:01.260
Yeah, where and it's beautiful.

01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:02.860
My wife hasn't been drinking.

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.960
Georgia has George's too young Isla is too

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:07.660
young, but I had at dinner.

01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:09.860
We had a couple and we're going through these

01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:13.260
hills and it starts raining and it starts

01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:16.160
raining and I go Isla.

01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:16.860
What are we missing?

01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:19.360
And she goes music big boy and I go, what do

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:19.860
you want to hear?

01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:23.060
And then she just starts going ooka-shaka ooka

01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:27.460
ooka ooka-shaka ooka ooka I can't stop this

01:46:27.460 --> 01:46:30.460
feeling she's screaming it behind and then I

01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:33.060
hear Georgia screaming it and then Leanne

01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:34.960
singing it and then Sandy and her two daughters

01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:35.560
are singing it.

01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:38.160
We're all in these Vespas and we're all singing

01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:41.460
it and and I and I swear to God if I hadn't

01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:42.760
been lightly feathered.

01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:44.760
I don't know if I would have been like Isla

01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:45.460
what are we missing?

01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:47.360
Because you know alcohol will give you that

01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:48.460
thing like what's next?

01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:49.360
What's bigger?

01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:51.060
How do we take this to the next level?

01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:53.760
And then I got this little girl who's still my

01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:55.760
little girl at that moment when she's singing

01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:59.060
sing it all the good times.

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:01.260
Give me not so long.

01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:02.160
Yeah, give it up girl.

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:03.560
And then we stop at the and we stop at the

01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:05.760
light and all of us are looking and it's pouring

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:06.160
rain.

01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:15.160
It is I mean, I remember sobbing crying sobbing

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:16.860
crying sobbing crying.

01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:18.660
And then I was like, let's get these fucking

01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:20.960
Vespas up and get to a vineyard and then we

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:23.560
went to a vineyard and all the girls tried a

01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:23.960
little wine.

01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:26.060
No one got buzzed or anything, but you're just

01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:28.960
sitting there with your family going like fuck

01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:32.060
dude it and I'm not certain you get that without

01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:34.860
a little bit of a little bit but then a lot is

01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:35.560
also interesting.

01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:39.560
It had a lot of whiskey with Rogan once I think

01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:40.160
I saw that.

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:42.560
Yeah, I think I saw that with Whitney to you

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:45.060
with a push-up concert contest you with David

01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:47.160
God is the only time I met David Goggins in

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.260
person one of the great embarrassments of my

01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:52.960
life is trashed out of my mind.

01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:55.660
I'm trying to say how much of a fan I am and I

01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:57.560
could tell by the look in his eye that what

01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:00.060
is actually coming out of my mouth is not good.

01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:03.060
It's not good and his wife is embarrassed

01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:03.860
standing right there.

01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:06.860
Also just everybody's embarrassed for me and

01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:08.960
I'm trying my best and then somehow I find

01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:11.860
myself a minute later doing push-ups with him

01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:12.960
as a challenge.

01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:15.860
I didn't it wasn't counting all I knew I'm not

01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:20.160
stopping and he was polite enough to stop.

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:21.360
I think probably like 50.

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:21.860
I don't know.

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:24.760
There's a gift someone gives you when they get

01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:26.860
drunk and they allow you to they get drunk and

01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:29.160
they lower their guard and they allow you to see

01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:29.660
them that way.

01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:30.360
It's a gift.

01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:31.260
It's a real gift.

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.560
It's just as cool as like pulling some aside

01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:36.660
and going yo, I'm into anime like are you cool

01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:37.060
with that?

01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:39.760
And then they're going yeah, yeah, can I show

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:40.860
you some cool anime?

01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:42.160
And then you're like, that's not my thing.

01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:43.560
But it's like a cool thing.

01:48:43.660 --> 01:48:45.460
It's like sharing cool music with someone or

01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:47.360
like telling them something about your childhood

01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:49.660
when you when you get drunk like real drunk

01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:52.660
around someone you're giving them a gift and

01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:54.960
that gift is I want you to see me for everything.

01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:57.160
I am you're not going to get any lies.

01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:59.060
You're not going to get any bullshit.

01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:01.060
This is me at my absolute worst.

01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:02.060
I have a rule.

01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:05.560
I will never never get mad at someone for getting

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:08.360
too fucked up because they're giving you a gift.

01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:11.360
They're saying like yo, I did this on accident,

01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:13.960
but I trust you enough to let you know that this

01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:16.260
is who I am and this is what you're getting.

01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:17.160
I love it.

01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:17.860
I love it.

01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:19.560
Especially when it comes to someone you don't

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:22.660
expect like you shut the fuck up.

01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:24.660
David Gawkins should have hugged you and said

01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:26.160
thanks for showing me this.

01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:29.460
Yeah, I guess that really haven't you're right.

01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:30.060
I haven't thought of it.

01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:32.860
That was there's an intimacy to that is that it

01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:34.360
is a gift of like fragility.

01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:35.360
Like this is me.

01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:38.460
I mean, I'm a very loving drunk, but I'm boy.

01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:39.560
Am I a dumb drunk?

01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:42.360
I'm just I bet you I bet you haven't seen dumb

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:46.460
drunk well dumb in terms of the eloquence of the

01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:48.060
words that are coming out of my mouth.

01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:51.660
So like you're just not stitching words together

01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:53.060
correctly to make sentences.

01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:56.960
No, I turn into Hemingway Lawson translation.

01:49:56.960 --> 01:50:00.160
Like I'll start saying random words, but like

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.760
translated to Japanese and back to English.

01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:05.660
It's not making sense, but there's love.

01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:08.760
Like I think what you feel is this kind of desire

01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:11.060
to connect that I think I always feel towards

01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:11.560
other people.

01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:13.460
But when I'm drunk, I'm just say fuck it.

01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:14.860
I don't need to be polite.

01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:16.760
I'll just be loving fully.

01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:21.060
Yeah, yeah, it's it's cool when people let you

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:23.160
see that in them because some people are really

01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:26.160
like measured like no one drink and then I'm

01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:26.460
done.

01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:26.860
I don't want it.

01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:27.560
No, no, no, no.

01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:29.460
And you're like, oh, show me a little more.

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:31.460
And then like it's cool.

01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:34.160
And I never get like I love my favorite moments

01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:36.060
in the next morning when they're like that make

01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:38.160
an ass out of myself and you get to say not at

01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:38.760
all.

01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:39.960
Yeah, not at all.

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:42.460
That's the coolest thing because some people bad

01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:44.460
people will leverage that over.

01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:46.660
Yeah, you can you see it's a bully tactic.

01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:48.460
They'll leverage that the bad interactions I've

01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:51.560
had with in this business that we were talking

01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:52.160
about earlier.

01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:56.260
There were people that that when you got fucked

01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:57.960
up, they used it against you.

01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:00.060
Yeah, they held it over your head and they said

01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:02.960
listen, man, I don't know what the fuck but if

01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:05.960
you want and you're like, hold on and then and

01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:09.360
then they made you they gaslight you into thinking

01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:11.060
you were the only one that was fucked up and

01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:13.360
you're like, okay, I guess I know who you are

01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:13.760
now.

01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:15.660
And I was like, didn't you get fucked up a little

01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:16.160
bit too?

01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:17.960
Yeah, like I know we smoked weed and I thought

01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:18.560
we ate Xanax.

01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:20.560
But like what about the I know I had a couple

01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:22.460
beers, but like I wasn't that fucked up.

01:51:23.060 --> 01:51:24.460
Well, Whitney is really good at that because

01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:27.260
she's the person I woke up next morning and she

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:30.360
just said, yeah, you're wonderful.

01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:31.160
You were eloquent.

01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:31.760
You were great.

01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:34.660
I am sure she was making that up completely.

01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:35.160
It was funny.

01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:37.260
I got blackout drunk at Whitney's roast of me

01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:38.060
like blackout drunk.

01:51:38.060 --> 01:51:40.560
Don't remember any of it and don't remember any

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:40.760
of it.

01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:43.060
Don't remember speaking on the microphone.

01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:45.860
I don't remember talking in the microphone and

01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:47.860
and I did the set apparently.

01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:48.260
Yeah.

01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:51.360
And I said to Whitney like in a real moment of

01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:53.160
vulnerability, Whitney's like a sister to me,

01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:54.260
like a legit sister.

01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:56.860
My daughter's call her Aunt Whitney Leanne.

01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:58.160
It's like a sister to Leanne.

01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:00.660
If she comes over to do a podcast, Whitney will

01:52:00.660 --> 01:52:02.860
show up an hour early and sit with Leanne out in

01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:06.760
Leanne's Rose Garden and just talk and Whitney.

01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:10.960
I I said the next day I call Whitney and I was

01:52:11.060 --> 01:52:12.060
getting on a plane.

01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:13.560
I was new.

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:14.160
I was hungover.

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:15.460
I said how bad was I last night?

01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:18.660
She was you were fucking fantastic and just didn't

01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:19.360
let me sit with it.

01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:20.360
And then I watched the video and I was like,

01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:21.460
oh, I was fucking out of control.

01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:22.660
I was way out of control.

01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:23.860
Thank you for lying to me.

01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:24.260
Yeah.

01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:27.360
So while being a wild out there comic, she's also

01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:29.760
this like caring and loving human being so

01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:30.360
interesting.

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:34.360
She is she has the most nurturing sensibility.

01:52:35.060 --> 01:52:36.460
She is you.

01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:39.360
She sends my daughter's gifts out of nowhere.

01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:40.060
Just out of nowhere.

01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:40.360
There's St.

01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:41.860
Georgia gifts up at college.

01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:45.060
It's just a gift box like she is just she takes

01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:45.560
care of people.

01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:46.760
That's her love language.

01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:49.660
And she's also the person that taught me what what

01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:51.560
the hell love language even means apparently

01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:53.160
there's a book and there's like five of them.

01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:54.360
You and Whitney.

01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:56.560
I would love to sit in the fucking room and watch

01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:57.360
you two talk.

01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:01.260
Yeah, she has a robot that looks like her and

01:53:02.460 --> 01:53:04.060
that's the future that robot.

01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:06.360
I told her she should have that robot do porn.

01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:10.960
Let someone fuck that robot and then and she

01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:13.160
gets you deep fake the face if she wants but I

01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:18.360
go promoted promoted special that way like a

01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:21.460
full-on not like Showtime soft core porn like

01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:26.360
full-on porn full-on like to do like hi welcome

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:29.160
inside you look tired.

01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:30.260
Do you need a drink?

01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:31.060
Yeah, oops.

01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:32.460
I'm stuck in the dryer.

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:34.460
You know, what's the promotion you're most

01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:35.560
proud of that you've done?

01:53:37.060 --> 01:53:37.860
Without a doubt.

01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:39.960
It's got to be when I took dance lessons.

01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:42.860
Yeah, that was epic because I tried to get Joe

01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:44.960
and Tom and Ari to do it for Sober October.

01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:47.360
I was rooting for you and they said no just

01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:48.260
like absolutely not.

01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:50.260
I knew Joe was going to say no, but Joe's a

01:53:50.260 --> 01:53:52.660
legit dancer like he can legit dance.

01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:55.060
He took like dance lessons for a movie and is

01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:58.260
apparently an amazing dancer and so you're

01:53:58.260 --> 01:53:58.660
right.

01:53:58.660 --> 01:53:59.660
He could have said yes.

01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:02.160
He could have said yes because I remember

01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:03.560
listening to that podcast where you really

01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:04.360
made the pitch.

01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:06.060
Yeah, and I said we all take hip-hop dance

01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:06.560
lessons.

01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:09.160
It's your cardio is through the roof and

01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:10.960
those you do an hour dance lesson, then we

01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:13.160
all do a hip-hop dance and then we all put

01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:14.660
our hip-hop dances against each other and

01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:16.060
we see who has the best hip-hop dance.

01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:18.660
It's different than the typical stuff we do.

01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:20.860
It's fun and we can also work out we can do

01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:22.660
everything but like let's do hip-hop dance

01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:25.860
and Joe adamantly was like that's a horrible

01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:26.060
idea.

01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:26.860
I will not do that.

01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:29.260
And then and then Tom and Ari just you know,

01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:31.060
just whatever they were like, yeah, I side

01:54:31.060 --> 01:54:31.460
with Joe.

01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:32.460
We'll do something else.

01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:35.060
And then I was like, I knew I liked hip-hop

01:54:35.060 --> 01:54:37.060
dance and so I was like, I'm gonna take hip-hop

01:54:37.060 --> 01:54:37.660
dance lessons.

01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:39.560
Anyway, I'm gonna just do it over Sober October

01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:41.660
and I'm just gonna I'm gonna fucking do it

01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:43.860
and then maybe maybe I'll do a hip-hop dance

01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:46.260
video and then show it to them and let them

01:54:46.260 --> 01:54:50.560
rate me and then we did it and I and it was

01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:53.360
$1,200 and I for hip-hop dance lessons for

01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:55.260
like a month or whatever for like a couple

01:54:55.260 --> 01:54:59.860
weeks and then when we did it, I thought, you

01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:01.560
know, I bet we could put tour dates next to

01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:04.060
this because it's it was it turned out being

01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:05.960
like kind of good but kind of funny.

01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:07.760
I got what we could put tour dates next to

01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:09.660
this and it was the beginning of me figuring

01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:12.560
out the whole like my promos were short and

01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:14.460
quick and they were always like something

01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:14.760
silly.

01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:15.360
What's up guys?

01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:18.060
It's your boy Burke Chrysler and then that

01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:21.060
one blew up and immediate I was announcing

01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:23.060
the tour and immediately every tour date

01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:26.160
sold out and then every we added shows that

01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:28.260
day we added shows and every one of those

01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:31.060
sold out and I was like, whoa, and then Tom

01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:34.860
was like the fuck was that and I was like, I

01:55:34.860 --> 01:55:37.560
think I just sold out my whole fucking tour

01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:42.560
and and then Tom and then when Tom did his

01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:44.960
one like that and put his tour dates on it

01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:45.960
went over the top.

01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:49.060
He sold out his tours and he was like, whoa,

01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:50.860
he's a dress sold out every fucking show.

01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:51.560
We've added shows.

01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:53.860
I'm doing like an arena here and this is

01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:54.860
before we were doing arenas.

01:55:54.860 --> 01:55:57.060
I was like shut the fuck up and that changed

01:55:57.060 --> 01:55:58.960
my game where I was like, all right, so

01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:01.560
everything's got to be and then and then I

01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:02.760
was like, I don't mind spending a little

01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:04.560
money and then the next one I did was the

01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:07.060
marching band and I was just like and but

01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:08.260
it was you know, it's real crazy.

01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:10.960
I just said can you guys get me a marching

01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:12.860
band and they were like, yes, like it's like

01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:13.660
2400 bucks.

01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:15.360
I go cool and they're like, what do you want

01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:16.160
them to do and I go, I don't know.

01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:18.860
We'll figure it out and they came over and

01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:20.660
they had outfits and they were like, so

01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:22.160
where do you want us to play good?

01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:24.260
What song do you guys know and then they

01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:25.060
didn't even know each other.

01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:27.060
They were all hired people and they're like

01:56:27.060 --> 01:56:29.760
rubber band man and I was like, oh sure.

01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:31.860
Yeah, and then we just scripted it out.

01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:33.460
I was like, all right, I'll pretend it's a

01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:34.560
regular thing with the weights.

01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:36.160
I'll walk out and then I'll blow a whistle

01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:37.460
and then you come out with the

01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:42.260
and then and then we got like two videos

01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:44.060
out of that and that sold out dates and

01:56:44.060 --> 01:56:45.060
I was like fuck.

01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:49.760
And then and then and then and then and

01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:53.160
then the real baller one the fucking real

01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:55.460
one the real one was

01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:58.960
I tore all the muscles in my arm going

01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:01.160
into and do shoot in the movie and I

01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:02.660
ripped all the tricep muscles off and

01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:04.360
they were retracted so I'd go in for

01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:07.960
surgery and the anesthesiologist said to

01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:11.260
me the night before he's like what music

01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:12.660
do you want going in going under and I

01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:13.760
was like what he goes you can pick your

01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:14.660
music going under.

01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:16.260
I said wait, hold on.

01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:17.960
What is it like when you go I go is it

01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:20.360
like casual and he was like, yeah, I

01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:22.260
said I'm doing a promo read going under

01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:23.360
he goes, what do you mean?

01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:24.860
I said I'll explain to you tomorrow,

01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:26.460
but I'm going to I'm not going to count

01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:27.060
backwards.

01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:28.660
I'm just going to do a promo read until

01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:30.660
I pass out and my phone is going to

01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:31.460
fall on the ground.

01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:34.760
All I need you to do is hit stop record

01:57:35.660 --> 01:57:38.160
and so they rolled me into surgery.

01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:38.860
I had red rocks.

01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:41.560
I'd only sold like 75% of red rocks,

01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:43.260
which is the biggest 10,000 the biggest

01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:45.560
venue and I'd ever played in and I

01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:48.560
rolled in with my thing with CCR playing

01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:50.760
in the background and I just was like

01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:53.760
I lay here on this mat or on this steel

01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:56.060
terrified as I go into surgery.

01:57:56.060 --> 01:57:57.260
I want you to know one thing.

01:57:57.660 --> 01:57:59.660
I'm playing Red Rock September 10th

01:57:59.860 --> 01:58:01.760
and I started doing my promo read and

01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:03.060
he was like, yeah, I go Jimmy Buffett

01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:04.360
say the night before and the night

01:58:04.360 --> 01:58:05.360
after he's like for real.

01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:05.760
I go.

01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:06.360
Yeah, you want to come?

01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:06.960
He's like, hell yeah.

01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:07.660
He's like, all right.

01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:09.160
He's like, you're going under and he

01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:09.760
hits it.

01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:11.960
I got sure and I dropped the phone

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:14.560
woke up at a surgery and the first

01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:15.660
thing I said is where's my phone

01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:17.860
and he goes you got it and Leanne's

01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:18.560
like I've already watched it.

01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:20.460
It's good and I went for real and

01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:22.860
so like that was a that was a

01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:24.860
that was a that was a big one.

01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:25.960
That was a big one, too.

01:58:26.060 --> 01:58:26.860
Yeah, that was genius.

01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:28.260
But that was sort of opportunity

01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:29.560
kind of jumping in an idea.

01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:30.760
Have you ever met Mr.

01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:31.560
Beast Jimmy?

01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:34.360
No, so he he's I got to hang out

01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:36.260
with him for a day and listen to

01:58:36.260 --> 01:58:38.160
brainstorm with the team ideas.

01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:39.760
He kind of sounds like you but on

01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:42.260
steroids in terms of like first of

01:58:42.260 --> 01:58:44.760
all willing to spend any amount of

01:58:44.760 --> 01:58:48.160
money on an idea like anything

01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:49.560
anything is allowed.

01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:50.760
Anything is allowed.

01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:51.860
I love that energy.

01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:55.160
The only thing is no like rated

01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:55.860
R stuff.

01:58:55.860 --> 01:58:57.960
So he's really trying to go like

01:58:58.860 --> 01:59:00.360
for the broader audience for kids

01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:00.760
and so on.

01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:02.060
So that's the limitation.

01:59:02.060 --> 01:59:03.860
So you can't do like most of the

01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:05.160
ideas that pop into my head when

01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:07.860
anything's allowed is kind of dark.

01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:09.660
Yeah, but the point is to really

01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:11.060
aggressively brainstorm every

01:59:11.060 --> 01:59:13.260
single day at the whiteboard like

01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:16.060
what and he does that for YouTube

01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:17.960
shorts to for one minute videos.

01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:18.560
Really?

01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:21.060
And just like really like what is

01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:22.260
the coolest thing we could possibly

01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:22.560
do.

01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:23.460
I love that.

01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:25.560
I love that energy and that energy.

01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:28.160
Most people don't you do that and

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:30.160
they should basically youtubers do

01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:31.660
that because they're obsessed about

01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:32.960
this particular YouTube algorithm

01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:35.060
so on and and Jimmy is the best at

01:59:35.060 --> 01:59:36.960
that but like that can benefit you

01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:38.860
if you're a scientist if you're a

01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:41.360
comedian if you're whatever just

01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:42.260
go all out.

01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:44.260
It's there's something really fun

01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:46.860
authentically fun about just coming

01:59:46.860 --> 01:59:48.960
up with a really stupid idea and

01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:50.160
just going let's see what happens

01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:51.860
who gives a fuck we've had those

01:59:51.860 --> 01:59:53.560
like I thought I could catch an

01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:58.260
arrow one time and my wife's like

01:59:58.260 --> 02:00:00.060
absolutely fucking not and I go I

02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:01.660
really think I can I go let's just

02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:04.160
get really close shoot it and then

02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:06.060
I'll see if I can catch it and she's

02:00:06.060 --> 02:00:07.860
like no that's not what you're doing

02:00:07.860 --> 02:00:09.560
and then my cousins like hey we could

02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:10.560
cheat it to make you look like you

02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:12.560
caught an arrow and I went what he

02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:13.960
was here just okay let's do it like

02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:15.860
this and so we did it and it got

02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:16.760
sold a ton of tickets.

02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:17.960
It looks like I really kind of

02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:18.960
everyone knows I didn't catch an

02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:19.260
arrow.

02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:21.460
I mean for the movie we did a promo

02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:22.660
legendary was like you do all the

02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:24.660
promos and we did a promo and I

02:00:24.660 --> 02:00:26.360
thought I could slide out of my car

02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:29.060
like Tom Cruise did in a in a

02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:31.760
helicopter and with roller skates

02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:33.460
and get behind the car and then

02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:35.260
skate behind the car and we just

02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:37.960
ran over my foot and it was real

02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:40.660
and it was scary but we just caught

02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:43.460
it all and in doing it my cousins

02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:45.560
like give me the read and I'm like

02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:47.360
my movie comes out Memorial Day

02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:49.160
weekend I think we have to go to

02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:50.260
the hospital and then we went to

02:00:50.260 --> 02:00:51.560
the hospital and I'm in the speedo

02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:53.060
with a helmet on one broken

02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:55.760
roller skate and then and then

02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:57.660
that did really well and so like I

02:00:57.660 --> 02:00:58.760
said the whole thing is just turn

02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:00.060
the camera on you never know what's

02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:02.560
gonna fucking happen and don't be

02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:03.860
afraid to look stupid and all that

02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:05.160
kind of stuff just go all out

02:01:05.160 --> 02:01:07.360
fucking egos the death of comedy

02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:09.360
like when you when you really give

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:12.260
a like if it's hard to be the

02:01:12.260 --> 02:01:14.160
coolest guy in the room and still

02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:16.260
want to be a comedian is just let

02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:17.460
yourself be whoever you are and

02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:19.060
you'll see the great ones they're

02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:21.160
like that they don't do you know

02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:23.460
they're they're just regular fucking

02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:24.760
dudes and you get some real slick

02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:26.260
ones like Dave's Dave's Paul might

02:01:26.260 --> 02:01:27.160
be the coolest guy in the fucking

02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:28.660
room he right might really might be

02:01:28.660 --> 02:01:29.760
yeah, but I think that's just who

02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:32.760
the fuck he is who are the outside

02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:34.460

02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:41.360
of my friend group so like for me

02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:43.460
probably in Norman Donald Mitch

02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:47.060
Heitberg George Carlin Thompson gore

02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:48.860
number one. Oh, yeah. No.

02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:51.960
Wanted to say that it's an

02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:54.560
interesting pairing no Mitch

02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:57.460
Heitberg David tell David tell

02:01:57.560 --> 02:01:59.560
David tell every everybody deeply

02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:01.460
respects David more than even his

02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:02.660
comedy. I love the show where he

02:02:02.660 --> 02:02:06.260
was insomniac insomniac. He's so

02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:09.360
good at just the natural comedy of

02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:10.360
human interaction.

02:02:10.460 --> 02:02:12.260
He's a brilliant comic. He's just

02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:13.660
a brilliant fucking mind.

02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:16.060
Norm MacDonald's fucking genius

02:02:16.060 --> 02:02:17.260
and absolute genius.

02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:20.760
I mean look, you know Chappelle

02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:23.060
and Bill Burr are are the two

02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:24.660
best in our generation in my

02:02:24.660 --> 02:02:26.560
opinion and and that's you know,

02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:27.660
and that's understanding that like

02:02:27.660 --> 02:02:28.760
I'm still friends with some of the

02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:30.360
best in our generation, but like

02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:32.060
just the way their brains work is

02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:33.460
really on a next level.

02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:35.060
Like, you know, those are guys

02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:37.060
Stan Hope is the same way just

02:02:37.060 --> 02:02:39.760
fucking genius, you know, I Rogan

02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:40.960
Sugura. Those are my friend group.

02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:41.960
That's my really close friend

02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:43.760
group. But like those other guys

02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:45.160
I'm friends with but they're not

02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:47.960
like that's like yeah.

02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:50.260
Louis CK go Louis CK fuck.

02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:51.160
He's amazing.

02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:52.560
It's hard to do because you start

02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:55.060
like forgetting the like people

02:02:55.060 --> 02:02:56.360
and then it's almost like people

02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:57.260
go. Oh, so you didn't like that

02:02:57.260 --> 02:02:58.160
person. You're like, no, I fucking

02:02:58.160 --> 02:02:58.860
love that person.

02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:02.360
I mean, there's a for me like

02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:04.060
Robin Williams, which the whole

02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:04.660
another thing.

02:03:04.660 --> 02:03:05.360
Oh, yeah.

02:03:05.860 --> 02:03:09.860
Silverman fucking I love Jeanine.

02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:12.160
I'm a fucking big Jeanine fan.

02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:13.260
I love her brain.

02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:14.660
Marin's fucking hilarious.

02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:17.360
You know, Patton's brilliant.

02:03:17.660 --> 02:03:18.460
David Cross.

02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:19.460
I mean, there's like it's you know,

02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:21.360
it's really to ignore those guys

02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:22.260
and those guys were like the whole

02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:23.960
forefront of the alternative comedy

02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:25.960
front. They're fucking amazing.

02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:27.960
Yeah, and the people that have

02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:29.760
like Marin or Joe that have

02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:30.960
podcasts is interesting.

02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:32.060
It's an interesting pairing because

02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:33.360
you get to know like everything

02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:34.460
about them, but then they're also

02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:36.260
comedians and I've gotten

02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:39.360
I've gone to Joe's Club a lot.

02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:41.360
I listened Joe and just that

02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:43.060
whole group of comics do comedy

02:03:43.060 --> 02:03:44.960
and go to the same set over

02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:46.160
and over and over and to see how

02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:47.560
it changes. It's really cool.

02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:48.260
It's the coolest thing.

02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:49.360
When I first started to watch

02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:50.660
someone like a tell was really

02:03:50.660 --> 02:03:51.460
brilliant at it because you'd

02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:52.960
watch him tinker with a set.

02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:56.160
Yeah, and he'd have an idea

02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:57.560
like hitting someone over the

02:03:57.560 --> 02:03:58.960
head with a hammer from behind

02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:00.760
and then he'd work it nine

02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:02.460
different ways, you know, and

02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:03.460
you'd be like, whoa.

02:04:03.460 --> 02:04:04.660
So you're the hitting hammer in

02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:06.060
the head is the thing that he's

02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:06.660
working on.

02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:09.460
I hope Eddie Murphy comes back.

02:04:10.460 --> 02:04:11.560
He's one of the greats.

02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:12.160
Chris Rock.

02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:14.360
Chris Rock's fucking bring the

02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:15.560
pain is like the reason I got in

02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:16.060
comedy.

02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:19.660
Do you have advice for young

02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:22.160
folks? You seem like a stellar

02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:24.260
example of successful human

02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:28.260
being or more seriously a very

02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:29.560
kind of nonlinear life.

02:04:30.060 --> 02:04:30.960
Do you have advice for young

02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:31.760
people in high school and

02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:34.960
college? I don't have a good

02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:35.760
life.

02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:37.960
They can be proud of don't worry

02:04:38.060 --> 02:04:40.560
too much about what you do when

02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:41.260
you get older.

02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:44.960
But when you do start worrying

02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:47.260
find the thing you love and it

02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:49.660
will never feel like work the

02:04:49.860 --> 02:04:52.160
to fucking I can't imagine what

02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:54.260
it must feel like to be a lawyer

02:04:54.260 --> 02:04:55.960
and have to read papers or

02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:57.860
whatever they do all day and

02:04:57.860 --> 02:04:59.060
know that that's my day.

02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:01.160
I mean it must feel like what I

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:02.360
what school felt like for me.

02:05:04.060 --> 02:05:05.360
If you find that thing you love

02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:08.760
to do you will work endlessly

02:05:09.060 --> 02:05:11.660
effortlessly and hard as fucking

02:05:11.660 --> 02:05:13.460
shit every day and you'll love

02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:14.760
every day of your life.

02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:16.060
Find what you love and let it

02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:16.560
kill you.

02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:19.360
Bukowski said that for then

02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:20.560
that's the fucking thing because

02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:21.460
that's what I'm doing.

02:05:21.860 --> 02:05:23.160
I'm letting it fucking take.

02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:25.860
I'm I'm fucking I'm on that

02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:27.460
fucking bullet train to fucking

02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:29.560
nowhere on this fucking comedy

02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:29.860
journey.

02:05:29.860 --> 02:05:30.560
I love it.

02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:31.560
I love it.

02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:32.760
So it's like the Hunter S.

02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:33.560
Thompson thing.

02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:34.060
What is it?

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:36.060
However you put it you basically

02:05:36.260 --> 02:05:38.060
you're not supposed to be end up

02:05:38.060 --> 02:05:40.460
in a well-preserved box you slide

02:05:40.460 --> 02:05:43.860
in sideways smoke just beat up.

02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:46.960
Yeah just just a giant mess.

02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:48.260
I love I love those guys that can

02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:49.460
really live that life that are

02:05:49.460 --> 02:05:51.660
like yeah man I'm breaking it.

02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:52.660
I'm breaking it down like a guy

02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:54.260
like Tony Hawk or Matt Hoffman

02:05:54.660 --> 02:05:56.360
like yeah if I don't fucking

02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:57.560
break the fuck out of this thing

02:05:57.560 --> 02:05:59.060
before I am then I'm not doing

02:05:59.060 --> 02:05:59.460
it right.

02:05:59.960 --> 02:06:01.260
Then again there's also Churchill

02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:02.660
who tried to break the thing and

02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:04.960
he couldn't lived into his 90s a

02:06:04.960 --> 02:06:06.660
bad motherfucker just a bad

02:06:06.660 --> 02:06:07.360
motherfucker.

02:06:08.060 --> 02:06:09.660
So I guess the only hope we can

02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:11.260
have for Burke Chrysler is that

02:06:11.260 --> 02:06:12.160
you're going to be the Winston

02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:13.260
Churchill of comedy.

02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:15.160
My life is lived perfectly.

02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:19.760
If I'm 95 years old and all my

02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:20.560
friends are dead.

02:06:23.860 --> 02:06:25.160
Yeah they're like they're like

02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:26.960
can you believe that wolf got

02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:27.460
Rogan?

02:06:27.860 --> 02:06:28.260
Yeah.

02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:32.060
Can you believe Cigara 600 pounds

02:06:32.060 --> 02:06:33.760
and they had to carry him out in

02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:35.160
a crane out of that house?

02:06:36.260 --> 02:06:38.460
Can you believe that it's just

02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:39.960
Burke Chrysler and Joey Diaz

02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:43.860
left just standing there in

02:06:43.860 --> 02:06:44.560
October.

02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:46.160
So October just the two of you

02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:48.860
left just laughing over is just

02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:51.360
I'm 95 at the Mark Twain Awards

02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:52.760
and they're like Burke Chrysler

02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:54.460
still fucking here.

02:06:54.760 --> 02:06:56.360
Who saw that coming?

02:06:57.160 --> 02:06:58.360
I hope so Bert.

02:06:58.360 --> 02:06:59.760
I'm a huge fan of yours.

02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:01.160
It meant so much to me when you

02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:03.560
said that you knew who I was like

02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:04.560
we were talking about it.

02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:06.160
Just it's so cool.

02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:06.860
It's so cool.

02:07:06.860 --> 02:07:07.860
Thank you for putting so much

02:07:07.860 --> 02:07:08.960
joy and love out there in the

02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:09.360
world.

02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:11.060
I'm a huge fan and thank you for

02:07:11.060 --> 02:07:12.060
the love you give me.

02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:12.960
Thank you man.

02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:14.460
I am a huge fan of yours.

02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:16.060
You keep doing you I'll keep

02:07:16.060 --> 02:07:17.160
doing me and then let's see if

02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:17.860
we can meet in the middle

02:07:17.860 --> 02:07:19.060
sometime have a cold beer in

02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:19.860
the afternoon.

02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:20.560
Love you brother.

02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:21.160
Love you.

Thanks for listening to this

02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:24.360
conversation with Burke Chrysler

02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:25.860
to support this podcast.

02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:27.060
Please check out our sponsors

02:07:27.060 --> 02:07:29.160
in the description and now let

02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:30.160
me leave you with some words

02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:31.360
from Hunter S Thompson.

02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:34.060
Life should not be a journey

02:07:34.060 --> 02:07:35.460
to the grave with the intention

02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:37.660
of arriving safely in a pretty

02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:39.460
and well-preserved body but

02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:41.660
rather to skin in broadside

02:07:41.960 --> 02:07:44.160
in a cloud of smoke thoroughly

02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:46.860
used up totally worn out and

02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:48.160
loudly proclaiming.

02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:50.560
Wow, what a ride.

02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:52.560
Thank you for listening.

02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:54.960
I hope to see you next time.

02:07:55.860 --> 02:07:56.360
Thank you.
