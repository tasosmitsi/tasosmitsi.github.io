00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
The following is a conversation with Stephen Cotkin,

00:02.640 --> 00:04.720
his second time on the podcast.

00:04.720 --> 00:08.080
Stephen is one of the greatest historians of all time,

00:08.080 --> 00:11.320
specializing in 20th and 21st century history

00:11.320 --> 00:13.680
of Russia and Eastern Europe.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.000
And he has written what is widely considered

00:16.000 --> 00:18.920
to be the definitive biography of Stalin

00:18.920 --> 00:22.280
in three volumes, two of which have been published,

00:22.280 --> 00:26.400
and the third focused on World War II and the years after

00:26.400 --> 00:28.680
he is in the midst of writing now.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.640
This conversation includes a response

00:31.640 --> 00:34.560
to my previous podcast episode with Oliver Stone

00:34.560 --> 00:37.960
that was focused on Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine.

00:38.800 --> 00:42.040
Stephen provides a hard-hitting criticism of Putin

00:42.040 --> 00:44.160
and the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

00:44.160 --> 00:46.520
weighed and contextualized deeply

00:46.520 --> 00:50.200
in the complex geopolitics and history of our world,

00:50.200 --> 00:53.280
all with an intensity and rigor,

00:53.280 --> 00:56.280
but also wit and humor that makes Stephen

00:56.360 --> 00:58.600
one of my favorite human beings.

01:00.480 --> 01:03.360
Please also allow me to mention something

01:03.360 --> 01:06.240
that has been apparent and has weighed heavy

01:06.240 --> 01:07.880
on my heart and mind.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.680
This conversation with Stephen Cotkin

01:11.680 --> 01:14.320
makes it more dangerous for me to travel in Russia.

01:15.480 --> 01:18.520
The previous conversation with Oliver Stone

01:18.520 --> 01:21.560
makes it more dangerous for me to travel in Ukraine.

01:22.560 --> 01:27.120
This makes me sad, but it is the way of the world.

01:27.120 --> 01:31.240
I will nevertheless travel to both Ukraine and Russia.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.320
I need to once again see with my own eyes

01:35.320 --> 01:40.120
the land of my ancestors, where they suffered but flourished

01:40.120 --> 01:43.280
and eventually gave birth to silly old me.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.040
I need to hear directly the pain, anger and hope

01:49.040 --> 01:50.880
from both Ukrainians and Russians.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.120
I won't give details to my travel plans

01:54.120 --> 01:56.280
in terms of location and timing,

01:56.280 --> 01:58.840
but the trip is very soon.

01:58.840 --> 02:03.840
Whatever happens, I'm truly grateful for every day I'm alive

02:04.440 --> 02:06.480
and I hope to spend each such day

02:06.480 --> 02:08.280
adding a bit of love to the world.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.280
I love you all.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.160
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

02:14.080 --> 02:18.400
And now, dear friends, here's Stephen Cotkin.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.200
You are one of the great historians of our time

02:22.200 --> 02:24.600
specializing in the man, the leader,

02:24.600 --> 02:26.640
the historical figure of Stalin.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.800
So let me ask a challenging question.

02:29.640 --> 02:34.640
If you can perhaps think about the echo of 80 years

02:36.760 --> 02:40.080
between Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Putin,

02:40.080 --> 02:42.040
what are the similarities and differences

02:42.040 --> 02:44.560
between the man and the historical figure,

02:44.560 --> 02:47.040
the historical trajectory of Stalin and Putin?

02:48.720 --> 02:49.560
Thank you, Lex.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.280
It's very nice to be here again with you.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.400
It's been a while.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.240
Good to see you.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.160
Yeah, good to see you as well.

02:56.160 --> 02:57.800
You're looking good.

02:57.800 --> 03:01.120
I see this podcast stuff is doing you right.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.440
Yeah.

03:02.440 --> 03:06.960
So we can't really put very easily Vladimir Putin

03:06.960 --> 03:09.200
in the same sentence with Joseph Stalin.

03:10.040 --> 03:13.640
Stalin is a singular figure

03:13.640 --> 03:16.960
and his category is really small.

03:16.960 --> 03:21.400
Hitler, Mao, that's really about it.

03:21.400 --> 03:25.720
And even in that category, Stalin is the dominant figure,

03:25.720 --> 03:28.640
both by how long he was in power

03:28.640 --> 03:30.720
and also by the amount of power,

03:30.720 --> 03:32.480
the military industrial complex

03:32.480 --> 03:34.080
he helped build and commanded.

03:35.280 --> 03:38.240
So Putin can't be compared to that.

03:38.240 --> 03:42.400
However, Putin's in the same building as Stalin.

03:42.400 --> 03:46.640
He uses some of the same offices as Stalin used

03:46.640 --> 03:49.880
and some of those, the television broadcasts

03:49.880 --> 03:51.800
that we see of Putin at meetings

03:51.800 --> 03:54.080
and Putin inside the Kremlin,

03:55.200 --> 03:57.000
Stalin used to sit in those rooms

03:57.000 --> 03:58.880
and hold meetings in those rooms.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.160
That's the Imperial Senate

04:01.160 --> 04:02.520
built by Catherine the Great,

04:02.520 --> 04:06.720
an 18th century building inside the Kremlin.

04:06.720 --> 04:11.720
It's a domed building and you can see it on the panorama,

04:12.600 --> 04:13.440
the top of the building,

04:13.440 --> 04:15.200
at least you can see it on the panorama

04:15.200 --> 04:17.000
when you look over the Kremlin wall

04:17.000 --> 04:20.240
from many sites inside Moscow.

04:21.320 --> 04:26.120
So if he's not comparable to Stalin,

04:26.120 --> 04:28.880
he still works, as I said, in those same buildings,

04:28.880 --> 04:31.800
those same offices, partly.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.800
And so therefore, he's got some of the problems

04:34.800 --> 04:36.080
that Stalin had,

04:36.080 --> 04:39.640
which was managing Russian power in the world

04:39.640 --> 04:43.600
from a position of weakness vis-a-vis the West,

04:43.600 --> 04:48.600
but from an ambition, a grandiosity, in fact.

04:49.480 --> 04:53.680
And so this combination of weakness and grandeur,

04:54.800 --> 04:56.960
of not being as strong as the West,

04:56.960 --> 05:01.360
but aspiring to be as great or greater than the West,

05:01.360 --> 05:04.260
that's the dilemma of Russian history

05:04.260 --> 05:06.200
for the past many centuries.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.020
It was the dilemma for the czars.

05:08.020 --> 05:09.720
It was the dilemma for Peter the Great.

05:09.720 --> 05:12.120
It was the dilemma for Alexander.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.440
It was the dilemma for Stalin,

05:14.440 --> 05:16.800
and it's the dilemma for Putin.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.960
Russia is smaller now,

05:18.960 --> 05:22.080
compared to when Stalin was in that Kremlin.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.440
It's got pushed back to borders

05:25.440 --> 05:28.040
almost the time of Peter the Great.

05:28.040 --> 05:31.240
It's farther from the main European capitals now

05:31.240 --> 05:34.200
than any time since that 18th century.

05:35.360 --> 05:39.120
And the West has only grown stronger

05:39.120 --> 05:40.180
in that period of time.

05:40.180 --> 05:42.680
So the dilemma is greater than ever.

05:43.720 --> 05:46.980
The irony of being in that position,

05:46.980 --> 05:48.260
of sitting in the Kremlin,

05:48.260 --> 05:50.720
trying to manage Russian power in the world,

05:50.720 --> 05:53.700
trying to be a providential power,

05:53.700 --> 05:57.100
a country with a special mission in the world,

05:57.100 --> 06:01.420
a country which imagines itself to be a whole civilization,

06:01.420 --> 06:03.540
and yet not having the capabilities

06:03.540 --> 06:05.900
to meet those aspirations,

06:05.900 --> 06:09.220
and falling farther and farther behind the West.

06:09.220 --> 06:12.500
The irony of all of that is the attempted solutions

06:13.580 --> 06:17.020
put Russia in a worse place every single time.

06:17.020 --> 06:20.220
So you try to manage the gap with the West,

06:20.220 --> 06:23.780
you try to realize these aspirations,

06:23.780 --> 06:26.660
you try to raise your capabilities,

06:26.660 --> 06:28.400
and you build a strong state,

06:28.400 --> 06:30.480
the quest to build a strong state

06:30.480 --> 06:33.420
and use coercive modernization

06:34.620 --> 06:38.420
to try somehow, if not to close the gap with the West,

06:38.420 --> 06:39.700
at least to manage it.

06:40.740 --> 06:45.740
And the result is different versions of personalist rule.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.620
So they don't build a strong state,

06:48.620 --> 06:50.540
they build a personal dictatorship,

06:50.540 --> 06:52.060
they build an autocracy.

06:53.140 --> 06:56.420
And moreover, that autocracy undertakes measures

06:56.420 --> 07:00.420
which then worsen the very geopolitical dilemma

07:00.420 --> 07:05.020
that gave rise to this personalist rule in the first place.

07:05.020 --> 07:08.420
And so I call this Russia's perpetual geopolitics,

07:08.420 --> 07:11.380
I've been writing about this for many, many years.

07:11.380 --> 07:14.860
What's important about this analysis

07:14.860 --> 07:17.420
is this is not a story

07:17.420 --> 07:22.420
of eternal Russian cultural proclivity to aggression.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.820
It's not something that's in the mother's milk,

07:26.820 --> 07:30.300
it's not something that can't be changed.

07:30.300 --> 07:34.780
Russia doesn't have an innate cultural tendency

07:34.780 --> 07:35.880
to aggression.

07:35.880 --> 07:39.580
This is a choice, it's a strategic choice

07:39.580 --> 07:42.540
to try to match the power of the West,

07:42.540 --> 07:46.600
which from Russia's vantage point is actually unmatchable.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.040
But it's a choice that's made again and again,

07:49.040 --> 07:50.580
and Putin has made this choice

07:50.580 --> 07:52.940
just as Stalin made the choice, right?

07:52.940 --> 07:56.500
Stalin presided over the World War II victory,

07:56.500 --> 07:57.940
and then he lost the peace.

07:58.940 --> 08:02.460
After he died in 1953,

08:02.460 --> 08:06.700
there was of course other rulers who succeeded him,

08:06.700 --> 08:09.460
he was still the most important person in the country

08:09.460 --> 08:11.140
after he died,

08:11.140 --> 08:14.180
because they were trying to manage that system that he built,

08:14.180 --> 08:17.580
and more importantly manage that growing gap with the West.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.140
By the time the 90s rolled around,

08:21.140 --> 08:25.060
former Soviet troops, now Russian troops,

08:25.060 --> 08:28.740
withdrew from all those advanced positions

08:28.740 --> 08:30.500
that they had achieved as a result

08:30.500 --> 08:32.340
of the World War II victory,

08:32.340 --> 08:34.700
and it was Napoleon in reverse.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.780
They went on the same roads,

08:36.780 --> 08:39.860
but not from Moscow back to Paris,

08:39.860 --> 08:44.460
but instead from Warsaw and from East Berlin

08:44.460 --> 08:48.740
and from Tallinn and Riga and all the other places

08:48.740 --> 08:53.580
of former Warsaw Pact and former Soviet republics

08:53.580 --> 08:55.500
in the Baltic region.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.060
They went back to Russia in retreat,

08:58.060 --> 09:02.020
and so Stalin in the fullness of time lost the peace,

09:02.020 --> 09:04.860
and Putin in his own way,

09:04.860 --> 09:07.100
inheriting some of this,

09:07.100 --> 09:11.180
attempting to reverse it when, as I said,

09:11.180 --> 09:14.160
Russia was smaller, farther away, weaker,

09:14.160 --> 09:16.380
the West was bigger and stronger

09:16.380 --> 09:20.180
and had absorbed those former Warsaw Pact

09:21.180 --> 09:24.140
countries and Baltic states

09:24.140 --> 09:27.980
because they voluntarily begged to join the West.

09:27.980 --> 09:30.380
The West didn't impose itself on them.

09:30.380 --> 09:34.460
It's a voluntary sphere of influence that the West conducts,

09:34.460 --> 09:38.340
and so that dilemma is where you can put Putin and Stalin

09:38.340 --> 09:40.140
in the same sentence,

09:40.140 --> 09:45.140
and the terrible outcome for Russia in the fullness of time

09:45.340 --> 09:46.700
also has echoes,

09:46.700 --> 09:51.700
but of course Putin hasn't murdered 18 to 20 million people,

09:51.740 --> 09:54.900
and the scale of his abilities to cause grief

09:56.580 --> 10:00.020
with the nuclear weapons aside is nothing like Stalin's,

10:00.020 --> 10:02.260
and so we have to be careful, right?

10:02.260 --> 10:05.340
Only Mao put bigger numbers on the board

10:06.300 --> 10:08.260
from a tragic point of view than Stalin.

10:08.260 --> 10:10.140
And numbers matter here

10:10.140 --> 10:12.940
if we compare these singular figures.

10:13.940 --> 10:16.820
Yeah, Mao killed more people than Stalin

10:16.820 --> 10:20.540
because Mao had more people to kill.

10:20.540 --> 10:22.940
The most amazing thing about Mao is

10:22.940 --> 10:25.220
he watched Stalin do it.

10:26.220 --> 10:28.720
He watched Stalin collectivize agriculture

10:28.720 --> 10:30.780
and famine result.

10:30.780 --> 10:34.940
He watched Stalin impose this communist monopoly,

10:34.940 --> 10:37.940
and all of those people sent to prison

10:37.940 --> 10:40.380
or given a bullet in the back of the neck,

10:40.380 --> 10:41.460
and he watched all of that,

10:41.460 --> 10:43.740
and then he did it again himself in China.

10:43.740 --> 10:46.260
Do you think he saw the human cost directly,

10:46.260 --> 10:48.340
that when you say he saw,

10:48.340 --> 10:51.220
do you think he was focused on the policies,

10:51.220 --> 10:54.620
or was he also aware distinctly as a human being

10:54.620 --> 10:58.060
of the human costs in the lives of peasants

10:58.060 --> 11:01.780
and the lives of the working class and the lives of the poor?

11:01.780 --> 11:03.820
I think the prima facie evidence

11:03.820 --> 11:06.080
is that he didn't value human life.

11:07.080 --> 11:10.360
Otherwise, I don't think after seeing the amount of lives

11:10.360 --> 11:12.840
that were taken in the Soviet experiment,

11:12.840 --> 11:16.320
he would have done something similar after that.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.680
I think the answer, Lex,

11:17.680 --> 11:21.240
is it's very hard to get inside Mao's head

11:21.240 --> 11:24.120
and figure out what he was really thinking.

11:24.120 --> 11:27.180
But if you just look at the results that happened,

11:27.180 --> 11:29.160
the policies that were undertaken

11:29.160 --> 11:31.240
and the consequences of them,

11:31.240 --> 11:34.760
you would have to conclude that there was, let's say,

11:34.800 --> 11:38.680
no value or little value placed on human life.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.880
Unfortunately, that's characteristic

11:40.880 --> 11:43.040
not only of communist dictators, right,

11:43.040 --> 11:45.640
of post-communist dictators as well,

11:45.640 --> 11:49.320
but the scale of the horrors that they inflict,

11:50.320 --> 11:54.560
as horrific as they are, just can't compare.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.560
And so we're in a situation where Eurasia,

11:58.560 --> 12:03.040
that is to say, the ancient civilizations of Eurasia,

12:03.040 --> 12:07.260
which would be Russia, Iran, China,

12:08.640 --> 12:13.400
all have some version of non-democratic,

12:13.400 --> 12:16.280
illiberal autocratic regimes,

12:16.280 --> 12:17.640
and they're all pushing up

12:17.640 --> 12:21.140
against the greater power of the West in some form.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.280
Sometimes they coordinate their actions

12:23.280 --> 12:25.320
and sometimes they don't.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.700
But this is a very long-standing phenomenon, Lex,

12:28.700 --> 12:33.460
that predates Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping

12:33.460 --> 12:37.580
or the latest incarnation of the supreme leader in Iran.

12:37.580 --> 12:40.780
So we'll talk about this, I think,

12:40.780 --> 12:44.580
really powerful framework of five dimensions

12:44.580 --> 12:47.140
of authoritarian regimes that you've put together.

12:47.140 --> 12:49.780
But first, let's go to this Napoleon

12:49.780 --> 12:54.780
and reverse retreat from Warsaw back.

12:55.700 --> 12:59.860
Putin has called, from the perspective of Putin,

12:59.860 --> 13:02.660
this retreat, this collapse of Stalin

13:02.660 --> 13:07.580
is one of the great tragedies of that region, of Russia.

13:09.220 --> 13:12.500
Do you think there's a sense where,

13:12.500 --> 13:16.700
as Putin sits now in power for 22-plus years,

13:17.860 --> 13:20.860
he really dreams of a return

13:21.700 --> 13:26.700
to the power, the influence, the land of Stalin?

13:31.300 --> 13:35.060
So while you said that they're not in the same place

13:35.060 --> 13:37.020
in terms of the numbers of people

13:38.380 --> 13:40.900
that suffer due to their regime,

13:40.900 --> 13:44.540
do you think he hopes to have the same power,

13:44.540 --> 13:47.100
the same influence for a nation

13:47.140 --> 13:50.500
that was in the 30s, in the 40s, in the 50s

13:51.780 --> 13:54.020
of the 20th century under Stalin?

13:54.020 --> 13:56.460
If he does, Lex, he's deluding himself.

13:57.780 --> 13:59.700
We don't know for sure.

13:59.700 --> 14:02.380
Very few people talk to him.

14:02.380 --> 14:04.740
Very few people have access to him.

14:05.580 --> 14:09.740
A handful of Western leaders have met with him

14:09.740 --> 14:11.240
for short periods of time.

14:12.180 --> 14:14.700
Those inside Russia barely meet with him,

14:14.740 --> 14:17.580
his own minions in the regime

14:17.580 --> 14:19.260
barely have face time with him.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.540
We don't know exactly what he thinks.

14:22.540 --> 14:27.540
It could be that he has delusions

14:27.780 --> 14:30.420
of reconquering Russian influence,

14:30.420 --> 14:34.800
if not direct control over the territories that broke away,

14:35.660 --> 14:36.940
but it's not gonna happen.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.700
Let's talk a little bit about this guy, Nikolai Patrushev.

14:42.580 --> 14:45.740
Nikolai Patrushev is probably not well known

14:45.740 --> 14:47.460
to your listeners.

14:47.460 --> 14:50.900
He's the head of Russia's Security Council,

14:51.780 --> 14:54.300
and so you could probably call him

14:54.300 --> 14:57.780
the second most important or second most powerful man

14:57.780 --> 15:01.020
in Russia, certainly inside the regime.

15:02.120 --> 15:05.520
Arguably, Navalny is the second most important person

15:05.520 --> 15:08.020
in the country, and we'll talk about that later, I'm sure.

15:08.020 --> 15:09.780
In terms of influence, yes.

15:10.140 --> 15:15.140
But Patrushev is a version of Putin's right-hand man.

15:17.940 --> 15:22.500
And Patrushev has been giving interviews in the press.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.020
You probably saw the interview

15:24.020 --> 15:27.580
with Nizavismaya Gazeta not that long ago.

15:27.580 --> 15:31.620
He writes also his own blog-like interventions

15:31.620 --> 15:36.620
in the public sphere using the few channels that are left.

15:37.420 --> 15:39.740
And what's interesting about Patrushev,

15:39.740 --> 15:44.740
and this could well reflect similar thinking to Putin's,

15:44.740 --> 15:46.420
which is why I'm bringing this up,

15:47.540 --> 15:51.900
is that he's got this conspiratorial theory

15:51.900 --> 15:56.900
that the West has been on a forever campaign

15:56.900 --> 16:01.220
to destroy Russia, just like it destroyed the Soviet Union,

16:01.220 --> 16:03.700
and that everything the West does

16:03.700 --> 16:05.900
is meant to dismember Russia.

16:07.380 --> 16:11.060
And that Russia is fighting an existential battle

16:11.060 --> 16:12.980
against the West.

16:12.980 --> 16:16.540
And so, for example, the CIA and the American government

16:16.540 --> 16:18.980
wanted to bring down the Soviet Union,

16:18.980 --> 16:21.060
nevermind that the Bush administration,

16:21.060 --> 16:24.460
the first Bush, the father, was trying desperately

16:24.460 --> 16:26.500
to hold the Soviet Union together

16:26.500 --> 16:30.340
because they were afraid of the chaos that might ensue

16:30.340 --> 16:33.500
and the nukes that might get loose

16:33.540 --> 16:37.540
as a result of a Soviet collapse.

16:37.540 --> 16:40.580
And it wasn't until the very last moment

16:40.580 --> 16:44.780
where Bush decided, his administration decided

16:44.780 --> 16:48.780
to back those Republican leaders

16:48.780 --> 16:51.460
who were breaking away from Mikhail Gorbachev

16:51.460 --> 16:53.820
and the Soviet Union, right?

16:53.820 --> 16:56.340
So nevermind the empirics of it,

16:56.340 --> 16:59.060
nevermind that Bill Clinton's administration

16:59.060 --> 17:02.780
following George Bush sent boatloads of money

17:03.580 --> 17:06.660
Western taxpayer money to Russia.

17:06.660 --> 17:08.740
We don't know exactly how much

17:08.740 --> 17:10.580
because it came from different sources.

17:10.580 --> 17:13.260
People talk about how there was no Marshall Plan.

17:13.260 --> 17:16.380
It was tens of billions of dollars

17:16.380 --> 17:20.300
from various sources, from the IMF and other sources.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.740
And Lex, it disappeared, it's gone.

17:22.740 --> 17:25.060
Just like the German money that went to Gorbachev

17:25.060 --> 17:28.980
for unification disappeared even before the Soviet collapse.

17:28.980 --> 17:32.180
The money disappeared, but the West sent the money.

17:32.180 --> 17:33.940
So how was that a plot?

17:33.940 --> 17:37.180
And then you could go all the way to Obama's administration,

17:37.180 --> 17:39.820
George Bush trying to do business deals

17:39.820 --> 17:43.140
and reset the relations and Obama administration

17:43.140 --> 17:44.700
trying to reset the relations

17:44.700 --> 17:48.020
and doing nothing after the Georgian war

17:48.020 --> 17:51.940
and slapping Putin on the wrist

17:51.940 --> 17:55.060
following the seizure for supply.

17:55.060 --> 17:56.700
And you could go on and you could go on

17:56.700 --> 17:59.020
all the way through the Trump administration

17:59.060 --> 18:01.900
telling Putin that he's right.

18:01.900 --> 18:05.100
Trump believes Putin and doesn't believe US intelligence

18:05.100 --> 18:07.020
about Russian efforts to interfere

18:07.020 --> 18:08.820
in American domestic politics.

18:08.820 --> 18:11.780
So despite all the empirics of it,

18:11.780 --> 18:14.780
you have Patrushev and likely Putin

18:14.780 --> 18:19.460
talking about this multi-decade Western conspiracy

18:19.460 --> 18:21.540
to bring Russia down.

18:21.540 --> 18:23.620
At the same time as that's happening,

18:23.620 --> 18:27.060
the Germans are voluntarily increasing

18:27.060 --> 18:30.020
their dependence on Russian energy,

18:30.020 --> 18:33.020
voluntarily increasing their dependence on Russia.

18:33.020 --> 18:36.020
So here's the conspiracy to bring Russia down.

18:36.020 --> 18:39.940
The French who fantasize about themselves

18:39.940 --> 18:43.180
as a diplomatic superpower are constantly,

18:43.180 --> 18:46.220
the French leaders are constantly running to the Kremlin

18:46.220 --> 18:48.220
to ask what Russia needs,

18:48.220 --> 18:50.700
what concessions from the West Russia needs

18:50.700 --> 18:53.740
to feel respected again.

18:53.780 --> 18:58.700
The British provide all manner of money laundering

18:58.700 --> 19:01.540
and reputation laundering services

19:01.540 --> 19:03.540
for the whole Russian oligarchy,

19:03.540 --> 19:07.780
including the state officials who are looting the state

19:07.780 --> 19:11.980
and using the West British institutions to launder their money.

19:11.980 --> 19:13.340
So all of this is happening.

19:13.340 --> 19:16.900
And yet Patrushev imagines this conspiracy

19:16.900 --> 19:19.180
to bring Russia down by the West.

19:19.180 --> 19:22.060
And so that's what we've got in the Kremlin again.

19:22.060 --> 19:26.940
Stalin had that same conspiratorial mentality of the West.

19:26.940 --> 19:28.540
Everything that happened in the world

19:28.540 --> 19:30.580
was part of a Western conspiracy

19:30.580 --> 19:32.340
directed against the Soviet Union

19:32.340 --> 19:34.180
and now directed against Russia.

19:34.180 --> 19:37.740
Even though the West is trying to appease,

19:37.740 --> 19:39.660
the West is offering its services,

19:39.660 --> 19:42.260
the West is trying to change Russia through investment

19:42.260 --> 19:46.700
in a positive way, but instead the West is what's changing.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.500
The West is becoming more corrupt.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.580
Western services are being corrupted

19:50.580 --> 19:52.900
by the relationship with Russia.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.900
So you have to ask yourself,

19:54.900 --> 19:58.180
who are these people in power in the Kremlin

19:58.180 --> 20:02.340
who imagine that while they're availing themselves

20:02.340 --> 20:07.060
of every service and every blandishment of the West,

20:07.060 --> 20:09.260
while they're availing themselves of this,

20:09.260 --> 20:11.940
that they're fighting a conspiracy

20:11.940 --> 20:14.460
by the West to bring them down.

20:14.460 --> 20:19.460
So this is what they call the Abizhania, right?

20:20.580 --> 20:23.580
In Russian, which is a term, as you know,

20:23.580 --> 20:26.900
that means those who are resentful

20:26.900 --> 20:29.180
or you might call them the losers,

20:29.180 --> 20:31.060
the losers in the transition.

20:31.900 --> 20:36.740
So when the Soviet Union fell and there was a diminishment,

20:36.740 --> 20:39.740
a very substantial diminution in Russian power

20:39.740 --> 20:44.060
and influence in the world, a lot of people lost out.

20:44.060 --> 20:46.980
They weren't able to steal the property.

20:46.980 --> 20:50.580
They weren't able to loot the state in the 90s

20:50.580 --> 20:52.820
and they were on the outside.

20:52.820 --> 20:55.300
They gradually came back in.

20:55.300 --> 20:58.380
They were the losers in the transition domestically.

20:59.260 --> 21:01.900
And for them, right?

21:01.900 --> 21:06.020
They wanted to reverse being on the losing side.

21:06.020 --> 21:10.140
And so they began to expropriate, to steal the money,

21:10.140 --> 21:14.940
steal the property from those first thieves

21:14.940 --> 21:16.980
who stole in the 90s.

21:16.980 --> 21:20.140
And the 2000s and on have been about re-stealing,

21:20.140 --> 21:23.180
taking the losers in the transition,

21:23.180 --> 21:25.940
taking the money from the winners

21:25.940 --> 21:30.660
and reversing this resentment, this loser status.

21:30.660 --> 21:33.660
Those are your Patrushevs and your Putin's.

21:33.660 --> 21:36.620
But at the same time, this blows out

21:36.620 --> 21:41.620
to let's reverse the losses being on the losing side,

21:41.740 --> 21:44.660
the roiling resentment at the decline

21:44.660 --> 21:47.020
of their power internationally.

21:47.020 --> 21:49.620
Let's try to reverse that too.

21:49.620 --> 21:54.620
So you have a profound psychological whole generation

21:55.140 --> 21:58.340
of people who are on the losing end domestically

21:58.340 --> 22:00.460
and reverse that domestically.

22:00.460 --> 22:02.260
That's what the Putin regime is about.

22:02.260 --> 22:06.180
Remember, Mikhail Khodorkovsky's Yukos.

22:06.180 --> 22:09.300
Remember all the companies that are now owned

22:09.340 --> 22:12.700
by Putin cronies because they were taken away

22:12.700 --> 22:15.580
from whoever stole them in the first place.

22:15.580 --> 22:19.220
And now they're trying to do that on the international scale.

22:19.220 --> 22:22.900
It's one thing to put domestic opponents in jail.

22:22.900 --> 22:27.060
It's one thing to take away someone's property domestically,

22:27.060 --> 22:30.060
but you're not gonna reverse the power of the West

22:30.060 --> 22:33.220
with the diminished Russia that you have.

22:34.180 --> 22:38.980
And so that project, that Patrushev project,

22:38.980 --> 22:42.220
which we see him expressing again and again,

22:42.220 --> 22:43.900
he speaks about it publicly.

22:43.900 --> 22:48.900
It's not something that we need to go looking for a quest,

22:49.780 --> 22:51.380
the secret, we can't find it.

22:51.380 --> 22:52.500
What are they thinking?

22:52.500 --> 22:54.780
It's right there in front of our face.

22:54.780 --> 22:57.660
And Putin has spoken the same way for a long time.

22:57.660 --> 23:00.820
People point to the 2007 speech

23:00.820 --> 23:03.580
at the Munich Security Conference that Putin delivered.

23:03.580 --> 23:06.980
And certainly your listeners could use a snippet or two

23:06.980 --> 23:10.020
of that just like they could use a couple of quotes

23:10.020 --> 23:13.980
from Patrushev to contextualize what we're talking about.

23:13.980 --> 23:17.780
But it predates the 2007 Munich speech,

23:17.780 --> 23:22.780
the reaction to Ukraine's uprising in 2004,

23:23.740 --> 23:28.660
attempt to steal the election inside Ukraine,

23:28.660 --> 23:32.420
which the Ukrainian people rose up valiantly against

23:32.420 --> 23:35.020
and risked their lives and overturned.

23:35.020 --> 23:37.780
So there were public statements from Putin already

23:37.780 --> 23:41.380
back then, the statements about Khodorkovsky in 2003

23:41.380 --> 23:44.100
when he was arrested and expropriated.

23:44.100 --> 23:47.660
This is a long-standing psychological,

23:48.660 --> 23:51.180
deeply psychological issue,

23:51.180 --> 23:53.820
which is about managing Russian power in the world,

23:53.820 --> 23:56.020
as I was saying, the gap with the West,

23:56.020 --> 23:59.180
but has this further dimension of feeling like losers

23:59.180 --> 24:01.060
and wanting to reverse that.

24:01.060 --> 24:03.580
That's their life experience.

24:03.580 --> 24:08.060
Abizhine, so there's that resentment that fuels

24:08.060 --> 24:13.060
this narrative, fuels this geopolitics and internal policy.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.860
But so resentment is behind some of the worst things

24:16.860 --> 24:19.260
that have ever been done in human history.

24:19.260 --> 24:22.580
Hitler was probably fueled by resentment.

24:22.580 --> 24:26.020
So resentment is a really powerful force, yes.

24:26.020 --> 24:30.260
Just to maybe not push back,

24:30.260 --> 24:33.300
but to give fuller context on the West.

24:34.220 --> 24:39.220
There's a narrative from Putin's Russia

24:39.460 --> 24:42.220
that the West is somehow an enemy.

24:42.220 --> 24:44.340
You position everything against the West.

24:45.180 --> 24:47.900
But is there a degree and to what degree

24:47.900 --> 24:50.860
is the West willing to feed that narrative?

24:50.860 --> 24:53.980
That it's also convenient for the West to have an enemy.

24:53.980 --> 24:56.740
It seems like in the place, in the span,

24:58.260 --> 25:00.580
it seems like in geopolitics,

25:00.580 --> 25:05.580
having an enemy is useful for forming a narrative.

25:06.380 --> 25:09.860
Now, having an enemy for the basic respect of humanity

25:09.860 --> 25:12.980
is not good, but in terms of maintaining power,

25:12.980 --> 25:15.580
if you're a leader in a game of geopolitics,

25:15.580 --> 25:18.580
it seems to be good to have an enemy.

25:18.580 --> 25:21.700
It seems to be good to have something like a Cold War.

25:21.700 --> 25:23.460
We can always point your finger and say,

25:23.460 --> 25:27.220
all our actions are fighting this evil,

25:27.220 --> 25:28.540
whatever that evil is.

25:28.580 --> 25:32.260
It could be like with George W. Bush, the war on terror.

25:32.260 --> 25:33.660
Terrorism is this evil.

25:33.660 --> 25:35.420
You can always point at something.

25:35.420 --> 25:38.100
So you've made it seem that the West is trying.

25:38.100 --> 25:39.740
There's a lot of forces within the West

25:39.740 --> 25:42.660
that are trying to reach out a friendly hand,

25:42.660 --> 25:46.580
trying to help, sending money, sending compassion,

25:46.580 --> 25:48.020
trying to sort of...

25:48.020 --> 25:51.100
Trying to integrate Russia into global institutions.

25:51.100 --> 25:51.940
Exactly.

25:51.940 --> 25:55.180
Which was a longstanding multi-decade effort

25:55.180 --> 25:58.500
across multiple countries and multiple administrations

25:58.500 --> 25:59.660
in those countries.

25:59.660 --> 26:02.100
But is there also warmongers on the West?

26:02.100 --> 26:04.420
Of course, Lex, of course you're right about that,

26:04.420 --> 26:06.100
but let's put it this way.

26:06.100 --> 26:08.940
People talk about the Cold War,

26:08.940 --> 26:11.860
and they're usually looking to assign blame

26:11.860 --> 26:15.180
for the Cold War as if it's some kind of mistake,

26:15.180 --> 26:18.900
a misunderstanding or a search for an enemy

26:18.900 --> 26:23.100
that was convenient to rally domestic politics.

26:23.100 --> 26:28.100
So Lex, there's a coup in Czechoslovakia

26:28.140 --> 26:32.860
and somebody installs a communist regime in February 1948.

26:33.740 --> 26:36.700
No reaction to that, that's just okay.

26:36.700 --> 26:39.100
There's a blockade of Berlin.

26:39.100 --> 26:40.700
Is that cool by you?

26:40.700 --> 26:44.380
Where they try to strangle West Berlin

26:44.380 --> 26:46.540
so that they can swallow West Berlin

26:46.540 --> 26:48.140
and add it to East Berlin.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.140
You cool with that?

26:50.300 --> 26:54.740
How about Korean War, invasion of North Korea,

26:54.740 --> 26:57.140
invasion of South Korea by North Korea?

26:57.140 --> 26:58.980
You cool with that?

26:58.980 --> 27:01.700
How about the murders and the show trials

27:01.700 --> 27:05.260
up and down Eastern Europe in the late 40s

27:05.260 --> 27:08.100
after the imposition of the clone regimes?

27:08.100 --> 27:09.820
You good with that?

27:09.820 --> 27:12.340
Yeah, it's very convenient to have an enemy.

27:12.340 --> 27:15.260
I agree with you, but you know,

27:15.260 --> 27:17.180
there was some actions, Lex.

27:17.180 --> 27:19.900
There was some threats to people's freedom.

27:19.900 --> 27:21.900
There was some invasions.

27:21.900 --> 27:25.980
There was some aggression and violence on a mass scale,

27:25.980 --> 27:28.660
like collectivization of Eastern Europe.

27:28.660 --> 27:30.660
We could go on, Lex, with the examples.

27:30.660 --> 27:33.140
I'm just giving a few of them.

27:33.140 --> 27:36.100
And so the Cold War was not a mistake.

27:36.100 --> 27:38.540
It was not a misunderstanding.

27:38.540 --> 27:41.380
We don't have to blame someone for the Cold War.

27:41.380 --> 27:44.060
We have to give credit for the Cold War.

27:44.060 --> 27:47.660
The Truman administration deserves credit

27:47.660 --> 27:50.620
for standing up to Stalin's regime,

27:50.620 --> 27:53.420
for standing up to these actions,

27:53.420 --> 27:57.060
for saying, yeah, we're not just going to take this.

27:57.060 --> 27:59.060
We're not going to let this go on.

27:59.060 --> 28:02.700
We're not going to let this expand to further territories.

28:02.700 --> 28:05.020
We're going to create the NATO alliance,

28:05.020 --> 28:08.620
and we're going to rally democratic,

28:08.620 --> 28:12.180
liberal regimes to stand up to this illiberalism,

28:12.180 --> 28:14.460
this violence, and this aggression.

28:14.460 --> 28:19.180
And so, yeah, Lex, it's always convenient to have an enemy,

28:19.180 --> 28:20.740
but there was an enemy.

28:21.580 --> 28:24.180
Nikolai Leonov, who recently died,

28:24.180 --> 28:28.900
he died in April, 2022, and he had a major funeral.

28:28.900 --> 28:33.900
He was the last head analyst of the Soviet KGB.

28:36.380 --> 28:39.300
And Leonov is one of the most important figures

28:39.300 --> 28:41.740
for understanding the Soviet collapse.

28:41.740 --> 28:45.140
And he has the best memoir on the Soviet collapse,

28:45.140 --> 28:48.060
which is known in Russian as Lika Letia.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.980
You will understand that,

28:50.980 --> 28:55.980
and you'll help your podcast listeners understand.

28:56.140 --> 28:59.180
There's a singularity to that kind of expression,

28:59.180 --> 29:00.820
Lika Letia.

29:00.820 --> 29:02.300
Leonov just died.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.940
But one of the things, and in fact,

29:04.940 --> 29:09.580
the people who were supposedly arrested by Putin

29:09.580 --> 29:12.100
as scapegoats for the Ukraine war,

29:12.100 --> 29:14.860
the main one, Sergei Beseda,

29:14.900 --> 29:19.660
gave the eulogy at Leonov's funeral in April, 2022,

29:19.660 --> 29:22.220
showing that it's a lie that all of these people

29:22.220 --> 29:23.780
have been arrested and purged

29:23.780 --> 29:27.540
and another nonsense in social media.

29:27.540 --> 29:29.540
But to get back to what Leonov said

29:29.540 --> 29:31.420
and get back to your enemy point,

29:32.300 --> 29:35.740
Leonov said, you know, the West spent all this time

29:35.740 --> 29:39.060
blackening the image of the Soviet Union.

29:39.060 --> 29:44.020
All these resources and propaganda and covert operations

29:44.020 --> 29:45.820
to blacken the Soviet image.

29:45.820 --> 29:48.180
And they did, Lex, the West did do that.

29:48.180 --> 29:50.660
And then Leonov wrote in the next sentence,

29:50.660 --> 29:51.700
and you know what?

29:51.700 --> 29:54.740
We gave them a lot of material to work with

29:54.740 --> 29:57.260
to blacken our image.

29:57.260 --> 30:02.260
Yeah, so you're saying a kind of sobering reality,

30:02.380 --> 30:05.140
which it is possible to some degree to draw a line

30:05.140 --> 30:07.620
between the good guys and the bad guys.

30:07.620 --> 30:10.060
Freedom is better than unfreedom, Lex.

30:11.020 --> 30:12.860
It's a lot better than unfreedom.

30:12.860 --> 30:15.700
And a guy like you understands that really well.

30:15.700 --> 30:18.980
Well, so yes, but those are all, you know,

30:18.980 --> 30:21.340
there's words like justice, freedom.

30:24.980 --> 30:26.220
What else?

30:26.220 --> 30:27.060
Love.

30:27.060 --> 30:31.380
You can use a lot of words that Hitler himself used

30:31.380 --> 30:36.300
to describe why he is actually creating a better world

30:36.300 --> 30:37.900
than those he's fighting.

30:37.900 --> 30:39.340
So some of it is propaganda.

30:39.340 --> 30:41.340
The question is on the ground,

30:41.340 --> 30:43.420
what is actually increasing the amount of freedom

30:43.420 --> 30:44.260
in the world?

30:44.260 --> 30:45.900
Institution, Lex, right?

30:45.900 --> 30:48.540
We're not talking about propaganda here.

30:48.540 --> 30:50.860
When we use words like freedom,

30:50.860 --> 30:53.380
we're talking about rule of law.

30:53.380 --> 30:55.940
We're talking about protection of civil liberties.

30:55.940 --> 30:59.020
We're talking about protection of private property.

30:59.020 --> 31:01.260
We're talking about an independent

31:01.260 --> 31:03.500
and well-funded judiciary.

31:03.500 --> 31:07.260
We're talking about an impartial, non-corrupt,

31:07.260 --> 31:09.380
competent civil service.

31:09.380 --> 31:11.620
We're talking about separation of powers

31:11.620 --> 31:14.700
where the executive branch's power is limited,

31:14.700 --> 31:17.260
usually by an elected parliament.

31:17.260 --> 31:19.900
In fact, yes, let's talk about elections.

31:21.020 --> 31:22.980
Let's talk about freedom of speech

31:22.980 --> 31:25.260
and freedom of the public sphere.

31:25.260 --> 31:28.060
We're not talking about freedom as a slogan here.

31:28.060 --> 31:31.700
We're talking about a huge array of institutions

31:31.700 --> 31:35.340
and practices and norms ultimately, right?

31:35.340 --> 31:39.180
And if they exist, you know, and you live under them.

31:39.180 --> 31:40.460
And if they don't exist,

31:40.460 --> 31:43.420
you fully understand that as well, right?

31:43.420 --> 31:48.420
Ukraine was a flawed democracy before Russia invaded.

31:50.500 --> 31:55.260
It's utterly corrupt, many ways dysfunctional,

31:55.260 --> 31:58.540
especially the elites were dysfunctional.

31:58.540 --> 32:02.540
The gas industry in Ukraine was absolutely terrible

32:02.540 --> 32:04.660
because of the corruption that it generated,

32:04.660 --> 32:06.700
the oligarch problem,

32:06.700 --> 32:10.060
a handful of people stealing the state resources,

32:10.060 --> 32:13.980
and yet Ukraine had an open public sphere

32:13.980 --> 32:16.620
and it had a parliament that functioned.

32:16.620 --> 32:21.620
And so despite its flaws, it was still a democracy.

32:23.500 --> 32:26.620
The regime in Moscow, you can't say that, Lex.

32:27.580 --> 32:30.540
It's not a comparable regime to Ukraine.

32:30.540 --> 32:32.940
You could say, oh, well, there are oligarchs in Ukraine

32:32.940 --> 32:34.540
and there are oligarchs in Russia.

32:34.540 --> 32:36.020
There's corruption in Ukraine.

32:36.020 --> 32:37.260
There's corruption in Russia.

32:37.260 --> 32:39.340
So really, what's the big difference?

32:39.340 --> 32:43.060
The answer is, well, Ukraine had the open public sphere.

32:43.060 --> 32:44.380
Ukraine had a real parliament.

32:44.380 --> 32:47.740
Can you call Russia's Duma a real parliament?

32:47.740 --> 32:49.460
I don't think so.

32:49.460 --> 32:50.980
I don't think you can.

32:50.980 --> 32:54.140
Can you say that there were any checks whatsoever

32:54.140 --> 32:57.340
on the executive branch in Russia?

32:57.340 --> 32:59.700
Can you say that the Russian judiciary

32:59.700 --> 33:04.700
had any independence or really full level of competence,

33:05.700 --> 33:08.220
even compared to the Ukrainian judiciary,

33:08.220 --> 33:09.900
which was nothing to brag about?

33:09.900 --> 33:11.860
No, you can't say that, Lex.

33:11.860 --> 33:16.740
So we can differentiate between the very flawed,

33:16.740 --> 33:21.740
corrupt, oligarchic democracy in Ukraine

33:21.860 --> 33:26.180
and the very corrupt, oligarchic autocracy in Russia.

33:26.180 --> 33:28.980
I think that's a fair distinction.

33:28.980 --> 33:32.060
Yeah, we should say that Russia and Ukraine

33:32.060 --> 33:34.060
have the great honor of being the number one

33:34.220 --> 33:37.020
and the number two most corrupt nations in Europe

33:37.020 --> 33:38.620
by many measures.

33:38.620 --> 33:40.220
But there is a fundamental difference,

33:40.220 --> 33:41.980
as you were highlighting.

33:41.980 --> 33:44.620
Russia is a corrupt autocracy.

33:44.620 --> 33:48.020
Ukraine, we can say, is a corrupt democracy.

33:48.020 --> 33:52.420
And to that level, there's a fundamental difference.

33:53.660 --> 33:57.700
Ukraine is not murdering its own journalists

33:57.700 --> 33:59.700
in systematic fashion.

33:59.700 --> 34:03.380
If journalists are killed in Ukraine, it's a tragedy.

34:03.380 --> 34:05.180
If journalists are killed in Russia

34:05.180 --> 34:07.180
or Russian journalists are killed abroad,

34:07.180 --> 34:08.660
it's regime policy.

34:08.660 --> 34:11.500
And the degree to which a nation is authoritarian

34:12.500 --> 34:15.900
means that it's suffocating its own spirit,

34:15.900 --> 34:19.220
its capacity to flourish.

34:19.220 --> 34:24.220
We're not just talking about sort of the freedom

34:24.980 --> 34:26.820
of the press, those kinds of things,

34:26.820 --> 34:30.820
but basically all industries get suffocated

34:30.860 --> 34:33.300
and you're no longer being able to,

34:33.300 --> 34:36.060
yeah, flourish as a nation, grow the production,

34:36.060 --> 34:38.260
the GDP, the scientists, the art, the culture,

34:38.260 --> 34:39.180
all those kinds of things.

34:39.180 --> 34:40.780
Yes, Lex, you're absolutely right.

34:40.780 --> 34:45.020
And so before the invasion, the full-blown invasion

34:45.020 --> 34:48.220
of February 2022 into Ukraine, because as you know,

34:48.220 --> 34:52.060
the war has been going on for many years at a lower level

34:52.060 --> 34:54.260
compared to what it is these days,

34:54.260 --> 34:57.340
but still a tragic war with many deaths

34:57.340 --> 35:00.340
prior to February 2022.

35:00.380 --> 35:03.180
Before this latest war, we could have said

35:03.180 --> 35:07.420
that the greatest victims of the Putin regime are Russian,

35:07.420 --> 35:11.460
domestic, that the people who are suffering the most

35:11.460 --> 35:14.780
from the Putin regime are not sitting here

35:14.780 --> 35:18.860
in New York City, but in fact are sitting there in Russia.

35:18.860 --> 35:21.900
Now, of course, with the invasion of Ukraine

35:21.900 --> 35:26.900
and really the atrocities that have been well-documented

35:27.900 --> 35:30.420
and more are being investigated,

35:31.740 --> 35:34.980
we can't easily say anymore that Russians

35:34.980 --> 35:37.300
are the greatest victims of the Putin regime.

35:38.140 --> 35:43.140
But in ways other than bombing and murdering civilians,

35:43.180 --> 35:46.800
children, mothers, grandmothers, grandfathers,

35:49.220 --> 35:52.460
after you include that, then of course,

35:52.460 --> 35:55.260
the larger number of victims of the Putin regime

35:55.260 --> 35:57.980
are not Ukrainians, but ultimately Russians,

35:57.980 --> 36:00.660
and there's how many of them now that have fled.

36:02.140 --> 36:07.060
So your powerful, precise, rigorous words

36:07.060 --> 36:11.780
are standing in a stark contrast, I would say,

36:11.780 --> 36:15.100
to my very recent conversation with Oliver Stone.

36:15.100 --> 36:17.460
Now, I would love you to elaborate

36:17.460 --> 36:20.740
to this agreement you have here with his words

36:20.740 --> 36:24.500
and maybe words of people like John Mearsheimer

36:25.460 --> 36:29.540
the idea is that Putin's hand in this invasion of 2022

36:29.540 --> 36:34.140
was forced by the expansion of NATO,

36:34.140 --> 36:38.420
the imperialist imperative of the United States

36:38.420 --> 36:41.860
and the NATO forces.

36:43.740 --> 36:48.460
You disagree with this point in terms of placing the blame

36:48.460 --> 36:53.100
somehow on the invasion on forces larger

36:53.100 --> 36:55.380
than the particular two nations involved,

36:55.380 --> 36:59.620
but more on the geopolitics of the world

36:59.620 --> 37:02.180
that's driven by the most powerful military nation

37:02.180 --> 37:04.340
in the world, which is the United States.

37:04.340 --> 37:09.340
Yeah, Lex, so let's imagine that a tragedy's happened here

37:09.720 --> 37:12.420
in New York and a woman got raped.

37:13.980 --> 37:17.780
We know the perpetrator, they go to trial,

37:17.780 --> 37:20.780
and Oliver Stone gets up and says, you know what?

37:20.780 --> 37:23.100
The woman was wearing a short skirt

37:23.980 --> 37:28.820
and there was no option but for the rapist to rape her.

37:28.820 --> 37:31.100
The woman was wearing lipstick

37:32.000 --> 37:35.180
or the woman was applying for NATO membership

37:35.180 --> 37:36.860
and just had to be raped.

37:39.020 --> 37:42.520
Didn't want to rape her, but was compelled

37:42.520 --> 37:45.620
because of what she was doing and what she looked like

37:45.620 --> 37:47.900
and the clothes she was wearing

37:47.900 --> 37:51.620
and the alliances that she was under international law

37:51.620 --> 37:54.980
signed by Moscow, all the treaties

37:54.980 --> 37:57.180
that sovereign countries get to choose

37:57.180 --> 37:59.340
whatever alliance they belong to.

38:00.500 --> 38:04.820
A treaties that the UN Charter signed by Russia,

38:04.820 --> 38:09.820
Soviet Union, the 1975 Helsinki agreement

38:11.740 --> 38:13.300
signed by the Soviet Union,

38:13.300 --> 38:16.340
the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe

38:16.340 --> 38:17.700
signed by the Soviet Union,

38:18.500 --> 38:21.300
the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act

38:21.300 --> 38:24.500
signed by the Russian government, the post-Soviet Russia.

38:24.500 --> 38:29.500
All of those documents signed by either the Soviet regime

38:30.580 --> 38:33.620
or the Russian regime, which is the legally recognized

38:33.620 --> 38:38.460
international inheritor, successor of the Soviet state,

38:38.460 --> 38:40.460
all of those agreements are still in force

38:40.460 --> 38:44.900
and all of them say that countries are sovereign

38:44.900 --> 38:48.340
and can freely choose their foreign policy

38:48.340 --> 38:50.860
and what alliances they want to join.

38:50.860 --> 38:52.660
Let's even go farther than that.

38:52.660 --> 38:55.340
I mean, you don't have to go farther than that,

38:55.340 --> 38:58.020
but let's go farther than that, Lex.

38:58.020 --> 39:02.940
Is an autocratic repressive regime that invades its neighbors

39:02.940 --> 39:04.820
in the name of its own security

39:04.820 --> 39:07.040
something new in Russian history?

39:07.040 --> 39:09.000
Did we not see this before?

39:09.000 --> 39:13.580
Is this, does this not predate NATO expansion?

39:13.580 --> 39:17.180
Does this not predate the existence of NATO?

39:17.180 --> 39:20.140
Would Oliver Stone sit here in this chair and say to you,

39:20.140 --> 39:25.140
you know, they had to impose serfdom in the 17th century

39:25.620 --> 39:27.760
because NATO expanded.

39:27.760 --> 39:30.100
They had no choice, their hands were tied.

39:30.100 --> 39:33.560
They were compelled to treat their own population

39:33.560 --> 39:37.600
like slaves because, you know, NATO expanded.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.660
I mean, I could go on through the examples

39:39.700 --> 39:43.540
of Russian history that predate the existence,

39:43.540 --> 39:46.140
let alone the expansion of NATO,

39:46.140 --> 39:51.140
where you have behavior, policies, actions,

39:51.700 --> 39:55.740
very similar to what we see now from the Kremlin.

39:55.740 --> 40:00.020
And you can't explain those by NATO expansion, can you?

40:00.020 --> 40:03.680
And so that argument doesn't wash for me

40:03.680 --> 40:07.700
because I have a pattern here that predates NATO expansion.

40:07.700 --> 40:09.860
I have international agreements,

40:09.860 --> 40:13.740
founding documents signed by the Kremlin

40:13.740 --> 40:16.100
over many, many decades,

40:16.100 --> 40:18.580
acknowledging the freedom of countries

40:18.580 --> 40:20.620
to choose their alliances.

40:20.620 --> 40:24.220
And then I have this problem where when you rape somebody,

40:24.220 --> 40:26.980
it's not because they're wearing a short skirt,

40:26.980 --> 40:29.320
it's because you have raped them.

40:32.460 --> 40:35.220
You've committed a criminal act, Lex.

40:36.220 --> 40:38.620
I think there's a lot of people listening to this

40:38.620 --> 40:40.980
that will agree to the emotion,

40:40.980 --> 40:43.540
the power and the spirit of this metaphor.

40:43.540 --> 40:48.580
I was struggling to think how to dance within this metaphor

40:48.580 --> 40:51.720
because it feels like it wasn't precisely the right one,

40:51.720 --> 40:53.740
but I think that it captures the spirit.

40:55.180 --> 40:56.700
I'm not suggesting, Lex,

40:56.700 --> 40:58.980
that everything the West has done

40:59.900 --> 41:03.040
has been honorable or intelligent.

41:03.960 --> 41:06.300
Fortunately, we live in a democracy,

41:06.300 --> 41:10.200
we live in liberal regimes, we live under rule of law,

41:10.200 --> 41:13.480
liberal in the classical sense of rule of law,

41:13.480 --> 41:15.580
not liberal in the leftist sense.

41:17.120 --> 41:20.440
We live in places like that and we can criticize ourselves

41:20.440 --> 41:23.000
and we can criticize the mistakes that we made

41:23.000 --> 41:26.860
or the policy choices or the inactions that were taken.

41:26.860 --> 41:30.600
And there are a whole lot of things to answer for.

41:31.120 --> 41:36.120
And you can now discuss the ones that are your favorites,

41:36.800 --> 41:41.600
the dishonor or the mistakes, and I could discuss mine,

41:41.600 --> 41:44.940
and we could spend the whole rest of our meeting today

41:44.940 --> 41:47.280
discussing the West's mistakes and problems.

41:47.280 --> 41:49.680
And we won't end up in prison for it.

41:49.680 --> 41:53.520
Yeah, Lex, and so I'm thankful for that.

41:53.520 --> 41:55.680
And I'm thankful that people may disagree

41:55.680 --> 41:57.160
and that people make the argument

41:57.160 --> 41:59.640
that NATO expansion is to blame.

41:59.960 --> 42:02.840
But you see, I'm countering two arguments here.

42:02.840 --> 42:04.960
I'm countering one argument,

42:04.960 --> 42:08.700
which is very deeply popular, pervasive,

42:08.700 --> 42:13.200
about how Russia has this cultural tendency to aggression.

42:13.200 --> 42:16.160
And it can help but invade its neighbors

42:16.160 --> 42:17.640
and it does it again and again.

42:17.640 --> 42:21.000
And it's eternal Russian imperialism

42:21.000 --> 42:23.080
and you have to watch out for it.

42:23.080 --> 42:26.080
This very popular argument in the Baltic States,

42:26.080 --> 42:28.480
it's really popular in Warsaw,

42:28.480 --> 42:31.720
it's really popular with the liberal interventionists,

42:31.720 --> 42:34.360
and it's very, very popular with those

42:34.360 --> 42:36.640
who were part of the Iraq war squad

42:36.640 --> 42:38.200
that got us into that mess.

42:39.080 --> 42:42.360
So I'm against that, and the reason I'm against it

42:42.360 --> 42:44.760
is because it's not true, it's empirically false.

42:44.760 --> 42:47.560
There is no cultural trait,

42:47.560 --> 42:50.560
inherent tendency for Russia to be aggressive.

42:50.560 --> 42:53.120
It's a strategic choice that they make.

42:53.120 --> 42:55.080
Every time it's a choice made,

42:55.080 --> 42:56.520
it's not some kind of momentum.

42:56.520 --> 42:59.520
Every time it's a choice that we should judge

42:59.520 --> 43:01.280
for the choice that it is for the decision.

43:01.280 --> 43:03.080
And therefore they could make different choices.

43:03.080 --> 43:06.000
They could say, we don't have to stand up to the West.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.800
We don't have the capabilities to do that.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.580
We can still be a great country.

43:10.580 --> 43:13.200
We can still be a civilization unto itself.

43:13.200 --> 43:15.280
We can still be Russia.

43:15.280 --> 43:19.160
We can still worship in Orthodox cathedrals.

43:19.160 --> 43:21.960
We can still be ourselves,

43:21.960 --> 43:25.960
but we don't have to pursue this chimerical pursuit,

43:25.960 --> 43:29.280
this elusive quest to stand up to the West

43:29.280 --> 43:31.920
and be in the first ranks of powers.

43:31.920 --> 43:33.440
So I'm countering that argument.

43:33.440 --> 43:36.820
I'm saying it's perpetual geopolitics.

43:36.820 --> 43:40.760
It's a geopolitical choice rising out of this dilemma

43:40.760 --> 43:44.960
of the mismatch between aspirations and capabilities.

43:44.960 --> 43:48.000
It's not eternal Russian imperialism.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.020
And I'm also countering the other argument here, Lex,

43:51.020 --> 43:53.880
which is to say that it's the West's fault.

43:53.920 --> 43:56.200
It's Western imperialism.

43:56.200 --> 43:57.980
I very popular on the left,

43:57.980 --> 44:00.600
very popular with realist scholars,

44:00.600 --> 44:02.360
very popular with some of the people

44:02.360 --> 44:04.920
recently on your podcast.

44:04.920 --> 44:08.440
And so it's neither eternal Russian imperialism

44:08.440 --> 44:11.280
nor is it Western imperialism, right?

44:11.280 --> 44:14.720
The mere fact that the West is stronger than Russia

44:14.720 --> 44:17.920
is not a crime on the part of the West.

44:17.920 --> 44:21.400
It's not a crime that countries voluntarily

44:21.400 --> 44:24.320
wanna join the West that beg to get in,

44:24.320 --> 44:29.320
either the EU or NATO or other bilateral alliances

44:29.920 --> 44:31.640
or other trade agreements.

44:31.640 --> 44:34.520
Those are voluntarily entered into,

44:34.520 --> 44:35.900
and that's not criminal.

44:35.900 --> 44:39.220
If the West sphere of influence, which is open,

44:39.220 --> 44:41.620
an open sphere of influence,

44:41.620 --> 44:43.880
which as I say, people voluntarily join,

44:43.880 --> 44:46.240
if that expands, that's not a crime,

44:46.240 --> 44:49.780
nor is that a threat to Russia, ipso facto, right?

44:49.780 --> 44:52.060
NATO is a defensive alliance,

44:52.060 --> 44:54.100
and the countries that are largely pacifist

44:54.100 --> 44:55.700
who are members of NATO.

44:55.700 --> 44:57.380
And NATO doesn't attack,

44:57.380 --> 45:00.740
it defends members if they are attacked.

45:00.740 --> 45:04.440
And so the idea that Ukraine, which had the legal right,

45:04.440 --> 45:08.380
might wanna join NATO in the EU,

45:08.380 --> 45:11.020
which was not gonna happen in our lifetimes

45:11.020 --> 45:13.420
and was not a direct threat to the Putin regime

45:13.420 --> 45:18.420
since the Western countries that make up the EU and NATO

45:20.100 --> 45:24.340
decided that Ukraine was not ready for membership,

45:24.340 --> 45:26.780
there was no consensus, it was not gonna happen,

45:26.780 --> 45:31.420
but it's Ukraine's free choice to express that desire.

45:31.420 --> 45:34.300
And if your government is elected by your people,

45:34.300 --> 45:38.980
freely elected, meaning you can unelect that government

45:38.980 --> 45:40.660
in the next election,

45:40.660 --> 45:43.460
and that government makes foreign policy choices

45:43.460 --> 45:46.940
on the basis of its perceived interests,

45:46.940 --> 45:50.180
that's not a crime, Lex, that's not a provocation,

45:50.180 --> 45:52.620
that's not something that compels the leader

45:52.620 --> 45:55.920
of another country to invade you, right?

45:55.920 --> 45:59.060
That is legal under international law,

45:59.060 --> 46:02.060
and it's also a realist fact of life.

46:02.060 --> 46:06.740
The realists like to tell you that Russia here

46:06.740 --> 46:10.460
was disrespected, Russia's interests were not taken

46:10.460 --> 46:12.300
into account, et cetera, et cetera,

46:12.300 --> 46:15.100
but the real world works in such a way

46:15.140 --> 46:19.060
that treaties matter, that international law matters,

46:19.060 --> 46:21.380
that's why people like me were not in favor

46:21.380 --> 46:25.820
of the US 2003 invasion of Iraq, Lex,

46:25.820 --> 46:29.260
because it wasn't legal, in addition to the fact

46:29.260 --> 46:31.120
that we thought it might backfire.

46:32.060 --> 46:34.580
But you know, Lex, like I said,

46:34.580 --> 46:36.260
there are a lot of things about the West

46:36.260 --> 46:40.860
that we ought to criticize as citizens and we do criticize,

46:41.100 --> 46:45.820
but we have to be clear about where responsibility lies

46:45.820 --> 46:48.780
in these events that we're talking about today.

46:48.780 --> 46:51.940
So you get into trouble, it's largely erroneous

46:51.940 --> 46:56.140
to think about both the West or the United States

46:56.140 --> 46:58.500
from an imperialist perspective and Russia

46:58.500 --> 47:01.420
from an imperialist perspective, it's better,

47:01.420 --> 47:04.980
clearer to think about each individual aggressive decision

47:04.980 --> 47:07.380
on its own as a choice that was made.

47:07.380 --> 47:10.580
So let's talk about the most recent choice,

47:10.580 --> 47:15.580
made by Vladimir Putin, the choice to invade Ukraine

47:16.860 --> 47:18.900
or to escalate the invasion of Ukraine

47:18.900 --> 47:21.780
on February 24th, 2022.

47:22.780 --> 47:26.820
Now we're a few months removed from that decision,

47:26.820 --> 47:30.580
initial decision, why do you think he did it?

47:30.580 --> 47:35.580
What are the errors in understanding the situation

47:35.580 --> 47:40.580
and calculating the outcomes and everything else

47:40.620 --> 47:42.680
about this decision in your view?

47:44.820 --> 47:48.180
Yeah, Lex, when a war doesn't go well,

47:48.180 --> 47:52.420
it looks like lunacy to have launched it in the first place.

47:52.420 --> 47:54.140
Does it ever go well?

47:54.140 --> 47:56.860
War never goes according to plan.

47:56.860 --> 47:59.940
All war is based upon miscalculation,

47:59.940 --> 48:03.820
but not everybody is punished for their miscalculation.

48:03.820 --> 48:07.660
All aggressive war we're talking about, not defensive war,

48:07.660 --> 48:10.180
is based upon miscalculation.

48:10.180 --> 48:12.940
But you can adjust, you can recalibrate.

48:14.260 --> 48:15.740
When you're driving down the road

48:15.740 --> 48:18.420
and that very annoying voice is telling you

48:18.420 --> 48:23.300
in a thousand feet, make a right,

48:23.300 --> 48:26.380
and you fail to make a right, it recalibrates, right?

48:26.380 --> 48:30.620
It tells you, okay, now go turn around or U-turn

48:30.620 --> 48:31.900
or make a left.

48:31.900 --> 48:33.980
It doesn't say you're an idiot and turn around

48:33.980 --> 48:37.020
and make a U-turn, but it does recalibrate.

48:37.020 --> 48:38.540
So you can miscalculate,

48:38.540 --> 48:41.180
and the problem is not the miscalculation usually,

48:41.180 --> 48:45.460
it's the failure to do that adjustment, right?

48:45.460 --> 48:49.140
People I know who are hedge fund traders,

48:50.340 --> 48:52.860
I asked them, you know, what's your favorite trade?

48:52.860 --> 48:55.260
And the line from them all, and this is a cliche,

48:55.260 --> 48:58.940
is my favorite trade is when I made a mistake

48:58.940 --> 49:02.660
but I got out early before all the carnage.

49:02.660 --> 49:04.820
So their favorite trade is not when they made

49:04.820 --> 49:08.700
some brilliant choice, but it's when they miscalculated

49:08.700 --> 49:12.100
but they reduce the consequences of their miscalculation

49:12.100 --> 49:14.820
by recalibrating quickly, right?

49:14.820 --> 49:16.740
So let's talk about the calculation

49:16.740 --> 49:19.380
and miscalculation of February.

49:19.380 --> 49:21.780
Let's imagine, Lex, that you've been getting away

49:21.780 --> 49:22.700
with murder.

49:23.540 --> 49:26.460
I don't mean murder in a figurative sense.

49:26.460 --> 49:28.780
I mean you've been murdering people.

49:29.620 --> 49:30.820
You've been murdering them domestically,

49:30.820 --> 49:33.820
and you've been murdering them all across Europe,

49:33.820 --> 49:37.540
and you've been murdering them not just with, for example,

49:38.820 --> 49:41.860
a car accident, a staged car accident,

49:41.860 --> 49:44.500
or using a handgun.

49:44.500 --> 49:46.220
You use Novichok,

49:47.700 --> 49:51.860
or you use some other internationally outlawed

49:51.860 --> 49:53.100
chemical weapon.

49:54.620 --> 49:56.660
And let's imagine that you did it

49:56.660 --> 49:58.060
and nothing happened to you.

49:58.780 --> 50:01.380
It wasn't like you were removed from power.

50:01.380 --> 50:04.060
It wasn't like you paid a personal price.

50:04.060 --> 50:06.940
Sure, maybe there was some sanctions on your economy,

50:06.940 --> 50:09.660
but you didn't pay the price of those sanctions.

50:09.660 --> 50:12.660
Little people paid the price of those sanctions.

50:12.660 --> 50:15.820
Other people in your country paid the price.

50:15.820 --> 50:19.620
Let's imagine not only were you murdering people literally,

50:19.620 --> 50:22.300
but you decided to

50:23.860 --> 50:27.140
entice the idiotic ruler of Georgia

50:28.140 --> 50:32.140
into a provocation that you could then invade the country.

50:33.500 --> 50:34.900
And you invaded the country,

50:34.900 --> 50:37.300
and you bit off these territories,

50:37.300 --> 50:39.780
Abkhazia and South Ossetia,

50:39.780 --> 50:41.580
and what price did you pay for that?

50:42.580 --> 50:44.660
And then you decided, you know,

50:44.660 --> 50:46.620
I think I'll now invade Crimea,

50:46.620 --> 50:49.100
and forcibly annex Crimea,

50:49.100 --> 50:52.940
and I'll instigate an insurrection in the Donbas,

50:52.940 --> 50:55.900
in Eastern Ukraine, in Luhansk.

50:56.060 --> 50:58.020
Let's imagine you did all that,

50:58.020 --> 51:00.220
and then you had to stick out your wrist

51:00.220 --> 51:04.300
so that, you know, it could be slapped a couple of times.

51:04.300 --> 51:07.500
And you said, you know, I can pretty much do what I want.

51:08.420 --> 51:10.900
They're putting a sanction here and there,

51:10.900 --> 51:13.020
and they're doing this, and they're doing that,

51:13.020 --> 51:14.420
and you know what?

51:14.420 --> 51:17.380
They're more energy dependent on me than before.

51:17.380 --> 51:20.500
I got better money laundering and reputation services

51:20.500 --> 51:21.860
than anybody has.

51:21.860 --> 51:23.620
Maybe the Middle East and the Chinese

51:23.620 --> 51:26.260
would disagree with you that you have better than them,

51:26.260 --> 51:27.460
but yours are pretty good.

51:27.460 --> 51:31.780
And the Panama Papers get released, revealing

51:31.780 --> 51:34.460
all of your offshoring and your corruption,

51:34.460 --> 51:35.300
and what happens?

51:35.300 --> 51:36.660
Nothing happens, Lex.

51:36.660 --> 51:40.100
So the first and most important consideration here is,

51:40.100 --> 51:41.940
in your own mind,

51:41.940 --> 51:45.540
you've been getting away with murder, literally,

51:45.540 --> 51:46.820
as well as figuratively,

51:46.820 --> 51:48.140
and you think, you know,

51:48.140 --> 51:51.340
I probably can do something again and get away with it.

51:52.260 --> 51:55.900
And so the failure to respond at scale,

51:55.900 --> 51:58.540
in fact, the indulgences,

51:58.540 --> 52:01.660
the further dependencies that are introduced,

52:01.660 --> 52:05.460
the illusion that trade is the mechanism

52:05.460 --> 52:08.260
to manage authoritarian regimes.

52:08.260 --> 52:11.100
You know, that great, a German cliche,

52:11.980 --> 52:14.700
a Wandel durch Handel, right?

52:14.700 --> 52:18.500
Change through trade or transformation through trade,

52:18.500 --> 52:22.060
one of Angela Merkel's favorite expressions, right?

52:22.060 --> 52:25.740
You're gonna get the other side to be better

52:26.860 --> 52:31.780
rather than confront them in a Cold War fashion

52:31.780 --> 52:33.700
where you stand up to their aggressions

52:33.700 --> 52:35.220
and you punish them severely

52:35.220 --> 52:37.700
in order to deter further behavior.

52:37.700 --> 52:39.860
So that's the first and most important part

52:39.860 --> 52:41.660
of the calculation miscalculation.

52:41.660 --> 52:43.100
There are a lot of other dimensions.

52:43.100 --> 52:44.860
Can we pause on that really quick?

52:45.820 --> 52:48.340
So this is kind of idea of,

52:48.340 --> 52:50.860
it's okay to crack a few eggs to make an omelet,

52:51.980 --> 52:55.660
which is a more generous description of what you're saying,

52:55.660 --> 53:00.300
that you don't incorporate into the calculation

53:00.300 --> 53:04.060
the amount of human suffering that the decisions cause,

53:04.060 --> 53:08.660
but instead you look at sort of the success

53:08.660 --> 53:11.860
based on some kind of measure for you personally

53:11.860 --> 53:15.460
and for the nation in,

53:15.460 --> 53:17.700
not in terms of in the humanitarian sense,

53:17.700 --> 53:19.780
but in some kind of economic sense

53:19.780 --> 53:22.460
and a power, geopolitical power sense.

53:22.460 --> 53:23.340
Yeah.

53:23.340 --> 53:25.580
You're not sentimental, Lex.

53:25.580 --> 53:26.940
You say to yourself,

53:28.300 --> 53:31.500
the cause of Russian greatness

53:31.500 --> 53:34.060
is greater than any individual life.

53:35.020 --> 53:38.500
Russia being in the first rank of the great powers,

53:38.500 --> 53:43.500
Russia realizing its mission to be a special country

53:44.580 --> 53:46.260
with a special mission in the world,

53:46.260 --> 53:48.260
a civilization onto itself,

53:49.580 --> 53:51.940
the first rank of the great powers,

53:51.940 --> 53:53.940
maybe even the greatest power,

53:53.940 --> 53:58.060
that's worth the price that we have to pay,

53:58.060 --> 54:00.980
especially in other people's lives, right?

54:00.980 --> 54:03.820
We have a lot of literature on the Putin regime,

54:03.820 --> 54:06.700
which talks about the kleptocracy.

54:06.740 --> 54:10.420
The place is a kleptocracy and it is a kleptocracy.

54:11.460 --> 54:15.900
We all can see that and anybody in London

54:15.900 --> 54:19.260
live in the high life servicing this kleptocracy

54:19.260 --> 54:21.740
can testify that it's a kleptocracy

54:21.740 --> 54:23.660
and not only in London, of course,

54:23.660 --> 54:25.940
right here in the United States, in New York.

54:27.140 --> 54:30.860
But you know, it's not only a kleptocracy, Lex.

54:30.860 --> 54:33.940
That was the problem of the Russian studies literature.

54:34.940 --> 54:38.620
It wasn't just about stealing, looting the state.

54:38.620 --> 54:40.980
It was about Russian greatness.

54:40.980 --> 54:44.380
You see those rituals in the Kremlin, right?

54:44.380 --> 54:48.740
In the Grand Kremlin Palace, in the St. George's Hall,

54:48.740 --> 54:51.980
some of the greatest interiors in the world.

54:51.980 --> 54:56.380
And you see award ceremonies and you see marking holidays.

54:56.380 --> 54:58.580
And all of these looters of the state

54:58.580 --> 55:01.380
have their uniforms on with their medals

55:01.460 --> 55:05.620
and someone's given a speech or singing a ballad

55:05.620 --> 55:07.220
and their eyes are moist.

55:08.460 --> 55:12.420
Their eyes are moist because they're thieves and looters?

55:12.420 --> 55:16.940
No, Lex, because they believe in Russian greatness.

55:16.940 --> 55:21.860
They have a deep and fundamental passionate commitment

55:21.860 --> 55:23.940
to the greatness of Russia,

55:23.940 --> 55:26.620
which in unsentimental fashion,

55:26.620 --> 55:28.580
they're all sentimental to the max.

55:28.580 --> 55:31.540
That's why their eyes are moistening,

55:31.540 --> 55:35.420
but they imagine unsentimentally that any sacrifice is okay,

55:35.420 --> 55:38.060
a sacrifice of other people's lives,

55:38.060 --> 55:41.620
a sacrifice of their conscripts in the military,

55:41.620 --> 55:45.900
a sacrifice of Ukrainian women and children and elderly.

55:45.900 --> 55:49.940
That's a small price to pay for those moist eyes

55:49.940 --> 55:53.460
about Russian greatness and Russia's position in the world.

55:53.460 --> 55:56.060
Well, that human thing, that sentimentality

55:56.060 --> 55:57.300
is a thing that can get us in trouble

55:57.300 --> 55:59.100
in the United States as well,

55:59.100 --> 56:02.540
and lead us to wars, illegal wars and so on.

56:02.540 --> 56:05.540
But the United States, there's repercussions

56:05.540 --> 56:08.220
for breaking the law.

56:08.220 --> 56:10.900
You're going to pay for illegal wars in the end.

56:10.900 --> 56:14.460
You're saying that in authoritarian regimes,

56:14.460 --> 56:17.020
this sentimentality can really get out of hand

56:17.020 --> 56:18.940
and you can, by charismatic leaders,

56:18.940 --> 56:22.700
they can take that to manipulate the populace to make,

56:22.700 --> 56:26.380
that in the span of history led to atrocities

56:26.380 --> 56:30.140
and in today's world lead to humanitarian crises.

56:30.140 --> 56:33.300
It's not just a kleptocracy, it's a belief system.

56:33.300 --> 56:35.620
It's passion, it's conviction.

56:37.940 --> 56:41.540
You can call them illusions, you can call them fantasies,

56:41.540 --> 56:44.180
whatever you want to call them, they're real.

56:44.180 --> 56:45.900
They're real for those people.

56:45.900 --> 56:49.020
And so yes, they're looting that very state

56:49.020 --> 56:50.220
that they're trying to make

56:50.220 --> 56:52.380
one of the great powers in the world.

56:52.380 --> 56:55.900
And they resent the fact that the West

56:55.900 --> 56:58.380
doesn't acknowledge them as one of those great powers.

56:58.380 --> 57:01.260
And they resent that the West is more powerful.

57:01.260 --> 57:05.940
People talk about how Putin doesn't understand the world

57:05.940 --> 57:08.420
and that he gets really bad information.

57:08.420 --> 57:10.700
Lex, if you're sitting there in that Kremlin

57:11.900 --> 57:14.300
and you're trying to conduct business in the world

57:14.300 --> 57:16.980
and you're getting reports from your finance minister

57:16.980 --> 57:18.740
or your central bank governor,

57:19.660 --> 57:21.940
your whole economy, everything that matters,

57:21.940 --> 57:26.020
somehow all your trade is denominated in dollars and euros.

57:27.900 --> 57:29.300
Do you have any illusions

57:29.300 --> 57:32.780
about who controls the international financial system?

57:32.780 --> 57:34.140
I don't think so, Lex.

57:34.980 --> 57:39.540
You're looking over your industrial plan for the next year

57:39.540 --> 57:42.380
and you're looking over how many tanks you're gonna get

57:42.380 --> 57:44.620
and how many cruise missiles you're gonna get

57:44.620 --> 57:46.620
and how many submarines you're gonna get

57:46.620 --> 57:49.660
and fill in the blank.

57:49.660 --> 57:51.220
And you know what?

57:51.220 --> 57:53.100
It says right there in the paperwork

57:53.100 --> 57:54.980
where the component parts come from,

57:54.980 --> 57:59.060
where the software comes from, comes from the West, Lex.

57:59.060 --> 58:01.260
Your whole military industrial complex

58:01.260 --> 58:04.180
is dependent on high-end Western technology.

58:05.140 --> 58:08.660
And let's say you're in Beijing, not just in Moscow,

58:08.660 --> 58:11.620
and you go to a meeting in your own neighborhood.

58:11.620 --> 58:13.460
You're the leader of China.

58:13.460 --> 58:16.900
You go to a meeting with other Asian leaders.

58:16.900 --> 58:19.940
Do they all speak in Chinese with you?

58:19.940 --> 58:22.820
No, Lex, they don't speak Chinese.

58:22.820 --> 58:25.460
You go to an international meeting as the leader of China

58:25.460 --> 58:26.540
and guess what language

58:26.540 --> 58:29.100
is the main language of intercourse?

58:29.100 --> 58:31.980
Yes, the same one you and I are speaking right now.

58:33.020 --> 58:34.780
And so you live in that world.

58:34.780 --> 58:36.260
You live in the Western world

58:36.260 --> 58:38.620
and it's very hard to have illusions

58:38.620 --> 58:40.620
about what world you live in

58:40.620 --> 58:44.300
when you're under that, you need those Western banks.

58:44.300 --> 58:46.820
You need that foreign currency, right?

58:46.820 --> 58:49.020
You need that high-end Western technology,

58:49.180 --> 58:51.020
that technology transfer.

58:51.020 --> 58:53.220
You're speaking or you're forced to speak

58:53.220 --> 58:54.940
or your minions are forced to speak

58:54.940 --> 58:57.420
at international gatherings in English.

58:57.420 --> 59:01.220
And I could go on, all the indicators that you live in,

59:01.220 --> 59:04.460
and so Putin lives in that world, he's no fool.

59:04.460 --> 59:07.860
Well, to push back, isn't it possible that, as you said,

59:07.860 --> 59:11.020
the minions operate in that world,

59:11.020 --> 59:14.020
but can't you, if you're the leader of Russia

59:14.020 --> 59:15.180
or the leader of China

59:15.180 --> 59:17.220
or the leader of these different nations,

59:19.300 --> 59:21.660
still put up walls where, actually,

59:21.660 --> 59:24.660
when you think in the privacy of your mind,

59:24.660 --> 59:27.580
you exist not in the international world,

59:27.580 --> 59:30.300
but in a world where there's this great Russian empire

59:30.300 --> 59:32.540
or this great Chinese empire,

59:32.540 --> 59:34.420
and then you forget that there's English,

59:34.420 --> 59:36.940
you forget that there's technology in iPhones,

59:36.940 --> 59:38.860
you forget that there's all of this,

59:40.100 --> 59:43.540
US keeps popping up on all different paperwork.

59:43.540 --> 59:46.660
That just becomes the blurry details that dissipate,

59:46.660 --> 59:51.300
because what matters is the greatness of this dream empire

59:51.300 --> 59:54.220
that I have in my mind as a dictator.

59:54.220 --> 59:56.660
I would put it this way, Lex.

59:56.660 --> 01:00:01.540
After you absorb all of that from your minions

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:06.540
and it impresses upon your consciousness where you live,

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.540
you live in a Western-dominated world,

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:12.700
that the multipolar world doesn't exist.

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:16.300
Your goal is to make that multipolar world exist.

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.180
Your goal is to bring down the West.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:21.980
Your goal is for the West to weaken.

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:26.020
Your goal is a currency other than the dollar and the euro.

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:28.860
Your goal is an international financial system

01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:30.260
that you dominate.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:34.180
Your goal is technological self-sufficiency

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:36.860
made in China 2035, right?

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:40.260
Your goal is a world that you dominate,

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:42.380
not that the West dominates,

01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:45.100
and you're going to do everything you can

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.700
to try to attain that world,

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.980
which is a Russian-centric world,

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.220
or a Chinese-centric world,

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:56.180
or what we could call a Eurasian-centric world.

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:58.380
And it's not going to be easy, Lex,

01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:02.380
just for the reasons that we enumerated before.

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:04.820
But maybe you're going to get a helping hand.

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.500
Maybe the West is going to transfer

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.020
their best technology to you.

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.700
They're going to sell you their best stuff.

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:14.780
And then you're going to absorb it and maybe copy it

01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:16.860
and reverse engineer it.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:18.100
And if they won't sell it to you,

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.900
maybe you'll just have to steal it.

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:23.740
Maybe the West is going to allow you to bank,

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:27.780
even though you violate many laws

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.180
that would prohibit the West

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.620
from extending those banking services to you.

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:35.540
Maybe the West is going to buy your energy

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:38.260
and your palladium and your titanium

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.500
and your rare metals like lithium,

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.580
because you're willing to have your poor people

01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:48.700
mine that stuff and die of disease at an early age.

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:51.860
But Western governments, they don't want to do that.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.740
They don't want to do that dirty mining

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:56.500
of those very important rare earths.

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:57.620
But you're willing to do that

01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:59.300
because it's just people whose lives

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:01.540
you don't care about as an autocratic regime.

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:03.500
So that's the world you live in

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:07.100
where you're trying to get to this other world.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.900
You're at the center of the other world.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.260
You dominate the other world.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.740
But the only way to get there, Lex,

01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:18.460
is the West has to weaken, divide itself,

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.700
maybe even collapse.

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:25.180
And so you're encouraging to the extent possible

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:28.700
Western divisions, Western disunity,

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:33.580
Western lack of resolve, Western mistakes

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:36.700
and Western invasion of the wrong country

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:39.820
and Western destruction of its credibility

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:42.020
through international financial crises.

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:44.100
One could go on.

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:46.660
So if the West weakens itself

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:49.860
through its mistakes and its own corruption,

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:52.580
you're going to survive and maybe even come out

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:55.860
into that world where you're the center.

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:58.580
And so Russia's entire grand strategy,

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:00.500
just like China's grand strategy,

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:03.020
Iran, it's hard to say they have a grand strategy

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:06.620
because they're so profoundly weak.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:11.660
But Russia's grand strategy is we're a mess.

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:14.180
We don't invest in our human capital.

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:17.900
Our human capital flees or we actually drive it out.

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:21.100
It goes to MIT, like you did,

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:23.700
or it goes to fill in the blank, right?

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.780
We can't invest in our people.

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.460
Our healthcare is terrible.

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.580
Our education system is in decline.

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:33.340
We don't build infrastructure, Lex.

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:35.980
We don't improve our governance.

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.620
We don't invest in those attributes of modern power

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:41.220
that make the West powerful.

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:46.180
We can't because when we try, the money is stolen.

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:48.460
We try these grandiose projects

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:50.860
of national projects, they're called.

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.380
We're going to invest in higher ed.

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:54.580
We're going to invest in high tech.

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:57.820
We're going to build our own Silicon Valley

01:03:57.820 --> 01:03:58.820
known as Skolkovo.

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:01.500
We're going to do all those things and what happens?

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.020
They can't even build an airport

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:04.780
without the money disappearing.

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.660
The Sochi Olympics, Lex,

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:11.020
it cost them, officially cost them $50 billion.

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:14.180
You look around at the infrastructure that endured

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:17.060
from that $50 billion expense.

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:18.460
And you're thinking, you know,

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.900
that's like the second avenue subway.

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.820
You get almost nothing for your money.

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.820
And so yeah, it's corruption, Lex,

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.620
but it's also because they don't want to do that.

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:31.260
They don't want to invest in their people.

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:33.460
They couldn't do it if they wanted to.

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:36.220
And when they try, it doesn't work.

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.340
But why invest in your own people?

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:43.380
Invest in your hardware, your military hardware, right?

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:47.420
Invest in your cyber capabilities,

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:51.380
invest in all your spoilation techniques and your hard power

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:57.300
and invest in further corrupting and further weakening

01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.220
and further dividing the West.

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:03.460
Because as I said, if the West is weak, divided,

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:06.820
lacking resolve, you don't invest in your people,

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.300
you don't build infrastructure,

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:09.740
you don't improve your governance,

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.620
but you'll muddle through.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.580
That's Russian grand strategy.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:18.140
So invest in the hard power, weaken the West,

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:21.380
those combined together means you're going to be

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:24.540
heavily incentivized to escalate

01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:28.580
any military aggressive conflicts that are around you

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.180
or create new ones or just-

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.660
If you can get away with murder.

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:34.500
But what happens, Lex,

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:37.780
if it's a Harry Truman-like response?

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:40.220
What happens if somebody says,

01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:42.060
we're going to stand up to this?

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.420
We're not going to allow this to happen.

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.740
We're not going to launder your money anymore.

01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:52.020
We're not going to be dependent on you for energy

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:53.100
in the long term.

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:54.860
We're going to make a transition.

01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:59.380
We're going to punish you for that kind of behavior instead.

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.860
And the West has now switched to that

01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:07.860
only because of the courage and ingenuity

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:10.820
of the Ukrainian people.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:15.060
The Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:20.020
was one of the greatest gifts the West has ever received.

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:23.660
The sacrifices that the Ukrainians are making

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.340
right now as we speak,

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:31.340
meaning they're fighting a war by themselves

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.780
against a major military power, their neighbor Russia.

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:37.820
Nobody's fighting it with them.

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:41.260
Yes, we are giving them weapons

01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:43.220
so they can conduct self-defense,

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:45.740
which by the way is legal under international law.

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:48.060
Unlike the Russian invasion,

01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:50.980
which is illegal under international law,

01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:54.180
Western supply of weapons, including heavy weapons,

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:56.980
including offensive weapons to Ukraine

01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:59.900
for its self-defense in the invasion by Russia

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:01.340
is actually legal under,

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:06.340
and so thank God the Ukrainians surprised everybody.

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.500
They surprised me.

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.180
They surprised Putin in the Kremlin.

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:13.140
They surprised the Biden administration.

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:15.900
They surprised the European Union.

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:18.860
Not with the fact that they would resist.

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:20.420
We knew that.

01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:23.460
We had the Orange Revolution in 2004.

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:26.900
We had Maidan in 2013, 14,

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:31.380
where they rose up against a domestic tyrant

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:35.420
and they were willing to die on behalf of their country then,

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:37.660
let alone against a foreign tyrant

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.620
invading their country, right?

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:40.900
So we knew they would resist.

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.060
We didn't know just how successful,

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.540
certainly I didn't know,

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:46.100
they would be on the battlefield.

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.300
It's been breathtaking to watch.

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:51.380
That sacrifice, that gift,

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.940
enabled the West to rediscover itself,

01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:57.060
to rediscover its power, to revive itself,

01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:59.900
to say, to hell with this energy dependence

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:00.740
in the long-term,

01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:02.260
to hell with this money laundering

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:04.180
and reputation laundering,

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:07.260
to hell with this running back and forth to Moscow

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.180
to try to see what Putin needs

01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:11.620
in order for him to feel respected,

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:13.140
what appeasement he needs, right?

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:16.900
So we'll see if it endures,

01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:20.980
but this shift comes from the Ukrainians.

01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:23.660
And so it's no longer getting away with murder, Lex,

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:25.660
and we thank the Ukrainians for that.

01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.740
The people and the leadership

01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:32.740
and the separate factions that make up Ukraine uniting,

01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:34.900
it's the unification,

01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:37.100
the uniting against the common enemy,

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:40.340
and standing up before anyone knew

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:43.180
that they would be backed by all of these other nations

01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:45.220
by this money and all this kind of stuff,

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:49.180
standing there, especially with the President Zelensky,

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:52.500
where it makes total sense to flee,

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.020
he stood his ground.

01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:56.980
Let's take that point that you just raised,

01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:58.740
which is a deep and fundamental point,

01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:00.700
and I thank you for that.

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:01.940
Do you guys hear that?

01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:03.100
I think that was a compliment.

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:03.940
There we go.

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:05.100
Let's go.

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:05.940
Lex.

01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:07.100
Zelensky unification.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.980
I'm sitting here in front of you.

01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:10.420
It's an honor.

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:11.780
And it's a mutual honor.

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:17.060
So Ukraine, before the war,

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:20.660
is run by a TV production company, right?

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:24.500
You're one guy running this fantastic, incredible podcast.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:28.660
There's 20 guys or so running a country the size of Ukraine,

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:32.340
and one's a producer, and one's like a makeup person,

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:35.060
and one's a video editor,

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:38.700
and they're fantastically talented people

01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:42.140
if your country is a TV production.

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:44.740
So before the war, Zelensky had what?

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:48.980
25% approval rating, and he couldn't get much done,

01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:50.380
and it wasn't working.

01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:53.340
He got elected with 73%, as you know,

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:54.540
and then he was down to 20.

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.580
That's a pretty big drop.

01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:58.060
And so you're thinking,

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:01.060
maybe having a major, large size,

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:05.020
40 million plus population European country

01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:09.860
run by a TV production company is not the best choice.

01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:11.580
And then what do we see?

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:14.900
We see President Zelensky decides

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:18.780
to risk his life on behalf of his country, Ukraine.

01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:20.940
He decides to stay in the capital.

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:23.900
He's not gonna flee.

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:25.660
They're gonna stay and fight.

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:26.900
And he could be killed.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:27.820
He can die.

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:30.340
It's a decision where he put his life on the line.

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:35.860
Obviously, he's Jewish descent,

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:40.940
Russian-speaking childhood and upbringing.

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:43.220
Russian-speaking Jewish descent

01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:46.580
puts his life on the line for the country of Ukraine.

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:49.700
It's a pretty big message, don't you think?

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:51.420
And it's crucial.

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:54.540
And it turns out, not only that, Lex,

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:56.780
but they're good at TV.

01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:59.020
They're good at information war.

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:02.780
And in a war, it's a TV production company

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.700
and a TV personality.

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:07.980
That's exactly what you want running a country

01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:11.380
because they're crushing in the information war.

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:13.380
And he's spectacular.

01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:18.380
European Parliament, US Congress, Israeli Parliament.

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:22.980
There's no room on Zoom, let alone in person,

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.540
that he can't win over.

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.620
He's just so effective.

01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:29.700
This is the first time reality TV

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:33.380
has been about reality instead of fake.

01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:37.100
Reality TV is just this completely fake nonsense.

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:41.060
But Zelensky, this is real reality TV.

01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:43.260
And he means it.

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:45.780
And the nation is behind him.

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:47.500
And they're just as courageous

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.260
and just as ingenious in many ways.

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:52.420
And it's spectacular.

01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:55.620
And so, yeah, who saw that coming?

01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:57.700
I didn't see that coming, Lex.

01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:58.940
In fact, the Biden,

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.220
we talk about Putin's miscalculation.

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:04.020
The Biden administration, as you alluded to,

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:06.700
offered him an exit from the country.

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:09.340
They didn't say, you know, you want to stand and fight?

01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:10.620
We'll back you.

01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:12.580
They said, we'll get you out.

01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:14.100
You want to come now?

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:16.860
And famously, you know that quote, right?

01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:20.700
What he said about how he doesn't need a ride.

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:22.740
Remember that moment?

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:25.580
The Biden administration was poised

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:28.780
to do another Afghanistan moment.

01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:32.380
That ignominious exit from Afghanistan

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:35.020
was almost what happened in Ukraine

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:38.300
when the Biden administration offered him

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:39.860
that ride out of there.

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:43.060
And fortunately, he declined and helped rally.

01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:45.620
And the people from below also rallied

01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:48.580
to stop the invader without the presidency

01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:50.820
and without the government in Ukraine,

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:55.260
saving the Biden administration and the European leaders

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:56.220
who latched on.

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:58.580
Fortunately, they had the presence of mind

01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:00.380
to latch on to this gift,

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:04.460
this bravery and ingeniousness of Zelensky

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:05.860
and the rest of the Ukrainians,

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:10.860
and flipped and decided to support Ukraine's resistance.

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:14.700
You know, first with 5,000 helmets only,

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:16.700
as the Germans initially promised,

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:19.580
and now with really heavy weapons.

01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:22.860
And so that's something that wasn't foreseen.

01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:24.620
I certainly didn't foresee that.

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:29.620
I foresaw the Ukrainian society being courageous and resisting,

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:34.580
but I didn't foresee a television production company

01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:38.500
being exactly what you want to run a country in a war,

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:42.820
a president Zelensky willing to sacrifice,

01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:45.420
lay down his life and rallying others

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:47.220
in the country to do that.

01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:50.140
And then the country being so effective,

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:52.740
not just at a courage,

01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:56.940
but at battlefield resistance to the Russian invasion.

01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:59.300
So I stand corrected by the Ukrainians,

01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:03.340
and I'm ecstatic that I was wrong,

01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:04.540
that I was proven wrong.

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.380
And like I said, there's clear factions

01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:09.180
of the West and the East of Ukraine,

01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:11.460
and here's a person that, like you said,

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:16.300
was in the high 20s, low 30s percentage approval

01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:17.780
in the country before the war,

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:20.380
and now was able to use-

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:21.220
He's in the 90s now.

01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:22.180
In the 90s.

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:24.860
He's in the 90% approval rating.

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:29.860
I mean, I think they stopped doing the polling.

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:33.660
Once he hit 91% or whatever it was in the previous poll,

01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:35.780
I think they all understood that for now,

01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:38.140
they didn't need any more polling,

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.700
that it's pretty clear the nation.

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:43.380
So 25% to 90-something percent.

01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:47.180
And just like the 25% was deserved,

01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:50.660
the 90-something percent is also deserved, fully deserved.

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:53.340
And the question is how that all stabilizes.

01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:58.340
It feels like this set of events,

01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:02.420
I may be paying attention to Twitter too much,

01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:05.860
which is a concern of mine,

01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:09.580
whether the change I see is just surface level

01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:11.420
or deep level.

01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.740
But it seems like we're in a new world,

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.700
that something dramatic has shifted,

01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:21.060
that this power that's rooted,

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:25.540
I mean, in your study of the 20th century,

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.180
it's so deeply rooted in history.

01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:29.580
There's this power center of the world

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:33.580
is now going to, has been shaken by this event.

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:37.900
And how that changes the world is unclear.

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.820
It's unclear what lesson China learns from watching this,

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:43.140
what lesson India learns from watching this.

01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:45.500
Both nations, as far as you can get polls

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.780
about Chinese population,

01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:51.820
but both nations are largely in support of Putin.

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:54.540
So Russia, India, and China

01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:57.460
are still supporting of Putin quietly.

01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:02.460
I would maybe elaborate a little bit on that point, Lex.

01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:04.900
I think you're right.

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:08.420
The feeling that we're in an inflection moment,

01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:10.540
you know, an inflection point,

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.500
I think that's widespread.

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:16.460
And I think it's widespread for good reason, we might be.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:21.460
But I also share your, let's say,

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:26.220
modesty about where it's going

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:29.580
and how hard it is to predict where this might go.

01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:33.860
It's only an inflection point if the trends continue,

01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:36.140
right, if the trends endure.

01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:38.940
There are plenty of non-inflection points.

01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:42.860
After 9-11, the whole world rallied around the United States

01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:47.460
after it was attacked, after the bombing of the towers

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:50.140
here in New York City and the hitting of the Pentagon.

01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:53.180
And that didn't last.

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:56.620
And it was not really an inflection point, was it?

01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:59.660
It felt like it might be, but it wasn't.

01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:01.780
And so this is not a comparable moment

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:04.260
in terms of what happened,

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:08.140
but it has the feeling that it might be a watershed.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.380
And maybe we'll squander it

01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:13.860
the way we squandered the post-9-11

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:16.820
rallying around the United States.

01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:21.300
Maybe we'll actually consolidate it and it'll endure,

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:24.060
or maybe it'll endure despite ourselves.

01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:26.820
And we can't tell and we can't know yet.

01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:30.580
And it depends in part on what we do and what we don't do.

01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:33.340
But here's a few things that we understand already.

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:39.420
The idea that the West was in decline

01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:43.060
and that the rest of the world had risen

01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:44.380
and was more powerful

01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:47.100
and that we lived in a multipolar world,

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:49.500
that turns out to be empirically false.

01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:52.500
It's not true.

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.300
I mean, it's just factually not true.

01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:57.980
There are no major important

01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:01.620
multinational institutions, organizations

01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:06.620
that are run on behalf of or led by a South African,

01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:11.460
a Nigerian person from India.

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:14.900
Even the Chinese don't run these institutions.

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:18.020
They would like to, and they're trying, but they don't.

01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:23.620
And so whatever you pick, the IMF, the World Bank,

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.180
the Federal Reserve,

01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:28.780
which is the most powerful multinational institution,

01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:31.660
which is actually only a domestic institution

01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:35.980
and doesn't have a legal mandate to act multilaterally,

01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:38.660
but does, it's got the most power

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.100
of any institution in the world.

01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:45.740
NATO, the bilateral alliances that the US has

01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.020
up and down Asia.

01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:53.420
What organizations that have tremendous leverage

01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:56.500
on the international system, on the international order,

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:57.500
are non-Western?

01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:04.340
The UN is the most encompassing.

01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:06.340
And of course, we know that the five,

01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:10.180
it has five members of the Security Council with a veto,

01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:12.540
one of which is Russia, one of which is China,

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:16.020
and the others are the US, Britain and France,

01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:21.020
not India, not South Africa, not Indonesia,

01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:25.660
not all of these other countries where the people live,

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:28.420
right, the bulk of the population of the world

01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:30.180
and where the population is growing

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:32.260
like on the African continent.

01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:34.540
So it's not a multipolar world.

01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:38.060
We talked already about the international financial system.

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:40.300
That's the Western, not multipolar.

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:42.780
We talked about the US military in NATO,

01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:45.100
or we could talk about the Japanese military,

01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:47.340
which is just very formidable,

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:50.060
enormous number of platforms.

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:51.700
Even the Australian military,

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:54.180
we could talk about that, right?

01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:57.700
And so it's a Western dominated world.

01:19:57.700 --> 01:20:01.460
And the West, remember, is not a geographic concept.

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:06.460
It is an institutional and values club.

01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:10.020
The Japanese are not European, but they're Western,

01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:14.180
just like Russia is European, but not Western,

01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:16.820
because European is a cultural category

01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:19.620
and Western is an institutional category,

01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:22.660
where you have rule of law and separation of powers

01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:24.220
and free and open public sphere

01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:27.180
and dynamic open market economy.

01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:28.260
Okay.

01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:31.380
And then we have another thing which is pretty clear.

01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:34.980
The West is powerfully resented,

01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:39.500
powerfully envied and admired simultaneously.

01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:43.180
PJ O'Rourke, the comedian who died this year,

01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:48.380
fantastic, it was a big loss for the culture.

01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:49.900
He said, there are two things

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:51.700
that are always characteristic

01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:53.860
of any American embassy abroad.

01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:58.540
One is a political protest outside,

01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:01.220
and the other is the longest line

01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:03.540
you've ever seen for visas.

01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:08.620
And those things are true simultaneously,

01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:10.380
and that's the world we live in,

01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:12.940
meaning that non-Western countries

01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:17.460
envy and admire the West,

01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:20.740
but they also resent the power of the West,

01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:23.020
Western hypocrisy, right?

01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:26.900
The West invades countries when it wants,

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:30.460
but when others do that, it's illegal, right?

01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:35.460
The West arrests you for money laundering,

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:37.980
but it's Western money laundering

01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:41.740
that is where you go when you need to launder money, right?

01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:44.420
So they see the hypocrisy,

01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:48.580
they see the excessive power that the West has,

01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:49.740
and they resent it.

01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:55.260
And they say, who elected you to run the world?

01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:58.460
We have a billion plus people,

01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:02.540
or we have 200 plus million people,

01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:04.940
and we don't have a say.

01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:08.500
You're the self-appointed guardians of our world.

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:09.500
Who did that?

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.540
And so it's incumbent on the West

01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:15.420
not only to remember the power that it has,

01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:18.980
but also to exercise that power,

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:21.700
legally and with restraint,

01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:26.700
and also to think about how we can expand institutions

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:29.420
to be more encompassing

01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:31.260
so that other parts of the world

01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:36.020
are not on the outside being dictated to,

01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:39.460
but instead are on the inside.

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:41.660
Too often, right,

01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:46.460
Western power is not consultative

01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:49.780
in a decision-making fashion.

01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:52.660
It's consultative after the fact.

01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:54.900
Okay, you know, we got together in the EU,

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:57.260
or we got together in NATO,

01:22:57.260 --> 01:22:59.580
or we got together at the Federal Reserve,

01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:02.780
and here's our decision, and we're announcing it today.

01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:06.340
And so your economy gets destroyed

01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:08.060
because the Federal Reserve decides

01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:09.780
it has to raise interest rates,

01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:14.460
or you now go into default,

01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:15.660
you can't pay your debt

01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:18.300
because Western banks lent you money,

01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:21.620
and now the West has changed interest rates

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:23.940
or other considerations,

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:27.700
and you're in big trouble now.

01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:32.220
And so this is something which we fail to address.

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:33.460
It's very hard to address.

01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:36.980
It's very hard to reform international institutions.

01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:39.860
It's very hard to share power.

01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:43.260
It's very hard to acknowledge that you have too much power,

01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:47.860
and that maybe having too much power is not good,

01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:51.220
not only for the rest of the world, but for yourself.

01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:53.780
And so it's great to rediscover the West

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:55.500
and rediscover its values

01:23:55.500 --> 01:24:00.500
and rediscover its authority and credibility and power,

01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:02.980
but that's not sufficient.

01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:04.660
So we know this now.

01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:07.300
We know that the rest of the world

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:12.300
is not necessarily jumping on the Western bandwagon

01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:14.940
to condemn Russia for its actions

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:17.380
because the West can do things

01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:20.420
like sanction your central bank,

01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:24.620
take away your reserves, deny you technology.

01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:27.180
It pretty much can do whatever it wants,

01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:28.780
and it can say that it's legal

01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:30.780
and it can go through various mechanisms

01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:33.180
and it can freeze your property,

01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:34.900
and you say to yourself,

01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:37.340
should anybody have that much power,

01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:40.460
and when do they come after me?

01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:42.540
Now there's a caveat here,

01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:47.300
and the caveat, Lex, is they don't like the West

01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:49.220
having all of that power,

01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:53.980
and they didn't join in the condemnation of Russia,

01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:57.420
but they also didn't join in Russia's aggression.

01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:02.340
So Russia's domestic civilian

01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:07.700
aerospace, aircraft industry, right?

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:10.700
Civilian aircraft industry is in big trouble now

01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:15.700
because of the export controls on spare parts and software.

01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:22.420
Brazil is a major power in aircraft manufacturing.

01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:24.700
Did they rush in and say,

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:27.980
you know, Vladimir Putin,

01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:31.540
we didn't condemn necessarily your actions in Ukraine.

01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:33.180
Okay, that's one thing.

01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:37.500
And how about we give you all of our aircraft technology

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:41.620
and we help you rebuild your domestic aircraft industry,

01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:43.940
and you can have the aviation that the West is...

01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:45.500
Did that happen, Lex?

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.340
Didn't happen.

01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:48.740
And you can look at India,

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.020
and you can look at China,

01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:51.460
and you can look at South Africa,

01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:54.460
and you can look at what they've done in practical terms.

01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:58.100
Yes, they haven't always joined

01:25:58.100 --> 01:26:00.020
in a full-throated condemnation.

01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:01.460
Maybe they've been neutral,

01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:04.540
or maybe they've been playing both sides of the fence,

01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:06.180
like Turkey, for example,

01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:11.500
but are they rushing in to join Russia,

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:14.260
to join Russia's aggression, to supply?

01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:16.340
And the answer is no.

01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:18.940
And the answer is no for two reasons.

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:22.540
One, they actually don't want to be party to that.

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:25.980
And two, they understand that Western power,

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:29.100
and they don't want to be on the receiving end

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:32.780
by crossing the West and then getting caught up

01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:35.420
in a sanctions regime, or worse.

01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.780
Can we go to the mind of Vladimir Putin,

01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:42.420
because what you just said, China, India,

01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:45.700
they seem to sit back and say,

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.820
we're not going to condemn the actions

01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:49.860
of Vladimir Putin and Russia,

01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:53.460
but we would really like for this war to be over.

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:56.100
So there's that kind of energy of,

01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:58.140
we don't just stop this,

01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:00.540
because you're putting us in a very, very bad position,

01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:05.140
and yet Vladimir Putin is continuing the aggression.

01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:06.540
What is he thinking?

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:08.620
What information is he getting?

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:10.820
Is it the system that you've described

01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:13.140
of authoritarian regimes that corrupts

01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:14.780
your flow of information,

01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:17.060
your ability to make clear-headed decisions?

01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:21.660
Just as a human being, when you go to sleep at night,

01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:24.100
is he not able to see the world clearly,

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:27.540
or is this all deliberate, systematic action

01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:31.300
that does have some reason behind it?

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:33.340
We gotta talk a little bit about China, too,

01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:36.260
but let's answer your Putin question directly.

01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:41.020
So on Twitter, you've lost the war.

01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:45.180
Or as they say, there are these two Russian soldiers

01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:47.020
having a smoke in Warsaw,

01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:51.100
and they're taking a break having a smoke,

01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:53.580
and they're sitting there in Warsaw on top of their tank,

01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:55.180
and one says to the other,

01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:57.460
yeah, we lost the information war.

01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:00.940
And there they are sitting in Warsaw

01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:02.300
having that smoke, right?

01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:07.140
So yeah, on Twitter, Russia has completely lost the war.

01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:09.620
In reality, they failed to take Kiev,

01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:11.740
they failed to capture Kiev,

01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:15.900
and they failed in phase two, as they called it,

01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:20.660
or plan B, which is to capture the entirety of the Donbas.

01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:23.540
We're three months into the war.

01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:25.900
If you had made a judgment about, let's say,

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:27.940
the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union,

01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:30.540
a definitive judgment after three months,

01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:32.940
you might've got the outcome wrong there.

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:34.780
If you had judged the Winter War,

01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:39.780
the 1939-40 Soviet invasion of Finland after three months,

01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:41.620
you would've got that wrong too

01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:43.140
of what the outcome was gonna be.

01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:45.540
So we're early in the game here,

01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:49.900
and we have to be careful about any definitive judgments.

01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:52.580
But it is the case that so far,

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:54.220
they failed to take Kiev,

01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:57.620
and they failed to capture the entirety of the Donbas,

01:28:57.620 --> 01:29:02.060
Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, eastern Ukraine.

01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:04.620
A part of eastern Ukraine.

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:09.020
And they've been driven out of Kharkiv

01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:12.500
and the area immediately surrounding Kharkiv.

01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:15.660
They never captured Kharkiv, but they came close,

01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:19.540
but now the Ukrainians drove them back to the Russian border

01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:22.060
in that very large and important region.

01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:25.340
So those look like battlefield losses

01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:28.820
that are impossible to explain away

01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:30.260
if you're the regime in Russia,

01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:32.460
except by suppression of information.

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.460
And as you know from Russian history,

01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:40.460
like leaders in Russia have an easier time

01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:44.380
with a state of siege and deprivation

01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:46.660
than they do with explaining a lost war.

01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:53.020
But let's look at some other facts

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:55.060
that are important to take into account.

01:29:56.220 --> 01:30:00.220
One, the Russian army has penetrated farther

01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:04.380
into Ukrainian territory since February, 2022,

01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:08.380
including in Kherson region,

01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:13.020
the famous Mariupol siege that just ended.

01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:18.940
They have built a large presence

01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:25.180
in areas north of Crimea on the Sea of Azov,

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:28.660
the Black Sea littoral ultimately,

01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:30.500
that they didn't previously hold.

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:35.220
They're still fighting in Luhansk for full control

01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:38.580
over at least half of the Donbas,

01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:41.420
and Ukrainians are resisting fiercely.

01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:46.420
But nonetheless, you can say that they've been driven out.

01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:50.420
On the contrary, farther penetration than the beginning.

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:53.660
Ukraine doesn't have an economy anymore.

01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:58.420
They have somewhere between 33 and 50% unemployment.

01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:02.580
It's hard to measure unemployment in a war economy,

01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:04.180
but their metallurgical industry,

01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:09.180
that Azov-style steel plant in Mariupol is a ruin now.

01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:14.020
And a lot of farmers are not planting the fields

01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:16.100
because the harvest from the previous year

01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:19.420
still hasn't been sent, sold abroad

01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:22.460
because the ports are blockaded or destroyed.

01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:26.100
And so you don't have an economy

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:28.780
and you need $5 billion or $7 billion

01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:33.300
or $8 billion a month to meet your payroll,

01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:37.780
to feed your people, to keep your army in the field.

01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:42.980
That's a lot of money per month, and that's indefinite.

01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:45.940
That's as long as this blockade lasts.

01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:49.220
And so you don't have an economy anymore, you're indigent.

01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:51.940
And even if you take the lower number, $5 billion,

01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:55.620
as opposed to Zelensky's ask for $7 billion,

01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:57.900
$5 billion is $60 billion a year.

01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:01.700
That's $60 billion this year, that's $60 billion next year.

01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:03.540
And so who's got that kind of money?

01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:06.380
Which Western taxpayers are ready?

01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:08.100
And if you use the $7 or $8 billion,

01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:10.460
you get up to $100 billion a year.

01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:15.460
The Biden just signed, President Joe Biden just signed

01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:22.220
the bill making it law, $40 billion in aid to Ukraine.

01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:24.540
It's just an enormous sum.

01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:28.540
The economic piece of that is a month and a half,

01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:33.540
two months of Ukrainians covering Ukrainian expenditures.

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:36.540
That's it.

01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:38.220
And they're asking the G7,

01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:40.020
they're asking everybody for this.

01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:44.180
So you have no economy and no prospect of an economy

01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:46.740
until you evict the Russians from your territory.

01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:52.740
And then you have a Western unity, Western resolve,

01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:56.100
it lasts or it doesn't last, Lex.

01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:58.140
So you're President Putin

01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:01.380
and you've got more territory than before.

01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:05.500
And you've got a stranglehold over the Ukrainian economy

01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:10.020
and you've got a lot of the world neutral

01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:13.140
and you've got the Chinese propaganda

01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:17.340
supporting you to the hilt with those Oliver Stone

01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:21.660
and Mearsheimer lines about how this is really NATO's fault.

01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:27.740
And you've got Hungary dragging its feet

01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:30.060
on the oil embargo against Russia.

01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:32.140
And you got Turkey dragging its feet

01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:35.900
on the recent applications of Sweden and Finland

01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:36.860
for NATO expense.

01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:38.540
And you're saying to yourself,

01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:40.260
Lex, maybe I can ride this out.

01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:43.100
I got a lot of problems of my own

01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:44.500
and we can go into the details

01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:46.700
on the Russian side's challenges.

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:51.900
But he's got, he's on Ukrainian territory

01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:53.380
unless he's evicted

01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:56.100
and he's got a stranglehold on their economy

01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:58.500
and he's got the possibility

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:02.020
that the West doesn't stay resolved

01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:05.500
and doesn't continue to pay for Ukraine's economy

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:08.020
or supply those heavy weapons.

01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:09.900
And so you could argue

01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:12.820
that maybe he's deluded about all of this

01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:14.860
and maybe he should go on Twitter.

01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:15.740
I'm not on Twitter,

01:34:15.740 --> 01:34:18.300
but maybe Putin who famously doesn't use the internet

01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:21.140
should go on Twitter and sees losing the war.

01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:24.860
Or you can argue that maybe he's calculating here

01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:26.980
that he's got a chance to still prevail.

01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:33.540
Wow, that is darkly insightful.

01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:38.020
If I could go to Henry Kissinger for a brief moment

01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:40.940
and people should read this op-ed

01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:44.620
he wrote in the Washington Post in March 5th, 2014

01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:49.580
after the start of the war between Russia and Ukraine

01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:51.900
before Crimea was annexed.

01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:55.420
There's a lot of interesting historical description

01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:57.740
about the division within Ukraine,

01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:59.740
the corruption within Ukraine

01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:02.380
that will, if people read this article,

01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:05.900
will give context to how incredible it is

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.540
what Zelensky was able to accomplish

01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:08.500
in uniting the country.

01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:10.060
But I just wanted to comment

01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:13.540
because Henry Kissinger's an interesting figure

01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:14.980
in American history.

01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:16.340
He opens the article with,

01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:19.420
In my life, I have seen four wars

01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:22.660
begun with great enthusiasm and public support,

01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:25.420
all of which we did not know how to end

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:29.820
and from three of which we withdrew unilaterally.

01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:34.820
The test of policy is how it ends, not how it begins.

01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:38.540
So he's giving this cold hard truth

01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:42.220
that we go into wars excited,

01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:46.180
are able to send $40 billion, financial aid,

01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:50.500
military aid, our own men and women,

01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:55.500
but the excitement fades, Twitter outrage fades,

01:35:56.460 --> 01:36:00.780
and then a country that's willing to wait patiently

01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:04.340
is willing to pay the cost of siege

01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:07.420
versus the cost of explaining to its own people

01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:12.420
that the war is lost, that country just might win, outlast.

01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:17.460
Let's hope not because the Ukrainians resistance

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:21.300
deserves to prevail here.

01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:23.460
Russia deserves to lose.

01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:26.260
No war of aggression like they've committed here

01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:28.740
against Ukraine should prevail

01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:30.780
if we can do anything about it.

01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:35.780
I support 1,000% the continued supply of heavy weapons,

01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:40.620
including offensive weapons to the Ukrainians

01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:44.500
as long as they're willing to resist and it's their choice.

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:46.700
It's their choice when to negotiate.

01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:48.660
It's their choice how much to resist.

01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:51.420
It's their choice what kind of sacrifices to make.

01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:56.820
And it's our responsibility to meet their requests

01:36:56.820 --> 01:37:00.780
more quickly than we have so far and at greater scale.

01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:05.260
But ultimately wars only have political ends.

01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:07.660
They never have military ends.

01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:10.380
You need a political solution here.

01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:14.300
So if the Ukrainians are able to conduct

01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:17.900
a successful counteroffensive at scale

01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:23.660
in July or August whenever they launch,

01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:26.580
right now the heavy weapons are coming in

01:37:26.580 --> 01:37:28.860
and they're being moved to the battlefield

01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:30.340
and more are coming.

01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:33.460
You know the dynamic, Russia bombs a school,

01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:37.340
Russia bombs a hospital, Americans and Europeans

01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:40.540
decide to send even more heavy weapons to Ukraine, right?

01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:43.860
That's the self-defeating dynamic from the Russian side.

01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:47.100
They commit the atrocities, we send more heavy weapons.

01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:51.780
Once those heavy weapons are on the battle lines,

01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:55.020
we'll see if Ukrainians cannot just defend,

01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:57.180
which they've proven they're able to do

01:37:57.180 --> 01:38:01.860
in breathtaking fashion, not just conduct counterattacks

01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:04.740
where the enemy moves forward

01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:07.820
and you cut behind the enemy's lines

01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:11.420
and you counterattack and push the enemy back a little bit.

01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:17.460
But whether you can evict the Russians from your territory

01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:20.500
with a combined arms operation

01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:22.940
where you have a massive superiority

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:26.940
in infantry and heavy weapons, but more importantly,

01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:30.340
you coordinate your air power, your tanks,

01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:33.940
your drones, your infantry at scale,

01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:36.500
which is something the Ukrainians have not done yet.

01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:39.420
It's something the Russians failed at in Ukraine

01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:42.940
and they come from the same place, the Soviet military.

01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:46.100
We hope this Ukrainian counter-offensive at scale,

01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:50.380
this combined arms operation succeeds.

01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:52.900
And if it does succeed, there's the possibility

01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:55.220
of a battlefield victory.

01:38:55.220 --> 01:38:57.500
Whether that also includes Crimea,

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:00.980
which as you know is not hostile,

01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:05.980
on the contrary to the Russian military, remains to be seen.

01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:11.740
But however much they regain territorially

01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:16.540
back towards the 1991 borders, which is their goal,

01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:20.500
their stated goal, and which we support them properly

01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:24.180
in trying to achieve, however much they achieve of that

01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:27.420
in this counter-offensive that we're anticipating,

01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:31.020
that will set the stage for the next phase.

01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:35.620
And either Russia, which is to say one person,

01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:40.620
Vladimir Putin, will acknowledge that he's lost the war

01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:44.380
because the Ukrainians won it on the battlefield,

01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:49.380
or he'll try to announce a full-scale mobilization,

01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:53.460
conscript the whole country, go back,

01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:55.500
and instead of acknowledging defeat,

01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:58.620
try to win with a different plan, recalibrate,

01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:00.420
remains to be seen.

01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:03.980
Will the Ukrainians negotiate any territory away,

01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:07.500
or must they capture also Crimea,

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:12.500
which puts a very high bar on the summer counter-offensive

01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:15.420
that we're gonna see, which could last through the fall

01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:17.620
and into the winter as a result.

01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:18.980
We don't know the answers to that.

01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:21.060
Nobody knows the answers to that.

01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:23.820
People are guessing, some people are better informed

01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:26.420
because they have inside intelligence.

01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:32.660
People are also worried about Russian escalation

01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:34.940
to nuclear weapons or chemical weapons

01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:38.380
if they begin to lose on the battlefield to Ukraine.

01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:40.740
Are you worried about nuclear war,

01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:43.820
the possibility of nuclear war?

01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:49.060
I think it's necessary to pay attention to that possibility.

01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:54.060
That possibility existed before the February, 2022

01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:57.300
full-blown invasion of Ukraine.

01:40:57.300 --> 01:41:00.380
The doomsday arsenal that Russia possesses

01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:03.380
is enough to destroy the world many times over,

01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:06.500
and that's been the case every year

01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:10.300
since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:13.980
And so, of course, we're concerned about that.

01:41:13.980 --> 01:41:15.780
We do know, however, Lex,

01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:18.540
that they have a system known as dual-key.

01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:22.460
Dual-key for their strategic nuclear weapons.

01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:28.460
Strategic nuclear weapons means the ones fired from silos,

01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:32.380
the missiles, the ones delivered from bombers,

01:41:32.380 --> 01:41:34.500
or the ones fired from submarines.

01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:35.860
And they're ready to go.

01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:37.740
They're intercontinental.

01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:40.540
We watch that very, very closely.

01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:44.500
We watch all the movement of that and the alerts, et cetera.

01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:47.220
We have tremendously, let's say,

01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:51.180
tremendous inside intelligence on that.

01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:53.860
But dual-key means that President Putin alone

01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:55.460
cannot fire them.

01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:57.900
He has one key, which he must insert.

01:41:57.900 --> 01:42:02.900
He must then insert the codes for a command to launch.

01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:07.540
That then goes to the head of the general staff

01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:11.620
who must, has his own key and separate codes

01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:14.260
and must do the same, insert that key and codes

01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:16.220
for them to launch.

01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:21.100
And so, will the general staff chief go along

01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:22.980
with the destruction of the world

01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:25.180
over a battlefield loss in Ukraine?

01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:27.780
I don't know the answer to that,

01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:30.300
and I don't know if anybody knows the answer to that.

01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:33.380
Will those people flying those bombers,

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:34.820
if they get the order from,

01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:37.980
if the dual-key system goes into action

01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:42.980
and both keys are used and all the codes are implemented,

01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:46.700
will those young guys flying those bombers

01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:48.460
let those bombs go?

01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:53.420
Will those at the missile silos decide to engage and fire?

01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:55.900
We don't know, but you can see

01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:59.300
that it's more than one man making the decision here

01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:02.380
in a system of strategic nuclear weapons.

01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:05.840
As far as the tactical, the so-called low yield

01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:08.720
or battlefield nuclear weapons,

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:11.340
we're not sure the system that they have in Russia

01:43:11.340 --> 01:43:16.340
these days for their use of such tactical nuclear weapons.

01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:22.020
It could well be that Putin and just himself,

01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:26.500
he alone could fire them or order them be fired.

01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:31.180
What you know, Lex, there's no tactical nuclear weapon

01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:34.080
fired at Ukraine that's not also fired

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:36.040
simultaneously at Russia.

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:41.880
If the Kremlin is 600 miles from Ukraine

01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:46.080
and if the wind changes direction

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:49.720
or the wind happens to be blowing east, northeast,

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.500
the fallout hits your Kremlin, not just Ukraine.

01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:58.000
Moreover, you have all those border regions

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.760
which are staging regions for the Russian offensive

01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:04.160
and they're a lot closer than 600 miles.

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:06.280
They're actually right there.

01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:09.600
And so you fire that weapon on Ukrainian territory

01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:11.880
and you can get the fallout,

01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:16.200
just like the Chernobyl fallout spread to Sweden,

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:20.480
which is how we got the Kremlin to finally,

01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:22.040
first they denied this at all.

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:25.260
We don't know why there's a big nuclear cloud over Sweden.

01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:26.940
We don't know where that came from,

01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:28.600
but eventually they admitted it.

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:33.400
So Russia can't actually use a nuclear weapon,

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:35.840
tactical battlefield one in Ukraine

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.960
without also firing it at itself.

01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:41.120
And in addition, it's that same dynamic

01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:44.560
I alluded to earlier, which is to say,

01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:48.420
you bomb a hospital, you bomb a school,

01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:52.600
there's more heavy weapons going to Ukraine from the west.

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:55.080
You can't get away with any of the,

01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:56.520
there's always going to be a response

01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:59.160
that's either proportional or greater than proportional.

01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:02.880
You could well have Europe signing on

01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:07.560
to NATO direct engagement, both Washington and Brussels,

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:10.920
direct engagement of the Russian army

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:13.160
on the territory of Ukraine.

01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:15.080
You think that's possible to do that

01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:19.320
without dramatic escalation from the Russian side?

01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:21.080
Yes, I do think it's possible,

01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:24.240
but it's very worrisome, just like you're saying.

01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:28.280
But if Putin were to escalate like that,

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:31.280
he's firing that weapon at himself,

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:34.600
and he's potentially provoking a direct clash

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:39.260
with NATO's military, not just with the Ukrainian military.

01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:40.840
If you're sitting in the Kremlin

01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:45.480
looking at those charts, Lex, of NATO capabilities,

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.540
and you can't conquer Ukraine,

01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:50.440
which didn't really have heavy weapons

01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:54.400
before February, 2022 at scale,

01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:58.160
and you're thinking, okay, now I'm going to take out NATO,

01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:04.000
that would be a bold step on the part of a Russian leader.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.260
And let's also remember, Lex,

01:46:06.260 --> 01:46:08.000
that there's another variable here.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:14.000
You're a despot as long as everyone implements your orders.

01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:18.840
And so if people start to say quietly,

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:22.840
not necessarily publicly, I may not implement that order,

01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:25.520
because that's maybe a criminal order,

01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:30.520
or my grandma is Ukrainian, or my wife is Ukrainian,

01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:34.000
or I don't want to go to the hog,

01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:37.000
I don't want to spend the rest of my life in the hog,

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.640
or whatever it might be.

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:41.480
At any point along the chain of command,

01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:43.320
along the chain of command,

01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:48.320
from the general staff all the way down to the platoon,

01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:52.800
you're a despot provided they implement your orders.

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:57.800
But who's to say that somewhere along the chain of command,

01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:02.960
people start to say, I'm going to ignore that order,

01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:06.000
or I'm going to sabotage that order,

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.240
or I'm going to flee the battlefield,

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:13.200
or I'm going to injure myself so that I don't have to fight,

01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:16.720
or I'm going to join the Ukrainian side.

01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:19.720
And so it could be that's what's left

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:24.640
of the Russian army in the field begins to disintegrate.

01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:27.560
Even if the Ukrainians are not able to mount

01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:29.560
that counteroffensive at scale,

01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:31.680
that combined arms operation,

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:34.840
the Russian military in the field,

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:36.800
which has taken horrendous casualties

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:38.160
as far as we understand,

01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:41.360
something like a third of the original force.

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:44.840
So you're talking about 50 to 60,000.

01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:48.440
That includes both dead and wounded

01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:51.800
to the point of being unable to return to the battlefield.

01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:55.920
Those are big numbers, those were a lot of families.

01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:57.640
A lot of families affected,

01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:02.520
their sons or their husbands or their fathers

01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:04.120
are either missing in action

01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:07.000
or the regime won't tell them that they're dead.

01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:10.280
As you know, from the sinking of that flagship,

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:14.280
Moskva, right, by the Ukrainians.

01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:18.480
And so a disintegration of the Russian military

01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:21.840
because there are orders that they either can't implement

01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:26.960
or don't want to implement is also not excluded.

01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:29.240
And so you have these two big variables,

01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:32.040
the Ukrainian army in the field and its ability

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:34.600
to move from defense to offense at scale.

01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:37.320
And we're gonna test that soon.

01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:41.280
And then the Russian ability in the field to hold together

01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:44.920
in a war of conquest and aggression,

01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:49.640
where their conscripts or their fed dog food

01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:53.080
or they don't have any weapons anymore

01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:54.880
because there's no resupply.

01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:59.160
And so the disintegration of the army can't be excluded.

01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:02.800
And then of course, all bets are off on the Putin regime.

01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:07.840
More long-term, there are these technology export controls.

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:10.760
We were talking about how the military industrial complex

01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:15.200
in Russia is dependent on foreign component parts

01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:16.640
and software.

01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:19.440
And so if you have export controls

01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:21.320
and you have firms voluntarily,

01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:24.240
even when they don't follow their export controls,

01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:28.960
leaving Russian business, refusing to do business with Russia.

01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:31.680
And we see this not just in the civilian sector,

01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:35.320
like with McDonald's or many other companies.

01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:40.320
We see this in the key areas like the oil industry

01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:42.200
with the executives fleeing,

01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:45.640
that is the Western executives fleeing,

01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:47.960
giving up their positions.

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:51.800
So Russia's ability to resupply its tanks,

01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:56.800
resupply its missiles, resupply its uniforms,

01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:01.960
resupply its food to its soldiers in the field

01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:03.640
and in their boots.

01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:07.840
We see a lot of stuff under tremendous stress.

01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:11.160
And in the long-term, there's no obvious way

01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:14.840
they can rebuild the military industrial complex

01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:17.800
to produce those weapons

01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:20.060
because they're reliant on foreign parts

01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:21.320
that they can't get anymore.

01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:23.920
And there are no domestic substitutes

01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:26.200
on the immediate horizon.

01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:30.680
That's at the earliest a two-year proposition

01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:32.360
to have domestic substitutes.

01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:35.440
And for some things like microelectronics,

01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:37.400
they've never had domestic substitutes

01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:40.760
going back to the Soviet times, as you know well.

01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:44.000
And so there's that pressure on Russia

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.840
from the technology export controls,

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:49.840
which if you're in the security ministry

01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.120
or the defense ministry,

01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:54.440
if you're in that side of the regime,

01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:57.080
you're feeling that pain as we speak

01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:59.160
and you're wondering about the strategy.

01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:06.560
Let me ask you about, again, the echoes of history.

01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:08.280
And it frustrates me in part

01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:10.520
when people draw these parallels,

01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:14.240
but maybe there is some deep insight about those parallels.

01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:18.800
So there's a song that goes,

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:24.000
So Operation Barbarossa, the bombing of Kiev by Hitler,

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.360
there is sort of an eerie parallel.

01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:37.320
And you have to be extremely careful

01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:41.960
drawing such parallels and such connections

01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:46.960
to this unexplainable war,

01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:50.320
that is World War II.

01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:55.240
But is there elements of this

01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:58.720
that do echo in the actions of Vladimir Putin?

01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:01.760
And more specifically,

01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:04.840
do you think that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal?

01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:09.480
Can that label be assigned to the actions of this man?

01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:14.520
The war criminal is a legal determination

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:17.840
and it requires evidence and due process

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:20.200
and the ability to defend oneself.

01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:24.880
We don't just decide in the Twitter sphere

01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:27.680
or on a podcast that somebody is a war criminal.

01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:31.680
They can be a suspected war criminal

01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:36.000
and we can gather evidence to try to prosecute that case.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.400
And then the issue for us, Lex,

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:40.680
is which court does it go to?

01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:44.120
What's the appropriate place?

01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:46.680
Does it happen in Ukraine because they're the victims?

01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:47.920
Does it happen in the Hague

01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:51.160
because there's an international criminal court there?

01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:52.920
Does it happen inside Russia

01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:56.000
because there's regime change at some point

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.280
and some of these people become,

01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:00.880
let's say, they get arrested

01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:03.680
by their own people inside Russia?

01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:07.080
So those are all important questions

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:09.520
that have to be pursued with resources

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:13.760
and with determination and by skilled people

01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:17.040
who are excellent at gathering that evidence.

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:18.920
And that process is underway

01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:22.080
and Ukraine has a trial underway now

01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:26.600
of one alleged war criminal who's pleaded guilty

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:29.560
and we'll see what the outcome of that trial

01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:32.080
inside Ukraine is of a lower level official,

01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:34.960
not obviously Vladimir Putin,

01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:36.880
but the commander of a tank group.

01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:42.720
So, yes, the names are eerily familiar.

01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:50.480
Izium, Kharkiv, Kiev, right?

01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:55.680
Those are the names we know from the Nazi invasion

01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:58.560
and the Nazi occupation of Ukraine.

01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:02.920
And it's very deeply troubling

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:05.000
to think that this could happen again.

01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:09.480
And there's a bizarre sense that the Russians,

01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:13.480
claiming, as Putin says, to de-Nazify Ukraine,

01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:18.000
have invaded the same places that the Nazis invaded

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.960
back in 1941.

01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:22.600
As somebody who's working on volume three

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:28.400
of your work on Stalin, going through this period,

01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:30.280
is it eerie to you?

01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:31.840
Yes, it is, Lex.

01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:32.680
That you're...

01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:35.400
I've written the chapters of volume three.

01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:37.760
I've drafted the chapters on the war.

01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:41.520
And as I said, the place names

01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:43.720
are very evocative, unfortunately.

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:48.680
But, you know, the Nazis failed, ultimately.

01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:54.720
They captured Ukraine for a time,

01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:57.720
but they were evicted from Ukraine.

01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:01.440
And it was massive partisan activity

01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:05.600
of partisan or guerrilla warfare resistance

01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:07.840
behind Nazi lines the whole time

01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:13.040
that they were allegedly in control of Ukraine.

01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:15.240
If you look at the maps on cable TV,

01:55:15.240 --> 01:55:17.240
they show you the sign of Russia,

01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:19.880
they show you the coloring, Russian control,

01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:22.400
and they draw a line and then it's colored in.

01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:24.680
But the word control is misplaced.

01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:27.120
They don't actually control it.

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:30.400
It's Russian claimed or extent

01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:34.640
of farthest Russian troop advancement.

01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:37.520
Because behind the Russian lines in Ukraine,

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:41.000
Crimea accepted, you have insurgencies,

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.360
you have the armed insurgency.

01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:45.560
In Melitopol, for example,

01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:49.240
which is a place that you know, in Southeastern Ukraine,

01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:53.480
there is a guerrilla war now underway

01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:57.880
to hurt the Russians who are in occupation

01:55:57.880 --> 01:55:59.280
of that city and region.

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:02.720
And we're gonna see that continue,

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:06.600
even if the war becomes a stalemate,

01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:09.760
even if it's stalemates more or less

01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:11.920
at the lines we're at now,

01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:16.920
which would mean that anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive

01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:19.440
at scale proves unsuccessful.

01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:21.840
The Russian army doesn't disintegrate

01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:25.760
and you end up with a stalemate

01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:28.400
where there could be a ceasefire or not a ceasefire,

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:30.600
but neither side is attempting an offensive

01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:32.480
for the time being.

01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:36.360
There will be resistance behind those Russian lines

01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:38.720
and it will be fierce resistance,

01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:42.240
the kind of resistance we saw to the Nazi occupation.

01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:46.360
Ultimately, it took the Red Army

01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:50.520
reinvading the territory of Ukraine

01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:55.520
and succeeding at combined arms operations at scale,

01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:57.920
a massive counteroffensive,

01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:01.200
much larger than anything we're talking about today.

01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:02.800
Ultimately, it required that

01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:05.560
to evict the Nazis from Ukraine.

01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:06.560
But in the meantime,

01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:09.760
they did not have an easy occupation regime there.

01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:16.720
Ukrainian partisans, Soviet partisans,

01:57:17.080 --> 01:57:21.400
killed Nazi officials, Wehrmacht soldiers,

01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:22.800
Wehrmacht officers,

01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:27.600
blew up the infrastructure they were using,

01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:30.960
made them pay a price for their occupation.

01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:33.600
We could well see,

01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:36.400
if unfortunately this ends in a stalemate

01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:38.160
for the time being,

01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:41.400
we could well see that type of insurgency

01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:43.880
gain momentum behind Russian lines

01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:48.040
and try to evict the Russians that way

01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:52.600
and then remount the counteroffensive at scale

01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:54.640
later on in the future,

01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:57.520
if the first one doesn't succeed.

01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:01.000
So that would be further echoes

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.040
of the World War II experience.

01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:05.880
The scale, once again, is much smaller.

01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:08.160
The size of the armies here,

01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:13.160
they're not in the many 800,000, 700,000,

01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:15.400
a million two, a million four,

01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:18.080
that's not what we're talking about today.

01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:21.360
But the weapons, the cruise missiles,

01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:27.360
artillery fire, artillery fire used to be very inaccurate

01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:29.440
and it was like saturation.

01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:31.920
You would just fire towards the enemy lines

01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:33.560
and if you hit something, you hit something

01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:36.080
and if you didn't, you just kept firing.

01:58:36.920 --> 01:58:39.600
Now you have drones, Lex.

01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:43.040
And so artillery fire is now sniper fire

01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:46.040
because you can coordinate the direction

01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:49.560
of the artillery fire with the drones.

01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:52.280
The drones can take a picture and show you

01:58:52.280 --> 01:58:55.440
where the enemy is precisely located

01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:58.880
and you can align that artillery to hit them

01:58:58.880 --> 01:59:02.240
instead of just indiscriminately bombing an area,

01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:03.960
a territory.

01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:08.360
And the NATO supplied artillery goes really far

01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:11.560
and you can fire into Russian positions

01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:15.240
and yourself not be exposed to Russian fire

01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:20.240
because your artillery fires farther than theirs.

01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:24.680
So that's coming and we're gonna see that in action.

01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:27.560
And so the scale is not the same,

01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:30.520
but the weapons, the precision of some of the weapons

01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:31.680
and some of the NATO.

01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:34.040
We're not sending all of our stuff,

01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:37.520
but as I said, the dynamic is Russia commits atrocities,

01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:40.280
Russia bombs schools, Russia bombs hospitals,

01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:44.880
Russia kills civilians and more and heavier

01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:49.000
and more lethal Western weapons go to Ukraine.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.600
Their willingness to risk their lives

01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:55.840
is really so impressive and the reason that we,

01:59:55.840 --> 02:00:00.840
it's our duty, we're obliged to supply those weapons.

02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:03.600
And so the Russians don't have that resupply

02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:05.040
and the Ukrainians do.

02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:09.280
And so the Russians are now digging in Lex,

02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:12.040
they're digging in deeply in the areas

02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:15.560
that they've penetrated and they're trying to build

02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:20.560
unassailable positions for when the Ukrainians transition

02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:26.440
from mostly defense to full scale offense.

02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:28.880
And we'll see if that now, I mean,

02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:32.840
they're digging everywhere, as they say,

02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:34.760
kapayut, kapayut, right?

02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:36.400
They're digging everywhere behind.

02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:37.720
Your Russian is beautiful.

02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:41.120
Digging in, I wish Lex like yours.

02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:44.760
But so there are these things that we can't predict,

02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:46.320
but there are these things we're watching

02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:47.640
and watching closely.

02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:53.440
And on top of that, something that's not in World War II

02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:56.280
or for the most part is cyber attacks and cyber warfare,

02:00:56.280 --> 02:01:00.440
which is much less perhaps

02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:05.320
convertible into human words,

02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:08.320
because it happens so quickly, it's such large scales,

02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:10.480
so difficult to trace and all those kinds of things.

02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:14.560
It's not bullets, it's electrical signals and that.

02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:18.480
Yeah, but those Ukrainian people, they're like you Lex.

02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:23.080
They're young and they're technically really proficient.

02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:25.000
And they've been amazing.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.480
You know, they spent those teenage years in the basement,

02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:30.600
playing video games.

02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:31.440
Not that.

02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:32.760
Turns out it's useful after all.

02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:35.040
It turns out it's more than useful.

02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:37.560
You can save your country that way.

02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:39.320
And so they're not alone.

02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:43.400
They're getting support and that support is important.

02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:46.240
But really predominantly it's Ukrainians

02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:48.280
on the cyber battlefield

02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:50.360
and their skills have been very impressive

02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:53.280
and they've been preparing for this for a number of years.

02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:58.280
And they have a whole army of young people on the cyber side.

02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:00.320
It's their civilian population.

02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:02.760
These are not people conscripted into the military

02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:05.920
or volunteering wearing the uniform.

02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:07.960
And so even in cyber warfare,

02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:11.440
the Ukrainians have been extremely impressive.

02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:16.440
And so let's remember that all of these aspects of warfare,

02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:22.880
whether it's how far your cruise missiles go

02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:24.840
and how accurate they are,

02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:28.240
what size your cyber capabilities are.

02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:31.880
It's really ultimately about the people.

02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:34.640
It's about the human capital, right?

02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:39.480
It's about their willingness, their skill level,

02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:41.560
but also their willingness to fight

02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:43.560
and to put their lives on the line.

02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:45.800
And there's no substitute for that.

02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:50.640
And so what's called morale or courage or bravery or valor,

02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:54.240
that's really the ultimately decisive

02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:59.240
provided you have enough sufficient arms, right?

02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:01.160
To conduct the fight.

02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:04.560
And if you don't, you use a Molotov cocktail, right?

02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:06.760
Grandma calls in the coordinates

02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:09.640
of the Russian tank on her iPhone

02:03:10.760 --> 02:03:13.840
and you have a Molotov cocktail

02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:18.760
that the people who used to work in the cafeteria

02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:22.160
are now stuffing flammable liquid into bottles

02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:23.920
and you carry one right up to the tank

02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:25.440
and you smash it against the tank

02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:29.440
or you drop it in one of the hatches in the tank, right?

02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:33.440
There's no substitute for that kind of stuff,

02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:38.160
that level of resolve, willingness to die for your country.

02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:40.320
That's a really big lesson

02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:43.640
that we need to absorb in our own country.

02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:48.240
We've been going to war more frequently than we should.

02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:51.600
And like you said, without the justification all the time.

02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:53.840
And then like Henry Kissinger said,

02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:57.040
without understanding how this was gonna end.

02:03:57.040 --> 02:03:58.960
It's easy to start a war.

02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:00.920
It's very difficult to win a war,

02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:03.400
prevail in a war or end a war on terms

02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:07.600
that meet your original expectations, right?

02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:09.960
We've been fighting wars,

02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:13.720
but we haven't been fighting wars as societies.

02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:16.440
We've been fighting wars as a small sliver

02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:18.440
of our population.

02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:20.960
Something like 1% of our population

02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:22.440
is involved with the military

02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:24.880
because we have an all volunteer force.

02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:27.800
And that means that it's easier

02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:30.440
for our politicians to go to war

02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:34.280
because they don't face conscription.

02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:36.440
They don't have the draft,

02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:39.560
which affects every family in the country.

02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:44.560
And because the number of people in the volunteer force

02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:49.520
is such a narrow stratum of the population.

02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:51.960
And so they've been getting away with this

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.680
because the professional army

02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:56.160
is much better than the conscript army.

02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:58.960
And an all volunteer force is much preferable

02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:01.240
from a military point of view.

02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:03.400
But from a societal point of view,

02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:09.320
it enables you to go to war too easily as a politician.

02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:11.720
And it doesn't engage the society

02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:14.160
the same way that the Ukrainian society

02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:18.320
is completely engaged from those young hackers

02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:20.840
all the way up to those grandmothers.

02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:23.400
Let me ask you, you're a scholar of history,

02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:25.160
a scholar of geopolitics,

02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:30.160
and you're also a human being.

02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:32.640
That's kind of you Lex, I'll take that.

02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:36.680
What's the value, what's the hope,

02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:39.680
what's the power of conversation here?

02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:41.920
If you could sit down with Vladimir Putin

02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:46.920
and have a conversation versus bullets,

02:05:47.080 --> 02:05:51.200
human exchange words, is there hope for those?

02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:53.160
And if so, what would you talk about?

02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:54.280
What would you ask him?

02:05:55.680 --> 02:05:58.840
Well, Henry Kissinger, you alluded to his op-ed,

02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:01.640
he's had many private meetings with President Putin

02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:06.200
over a long time.

02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:11.200
And President Biden, the previous presidents,

02:06:11.240 --> 02:06:15.040
the previous presidents, secretaries of state,

02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:19.040
officials below secretary of state,

02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:23.320
the head of the CIA evidently met with President Putin

02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:27.960
in the fall when he was massing the troops on the border

02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:29.280
before he invaded.

02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:34.920
And we sent the head of the CIA and Putin received him.

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:37.000
Somebody he evidently respects

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.240
or was at least willing to meet,

02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:41.400
unlike other members of the administration.

02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:46.080
So a lot of people are talking to him in some form

02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:49.840
or another for the 22 years he's been in power.

02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:55.320
And I'm not sure it's had what I would call

02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:57.400
their desired effect.

02:06:57.400 --> 02:07:00.000
Well, the nature of the conversation is interesting too

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.640
and also the timing which is post February 22nd

02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:07.480
is a different time and also another aspect.

02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:12.680
Which Oliver Stone mentioned interestingly,

02:07:12.680 --> 02:07:15.920
that there's something about COVID and the pandemic

02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:18.560
that creates isolation, the distancing.

02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:21.680
It's such a silly little nuance thing,

02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:25.720
but maybe it's actually has a profound impact

02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:29.200
on the human being, the human mind of Vladimir Putin,

02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:32.160
that there is something about an in-person meeting

02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:35.520
and not across a table that's far too large.

02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:38.880
But sort of the intimacy of one human to human

02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:40.480
in-person conversation,

02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:43.840
that there's something distinctly powerful

02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:48.840
about that reminder that as Putin says in the narrative

02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:52.200
in the propaganda, that we're all one people.

02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:54.000
There is truth to that.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:57.280
That this entirety of humanity is one people

02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:59.600
and you kind of reminded by that

02:07:59.600 --> 02:08:01.160
when you're sitting together.

02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:06.440
People who have sat across the table from him,

02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:10.400
whether at 30 yards or at three,

02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:15.680
have remarked upon this feeling of isolation

02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:18.880
that has affected him, the pandemic.

02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:21.160
I think there must be something to that

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:25.040
if several people who've been in the room with him

02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:26.240
are remarking on it.

02:08:27.880 --> 02:08:31.200
Everybody that I know and I've been able to talk to

02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:34.160
who's had a meeting with him in the past 10 years,

02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:39.120
including Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state,

02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:44.520
has said that Putin spends a lot of time

02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:47.400
enumerating his grievances.

02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:52.400
He goes through a monologue of his grievances

02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:54.000
and then the West did this

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.880
and then the West lied to us about that

02:08:56.880 --> 02:08:59.640
and then the West cheated us on this.

02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:03.360
And so it's not the conversation

02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:06.520
that you're encouraging of common humanity.

02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:10.520
It's that roiling resentment volcano

02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:12.800
that's just exploding and exploding.

02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:14.120
The resentment.

02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:19.080
And by the time he gets through the monologue

02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:22.000
of the grievances, the time of the meeting

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.080
is expired or over time.

02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:26.520
That's a brilliant statement,

02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:29.280
but that's where the skill of conversation comes in.

02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:32.840
When you're facing a bull with a red cloth,

02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:35.480
you have to learn how to avoid the long list of grievances

02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:37.320
and get to the humanity.

02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:39.120
That's a really important skill.

02:09:39.120 --> 02:09:40.880
It's a skill, for sure it's a skill

02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:44.080
and it's the highest level skill of a diplomat

02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:47.720
to be able to reach some type of common understanding

02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:51.600
when interests and worldviews clash so much.

02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:53.600
But here's your challenge, Lex.

02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:56.440
Your challenge is

02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:02.440
Russia wants to impose a closed sphere of influence

02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:05.160
on its neighbors.

02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:10.160
It wants to dictate what its neighbors can and can't do.

02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:12.560
It wants to exert influence,

02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:14.800
not by the power of its example,

02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:18.040
not by the freedom of its people,

02:10:18.040 --> 02:10:22.080
not by the dynamism of its diversified economy,

02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:24.400
but it wants to exert influence

02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:27.320
just because it deserves that,

02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:30.200
just because it's a great power,

02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:33.320
just because and on and on and on.

02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:36.160
It's a civilization unto itself.

02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:39.080
And it wants that and we can't give that.

02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:44.680
The reason that Russia was not integrated into the West

02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:46.120
was not for lack of trying.

02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:51.880
It was because Russia ultimately spurned the integration

02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:54.160
because it was about what terms

02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:56.480
the integration would come on.

02:10:56.480 --> 02:11:00.080
Would you come into the West and observe Western rules

02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:06.080
and be another country, meaning just another country?

02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:10.600
There's Poland and there's Austria

02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:15.600
and there's little tiny Monaco and there's Russia.

02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:19.480
And you're just one of those countries.

02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:21.920
And Russia's answer to that was no,

02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:24.440
we're not just one of those countries.

02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:26.640
We need special rules.

02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:29.400
We need special conditions.

02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:33.400
We'll integrate, but only as a special country,

02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:38.400
meaning like at the UN where all countries are sovereign,

02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:40.400
all countries are members,

02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:44.840
but Russia has a veto on what countries can and can't do.

02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:48.840
Those were the terms on which they were willing to integrate.

02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:52.280
And those were the terms that no leader of a Western country

02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:56.800
or the United States or the G7 or fill in the blank

02:11:56.800 --> 02:11:58.120
can grant to Russia.

02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:03.840
It's very well known that Vladimir Putin

02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:06.520
was one of the first, maybe the first person,

02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:10.440
first leader, foreign leader to call President Bush

02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:13.440
after the 9-11 tragedy.

02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:15.480
They didn't connect right away.

02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:17.880
President Bush was not in Washington,

02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:20.280
but eventually they did speak.

02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:22.040
He condemned the terrorist attack.

02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:24.280
He offered Russian support,

02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:28.560
which he delivered on the use of some Russian logistics

02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:32.200
for our Afghanistan operations.

02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:35.400
And a lot of people point to that and they say,

02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:39.160
there it is, Russia wanted to cooperate

02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:43.240
and did cooperate and we spurn them

02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:47.560
or we fail to appreciate Russia's cooperation.

02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:51.400
And so therefore Russia was cheated or Russia was lied to

02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:53.560
or Russia's grievances are legitimate.

02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:57.040
But here's the problem with that argument, Lex.

02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:00.440
In exchange for that support,

02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:05.080
Vladimir Putin asked in return from President Bush

02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:09.320
for a free hand in the former Soviet space

02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:13.320
that closed hierarchical sphere of influence

02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:17.480
where Russia would exert influence coercively

02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:19.240
over countries that were sovereign.

02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:23.560
And no American president could grant that

02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:25.040
and President Bush was right.

02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:25.960
He said no.

02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:30.880
And so the attempted cooperation blew up.

02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:33.320
But who's at fault there?

02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:40.760
Should there be a non-voluntary sphere of influence?

02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:42.000
Should that be granted?

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:46.800
Or should you face up to attempts to do that?

02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:52.440
Let's take a little detour here into China for a second.

02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:56.680
China had this brilliant grand strategy,

02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:01.760
which was, sure, America is hostile

02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:03.600
because America is hegemonic.

02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:05.800
America wants to control the world.

02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:07.840
America will never let China rise.

02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:11.400
America will do everything it can to hold China down.

02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:14.960
So we're gonna have hostility from America.

02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:16.800
We don't wanna decouple

02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:20.520
because we need that high-end technology transfer.

02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:22.320
Either we buy it or we steal it

02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:24.160
because America and the rest of the West

02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:26.640
has all the technology that we need.

02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:29.120
We have some of it domestically,

02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:31.120
more than before by a lot,

02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:33.960
but we're still dependent so we can't decouple.

02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:35.640
So we'll have the hostility,

02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:37.480
but there'll be a line we don't cross

02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:40.160
just so that we don't lose the technology transfer.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:45.680
Till Made in China 2035 is accomplished,

02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:48.440
and we're self-sufficient domestically

02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:51.000
in AI and every other area that's critical,

02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:53.960
but hostility from America.

02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:55.920
But we have an ace in the hole.

02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:58.120
Our ace in the hole is Europe.

02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:00.160
Europe hates conflict.

02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:01.600
They're all about trade.

02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:04.760
It doesn't matter how evil you are.

02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:07.120
They love to trade because

02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:10.640
vandel dur handel, change through trade.

02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:12.200
They have this illusion that

02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:15.600
you're gonna become a better country if they trade with you

02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:18.080
and you won't have conflict, war, and hostilities

02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:19.520
if you trade.

02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:22.520
And so we have this European ace in the hole.

02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:24.360
We're hostile with the Americans.

02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:27.920
We're still buying or stealing their technology.

02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:29.720
And better than that even,

02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:32.720
the Europeans are not hostile to us at all.

02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:35.200
They love to trade with us and they wanna trade more

02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:38.240
and they're our biggest trading partner already.

02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:39.200
And lo and behold,

02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:41.800
Xi Jinping sides with Vladimir Putin

02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:45.120
in the aggression in Ukraine.

02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:49.360
He doesn't side with him providing military equipment.

02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:52.000
He doesn't provide technology transfer,

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.680
but he provides public support

02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:58.120
and massive pro-Russian propaganda

02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:00.000
to the whole Chinese population.

02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:04.360
And the Europeans say, wait a minute,

02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:07.680
this is an invasion of a sovereign country in Europe.

02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:08.680
What do you mean?

02:16:09.640 --> 02:16:13.000
You're not condemning Vladimir Putin's invasion.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.760
And so that wedge that the Chinese had,

02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:18.440
that was the basis of their grand strategy,

02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:21.160
that wedge between the US and Europe

02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:23.120
when it came to China policy,

02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:24.920
that wedge is gone now.

02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:27.200
Xi Jinping destroyed it.

02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:29.240
And the Europeans and the Americans

02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:31.400
are coming close together

02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:34.800
on Ukraine and Russia policy for sure,

02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:37.480
but also more and more on China policy.

02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:40.800
And so that was a pretty big sacrifice

02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:42.800
for the Chinese leader to make.

02:16:42.800 --> 02:16:44.280
And what did he get in return?

02:16:45.480 --> 02:16:50.040
He gets hydrocarbons from Russia at reduced prices

02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:53.720
and the Chinese get hydrocarbons from a lot of countries.

02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:58.760
They have a completely diverse supply chain

02:16:58.760 --> 02:16:59.720
for their energy.

02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:02.160
So what do you think Xi Jinping is thinking now?

02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:04.560
Was it a mistake?

02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:06.200
I'd like to know, Lex.

02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:08.640
I'd like you to be able to sit down with him

02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:11.520
across from this table here on your podcast

02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:13.440
and pose that same question to him

02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:14.800
because we have no idea.

02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:16.760
There's a language barrier that's fascinating.

02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:20.160
By the way, you as a scholar of Stalin,

02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:21.600
do you think we'll ever break through

02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:24.160
the language barrier to China?

02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:27.200
Not ever, I apologize, in the next few years

02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:30.880
because there is a gigantic cultural and language barrier

02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:32.400
between the West and China.

02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:34.560
China's a great civilization.

02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:39.560
China predates the United States by millennia.

02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:42.560
China's accomplishments are breathtaking,

02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:46.280
but China's also led by, let's be honest,

02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:48.560
a communist party monopoly,

02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:53.000
which engages in a lot of criminal behavior.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:56.240
Lex, Tibet is Ukraine.

02:17:57.320 --> 02:17:59.800
Xinjiang is Ukraine.

02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:03.320
Hong Kong is Ukraine,

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.280
let alone support for Putin.

02:18:07.280 --> 02:18:09.600
This is before we've even discussed Taiwan.

02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:13.280
And so now the Europeans are coming to see this

02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:16.360
and the Americans are coming to understand this,

02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:20.120
that maybe trading with a regime like that,

02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:25.560
morally, politically, criminally,

02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:28.680
Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong,

02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:31.960
how is that different from what Putin is doing in Ukraine?

02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:35.760
I'd be hard-pressed to differentiate that ultimately,

02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:38.720
even though the analogies are not exact.

02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:43.720
And so the Chinese, it's like that guy Leonov,

02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:46.160
the author of Likhaletia,

02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:50.880
the great memoir of the late Soviet period,

02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:52.800
the end of the Soviet Union.

02:18:52.800 --> 02:18:55.160
You know, that they spend all this time

02:18:55.760 --> 02:18:58.200
and all these resources blackening our image,

02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:00.520
but we supply them with endless material

02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:02.360
to blacken our image.

02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:05.760
That's where Xi Jinping's regime is right now, Lex.

02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:09.640
And so they have a big dilemma on their side.

02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:11.760
It's a Western world

02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:14.320
and they've united the Western world

02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:19.320
and reawoken the Western world

02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:23.680
to the fact that China is a threat

02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:27.720
to the values, the institutions and values of the West.

02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:31.120
And that trade is not transforming China quite the opposite.

02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:34.120
We'll see if this endures.

02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:35.440
Maybe it doesn't endure.

02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:36.960
Maybe it's a fleeting moment.

02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:39.640
Maybe this is not an inflection point.

02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:43.880
Maybe the war in Ukraine ends more quickly than we think.

02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:45.680
And maybe, like you said,

02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:48.240
the Chinese and the Indians and the rest of them,

02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:50.800
the leaders there, they get their wish that it ends

02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:53.520
and the world moves on.

02:19:53.520 --> 02:19:55.960
And forgets or says,

02:19:55.960 --> 02:20:00.960
let's try again to resume our mutual understanding,

02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:04.920
our mutually beneficial trade and everything else.

02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:06.440
Maybe it's a passing phase.

02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:07.440
We can't exclude that.

02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:10.560
I'm very poor at predicting the future.

02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:14.880
But the moment is not a good one for the Chinese regime,

02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:18.600
let alone the fact that he's trying to impose

02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:23.640
an unprecedented in the modern era third term

02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:26.000
for himself as president in the fall

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.280
at the next party Congress,

02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:33.280
becoming president for life de facto, a Mao-like figure.

02:20:35.280 --> 02:20:40.280
And he's now got to do that in this environment

02:20:40.920 --> 02:20:45.000
where he has damaged Chinese grand strategy

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.560
and damaged the reputation of China

02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:51.040
and its relationships across the world.

02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:53.840
Maybe not permanently, but significantly.

02:20:54.760 --> 02:20:58.960
In addition to the problems they have at home, demography,

02:20:58.960 --> 02:21:02.320
as you know, a middle income trap,

02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:07.320
and then the regulatory insanity of Chinese communist rule

02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:10.800
that we've seen with the tech companies that you know well

02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:12.920
where they've destroyed all of that value

02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:17.160
with the blow up of their property sector

02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:21.960
because it was a massive bubble and that's still playing out.

02:21:21.960 --> 02:21:24.160
And this time it's the same,

02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:27.040
meaning this time it's not different.

02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:29.040
When it comes to a property blowout,

02:21:29.040 --> 02:21:33.240
it has enormous effects on middle-class balance sheets

02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:37.600
and their ability to remain consumers

02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:38.840
and drive the economy,

02:21:38.840 --> 02:21:40.920
which is the model that they have to share.

02:21:40.920 --> 02:21:43.800
So he's got a litany of challenges,

02:21:43.880 --> 02:21:48.880
independent even of the fact that he sided with his pal,

02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:54.320
Vladimir Putin, and their bromance is costing China

02:21:54.320 --> 02:21:56.040
very, very significantly.

02:21:56.040 --> 02:21:58.760
If you close your eyes.

02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:00.040
Yes.

02:22:00.040 --> 02:22:03.640
And a hundred years ago in 1922

02:22:03.640 --> 02:22:06.000
and you think about the future,

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.400
I wonder if you can hear the drums of war

02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:11.920
predicting the 30s,

02:22:11.920 --> 02:22:15.640
predicting the Great Depression

02:22:15.640 --> 02:22:18.640
and the resentment that builds,

02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:21.480
the economic resentment, the cultural resentment,

02:22:21.480 --> 02:22:23.440
the geopolitical resentment that builds

02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:25.080
and leads to World War II.

02:22:26.720 --> 02:22:28.960
At least to me, when I close my eyes,

02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:33.400
I can hear the drums of war that are still ahead of us.

02:22:33.400 --> 02:22:34.880
And it's possible that

02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:40.720
where there, 2022 will materialize in a similar way

02:22:42.440 --> 02:22:44.080
as did 1922.

02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:47.000
I have my eyes closed, Lex.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:48.080
Do you hear anything?

02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:50.960
And I sure hope that that's not what happened.

02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:56.720
But I'm looking at 1922, it's an epoch I know well.

02:22:56.720 --> 02:23:00.200
And I don't see the future that unfolds.

02:23:00.200 --> 02:23:02.960
I would not have predicted it had I been alive then.

02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:07.640
I see the war behind us.

02:23:07.640 --> 02:23:11.000
I see a prosperity on the horizon.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.440
Yes, inflation in Germany

02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:16.800
and some many other difficult issues,

02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:19.360
but there are more democracies now

02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:20.760
than there were before the war

02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:23.240
and the old empires are gone.

02:23:23.240 --> 02:23:25.440
And there's a cultural efflorescence

02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:28.040
and there's modernism in the arts

02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:30.400
and there's women entering the public sphere.

02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:32.680
And there's all this fantastic new technology

02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:38.200
like automobiles and I'm looking at the future from 1922.

02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:40.720
And I'm not seeing the Great Depression

02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:42.320
and I'm not seeing World War II

02:23:42.320 --> 02:23:44.680
and I'm not seeing the Holocaust

02:23:44.680 --> 02:23:48.040
because I don't predict the future

02:23:48.040 --> 02:23:51.160
and nobody in 1922 could see that future,

02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:54.240
although I guess there were some clairvoyants

02:23:54.240 --> 02:23:56.280
who predicted it, but.

02:23:56.280 --> 02:23:57.680
But you're not one of them.

02:23:57.680 --> 02:23:58.920
I'm not one of them.

02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:03.400
But this is what I know, Lex, from studying history.

02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:05.520
What I know is stuff happens.

02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:10.520
In other words, Lex, we're watching Ukraine war right now

02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:16.080
and all of our attention is focused on that.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.600
And it's like the economists say in their textbooks

02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:24.080
when their powerful models are employed

02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:26.160
and there's this line that says

02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:29.560
all other factors held constant,

02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:33.440
and then the model works.

02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:35.200
And you get this really great result.

02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:40.200
It's very powerful predictor and analysis, the model.

02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:44.320
And the whole game is all other factors held constant.

02:24:45.460 --> 02:24:48.280
So the Russia-Ukraine war that we've been discussing

02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:50.680
and this could happen and that could happen,

02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:53.120
but you know what stuff could happen, Lex?

02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:58.080
For example, the Israeli government could decide this summer

02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:00.240
that it's gonna bomb Iran

02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:03.480
because no Israeli government will tolerate Iran

02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:05.840
acquiring a nuclear weapon.

02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:10.240
And since President Trump exited, unilaterally exited

02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:14.560
from the multi-power nuclear agreement,

02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:17.160
Iran is now much closer to the bomb than they were

02:25:18.300 --> 02:25:19.140
when they were still in,

02:25:19.140 --> 02:25:22.080
when the United States was still in that agreement.

02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:24.200
And you tell me the Israeli government that says,

02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:26.880
sure, it's fine, it's okay, Iran can get the bomb.

02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:29.760
And so maybe that happens.

02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:31.800
And maybe that happens as early as this summer

02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:35.720
as Iran gets closer and closer and closer to the bomb.

02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:40.720
Maybe that guy in North Korea decides it's his time,

02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:45.720
just like his grandfather in 1950 decided it's time,

02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:50.720
we're gonna quote, reunify, unquote, the Korean peninsula.

02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:56.000
Maybe, I don't know, Lex, fill in the blank,

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:57.400
something's gonna happen,

02:25:57.400 --> 02:25:59.240
it's not gonna be what I predict,

02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:01.880
it's not gonna be what I'm watching,

02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:05.600
it's gonna be obvious only after it happens, not before.

02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:08.720
And then it's gonna upend the table.

02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:12.080
And all of a sudden-

02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:12.920
Everything changes.

02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:14.680
We're gonna be in a different environment,

02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:15.960
different circumstances.

02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:20.960
And is Ukraine still as central at that point

02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:23.200
as it seems to be right now?

02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:24.880
I don't know the answer to that question.

02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:28.040
Let me ask two rapid fire questions.

02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:29.600
You're only allowed to have one minute

02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:32.160
and it's about predicting the future.

02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:36.400
Okay, question one, Vladimir Putin,

02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:39.760
when will he no longer be in office?

02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:43.300
And will he step down or be overthrown?

02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:46.440
What's your prediction

02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:49.400
and a brief explanation of that prediction?

02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:52.000
Now, nobody can predict the future,

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:53.560
but what's your sense now?

02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:56.880
Some people are saying the pressure is building,

02:26:56.880 --> 02:26:59.560
he's going to be overthrown or stepped down

02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:01.080
at the end of this year.

02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:04.520
And some people say surely he's going

02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:09.200
to outlast Stalin's rule of 30 plus years.

02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:11.240
No evidence of a coup yet.

02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:16.520
None whatsoever, yet.

02:27:17.520 --> 02:27:22.400
He's pretty much at life expectancy for a Russian male.

02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:25.600
Those are bad numbers.

02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:29.280
He's 69, gonna be 70.

02:27:29.280 --> 02:27:32.640
So he's lived the life of a Russian male already,

02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:35.000
but he's got better doctors

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.400
than the majority of the Russian males

02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:42.760
in that, let's say, comparison set.

02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:46.360
So he could live a very long time with good doctors.

02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:49.720
So there could be a coup at some point,

02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:54.360
but there's none today in evidence.

02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:58.400
He could go because he's reached the life expectancy

02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:01.000
or he could stay for a long time.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:04.160
The thing to watch about this

02:28:04.160 --> 02:28:08.560
is an organization that nobody pays attention to,

02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:12.760
the FSO, the Federalnaya Sluzba Ochrannaya,

02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:15.120
which is the Praetorian Guard,

02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:18.680
the Self-Standing Bodyguard Directorate,

02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:21.880
the only one, the only organization in Russia

02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:24.280
that has any access to him.

02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:28.680
We've seen no disloyalty, no breaking of ranks,

02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:32.000
no defections, nothing in the public realm

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:35.680
in open sources about any divisions

02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:39.880
or problems in the FSO, in the Praetorian Guard.

02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:43.480
So if you can't break that, change that

02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:50.160
illicit defections there, you can't overturn him.

02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:52.880
Authoritarian regimes, Lex, they're terrible.

02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:54.720
They fail at everything.

02:28:54.720 --> 02:28:57.520
They can't feed their people.

02:28:57.520 --> 02:29:00.760
They have trouble achieving any goals.

02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:03.200
They only have to be good, however, at one thing.

02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:06.800
They only have to be good at the complete suppression

02:29:06.800 --> 02:29:08.960
of political alternatives.

02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:12.400
If you can suppress political alternatives,

02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:14.520
you can fail at everything else,

02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:17.640
but you can survive as an authoritarian regime.

02:29:17.640 --> 02:29:19.520
So you watch Navalny.

02:29:19.520 --> 02:29:21.720
He's still alive.

02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:23.920
Okay, Lex, you go for it.

02:29:23.920 --> 02:29:26.760
That's my second rapid-fire question

02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:28.360
is what happens to Navalny?

02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:30.200
What are the possible conclusions

02:29:30.200 --> 02:29:32.200
of what you said quite possibly

02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:36.240
the second most influential, powerful figure in Russia?

02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:41.000
Is he going to die in jail?

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:44.040
Will he become the next president of Russia?

02:29:44.040 --> 02:29:45.840
Well, what are the possible?

02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:47.480
I wish I knew, Lex.

02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:50.520
I've been surprised that he's still alive.

02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:54.760
I've been worried that he will be killed in prison

02:29:54.760 --> 02:29:56.160
in a staged fight.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:01.680
Some security officer, prison guard

02:30:01.680 --> 02:30:04.360
puts on a prison outfit, takes a lead pipe,

02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:05.320
goes into the cell.

02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:08.680
They have a, quote, fight, and Navalny is killed.

02:30:08.680 --> 02:30:11.600
I've been afraid of that, but he's still alive,

02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:14.480
even though he's serving a long sentence.

02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:17.320
So that leads me to guess

02:30:17.320 --> 02:30:20.040
that people inside the Putin regime

02:30:20.040 --> 02:30:23.520
and maybe President Putin himself understand

02:30:23.520 --> 02:30:27.520
that Navalny is their ticket to lift sanctions,

02:30:28.520 --> 02:30:33.520
that Navalny is even more popular outside of Russia

02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:35.320
than he is inside of Russia.

02:30:35.320 --> 02:30:37.600
He's the leader in many ways

02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:41.040
of the political opposition in the country,

02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:42.760
even while still in prison.

02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:45.480
His organization's been destroyed,

02:30:45.480 --> 02:30:48.760
but he doesn't have majority support in the population

02:30:48.760 --> 02:30:50.360
by any stretch of the imagination.

02:30:50.360 --> 02:30:52.760
But he's a big figure in the West,

02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:55.000
including here in the US.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.480
And so Navalny could be their ticket.

02:30:58.480 --> 02:31:00.040
Their get-out-of-jail card,

02:31:00.040 --> 02:31:02.600
meaning they release him from prison.

02:31:02.600 --> 02:31:04.800
He gets appointed, I don't know, prime minister,

02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:06.560
even by the Putin regime,

02:31:06.560 --> 02:31:09.480
if he were willing to accept such a position.

02:31:09.480 --> 02:31:11.640
And I have my doubts about that.

02:31:11.640 --> 02:31:14.480
And then that's how they lobby

02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:17.240
to remove the sanctions against them.

02:31:17.240 --> 02:31:20.440
So he's a card that President Putin could play.

02:31:21.680 --> 02:31:24.880
And so maybe that's the reason he's still alive,

02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:28.560
or maybe there are other reasons that we don't know.

02:31:28.560 --> 02:31:31.880
And so some alternative to Putin

02:31:31.880 --> 02:31:36.640
is more likely to arise inside his gang,

02:31:37.440 --> 02:31:39.680
Putin's shayka, as they say, right,

02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:44.680
inside his gang, where they tire of his mistakes,

02:31:45.800 --> 02:31:49.400
they tire of his self-defeating actions,

02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:52.340
and they say, patriotically for Russia,

02:31:53.340 --> 02:31:57.100
we need to do something against, move against this guy

02:31:57.100 --> 02:32:00.060
because he's hurting our country,

02:32:00.060 --> 02:32:02.460
and also because I could do better.

02:32:02.460 --> 02:32:05.860
I'm ambitious as well as patriotic.

02:32:05.860 --> 02:32:07.940
But once again, the problem there, Alex,

02:32:07.940 --> 02:32:12.940
is Putin is surrounded by this cocoon known as the FSO.

02:32:15.660 --> 02:32:18.660
He meets on Zoom predominantly

02:32:18.660 --> 02:32:20.020
with the rest of the government,

02:32:20.020 --> 02:32:24.020
including with the defense and security officials.

02:32:24.020 --> 02:32:27.860
They don't have frequent access to his person.

02:32:27.860 --> 02:32:31.420
And as you were alluding earlier to the pandemic,

02:32:31.420 --> 02:32:33.320
they have to quarantine for two weeks

02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:35.460
before every meeting with him.

02:32:35.460 --> 02:32:37.420
And moreover, you know, Alex,

02:32:37.420 --> 02:32:39.700
they don't know where he is.

02:32:39.700 --> 02:32:44.220
You see, when they're on Zoom with him and the room,

02:32:45.580 --> 02:32:46.740
it's the Valdai.

02:32:47.740 --> 02:32:51.940
His office in the Valdai region looks the same

02:32:51.940 --> 02:32:55.260
as his office in Sochi,

02:32:55.260 --> 02:32:58.420
or his office outside of Moscow and Novgorod.

02:32:58.420 --> 02:33:00.720
They're made up to look very similar on Zoom.

02:33:02.500 --> 02:33:05.780
And sure, some signs they're looking, where is it?

02:33:05.780 --> 02:33:08.500
But maybe they don't know.

02:33:08.500 --> 02:33:10.900
And so you're gonna move on him,

02:33:10.900 --> 02:33:13.660
and you're gonna jump him in his Kremlin,

02:33:13.660 --> 02:33:17.260
his dacha outside Moscow.

02:33:17.260 --> 02:33:20.260
And it turns out he's in Sochi or vice versa.

02:33:20.260 --> 02:33:23.260
And it turns out the FSO is loyal to him

02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:24.900
and won't let you anyway.

02:33:24.900 --> 02:33:27.620
So, Lex, we don't know,

02:33:27.620 --> 02:33:30.640
but we watch this FSO really closely.

02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:34.140
And we think that the elites, if not Putin,

02:33:34.140 --> 02:33:37.240
but maybe Putin too, understand Navalny

02:33:37.240 --> 02:33:40.420
as a really big potential political card

02:33:40.420 --> 02:33:41.980
that they could play.

02:33:41.980 --> 02:33:46.020
And one last question, the biggest question.

02:33:46.020 --> 02:33:49.340
You studied some of the darkest aspects

02:33:49.340 --> 02:33:52.180
of human history, human nature.

02:33:52.180 --> 02:33:54.600
Let me ask the why question.

02:33:54.600 --> 02:33:56.360
What are we doing here?

02:33:57.240 --> 02:34:01.840
What's the meaning of our existence, our life here on Earth?

02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:04.640
What are we humans trying to get at here?

02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:07.140
I can't answer that question either.

02:34:07.140 --> 02:34:11.340
But I can say that having a purposeful life

02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:14.340
is actually not that hard.

02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:18.820
You can't, you're not Gandhi, right?

02:34:18.820 --> 02:34:21.460
You're not President Roosevelt.

02:34:21.460 --> 02:34:25.240
You're not gonna transform a country or a civilization

02:34:25.240 --> 02:34:30.100
or become immortal because of your courage

02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:33.880
and your insight and your genius at critical moments.

02:34:34.880 --> 02:34:38.600
But you live in an environment, you're in a school,

02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:41.200
you're in a workplace,

02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:44.780
you're somewhere where you can affect other people

02:34:44.780 --> 02:34:46.680
in a positive way.

02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:50.160
It can be not just about yourself, but it can be about them.

02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:55.540
And you can have a positive impact on other people's lives

02:34:55.540 --> 02:34:57.320
through the work that you do,

02:34:57.320 --> 02:35:00.120
whether that's your employment or your charity,

02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:03.220
your spare time or your work time.

02:35:03.220 --> 02:35:07.220
It can be by modeling proper behavior, right?

02:35:07.220 --> 02:35:12.220
Admitting your mistakes, hard to do, but necessary.

02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:14.660
Remembering that you don't know everything,

02:35:14.660 --> 02:35:16.060
you can't predict the future,

02:35:16.060 --> 02:35:17.500
but you don't even know everything

02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:20.220
in your areas of expertise.

02:35:20.220 --> 02:35:23.660
Painfully reminded of that humility at times,

02:35:23.660 --> 02:35:25.980
but remind yourself too.

02:35:25.980 --> 02:35:30.980
So you can lead a life that can show others

02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:34.060
what good values are.

02:35:34.060 --> 02:35:37.580
And you can lead a life that dedicates yourself

02:35:37.580 --> 02:35:40.900
not only to your own material wellbeing,

02:35:40.900 --> 02:35:43.500
but to the wellbeing and to the development

02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:44.420
of others around you.

02:35:44.420 --> 02:35:47.300
And it can be on a humble scale.

02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:50.340
It can be in a small classroom or a small workplace,

02:35:50.340 --> 02:35:54.740
a small work team, but it can be done.

02:35:54.740 --> 02:35:58.720
And you can be reminded that having a positive impact,

02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:00.960
even on one other person,

02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:04.280
gives far greater meaning to your own life

02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:06.560
and is profoundly satisfying,

02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:10.880
much more satisfying than the attention you might get,

02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:15.340
let's say on social media or awards you might receive.

02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:17.760
There's nothing wrong with pursuing those.

02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:21.200
People pursue them and it's a free society.

02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:27.440
But leading a purposeful life intentionally is possible.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.600
Even just one person, I love the expression,

02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:33.400
save one life, save the world.

02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:36.520
Just focusing on the local,

02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:39.080
on the tiny little difference you can make in the world

02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:40.680
can somehow ripple.

02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:42.040
Every day.

02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:44.500
If you think about that every single day,

02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:47.680
you're a better person.

02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:49.520
We're a better society.

02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:52.200
And maybe you get to add a bit of love

02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:53.780
to the world after all.

02:36:54.780 --> 02:36:59.220
Steven, this is a huge honor for many reasons.

02:36:59.220 --> 02:37:01.740
One of which is I can just tell

02:37:01.740 --> 02:37:04.260
how much care you put into this conversation

02:37:04.260 --> 02:37:08.380
and how much, I use the word love a lot,

02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:12.760
but I just feel the love that,

02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:14.620
just even the respect you give me,

02:37:14.620 --> 02:37:17.820
which I can't tell you how energizing that is,

02:37:17.820 --> 02:37:19.900
how much that gives me strength

02:37:19.900 --> 02:37:22.600
for my own silly little pursuits.

02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:24.760
Thank you so much for doing that.

02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:26.280
Thank you for not just talking today,

02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:29.120
but giving me so much respect

02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:30.600
just with everything you're doing.

02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:32.280
I really appreciate that.

02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:33.720
It makes me feel special.

02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:35.200
So thank you so much for sitting down

02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:36.040
and talking to me.

02:37:36.040 --> 02:37:38.440
Mutual thanks, thank you as well,

02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:41.520
and thank you for the respect that you've shown me.

02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:43.320
These are really difficult issues

02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:45.600
that don't have simple answers.

02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:47.240
But that doesn't mean we give up.

02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:52.840
We have to keep thinking and learning and trying

02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:55.960
and finding solutions in everything we do,

02:37:55.960 --> 02:37:59.280
including on these big global tragedies

02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:00.960
that we live through.

02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:04.480
And it's heartbreaking what's going on.

02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:06.480
It just breaks my heart every day.

02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:08.000
A person who studies this,

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.680
I've been studying this for decades,

02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:12.000
and it keeps happening.

02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:16.360
And you think again, and yes, it is again,

02:38:16.760 --> 02:38:19.240
but we still have to keep trying.

02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:22.040
And we have to be inspired by those people

02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:24.200
who are more courageous than we are

02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:27.480
and sacrifice more than we sacrifice.

02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:30.600
For me, the Russian invasion of Ukraine,

02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:31.840
the war in Ukraine,

02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:35.880
is experienced in my study at home

02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:37.640
and in my office at Princeton

02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:40.080
or my coming office at Stanford

02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:43.160
when I moved full-time to Stanford in September.

02:38:43.160 --> 02:38:48.160
Or it's experienced far away in safety and in comfort.

02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:50.840
And we have to remember that too

02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:52.400
when we talk about these things,

02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:55.040
when we answer your questions, right?

02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:58.120
That as we speak and as we comment

02:38:58.120 --> 02:39:00.360
and think we're experts on these things

02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:02.480
from the comfort of our existence,

02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:07.320
that there are people in those tragedies right now.

02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:09.120
With no power, with no food,

02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:12.560
with full uncertainty about the future

02:39:12.600 --> 02:39:14.280
of the health of their children.

02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:15.400
That's it.

02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:19.960
And I've also seen, because I have family in both places,

02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:24.240
homes that were home for,

02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:28.400
buildings that were homes for generations now in rubble.

02:39:29.520 --> 02:39:30.480
So.

02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:33.120
Yes, Lex, it hurts.

02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:38.120
And it's Syria where 350,000,

02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:41.200
at least by UN estimates, died.

02:39:41.200 --> 02:39:43.920
And Russia participated in that.

02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:45.840
And it's Yemen.

02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:47.880
And it's so many other places

02:39:47.880 --> 02:39:50.600
that don't have the same degree of attention

02:39:50.600 --> 02:39:53.240
that a European country like Ukraine has.

02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:57.920
But yeah, we have to remember also

02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:00.520
that in addition to Ukraine,

02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:04.600
and then there's things right home here in New York City

02:40:04.600 --> 02:40:07.200
where children are without food,

02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:11.000
which is just inexcusable in a country this rich.

02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:13.560
So we shouldn't forget in our study of leaders,

02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:15.080
in our study of geopolitics,

02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:16.800
that ultimately it's about the humanity.

02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:21.720
It's about the human beings and human suffering.

02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:22.560
Thank you so much, Stephen.

02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:23.400
Thank you.

02:40:23.400 --> 02:40:24.800
This is an amazing conversation.

02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:25.960
Talk to you again soon.

02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:26.800
My pleasure.

02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:29.320
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:40:29.320 --> 02:40:31.120
with Stephen Kotkin.

02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:32.480

02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:38.440
And now let me leave you with some words

02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:39.760
from Mahatma Gandhi.

02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:44.840
When I despair, I remember that all through history,

02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:47.240
the way of truth and love have always won.

02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:50.840
There have been tyrants and murderers.

02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:54.080
And for a time, they can seem invincible,

02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:56.680
but in the end, they always fall.

02:40:57.880 --> 02:41:00.800
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
