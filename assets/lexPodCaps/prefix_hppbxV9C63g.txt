00:00.000 --> 00:09.320
Let me ask you to this question, whether it's bell curve or any research on race differences.

00:09.320 --> 00:13.680
Can that be used to increase the amount of racism in the world?

00:13.680 --> 00:17.040
Can that be used to increase the amount of hate in the world?

00:17.040 --> 00:27.800
My sense is there is such enormous reservoirs of hate and racism that have nothing to do

00:27.840 --> 00:33.040
with scientific knowledge of the data that speak against that.

00:33.040 --> 00:41.680
That no, I don't want to give racist groups of veto power over what scientists study.

00:41.680 --> 00:48.680
The following is a conversation with Richard Heyer on the science of human intelligence.

00:48.680 --> 00:53.600
This is a highly controversial topic, but a critically important one for understanding

00:53.600 --> 00:54.160
the human mind.

00:54.640 --> 00:59.400
I hope you will join me in not shying away from difficult topics like this.

00:59.400 --> 01:05.480
And instead, let us try to navigate it with empathy, rigor, and grace.

01:05.480 --> 01:10.200
If you're watching this on video now, I should mention that I'm recording this

01:10.200 --> 01:13.840
introduction in an undisclosed location somewhere in the world.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.040
I'm safe and happy and life is beautiful.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.200
This is a Lex Fridman podcast.

01:20.200 --> 01:23.160
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:23.160 --> 01:26.520
And now, dear friends, here's Richard Heyer.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.800
What are the measures of human intelligence and how do we measure it?

01:30.800 --> 01:34.960
Everybody has an idea of what they mean by intelligence.

01:34.960 --> 01:42.520
In the vernacular, what I mean by intelligence is just being smart, how well you reason,

01:42.520 --> 01:47.680
how well you figure things out, what you do when you don't know what to do.

01:47.720 --> 01:55.280
Those are just kind of everyday common sense definitions of how people use the word

01:55.280 --> 01:56.080
intelligence.

01:56.080 --> 02:02.320
If you want to do research on intelligence, measuring something that you can study

02:02.320 --> 02:04.640
scientifically is a little trickier.

02:04.640 --> 02:13.760
And what almost all researchers who study intelligence use is the concept called the

02:14.720 --> 02:19.440
And that is what is common.

02:19.440 --> 02:26.400
That is a mental ability that is common to virtually all tests of mental abilities.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.720
What's the origin of the term G-factor, by the way?

02:28.720 --> 02:32.000
It's such a funny word for such a fundamental human thing.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.360
The general factor, I really started with Charles Spearman.

02:36.400 --> 02:40.480
And he noticed this is like, boy, more than 100 years ago.

02:41.440 --> 02:50.720
He noticed that when you tested people with different tests, all the tests were correlated

02:50.720 --> 02:51.600
positively.

02:53.120 --> 02:56.640
And so he was looking at student exams and things.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.720
And he invented the correlation coefficient, essentially.

03:01.520 --> 03:09.280
And when he used it to look at student performance on various topics, he found that all the

03:09.280 --> 03:14.320
scores were correlated with each other and they were all positive correlations.

03:14.320 --> 03:21.200
So he inferred from this that there must be some common factor that was irrespective of

03:21.200 --> 03:23.200
the content of the test.

03:23.200 --> 03:29.360
And positive correlation means if you do well on the first test, you're likely to do well

03:29.360 --> 03:30.800
on the second test.

03:30.800 --> 03:35.760
And presumably that holds for tests across even disciplines.

03:35.760 --> 03:39.200
So not within subject, but across subjects.

03:39.200 --> 03:44.800
So that's where the general comes in, something about general intelligence.

03:44.800 --> 03:49.520
So when you were talking about measuring intelligence and trying to figure out something

03:49.520 --> 03:54.240
difficult about this world and how to solve the puzzles of this world, that means generally

03:54.240 --> 03:58.080
speaking, not some specific test, but across all tests.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.200
Absolutely right.

03:59.200 --> 04:05.600
And people get hung up on this because they say, well, what about the ability to do

04:05.600 --> 04:06.400
X?

04:06.400 --> 04:08.800
Isn't that independent?

04:08.800 --> 04:13.200
And they said, I know somebody who's very good at this, but not so good at this.

04:13.840 --> 04:14.640
This other thing.

04:15.200 --> 04:19.920
And so there are a lot of examples like that, but it's a general tendency.

04:19.920 --> 04:27.760
So exceptions really don't disprove, you know, your everyday experience is not the same as

04:27.760 --> 04:30.560
what the data actually show.

04:30.560 --> 04:34.960
And your everyday experience, when you say, oh, I know someone who's good at X, but not

04:34.960 --> 04:40.400
so good at Y, that doesn't contradict the statement of about, he's not so good, but

04:40.400 --> 04:42.640
he's not the opposite.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.600
It's not a negative correlation.

04:46.400 --> 04:46.720
Okay.

04:46.720 --> 04:54.000
So we're not, our anecdotal data, I know a guy is really good at solving some kind

04:54.000 --> 04:54.960
of visual thing.

04:55.760 --> 05:01.280
That's not sufficient for us to understand actually the depths of that person's intelligence.

05:01.280 --> 05:08.720
So how this idea of G factor, how much evidence is there?

05:09.280 --> 05:15.200
How strong, you know, given across the decades that this idea has been around, how much has

05:15.200 --> 05:22.720
it been held up that there is a universal sort of horsepower of intelligence that's

05:22.720 --> 05:29.360
underneath all of it, all the different tests we do to try to get to this thing in the depths

05:29.360 --> 05:34.160
of the human mind, that's a, that's a universal stable measure of a person's intelligence.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.640
You used a couple of words in there.

05:36.640 --> 05:36.880
Yeah.

05:36.880 --> 05:37.680
Stable and.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.480
We have to be precise with words.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.640
Well, hoping we can get away with being poetic.

05:42.640 --> 05:43.440
We can.

05:43.440 --> 05:48.720
There's a lot about research in general, not just intelligence research that is poetic.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.800
Science has a punetic aspect to it.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.680
Good scientists are very intuitive.

05:55.680 --> 05:59.040
They're not just, hey, hey, these are the numbers.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.920
You have to kind of step back and see the big picture.

06:01.920 --> 06:09.200
When it comes to intelligence research, you asked how well has this general concept held up?

06:09.760 --> 06:15.360
And I think I can say without fear of being empirically contradicted,

06:16.080 --> 06:20.240
that it is the most replicated finding in all of psychology.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.880
Now, some cynics may say, well, big deal, psychology, we all know there's a replication

06:24.880 --> 06:28.320
crisis in psychology and a lot of this stuff doesn't replicate.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.520
That's all true.

06:29.520 --> 06:36.560
There is no replication crisis when it comes to studying the existence of this general factor.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.320
Let me tell you some things about it.

06:38.880 --> 06:44.000
It is, it, it looks like it's universal in that you find it in all cultures.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.600
The way you find it, step back one, one step.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.960
The way you find it is to give a battery of mental tests.

06:51.760 --> 06:56.160
What battery you choose, take a battery of any mental tests you want,

06:56.960 --> 07:00.240
give it to a large number of diverse people.

07:01.440 --> 07:08.880
And you will be able to extract statistically the common, the commonality among all those tests.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.440
It's done by a technique called factor analysis.

07:12.400 --> 07:18.240
People think that's, that this may be a statistical artifact of some kind.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.640
It is not a statistical artifact.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.640
What is factor analysis?

07:22.640 --> 07:27.920
Factor analysis is a way of looking at a big set of data and look at the correlation among

07:27.920 --> 07:34.720
the different test scores and then find empirically the clusters of scores that go together.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.280
And there are different factors.

07:37.280 --> 07:40.960
So if you have a bunch of mental tests, there may be a verbal factor.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.200
There may be a numerical factor.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.760
There may be a visual spatial factor.

07:45.760 --> 07:50.160
But those factors have variants in common with each other.

07:50.160 --> 07:55.280
And that is the common, that's what's common among all the tests.

07:55.280 --> 07:58.000
And that's what gets labeled the G factor.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.640
So if you give a diverse battery of mental tests and you extract a G factor from it,

08:04.640 --> 08:08.160
that factor usually accounts for around half of the variants.

08:08.160 --> 08:12.080
It's the single biggest factor, but it's not the only factor.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.960
But it is the most reliable.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.320
It is the most stable.

08:17.120 --> 08:23.680
And it seems to be very much influenced by genetics.

08:23.680 --> 08:32.640
It's very hard to change the G factor with training or drugs or anything else.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.800
We don't know how to increase the G factor.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.800
Okay, you said a lot of really interesting things there.

08:36.800 --> 08:43.120
So first, I mean, just to get people used to it in case they're not familiar with this idea.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.680
G factor is what we mean.

08:45.680 --> 08:53.840
So often there's this term used IQ, which is the way IQ is used,

08:53.840 --> 08:57.200
they really mean G factor in regular conversation.

08:58.720 --> 09:02.560
Because what we mean by IQ, we mean intelligence.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.680
And what we mean by intelligence, we mean general intelligence.

09:05.680 --> 09:09.680
And general intelligence in the human mind, from a psychology,

09:09.680 --> 09:13.680
from a serious rigorous scientific perspective, actually means G factor.

09:13.680 --> 09:18.320
So G factor equals intelligence, just in this conversation to define terms.

09:18.320 --> 09:22.080
Okay, so there's this stable thing called G factor.

09:22.080 --> 09:27.360
You said now factor, you said factor many times,

09:28.240 --> 09:34.400
means a measure that potentially could be reduced to a single number

09:34.400 --> 09:36.240
across the different factors you mentioned.

09:37.120 --> 09:46.560
And what you said, it accounts for half, half-ish, accounts for half-ish of what?

09:46.560 --> 09:52.720
Of variance across the different set of tests.

09:53.600 --> 10:00.880
So if you do for some reason well on some set of tests, what does that mean?

10:00.880 --> 10:04.560
So that means there's some unique capabilities outside of the G factor

10:04.560 --> 10:05.840
that might account for that.

10:05.840 --> 10:06.640
And what are those?

10:07.280 --> 10:10.320
What else is there besides the raw horsepower,

10:10.320 --> 10:13.360
the engine inside your mind that generates intelligence?

10:13.360 --> 10:15.200
There are test-taking skills.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.680
There are specific abilities.

10:20.800 --> 10:30.080
Someone might be particularly good at mathematical things, mathematical concepts.

10:30.080 --> 10:34.160
Even simple arithmetic, some people are much better than others.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.560
You might know people who can memorize.

10:36.560 --> 10:41.200
And short-term memory is another component of this.

10:42.480 --> 10:46.800
Short-term memory is one of the cognitive processes

10:46.800 --> 10:49.920
that's most highly correlated with the G factor.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.440
So all those things like memory,

10:56.960 --> 11:02.080
test-taking skills account for variability across the test performances.

11:02.400 --> 11:09.280
So you can run, but you can't hide from the thing that God gave you, the genetics.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.960
So that G factor, science says that G factor is there.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.000
Each one of us have?

11:16.720 --> 11:19.200
Each one of us has a G factor.

11:19.200 --> 11:19.840
Oh, boy.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.120
Some have more than others.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.720
I'm getting uncomfortable already.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.560
Well, IQ is a score.

11:27.040 --> 11:31.920
An IQ score is a very good estimate of the G factor.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.240
You can't measure G directly.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.920
There's no direct measure.

11:35.920 --> 11:39.040
You estimate it from these statistical techniques.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.160
But an IQ score is a good estimate.

11:42.160 --> 11:42.960
Why?

11:42.960 --> 11:48.480
Because a standard IQ test is a battery of different mental abilities.

11:48.480 --> 11:55.600
You combined it into one score, and that score is highly correlated with the G factor,

11:55.600 --> 12:00.000
even if you get better scores on some subtests than others.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.160
Because again, it's what's common to all these mental abilities.

12:04.160 --> 12:09.280
So a good IQ test, and I'll ask you about that, but a good IQ test

12:10.240 --> 12:15.520
tries to compress down that battery of tests, like tries to get a nice battery,

12:16.160 --> 12:20.480
the nice selection of variable tests into one test.

12:21.280 --> 12:24.080
And so in that way, it sneaks up to the G factor.

12:24.080 --> 12:27.120
And that's another interesting thing about G factor.

12:28.080 --> 12:33.920
Now you give, first of all, you have a great book on the neuroscience of intelligence.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.640
You have a great course, which is when I first learned.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.880
You're a great teacher.

12:38.880 --> 12:43.920
Let me just say your course at the teaching company.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.600
I hope I'm saying that correctly.

12:45.600 --> 12:46.880
The intelligent brain.

12:46.880 --> 12:53.600
The intelligent brain is when I first heard about this G factor, this mysterious thing

12:53.600 --> 12:56.560
that lurks in the darkness that we cannot quite shine a light on.

12:56.640 --> 12:57.920
We're trying to sneak up on.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.920
So the fact that there's this measure, stable measure of intelligence,

13:01.920 --> 13:07.680
we can't measure it directly, but we can come up with a battery test

13:07.680 --> 13:17.520
or one test that includes a battery of variable type of questions that can reliably or

13:18.400 --> 13:21.520
attempt to estimate in a stable way that G factor.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.120
That's a fascinating idea.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.600
So for me as an AI person, it's fascinating.

13:25.680 --> 13:29.200
It's fascinating that there's something stable like that about the human mind,

13:29.200 --> 13:31.280
especially if it's grounded in genetics.

13:31.920 --> 13:37.920
It's most fascinating that as a researcher of the human mind

13:39.360 --> 13:46.400
and all the human psychological, sociological, ethical questions that start arising,

13:46.400 --> 13:49.840
it makes me uncomfortable, but truth can be uncomfortable.

13:50.800 --> 13:55.520
You know, I get that a lot about being uncomfortable talking about this.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.360
Let me go back and just say one more empirical thing.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.360
It doesn't matter which battery of tests you use.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.560
So there are countless tests.

14:10.560 --> 14:15.120
You can take any 12 of them at random, extract a G factor

14:15.120 --> 14:18.720
and another 12 at random and extract a G factor.

14:18.720 --> 14:22.960
And those G factors will be highly correlated like over 0.9 with each other.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.000
So it is a ubiquitous.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.440
It doesn't depend on the content of the test is what I'm trying to say.

14:30.160 --> 14:34.000
It is general among all those tests of mental ability.

14:34.000 --> 14:40.240
And tests of mental abilities include things like, geez, playing poker.

14:41.280 --> 14:45.520
Your skill at poker is not unrelated to G.

14:46.160 --> 14:52.000
Your skill at anything that requires reasoning and thinking, anything from spelling,

14:52.560 --> 14:55.680
arithmetic, more complex things.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.400
This concept is ubiquitous.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.800
And when you do batteries of tests in different cultures, you get the same thing.

15:05.680 --> 15:08.720
So this says something interesting about the human mind.

15:08.720 --> 15:11.440
That is, a computer is designed to be general.

15:12.400 --> 15:19.040
So that means you can, so it's not easily made specialized.

15:20.000 --> 15:27.280
Meaning if you're going to be good at one thing, Miyamoto Musashi has this quote.

15:27.280 --> 15:33.040
He's an ancient warrior, famous for the book of five rings in the martial arts world.

15:33.040 --> 15:37.920
And the quote goes, if you know the way broadly, you will see it in everything.

15:38.800 --> 15:46.160
Meaning if you do one thing is going to generalize to everything.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.200
And that that's an interesting thing about the human mind.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.520
So that that's what the G factor reveals.

15:54.320 --> 16:00.000
Okay. So what's the difference if you can elaborate a little bit further between IQ

16:00.000 --> 16:03.440
and G factor just because it's a source of confusion for people.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.600
IQ is a score.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.160
People use the word IQ to mean intelligence.

16:08.160 --> 16:12.480
But IQ has a more technical meaning for people who work in the field.

16:13.520 --> 16:18.640
It's an IQ score, a score on a test that estimates the G factor.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.080
And the G factor is what's common among all these tests of mental ability.

16:24.080 --> 16:30.480
So if you think about it's not a Venn diagram, but I guess you could make a Venn diagram out of it.

16:30.480 --> 16:36.880
But the G factor would be really at the core, what's common to everything.

16:37.520 --> 16:43.840
And what IQ scores do is they allow a rank order of people on the score.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.800
And this is what makes people uncomfortable.

16:46.800 --> 16:51.440
This is where there's a lot of controversy about whether IQ tests are biased

16:51.440 --> 16:53.760
toward any one group or another.

16:54.400 --> 16:58.960
And a lot of the answers to these questions are very clear,

16:58.960 --> 17:04.000
but they also have a technical aspect of it that's not so easy to explain.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.920
Well, we'll talk about the fascinating and the difficult things about all of this.

17:10.560 --> 17:14.560
So by the way, when you say rank order, that means you get a number and that means

17:14.560 --> 17:16.720
one person you can now compare.

17:18.720 --> 17:22.080
You could say that this other person is more intelligent than me.

17:22.880 --> 17:27.920
Well, what you can say is IQ scores are interpreted really as percentiles.

17:29.200 --> 17:37.760
So that if you have an IQ of 140 and somebody else has 70, the metric is such that you cannot

17:37.760 --> 17:45.040
say the person with an IQ of 140 is twice as smart as a person with an IQ of 70.

17:45.840 --> 17:49.760
That would require a ratio scale with an absolute zero.

17:49.760 --> 17:55.040
Now you may think you know people with zero intelligence, but in fact, there is no absolute

17:55.040 --> 17:57.840
zero on an IQ scale.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.680
It's relative to other people.

18:01.040 --> 18:08.560
So relative to other people, somebody with an IQ score of 140 is in the upper less than one percent,

18:09.280 --> 18:14.880
whereas somebody with an IQ of 70 is two standard deviations below the mean.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.480
That's a different percentile.

18:18.480 --> 18:25.840
So it's similar to like in chess, you have an ELO rating that's designed to rank order people.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.680
So you can't say it's twice.

18:27.680 --> 18:33.760
One person, if your ELO rating is twice, another person, I don't think you're twice as good at chess.

18:33.760 --> 18:34.480
Exactly.

18:34.480 --> 18:38.960
It's not stable in that way, but because it's very difficult to do these kinds of comparisons.

18:39.760 --> 18:43.840
But so what can we say about the number itself?

18:44.960 --> 18:48.000
Is that stable across tests and so on?

18:48.000 --> 18:52.080
No, there are a number of statistical properties of any test.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.320
They're called psychometric properties.

18:54.320 --> 19:00.720
You have validity, you have reliability, there are many different kinds of reliability.

19:00.720 --> 19:07.680
They all essentially measure stability, and IQ tests are stable within an individual.

19:07.680 --> 19:14.320
There are some longitudinal studies where children were measured at age 11, and again,

19:14.320 --> 19:20.080
when they were 70 years old and the two IQ scores are highly correlated with each other.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.000
Highly correlated with each other.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.040
This comes from a fascinating study from Scotland.

19:26.240 --> 19:33.360
In the 1930s, some researchers decided to get an IQ test on every single child

19:33.360 --> 19:36.800
age 11 in the whole country, and they did.

19:37.600 --> 19:45.520
And those records were discovered in an old storeroom at the University of Edinburgh

19:46.320 --> 19:51.680
by a friend of mine, Ian Deary, who found the records, digitized them,

19:52.320 --> 19:58.720
and has done a lot of research on the people who are still alive today from that original study,

19:58.720 --> 20:01.040
including brain imaging research, by the way.

20:01.040 --> 20:06.080
Really, it's a fascinating group of people who are studied.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.520
Not to get ahead of the story, but one of the most interesting things they found

20:12.400 --> 20:19.520
is a very strong relationship between IQ measured at age 11 and mortality,

20:21.680 --> 20:32.240
so that 70 years later, they looked at the survival rates and they could get death records

20:32.240 --> 20:36.400
from everybody, and Scotland has universal health care for everybody.

20:36.960 --> 20:43.040
And it turned out if you divide people by their age 11 IQ score into quartiles

20:43.840 --> 20:52.240
and then look at how many people are alive 70 years later, I know this is in the book,

20:52.240 --> 20:57.680
they have the graph in the book, but there are essentially twice as many people alive

20:57.680 --> 21:03.280
in the highest IQ quartile than in the lowest IQ quartile, true in men and women.

21:03.920 --> 21:04.880
Interesting.

21:04.880 --> 21:10.400
So it makes a big difference. Now, why this is the case is not so clear

21:11.360 --> 21:13.920
since everyone had access to health care.

21:13.920 --> 21:19.840
Well, there's a lot, and we'll talk about it, you know, just the sentences you used now

21:20.560 --> 21:25.280
could be explained by nature or nurture. We don't know.

21:25.280 --> 21:30.080
Now, there's a lot of science that starts to then dig in and investigate that question.

21:30.240 --> 21:33.680
Investigate that question, but let me linger on the IQ test.

21:33.680 --> 21:37.280
How are the test design, IQ test design, how do they work?

21:37.280 --> 21:39.920
Maybe some examples for people who are not aware.

21:41.360 --> 21:48.000
What makes a good IQ test question that sneaks up on this G factor measure?

21:48.000 --> 21:54.240
Well, your question is interesting because you want me to give examples of items that make good

21:54.240 --> 22:01.840
items. And what makes a good item is not so much its content, but its empirical relationship to the

22:01.840 --> 22:08.960
total score that turns out to be valid by other means. So for example,

22:10.720 --> 22:14.080
let me give you an odd example from personality testing.

22:15.520 --> 22:21.600
So there's a personality test called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory,

22:21.600 --> 22:24.000
MMPI, been around for decades.

22:24.000 --> 22:29.120
I've heard about this test recently because of the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial.

22:29.120 --> 22:33.360
I don't know if you've been paying attention to that, but they have not been paying attention to

22:33.360 --> 22:38.640
it. They had psychologists on the stand and they were talking. Apparently those psychologists did,

22:40.000 --> 22:45.600
again, I'm learning so much from this trial. They did different battery of tests

22:45.760 --> 22:52.400
to diagnose personality disorders. Apparently there's that systematic way of doing so and the

22:52.400 --> 22:59.200
Minnesota one is one of the ones that there's the most science on. There's a lot of great papers

22:59.200 --> 23:04.400
which were all continuously cited on the stand, which is fascinating to watch. Sorry, a little

23:04.400 --> 23:05.200
bit of attention.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.160
It's okay. I mean, this is interesting because you're right. It's been around for decades.

23:08.160 --> 23:14.160
There's a lot of scientific research on the psychometric properties of the test, including

23:14.160 --> 23:21.120
what it predicts with respect to different categories of personality disorder. But what I

23:21.120 --> 23:29.120
want to mention is the content of the items on that test. All of the items are essentially true,

23:29.120 --> 23:38.960
false items. True or false, I prefer a shower to a bath. True or false, I think Lincoln was a better

23:38.960 --> 23:48.000
president than Washington. What does that have to do? The point is the content of these items,

23:48.000 --> 23:57.280
nobody knows why these items in aggregate predict anything, but empirically they do. It's a technique

23:57.280 --> 24:05.760
of choosing items for a test that is called dust bowl empiricism. That the content doesn't matter,

24:06.080 --> 24:13.440
but for some reason when you get a criterion group of people with this disorder and you compare them

24:13.440 --> 24:20.560
to people without that disorder, these are the items that distinguish. Irrespective of content,

24:20.560 --> 24:22.560
it's a hard concept to grasp.

24:22.560 --> 24:34.000
Well, first of all, it's fascinating. I consider myself part psychologist because I love human

24:34.000 --> 24:40.400
robot interaction. Half of that problem is a psychology problem because there's a human.

24:41.920 --> 24:50.800
Designing these tests to get at the questions is the fascinating part. What does dust bowl

24:50.800 --> 24:59.280
empiricism refer to? Does it refer to the final result? Yeah, so it's the test is dust bowl

24:59.520 --> 25:07.120
empiricism, but how do you arrive at the battery of questions? I presume one of the things now,

25:07.120 --> 25:13.920
again, I'm going to the excellent testimony in that trial, because they also explain the tests,

25:16.000 --> 25:24.800
that a bunch of the questions are kind of make you forget that you're taking a test. It makes it

25:25.520 --> 25:31.520
very difficult for you to somehow figure out what you're supposed to answer.

25:31.520 --> 25:36.160
Yes, it's called social desirability, but we're getting a little far afield because I only wanted

25:36.160 --> 25:43.120
to give that example of dust bowl empiricism. When we talk about the items on an IQ test,

25:44.400 --> 25:53.440
many of those items in the dust bowl empiricism method have no face validity. In other words,

25:53.440 --> 26:00.400
they don't look like they measure anything. Whereas most intelligence tests, the items

26:00.400 --> 26:06.880
actually look like they're measuring some mental ability. You were bringing that up as an example

26:06.880 --> 26:12.720
as what it is not. Yes. Got it. Okay, so I don't want to go too far afield on it.

26:12.720 --> 26:18.960
Too far afield is actually one of the names of this podcast, so I should mention that.

26:18.960 --> 26:25.120
Far afield. Yeah, so anyway, sorry. So they feel the questions look like they

26:25.920 --> 26:30.400
pass the face validity test. And some more than others. So for example,

26:30.400 --> 26:37.920
let me give you a couple of things here. One of the subtests on a standard IQ test is

26:37.920 --> 26:43.360
general information. Let me just think a little bit because I don't want to give you the actual

26:43.360 --> 26:53.520
item. But if I said, how far is it between Washington DC and Miami, Florida within 500 miles,

26:53.520 --> 27:02.800
plus or minus? Well, it's not a fact most people memorize, but you know something about geography.

27:02.800 --> 27:08.880
You say, well, I flew there once. I know planes fly for 500 miles. You can kind of make an estimate.

27:09.040 --> 27:20.240
But it also seems like it would be very cultural. So there's that kind of general information. Then

27:20.240 --> 27:31.280
there's vocabulary test. What does regatta mean? And I choose that word because that word was

27:31.280 --> 27:37.520
removed from the IQ test because people complained that disadvantaged people would not know that

27:37.520 --> 27:46.560
word just from their everyday life. Okay, here's another example from a different kind of subtest.

27:47.040 --> 27:55.280
What's regatta, by the way? Regatta is a sailing competition, a competition with boats.

27:55.280 --> 28:02.080
Not necessarily sailing, but the competition. Yep, yep. I'm proudly disadvantaged in that way.

28:02.160 --> 28:07.920
Okay, excellent. So that was removed, you were saying. Okay, so here's another subtest. I'm

28:07.920 --> 28:12.080
going to repeat a string of numbers and when I'm done, I want you to repeat them back to me.

28:12.640 --> 28:24.720
Ready? Seven, four, two, eight, one, six. That's way too many. Seven, four, two, eight, one, six.

28:25.520 --> 28:29.680
You get the idea. Now the actual test starts with a smaller number,

28:30.640 --> 28:36.400
like two numbers, and then as people get it right, you keep going, adding to the string of numbers

28:36.400 --> 28:43.440
until they can't do it anymore. Okay, but now try this. I'm going to say some numbers and when I'm

28:43.440 --> 28:51.520
done, I want you to repeat them to me backwards. I quit. Okay, now, so I gave you some examples of

28:51.520 --> 28:58.560
the kind of items on an IQ test. General information, I can't even remember all of them.

28:58.560 --> 29:05.760
General information, vocabulary, digit span forward and digit span backward.

29:06.640 --> 29:10.080
Well, you said I can't even remember them. That's a good question for me.

29:11.520 --> 29:14.960
What does memory have to do with G-Factor? Okay, well, let's hold on.

29:15.680 --> 29:25.120
All right. Let's just talk about these examples. Now, some of those items seem very cultural

29:26.720 --> 29:32.960
and others seem less cultural. Which ones do you think,

29:33.760 --> 29:38.080
scores on which subtests are most highly correlated with the G-Factor?

29:38.080 --> 29:42.320
Well, the two advances are less cultural.

29:43.520 --> 29:54.320
Well, it turns out vocabulary is highly correlated and it turns out that digit span backwards is

29:54.320 --> 29:58.560
highly correlated. How do you figure?

29:58.560 --> 30:03.920
Now you have decades of research to answer the question, how do you figure?

30:04.480 --> 30:11.280
Right. So now there's like good research that gives you intuition about what kind of questions

30:11.280 --> 30:21.120
get at it. Just like there's something I've done, I've actually used for research to send me an

30:21.120 --> 30:26.080
autonomous vehicle. Whether humans are paying attention, there's a body of literature that

30:26.160 --> 30:29.440
does end back tests. For example, we have to

30:33.440 --> 30:39.200
put workload on the brain to do recall, memory recall. And that helps you kind of

30:40.160 --> 30:45.600
put some work onto the brain while the person is doing some other task and does some interesting

30:45.600 --> 30:50.320
research with that. But that's loading the memory. So there's like research around

30:50.960 --> 30:56.720
stably what that means about the human mind. And here you're saying recall backwards

30:58.320 --> 30:59.600
is a good protector.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.880
It's a transformation.

31:01.680 --> 31:11.120
Yeah. So you have to load that into your brain and not just remember it, but do something with it.

31:11.120 --> 31:16.800
Right. Here's another example of a different kind of test called the Hick paradigm. And it's not

31:16.800 --> 31:25.040
verbal at all. It's a little box and there are a series of lights arranged in a semi-circle

31:25.040 --> 31:32.800
at the top of the box. And then there's a home button that you press. And when one of the lights

31:32.800 --> 31:39.840
goes on, there's a button next to each of those lights. You take your finger off the home button

31:39.840 --> 31:45.840
and you just press the button next to the light that goes on. And so it's a very simple reaction

31:45.840 --> 31:50.400
time. Light goes on. As quick as you can, you press the button and you get a reaction time.

31:50.400 --> 31:56.800
From the moment you lift your finger off the button to when you press the button with where

31:56.800 --> 32:04.960
the light is, that reaction time doesn't really correlate with IQ very much. But if you change

32:05.760 --> 32:12.880
the instructions and you say three lights are going to come on simultaneously,

32:12.960 --> 32:17.520
I want you to press the button next to the light that's furthest from the other two.

32:18.880 --> 32:25.280
So maybe lights one and two go on and light six goes on simultaneously. You take your finger

32:25.280 --> 32:33.360
off and you would press the button by light six. That's that reaction time to a more complex task.

32:34.160 --> 32:40.400
It's not really hard. Almost everybody gets it all right. But your reaction time to that

32:40.960 --> 32:46.800
is highly correlated with the G factor. This is fascinating. So reaction time is a temporal

32:47.600 --> 32:55.600
aspect to this. It's the speed of processing. Is this also true for ones that take longer,

32:55.600 --> 33:03.680
like five, 10, 30 seconds? Is time part of the measure? Yes. And that is why some of the best

33:03.680 --> 33:12.000
IQ tests have a time limit. Because if you have no time limit, people can do better,

33:12.800 --> 33:21.680
but it doesn't distinguish among people that well. So that adding the time element is important. So

33:21.680 --> 33:29.200
speed of information processing and reaction time is a measure of speed of information processing

33:29.200 --> 33:35.280
turns out to be related to the G factor. But the G factor only accounts for maybe half or

33:35.280 --> 33:47.200
some amount on the test performance. For example, I get pretty bad test anxiety. I just don't enjoy

33:47.200 --> 33:54.720
tests. I enjoy going back into my cave and working. I've always enjoyed homework way more than tests,

33:55.440 --> 34:00.240
no matter how hard the homework is, because I can go back to the cave and hide away and think

34:00.240 --> 34:05.840
deeply. There's something about being watched and having a time limit that really makes me anxious

34:05.840 --> 34:11.280
and I could just see the mind not operating optimally at all. But you're saying underneath

34:11.280 --> 34:19.120
there, there's still a G factor. There's no question. And if you get anxious taking a test,

34:19.120 --> 34:24.320
many people say, oh, I didn't do well because I'm anxious. I hear that a lot.

34:24.880 --> 34:30.400
Well, fine. If you're really anxious during the test, the score will be a bad estimate

34:30.400 --> 34:35.600
of your G factor. It doesn't mean the G factor isn't there. And by the way,

34:36.560 --> 34:43.440
standardized tests like the SAT, they're essentially intelligence tests. They are

34:43.440 --> 34:51.200
highly G loaded. Now, the people who make the SAT don't want to mention that. They have enough

34:51.200 --> 34:57.040
trouble justifying standardized testing. But to call it an intelligence test is really

34:57.040 --> 35:02.960
beyond the pale. But in fact, it's so highly correlated because it's a reasoning test.

35:02.960 --> 35:09.360
The SAT is a reasoning test, a verbal reasoning, mathematical reasoning. And if it's a reasoning

35:09.360 --> 35:17.920
test, it has to be related to G. But if people go in and take a standardized test, whether it's an

35:17.920 --> 35:26.960
IQ test or the SAT, and they happen to be sick that day with 102 fever, the score is not going

35:26.960 --> 35:34.080
to be a good estimate of their G. If they retake the test when they're not anxious or less anxious

35:34.080 --> 35:40.160
or don't have a fever, the score will go up and that will be a better estimate. But you

35:40.160 --> 35:47.600
can't say their G factor increased between the two tests. Well, it's interesting. So the question is

35:47.600 --> 35:53.840
how wide of a battery of tests is required to estimate the G factor? Well, because I'll give

35:53.840 --> 35:59.920
you as my personal example, I took the SAT and I think it was called the ACT where I was too. Also,

35:59.920 --> 36:08.240
I took SAT many times. Every single time I got a perfect math and verbal, the time limit on the

36:08.240 --> 36:13.520
verbal made me very anxious. I did not, I mean, part of it, I didn't speak English very well.

36:14.160 --> 36:18.800
But honestly, it was like, you're supposed to remember stuff. And like, I was so anxious and

36:18.800 --> 36:26.160
like, as I'm reading, I'm sweating. I can't, you know, that like, that feeling you have when you're

36:26.160 --> 36:31.280
reading a book and you, you just read a page and you know nothing about what you've read because

36:31.280 --> 36:38.640
you zoned out. That's the same feeling of like, I can't, I have to, you're like, no, read and

36:38.640 --> 36:45.920
understand. And that anxiety is like, and you start seeing like the typography versus the content

36:45.920 --> 36:55.120
of the words. Like that was, I don't, it's interesting because I know that what they're

36:55.120 --> 37:01.760
measuring, I could see being correlated with something, but that anxiety or some aspect of

37:01.760 --> 37:10.480
the performance sure plays a factor. And I wonder how you sneak up in a stable way. I mean,

37:10.480 --> 37:15.840
this is a broader discussion, but that's like standardized testing, how you sneak up,

37:16.480 --> 37:22.400
how you get at the fact that I'm super anxious and still nevertheless measure some aspect of my

37:22.400 --> 37:27.760
intelligence. I wonder, I don't know. I don't know if you can say to that, that time limit sure is a

37:27.760 --> 37:34.640
pain. Well, let me say this. There are two ways to approach the very real problem that you say

37:34.640 --> 37:43.280
that some people just get anxious or not good test takers. By the way, part of testing is

37:44.240 --> 37:51.440
you know the answer, you can figure out the answer or you can't. If you don't know the answer,

37:51.440 --> 37:56.000
there are many reasons you don't know the answer at that particular moment. You may have learned

37:56.000 --> 38:02.000
it once and forgotten it. It may be on the tip of your tongue and you just can't get it because

38:02.000 --> 38:08.480
you're anxious about the time limit. You may never have learned it. You may have been exposed to it,

38:08.480 --> 38:13.200
but it was too complicated and you couldn't learn it. I mean, there are all kinds of reasons here,

38:13.760 --> 38:23.200
but for an individual to interpret your scores as an individual, whoever is interpreting the score

38:23.200 --> 38:29.920
has to take into account various things that would affect your individual score. That's why

38:29.920 --> 38:37.920
decisions about college admission or anything else where tests are used are hardly ever the only

38:39.200 --> 38:46.640
criterion to make a decision. I think people are, college admissions, letting go of that very much.

38:46.640 --> 38:54.240
Oh yes, there you have. But what does that even mean? Because is it possible to design standardized

38:54.240 --> 39:01.440
tests that are useful to college admissions? Well, they already exist. The SAT is highly

39:01.440 --> 39:08.000
correlated with many aspects of success at college. Here's the problem. So maybe you could speak to

39:08.000 --> 39:13.520
this. The correlation across the population versus individuals. So

39:17.360 --> 39:27.360
our criminal justice system is designed to make sure, wow, it's still there's tragic cases where

39:27.360 --> 39:36.080
innocent people go to jail, but you try to avoid that. In the same way with testing, it would suck

39:36.080 --> 39:44.720
for an SAT to miss genius. Yes, and it's possible, but it's statistically unlikely. So it really comes

39:44.720 --> 40:01.600
down to which piece of information maximizes your decision-making ability. So if you just use high

40:01.600 --> 40:08.960
school grades, it's okay. But you will miss some people who just don't do well in high school,

40:08.960 --> 40:14.800
but who are actually pretty smart enough to be bored silly in high school and they don't care

40:14.800 --> 40:21.920
and their high school GPA isn't that good. So you will miss them. In the same sense that somebody

40:21.920 --> 40:28.880
who could be very able and ready for college just doesn't do well on their SAT. This is why

40:28.880 --> 40:37.040
you make decisions with taking in a variety of information. The other thing I wanted to say,

40:39.040 --> 40:45.600
I talked about when you make a decision for an individual, statistically for groups,

40:45.600 --> 40:51.840
there are many people who have a disparity between their math score and their verbal score.

40:52.800 --> 40:59.920
That disparity or the other way around, that disparity is called tilt. The score is tilted

40:59.920 --> 41:06.240
one way or the other. And that tilt has been studied empirically to see what that predicts.

41:07.040 --> 41:15.840
And in fact, you can't make predictions about college success based on tilt. Mathematics is

41:15.840 --> 41:21.440
a good example. There are many people, especially non-native speakers of English who come to this

41:21.440 --> 41:26.960
country, take the SATs, do very well on the math and not so well on the verbal. Well,

41:26.960 --> 41:33.600
if they're applying to a math program, the professors there who are making the decision

41:33.600 --> 41:41.200
or the admissions officers don't wait so much the score on verbal, especially if it's a non-native

41:41.200 --> 41:46.720
speaker. Well, so yeah, you have to try to in the admission process, bring in the context,

41:47.600 --> 41:52.560
but non-native isn't really the problem. I mean, that was part of the problem for me,

41:53.680 --> 41:58.640
but it's the anxiety was, which it's interesting. It's interesting.

42:02.640 --> 42:08.720
Oh boy, reducing yourself down to numbers, but it's still true. It's still the truth.

42:09.600 --> 42:17.440
It's a painful truth. That same anxiety that led me to struggle with the SAT

42:18.720 --> 42:26.000
verbal tests is still within me in all ways of life. So maybe that's not anxiety.

42:26.800 --> 42:31.680
Maybe that's something, you know, like personality is also pretty stable.

42:32.320 --> 42:41.840
Personality is stable. Personality does impact the way you navigate life. There's no question.

42:42.400 --> 42:46.960
Yeah. And we should say that the G factor in intelligence is not just about some kind of

42:48.720 --> 42:54.960
number on a paper. It's also has to do with how you navigate life, how

42:54.960 --> 43:02.720
easy life is for you in this very complicated world. So personality is all tied into that

43:02.720 --> 43:10.000
in some deep fundamental way. But now you've hit the key point about why we even want to study

43:10.000 --> 43:16.640
intelligence and personality, I think to a lesser extent, but that's my interest is more on

43:16.640 --> 43:22.160
intelligence. I went to graduate school and wanted to study personality, but that's kind of another

43:22.160 --> 43:28.080
story, how I got kind of shifted from personality research over to intelligence research because

43:28.080 --> 43:35.200
it's not just a number. Intelligence is not just an IQ score. It's not just an SAT score. It's what

43:35.200 --> 43:45.360
those numbers reflect about your ability to navigate everyday life. It has been said that

43:45.360 --> 43:48.160
life is one long intelligence test.

43:51.920 --> 43:59.440
And who can't relate to that. And if you doubt, see another problem here is a lot of critics of

43:59.440 --> 44:06.000
intelligence research, intelligence testing tend to be academics who by and large are pretty smart

44:06.000 --> 44:13.520
people. And pretty smart people by and large have enormous difficulty understanding what the world

44:13.520 --> 44:22.080
is like for people with IQs of 80 or 75. It is a completely different everyday experience.

44:22.960 --> 44:32.400
Even IQ scores of 85, 90, there's a popular television program, Judge Judy, where Judge

44:32.400 --> 44:38.720
Judy deals with everyday people with everyday problems. And you can see the full range

44:39.360 --> 44:45.200
of problem solving ability demonstrated there. And sometimes she does it for laughs,

44:45.200 --> 44:55.120
but it really isn't funny because there are people who are very limited in their life

44:55.840 --> 45:05.920
navigation, let alone success by not having good reasoning skills, which cannot be taught.

45:06.800 --> 45:11.200
We know this by the way, because there are many efforts. The United States military,

45:11.200 --> 45:17.600
which excels at training people. I don't know that there's a better organization in the world

45:17.600 --> 45:24.400
for training diverse people. And they won't take people with IQs under I think 83 is the cutoff

45:25.200 --> 45:34.240
because they are unable to train people with lower IQs to do jobs in the military.

45:34.240 --> 45:37.600
So one of the things that G factor has to do with is learning.

45:37.600 --> 45:45.360
Absolutely. Some people learn faster than others. Some people learn more than others.

45:45.360 --> 45:51.680
Now faster, by the way, is not necessarily better, as long as you get to the same place eventually.

45:53.680 --> 46:00.160
But there are professional schools that want students who can learn the fastest because they

46:00.160 --> 46:08.640
can learn more or learn deeper or all kinds of ideas about why you select people with the

46:08.640 --> 46:14.960
highest scores. And there's nothing funnier, by the way, to listen to a bunch of academics

46:14.960 --> 46:20.800
complain about the concept of intelligence and intelligence testing. And then you go to a faculty

46:20.800 --> 46:25.840
meeting where they're discussing who to hire among the applicants. And all they talk about is how

46:25.840 --> 46:31.360
smart the person is. We'll get to that. We'll sneak up to that in different ways. But there's

46:31.360 --> 46:36.720
something about reducing a person to a number that in part is grounded to the person's genetics

46:36.720 --> 46:42.080
that makes people very uncomfortable. But nobody does that. Nobody in the field actually

46:42.080 --> 46:55.520
does that. That is a worry that is a worry like... Well, I don't want to call it a conspiracy

46:55.520 --> 47:02.320
theory. I mean, it's a legitimate worry, but it just doesn't happen. Now I had a professor

47:02.320 --> 47:10.480
in graduate school who was the only person I ever knew who considered the students only by their

47:10.480 --> 47:20.080
test scores. And later in his life, he kind of backed off that. Well, let me ask you this.

47:20.080 --> 47:28.560
So we'll jump around. I'll come back to a book. I've had political discussions with people.

47:31.840 --> 47:38.560
Actually, my friend Michael Mallis, he's an anarchist. I disagree with him on basically

47:38.560 --> 47:44.880
everything except the fact that love is a beautiful thing in this world.

47:47.280 --> 47:52.160
And he says this test about left versus right, whatever. It doesn't matter what the test is,

47:52.160 --> 47:57.520
but he believes the question is, do you believe that some people are better than others?

48:00.160 --> 48:07.120
The question is ambiguous. Do you believe some people are better than others? And to me,

48:07.440 --> 48:13.920
the immediate answer is no. It's a poetic question. It's ambiguous question.

48:17.360 --> 48:25.040
People want to maybe the temptation to ask better at what? Better at sports and so on. No. To me,

48:25.040 --> 48:31.520
I stand with the finding documents of this country, which is all men are created equal.

48:32.080 --> 48:38.640
There's a basic humanity and there's something about tests of intelligence.

48:39.840 --> 48:45.840
Just knowing that some people are different, like the science of intelligence that shows that some

48:45.840 --> 48:55.120
people are genetically in some stable way across a lifetime, have a greater intelligence than others,

48:56.000 --> 49:02.720
makes people feel like some people are better than others and that makes them very uncomfortable.

49:04.480 --> 49:09.440
Maybe you can speak to that. The fact that some people are more intelligent than others

49:09.440 --> 49:20.400
in a way that cannot be compensated through education, through anything you do in life.

49:20.400 --> 49:29.120
What do we do with that? OK, there's a lot there. We haven't really talked about the genetics of it

49:29.120 --> 49:37.760
yet, but you are correct in that it is my interpretation of the data that genetics has

49:37.760 --> 49:44.320
a very important influence on the G factor. This is controversial. We can talk about it,

49:44.320 --> 49:50.160
but if you think that genetics, that genes are deterministic, are always deterministic,

49:50.640 --> 49:59.440
that leads to the worry that you expressed. But we know now in the 21st century that many genes

49:59.440 --> 50:08.560
are not deterministic, they're probabilistic, meaning their gene expression can be influenced.

50:09.760 --> 50:16.320
Now, whether they're influenced only by other biological variables or other genetic variables

50:16.320 --> 50:21.360
or environmental or cultural variables, that's where the controversy comes in.

50:22.880 --> 50:29.120
And we can discuss that in more detail if you like. But to go to the question about better,

50:30.000 --> 50:39.840
people better, there's zero evidence that smart people are better with respect to

50:40.720 --> 50:49.360
important aspects of life like honesty, even likability. I'm sure you know many very

50:49.360 --> 50:54.640
intelligent people who are not terribly likable or terribly kind or terribly honest.

50:55.360 --> 51:00.640
Is there something to be said? So one of the things I've recently reread for the second time,

51:01.840 --> 51:08.160
I guess that's what the word reread means. The rise and fall of the Third Reich,

51:08.800 --> 51:16.400
which is, I think, the best telling of the rise and fall of Hitler. And one of the interesting

51:16.400 --> 51:32.400
things about the people that, how should I say it, justified or maybe propped up the ideas that

51:32.400 --> 51:39.840
Hitler put forward is the fact that they were extremely intelligent. They were the intellectual

51:39.840 --> 51:49.360
class. It was obvious that they thought very deeply and rationally about the world.

51:49.360 --> 51:55.920
So what I would like to say is one of the things that shows to me is some of the worst atrocities

51:55.920 --> 52:00.400
in the history of humanity have been committed by very intelligent people.

52:02.000 --> 52:10.000
So that means that intelligence doesn't make you a good person. I wonder if, you know, there's a

52:10.000 --> 52:17.440
G factor for intelligence. I wonder if there's a G factor for goodness. You know, they need you in

52:18.240 --> 52:23.120
good and evil. Of course, that's probably harder to measure because that's such a subjective thing,

52:23.120 --> 52:29.760
what it means to be good. And even the idea of evil is a deeply uncomfortable thing because how

52:29.760 --> 52:36.800
do we know? But it's independent, whatever it is, it's independent of intelligence. So I agree with

52:36.800 --> 52:46.160
you about that. But let me say this. I have also asserted my belief that more intelligence is better

52:46.160 --> 52:55.760
than less. It doesn't mean more intelligent people are better people. But all things being equal,

52:55.760 --> 53:01.600
would you like to be smarter or less smart? So if I had a pill, I have two pills. I said,

53:01.600 --> 53:05.440
this one will make you smarter. This one will make you dumber. Which one would you like?

53:06.320 --> 53:09.680
Are there any circumstances under which you would choose to be dumber?

53:09.760 --> 53:13.600
Well, let me ask you this. That's a very nuanced and interesting question.

53:15.440 --> 53:21.520
You know, there's been books written about this, right? Now we'll return to the hard questions,

53:21.520 --> 53:28.400
the interesting questions, but let me ask about human happiness. Does intelligence lead to

53:28.400 --> 53:39.360
happiness? No. So, okay, so back to the pill then. So why, when would you take the pill? So you said,

53:39.360 --> 53:50.800
IQ 80, 90, 100, 110, you start going through the quartiles and is it obvious? Isn't there

53:53.040 --> 53:56.160
diminishing returns and then it starts becoming negative?

53:57.200 --> 54:07.360
This is an empirical question. And so that I have advocated in many forums more research

54:08.160 --> 54:16.000
on enhancing the G factor. Right now, there have been many claims about enhancing intelligence.

54:17.200 --> 54:23.040
You mentioned the NBAC training. It was a big deal a few years ago. It doesn't work. Data is

54:23.040 --> 54:28.480
very clear. It does not work. Or doing like memory tests, like training and so on.

54:28.480 --> 54:35.120
Yeah. It may give you a better memory in the short run, but it doesn't impact your G factor.

54:38.000 --> 54:43.840
It was very popular a couple of decades ago that the idea that listening to Mozart

54:44.400 --> 54:48.960
could make you more intelligent. There was a paper published on this with somebody I knew

54:48.960 --> 54:55.120
published this paper. Intelligence researchers never believed it for a second. There have been

54:55.120 --> 55:01.440
hundreds of studies, all the meta-analyses, all the summaries and so on. There's nothing to it,

55:02.160 --> 55:11.520
nothing to it at all. But wouldn't it be something? Wouldn't it be world shaking

55:12.720 --> 55:16.560
if you could take the normal distribution of intelligence, which we haven't really

55:16.560 --> 55:22.400
talked about yet, but IQ scores and the G factor is thought to be a normal distribution,

55:22.400 --> 55:32.320
and shift it to the right so that everybody is smarter. Even a half a standard deviation would

55:32.320 --> 55:41.360
be world shaking because there are many social problems, many, many social problems that are

55:41.360 --> 55:50.160
exacerbated by people with lower ability to reason stuff out and navigate everyday life.

55:50.160 --> 55:58.480
I wonder if there's a threshold. Maybe I would push back and say universal shifting

55:59.280 --> 56:06.240
of the normal distribution may not be the optimal way of shifting. Maybe it's better to

56:07.120 --> 56:13.840
whatever the asymmetric kind of distributions is like really pushing the lower up versus

56:14.640 --> 56:19.440
trying to make the people at the average more intelligent.

56:19.440 --> 56:24.400
So you're saying that if in fact there was some way to increase G, let's just call it

56:24.400 --> 56:29.840
metaphorically a pill, an IQ pill, we should only give it to people at the lower end.

56:30.480 --> 56:38.960
No, it's just intuitively I can see that life becomes easier at the lower end if it's increased.

56:39.600 --> 56:44.960
It becomes less and less. It is an empirical scientific question, but it becomes less and

56:44.960 --> 56:54.000
less obvious to me that more intelligence is better. At the high end, not because it would

56:54.000 --> 57:01.840
make life easier, but it would make whatever problems you're working on more solvable.

57:02.560 --> 57:08.880
And if you are working on artificial intelligence, there's a tremendous potential

57:11.280 --> 57:13.120
for that to improve society.

57:13.120 --> 57:19.840
I understand. So whatever problems you're working on, yes, but there's also the problem

57:19.840 --> 57:26.720
of the human condition. There's love, there's fear, and all of those beautiful things that

57:26.720 --> 57:31.440
sometimes if you're good at solving problems, you're going to create more problems for yourself.

57:32.000 --> 57:38.240
It's I'm not exactly sure. So ignorance is bliss is a thing. So there might be a place,

57:38.240 --> 57:43.600
there might be a sweet spot of intelligence given your environment, given your personality,

57:43.600 --> 57:48.000
all of those kinds of things. And that becomes less beautifully complicated,

57:48.000 --> 57:53.040
the more and more intelligent you become. But that's a question for literature,

57:53.040 --> 57:54.560
not for science, perhaps.

57:54.560 --> 58:00.560
Well, imagine this. Imagine there was an IQ pill and it was developed by a private company.

58:01.520 --> 58:08.720
And they are willing to sell it to you. And whatever price they put on it, you are willing

58:08.720 --> 58:14.720
to pay it because you would like to be smarter. But just before they give you a pill, they give

58:14.720 --> 58:25.760
you a disclaimer form to sign. You understand that this pill has no guarantee that your life

58:25.760 --> 58:28.480
is going to be better. And in fact, it could be worse.

58:29.120 --> 58:34.640
Well, yes, that's how lawyers work. But I would love for science to answer the question to try

58:34.640 --> 58:40.320
to predict if your life is going to be better or worse when you become more or less intelligent.

58:40.320 --> 58:44.720
It's a fascinating question about what is the sweet spot for the human condition.

58:46.400 --> 58:52.480
Some of the things we see as bugs might be actually features, maybe crucial to our

58:53.040 --> 58:58.400
our overall happiness is our limitations might lead to more happiness than less.

58:58.960 --> 59:05.360
But again, more intelligence is better at the lower end. That's more that's something that's

59:05.360 --> 59:09.840
less arguable and and fascinating if possible to increase.

59:09.840 --> 59:15.360
But you know, there's virtually no research that's based on a neuroscience approach to

59:15.360 --> 59:22.080
solving that problem. All the solutions that have been proposed to solve that problem

59:22.560 --> 59:30.240
or to ameliorate that problem are essentially based on the blank slate assumption that,

59:30.240 --> 59:35.840
you know, enriching the environment, removing barriers, all good things, by the way,

59:35.840 --> 59:40.480
I'm not against any of those things. But there's no empirical evidence that they're going to

59:40.480 --> 59:47.120
improve the general reasoning ability or make people more employable.

59:47.680 --> 59:50.240
Have you read Flowers of Algernon? Yes.

59:51.680 --> 59:54.240
That's to the question of intelligence and happiness.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.440
There are many profound aspects of that story. It was a film that was very good.

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:07.120
The film was called Charlie for the younger people who are listening to this.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:14.880
You might be able to stream it on Netflix or something, but it was a story about

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:22.960
a person with very low IQ who underwent a surgical procedure in the brain and he slowly became a

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:33.040
genius. And the tragedy of the story is the effect was temporary. It's a fascinating story, really.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:38.240
That goes in contrast to the basic human experience that each of us individually have,

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:45.280
but it raises the question of the full range of people you might be able to be

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.520
given different levels of intelligence. You've mentioned the normal distribution.

01:00:52.800 --> 01:01:00.080
So let's talk about it. There's a book called The Bell Curve written in 1994, written by psychologist

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:06.880
Richard Herrnstein and political scientist Charles Murray. Why was this book so controversial?

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:15.040
This is a fascinating book. I know Charles Murray. I've had many conversations with him.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.720
Yeah. What is the book about?

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:23.680
The book is about the importance of intelligence in everyday life.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:32.800
That's what the book is about. It's an empirical book. It has statistical analyses of very large

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:41.520
databases that show that essentially IQ scores or their equivalent are correlated to all kinds of

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:52.160
social problems and social benefits. That in itself is not where the controversy about that

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:59.440
book came. The controversy was about one chapter in that book, and that is a chapter about the

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:07.040
average difference in mean scores between black Americans and white Americans. These

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:11.840
are the terms that were used in the book at the time and are still used to some extent.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:26.720
Historically, or really for decades, it has been observed that disadvantaged groups

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:38.160
score on average lower than Caucasians on academic tests, tests of mental ability,

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:44.160
and especially on IQ tests. The difference is about a standard deviation, which is about 15

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:53.520
points, which is a substantial difference. In the book, Herrnstein and Murray, in this one chapter,

01:02:54.080 --> 01:03:03.680
assert clearly and unambiguously that whether this average difference is due to genetics

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:10.400
or not, they are agnostic. They don't know. Moreover, they assert they don't care

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:17.680
because you wouldn't treat anybody differently knowing if there was a genetic component or not

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:24.000
because that's a group average finding. Every individual has to be treated as an individual.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:30.960
You can't make any assumption about what that person's intellectual ability might be from the

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:40.880
fact of an average group difference. They're very clear about this. Nonetheless, people took away,

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.520
I'm going to choose my words carefully because I have a feeling that many critics didn't actually

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:53.200
read the book. They took away that Herrnstein and Murray were saying that Blacks are genetically

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:59.920
inferior. That was the take-home message. If they weren't saying it, they were implying it because

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:09.600
they had a chapter that discussed this empirical observation of a difference. Isn't this horrible?

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:16.560
And so the reaction to that book was incendiary.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:23.680
What do we know from that book and the research beyond

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.480
about race differences and intelligence?

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:35.200
It's still the most incendiary topic in psychology. Nothing has changed that.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:42.320
Anybody who even discusses it is easily called a racist just for discussing it.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:51.040
It's become fashionable to find racism in any discussion like this. It's unfortunate.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:05:00.960
The short answer to your question is there's been very little actual research on this topic

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:13.600
since the Bell Curve, even before. This really became incendiary in 1969 with an article published

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:19.760
by an educational psychologist named Arthur Jensen. Let's just take a minute and go back to that

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:26.160
to see the Bell Curve in a little bit more historical perspective. Arthur Jensen was

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:35.600
an educational psychologist at UC Berkeley. I knew him as well. In 1969 or 68, the Harvard

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:47.440
Educational Review asked him to do a review article on the early childhood education programs

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:53.280
that were designed to raise the IQs of minority students.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:59.360
This was before the federally funded Head Start program. Head Start

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:03.520
had not really gotten underway at the time Jensen undertook his review

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:11.680
of what were a number of demonstration programs. These demonstration programs were

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:18.800
for young children around kindergarten age. They were specially designed to be cognitively

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:29.360
stimulating to provide lunches, do all the things that people thought would minimize this average

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:37.200
gap of intelligence tests. There was a strong belief among virtually all psychologists that

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:45.520
the cause of the gap was unequal opportunity due to racism, all negative things in the society,

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:53.520
and if you could compensate for this, the gap would go away. Early childhood education back

01:06:53.520 --> 01:07:01.200
then was called literally compensatory education. Jensen looked at these programs. He was an

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:09.600
empirical guy. He understood psychometrics. It was over a hundred page article detailing

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:17.440
these programs and the flaws in their research design. Some of the programs reported IQ gains

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:25.120
on average five points, but a few reported 10, 20, and even 30 point gains. One was called

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:31.840
The Miracle in Milwaukee. That investigator went to jail ultimately for fabricating data,

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:38.720
but the point is that Jensen wrote an article that said, look, the opening sentence of his

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:44.080
article is classic. The opening sentence is, I may not quote it exactly right, but it's,

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:51.200
we have tried compensatory education and it has failed. He showed that these gains

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:59.120
were essentially nothing. You couldn't really document empirically any gains at all from these

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:07.440
really earnest efforts to increase IQ, but he went a step further, a fateful step further.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:15.040
He said, not only have these efforts failed, but because they have had essentially no impact,

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:22.000
we have to re-examine our assumption that these differences are caused by environmental things

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:29.360
that we can address with education. We need to consider a genetic influence, whether there's a

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:35.280
genetic influence on this group difference. So you said that this is one of the more controversial

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:40.720
works ever. I think it's the most infamous paper in all of psychology, I would go on to say,

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:49.680
because in 1969, the genetic data was very skimpy on this question, skimpy and controversial. It's

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:55.040
always been controversial, but it was even skimpy and controversial. It's kind of a long story that

01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:04.160
I go into a little bit in more detail in the book Neuroscience of Intelligence, but to say he was

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:10.480
vilified is an understatement. I mean, he couldn't talk it at the American Psychological Association

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:18.160
without bomb threats clearing the lecture hall. Campus security watched him all the time. They

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:28.880
opened his mail. He had to retreat to a different address. This was one of the earliest kinds. This

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:36.880
is before the internet and kind of internet social media mobs, but it was that intense.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:44.880
And I have written that overnight after the publication of this article,

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:53.280
all intelligence research became radioactive. Nobody wanted to talk about it. And then

01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:04.800
nobody was doing more research. And then the bell curve came along and the Jensen controversy was

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:10.080
dying down. I have stories that Jensen told me about his interaction with the Nixon White House

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:16.080
on this issue. I mean, this was like a really big deal. It was some unbelievable stories,

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:22.720
but he told me this, so I kind of believe these stories. Nonetheless, 25 years later,

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:33.200
all the silence basically saying, nobody wants to do this kind of research. There's so much

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:40.960
pressure, so much attack against this kind of research. And here's sort of a bold, stupid,

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:46.720
crazy people that decided to dive right back in. I wonder how much discussion that was. Do we

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:54.400
include this chapter or not? Murray has said they discussed it and they felt they should include it

01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:00.720
and they were very careful in the way they wrote it, which did them no good.

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:08.320
Yeah. So as a matter of fact, when the bell curve came out, it was so controversial.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:15.600
I got a call from a television show called Nightline. It was with a broadcaster called

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:21.600
Ted Koppel, who had this evening show, I think it was on late at night, talked about news. It

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:29.200
was a straight up news thing. And a producer called and asked if I would be on it to talk about

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:36.480
the bell curve. And I said, you know, she asked me what I thought about the bell curve as a book.

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:43.520
I said, look, it's a very good book. It talks about the role of intelligence in society. And

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:48.160
she said, no, no, what do you think about the chapter on race? That's what we want you to

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:57.280
talk about. I remember this conversation. I said, well, she said, what would you say if you were on

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:06.800
TV? And I said, well, what I would say is that it's not at all clear if there's any genetic component

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:16.880
to intelligence, any differences, but if there were a strong genetic component,

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:24.400
that would be a good thing. And, you know, complete silence on the other end of the phone.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:32.560
And she said, well, what do you mean? And I said, well, if it's the more genetic any difference is,

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:39.120
the more it's biological. And if it's biological, we can figure out how to fix it.

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:43.600
I see. That's interesting. She said, would you say that on television?

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:47.200
Yes. I said, no. And so that was the end of that.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:13:01.280
So that's for more like biology is within the reach of science and the environment is a public

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:07.840
policy, social and all those kinds of things. It's from your perspective, whichever one

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.880
you think is more amenable to solutions in the in the short term is the one that excites you.

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:16.240
But you saying that is good.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:25.840
The truth of genetic differences, no matter what the between groups

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:34.960
is a painful, harmful, potentially potentially dangerous thing.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:41.840
Let me ask you to this question, whether it's bell curve or any research on race differences.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:49.120
Can that be used to increase the amount of racism in the world? Can that be used to increase the

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.720
amount of hate in the world? Do you think about this kind of stuff?

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.720
I've thought about this a lot, not as a scientist, but as a person.

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:11.680
And my sense is there is such enormous reservoirs of hate and racism that have nothing to do with

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.160
have nothing to do with scientific knowledge of the data that speak against that.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:26.800
That no, I don't I don't want to give racist groups of veto power over what scientists study.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:33.600
If you think that the differences and by the way, virtually no one disagrees that there are

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:38.240
differences in scores. It's all about what causes them and how to fix it.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:44.640
So if you think this is a cultural problem, then you must ask the problem.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:50.320
Do you want to change anything about the culture or are you okay with

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:55.360
the culture because you don't feel it's appropriate to change a person's culture?

01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:00.720
So are you okay with that and the fact that that may lead to disadvantages in school achievement?

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:07.280
It's a question. If you think it's environmental, what are the environmental

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:14.400
parameters that can be fixed? I'll tell you one lead in, you know, lead from gasoline

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:20.880
in the atmosphere, lead in paint, lead in water. That's an environmental toxin that

01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:25.920
society has the means to eliminate and they should.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:32.240
Yeah, just to sort of trying to find some insights and conclusion to this very difficult topic.

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:40.240
Is there been research on environment versus genetics, nature versus nurture on this question

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:46.640
of race differences? There is not, no one wants to do this research. First of all,

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:52.320
it's hard research to do. Second of all, it's a minefield. No one wants to spend their career

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:59.280
on it. Tenured people don't want to do it, let alone students. The way I talk about it,

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:04.240
well, before I tell you the way I talk about it, I want to say one more thing about Jensen.

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:12.320
He was once asked by a journalist straight out, are you a racist? His answer was very interesting.

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:19.200
His answer was, I've thought about that a lot and I've concluded it doesn't matter.

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:23.520
Now I know what he meant by this.

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:25.680
The guts to say that, wow.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:29.760
He was a very unusual person. I think he had a touch of Asperger's syndrome,

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:34.000
to tell you the truth, because I saw him in many circumstances.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.960
He would be canceled on Twitter immediately with that sentence.

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:40.720
Yeah, but what he meant was he had a hypothesis.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:48.800
With respect to group differences, he called it the default hypothesis. He said whatever factors

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:54.240
affect individual intelligence are likely the same factors that affect group differences.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:17:01.600
It was the default, but it was a hypothesis. It should be tested. If it turned out empirical

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:05.520
tests didn't support the hypothesis, he was happy to move on to something else.

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:15.120
He was absolutely committed to that scientific ideal. It's an empirical question.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.640
We should look at it and let's see what happens.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:23.360
The scientific method cannot be racist from his perspective.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:29.440
It doesn't matter what the scientists, if they follow the scientific method,

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:32.000
it doesn't matter what they believe.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:40.080
And if they are biased and they consciously or unconsciously bias the data, other people

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:47.520
will come along to replicate it. They will fail and the process over time will work.

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:56.000
Let me push back on this idea because psychology to me is full of gray areas.

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:05.280
What I've observed about psychology, even replication crisis aside, is that something

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:12.000
about the media, something about journalism, something about the virality of ideas in the

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:20.800
public sphere, they misinterpret. They take up things from studies, willfully or from

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:25.360
ignorance misinterpret findings and tell narratives around that.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:32.080
I personally believe for me, I'm not saying that broadly about science, but for me,

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:39.360
it's my responsibility to anticipate the ways in which findings will be misinterpreted.

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:46.880
So, I've thought about this a lot because I published papers on semi-autonomous vehicles

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:54.960
and those, you know, cars, people die in cars. There's people that have written me

01:18:54.960 --> 01:19:01.680
letters saying emails, nobody writes letters, I wish they did, that have blood in my hands

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:06.000
because of things that I would say positive or negative, there's consequences.

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:11.280
In the same way when you're a researcher of intelligence, I'm sure you might get emails

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:18.480
or at least people might believe that finding your study is going to be used by a large number

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:24.640
of people to increase the amount of hate in the world. I think there's some responsibility

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:32.480
on scientists, but for me, I think there's a great responsibility to anticipate the ways

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:39.120
things will be misinterpreted and there you have to, first of all, decide whether you want to say

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:45.840
a thing at all or do the study at all, publish the study at all, and to the words with which

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:53.040
you explain it. I find this on Twitter a lot actually, which is when I write a tweet,

01:19:53.040 --> 01:20:00.720
I'm usually just doing it so innocently, I'll write it, you know, it takes me like

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:05.120
five seconds to write it or whatever, 30 seconds to write it, and then I'll think,

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:11.520
all right, I close my eyes open and try to see how will the world interpret this,

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:15.840
what are the ways in which this will be misinterpreted? I'll sometimes adjust that

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:22.960
tweet to see, yeah, so in my mind it's clear, but that's because it's my mind from which this

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:29.120
tweet came, but you have to think in a fresh mind that sees this and it's spread across

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:36.640
a large number of other minds, how will the interpretation morph? I mean, for a tweet,

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:44.480
it's a silly thing, it doesn't matter, but for a scientific paper and study and finding,

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:49.600
I think it matters, so I don't know, I don't know what your thoughts are about on that,

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:56.960
because maybe for Jensen, the data is there, what do you want me to do? This is a scientific

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:03.040
process that's been carried out, if you think the data was polluted by bias, do other studies

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:14.560
that reveal the bias, but the data is there, and I'm not a poet, I'm not a literary writer,

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:19.280
what do you want me to do? I'm just presenting you the data, what do you think on that spectrum,

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:26.320
what's the role of a scientist? The reason I do podcasts, the reason I write books for the public,

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:35.200
is to explain what I think the data mean and what I think the data don't mean. I don't do very much

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:41.920
on Twitter other than to retweet references to papers, I don't think it's my role to explain

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:51.440
these because they're complicated, they're nuanced, but when you decide not to do a scientific study

01:21:51.440 --> 01:22:00.960
or not to publish a result because you're afraid the result could be harmful or insensitive,

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:09.840
that's not an unreasonable thought, and people will make different conclusions and decisions

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:18.720
about that. I wrote about this, I'm the editor of a journal called Intelligence which publishes

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:25.600
scientific papers, sometimes we publish papers on group differences, those papers sometimes

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:30.720
are controversial, these papers are written for a scientific audience, they're not written for the

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:40.160
Twitter audience, I don't promote them very much on Twitter, but in a scientific paper,

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:47.600
you have to now choose your words carefully also because those papers are picked up by

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:54.320
non-scientists, by writers of various kinds, and you have to be available to discuss

01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:03.360
what you're saying and what you're not saying. Sometimes you are successful at having a good

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:10.560
conversation like we are today that doesn't start out pejorative. Other times I've been asked to

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:18.800
participate in debates where my role would be to justify race science. Well you can see, you start

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:28.080
out, that was a BBC request that I received. I have so much, it's a love-hate relationship,

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:34.560
mostly hate with these shallow journalism organizations, so they would want to use you

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:42.080
as a kind of in a debate setting to communicate as to like there is race differences between groups

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:49.680
and make that into debate and put you in a role of- Justifying racism. Justifying racism. That's

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:54.800
what they're asking me to do. Courses like educating about this field of the science of

01:23:54.800 --> 01:24:01.280
intelligence, yeah. I want to say one more thing before we get off the normal distribution. You

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:08.160
also asked me, what is the science after the bell curve? And the short answer is there's not much

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:15.200
new work, but whatever work there is supports the idea that there still are group differences.

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:23.520
It's arguable whether those differences have diminished at all or not. And there is still

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:32.400
a major problem in underperformance for school achievement for many disadvantaged and minority

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:41.520
students, and there so far is no way to fix it. What do we do with this information? Is this now

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:48.720
a task now? We'll talk about the future on the neuroscience and the biology side, but in terms of

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:53.360
this information as a society, in the public policy, in the political space,

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:58.080
in the social space, what do we do with this information? I've thought a lot about this. The

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:07.280
first step is to have people interested in policy understand what the data actually show to pay

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:14.720
attention to intelligence data. You can read policy papers about education and using your

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:20.160
word processor. You can search for the word intelligence. You can search a 20,000 word

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:25.840
document in a second and find out the word intelligence does not appear anywhere.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:33.200
In most discussions about what to do about achievement gaps, I'm not talking about test

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:39.120
gaps. I'm talking about actual achievement gaps in schools, which everyone agrees is a problem.

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:43.040
The word intelligence doesn't appear among educators.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:44.720
That's fascinating.

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:50.640
As a matter of fact, in California, there has been tremendous controversy about recent

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:58.160
attempts to revise the curriculum for math in high schools. We had a Stanford professor

01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:06.400
of education who was running this review assert there's no such thing as a mathematical talent.

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:13.520
And she wanted to get rid of the advanced classes in math because not everyone could do that.

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:17.680
Now, of course, this has been very controversial. They've retreated somewhat.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:22.640
But the idea that a university professor was in charge of this who believes

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:34.080
that there's no talent, that it doesn't exist, this is rather shocking, let alone the complete

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:37.360
absence of intelligence data.

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:41.200
By the way, let me tell you something about what the intelligence data show.

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:50.480
Let's take race out of it. Even though the origins of these studies were a long time ago,

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:57.120
I'm blocking on the name of the report. The Coleman Report was a famous report about education.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:04.160
And they measured all kinds of variables about schools, about teachers, and they looked at

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:13.440
academic achievement as an outcome. And they found the most predictive variables of education

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:20.880
outcome were the variables the student brought with him or her into the school, essentially

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:28.560
their ability. And that when you combine the school and the teacher variables together,

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.520
the quality of the school, the funding of the school, the quality of the teachers,

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:37.440
their education, you put all the teacher and school variables together,

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:43.200
it barely accounted for 10% of the variance. And this has been replicated now.

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:53.200
So the best research we have shows that school variables and teacher variables together

01:27:53.840 --> 01:28:01.520
account for about 10% of student academic achievement. Now, you want to have some policy

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:07.680
on improving academic achievement, how much money do you want to put into teacher education?

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:14.400
How much money do you want to put into the quality of the school administration? You know

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:20.080
who you can ask? You can ask the Gates Foundation, because they spent a tremendous amount of money

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:27.440
doing that. And at the end of it, because they're measurement people, they want to know the data,

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:32.640
they found it had no impact at all. And they've kind of pulled out of that kind of program.

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:40.080
So, boy, let me ask you, this is me talking, but there's...

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.560
Just the two of us.

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:48.720
Just the two of us, but I'm going to say some funny and ridiculous things, so you're surely

01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:56.240
not approving of it. But there's a movie called Clerks. I've seen it, yeah.

01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:01.920
There's a funny scene in there where a lovely couple are talking about the number of previous

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:09.520
sexual partners they had. And the woman says that, I believe she just had a handful,

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:16.240
like two or three or something like that, sexual partners. But then she also mentioned that she...

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:21.600
What's that called? Felicia, what's the scientific? But she went, you know,

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:29.680
gave a blowjob to 37 guys, I believe it is. And so that has to do with the truth.

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:39.680
So sometimes, knowing the truth can get in the way of a successful relationship of love of some of

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:48.640
the human flourishing. And that seems to me that's at the core here, that facing some kind of truth

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:55.600
that's not able to be changed makes it difficult to sort of...

01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:04.880
It's limiting as opposed to empowering. That's the concern. If you sort of test for intelligence

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:10.560
and lay the data out, it feels like you will give up on certain people. You will

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:16.000
you'll sort of start bidding people as like, well, this person is like,

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:21.680
let's focus on the average people or let's focus on the very intelligent people. That's the concern.

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:31.520
And there's a kind of intuition that if we just don't measure and we don't use that data,

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:38.800
that we would treat everybody equal and give everybody equal opportunity. If we have the data

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:46.240
in front of us, we're likely to mis-distribute the amount of sort of attention we allocate,

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:51.280
resources we allocate to people. That's probably the concern.

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:59.680
It's a realistic concern, but I think it's a misplaced concern if you want to fix the problem.

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:03.840
If you want to fix the problem, you have to know what the problem is.

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:09.520
Now, let me tell you this. Let's go back to the bell curve, not the bell curve,

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:18.400
but the normal distribution. 16% of the population on average has an IQ under 85,

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:26.640
which means they're very hard. If you have an IQ under 85, it's very hard to find gainful employment

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:36.640
at a salary that sustains you at least minimally in modern life. Not impossible, but it's very

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:46.400
difficult. 16% of the population of the United States is about 51 or 52 million people with IQs

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:55.600
under 85. This is not a small issue. 14 million children have IQs under 85.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Is this something we want to ignore? What is the Venn diagram when you have people

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:12.720
with IQs under 85 and you have achievement in school or achievement in life?

01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:20.240
There's a lot of overlap there. This is why, to go back to the IQ pill, if there were a way

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:30.880
to shift that curve toward the higher end, that would have a big impact.

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:35.440
If I could, maybe before we talk about the impact on life and so on,

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:41.920
some of the criticisms of the bell curve. Stephen Jay Gould wrote that the bell curve

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:47.520
rests on four incorrect assumptions. It would be just interesting to get your thoughts on

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:53.360
the four assumptions, which are intelligence must be reducible to a single number, intelligence must

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:59.520
be capable of rank-ordering people in a linear order, intelligence must be primarily genetically

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:06.800
based, and intelligence must be essentially immutable. Maybe not as criticisms, but as

01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:12.640
thoughts about intelligence. We could spend a lot of time on him.

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:26.240
He wrote that in 1985, 1984. His views were overtly political, not scientific. He was a

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:33.280
scientist, but his views on this were overtly political. I would encourage people listening

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:43.040
to this, if they really want to understand his criticisms, they should just Google what he had

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:52.560
to say and Google the scientific reviews of his book, The Mismeasure of Man, and they will take

01:33:52.560 --> 01:34:00.000
these statements apart. They were wrong. Not only were they wrong, but when he asserted in his first

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:08.000
book that there was no biological basis essentially to IQ, by the time the second edition came around,

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:16.640
there were studies of MRIs showing that brain size, brain volume were correlated to IQ scores,

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:22.240
which he declined to put in his book. I'm learning a lot today. I didn't know

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:28.720
actually the extent of his work. I was just using a few little snippets of criticism.

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.560
That's interesting. There's a battle here. He wrote a book, Mismeasure of Man,

01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:39.600
that's missing a lot of the scientific grounding. His book is highly popular in colleges today.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:44.240
You can find it in any college bookstore under assigned reading. It's highly popular. The

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:48.880
Mismeasure of Man? Yes, highly influential. Can you speak to the Mismeasure of Man? I'm

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:54.240
undereducated about this. Is this the book basically criticizing the ideas in the book?

01:34:54.880 --> 01:35:04.480
Where those four things came from. It is really a book that was really taken apart point by point

01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:11.280
by a number of people who actually understood the data. He didn't care. He didn't modify anything.

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:17.920
Listen, because this is such a sensitive topic, like I said, I believe

01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:27.200
that the impact of the work, as it is misinterpreted, has to be considered,

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:32.720
because it's not just going to be scientific discourse. It's going to be political discourse.

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:39.760
There's going to be debates. There's going to be politically motivated people that will use

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:46.640
messages in each direction. Make something like the bell curve the enemy or the support

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:56.160
for one's racist beliefs. I think you have to consider that, but it's difficult because

01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:05.120
Nietzsche was used by Hitler to justify a lot of his beliefs. It's not exactly

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:12.000
on Nietzsche to anticipate Hitler or how his ideas will be misinterpreted and used for evil.

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:17.520
But there is a balance there. I understand. This is really interesting. I didn't know. Is there

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:22.320
any criticism of the book you find compelling or interesting or challenging to you from a

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:25.520
scientific perspective? There were factual criticisms

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:32.960
about the nature of the statistics that were used, the statistical analyses. These were more

01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:38.960
technical criticisms. They were addressed by Murray in a couple of articles where he took all the

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:46.560
criticisms and spoke to them. People listening to this podcast can certainly find all those online.

01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:54.000
It's very interesting. But Murray went on to write some additional books, two in the last couple of

01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:03.120
years. One about human diversity, where he goes through the data refuting the idea that race is

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:10.400
only a social construct with no biological meaning. He discusses the data. It's a very good

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:17.680
discussion. You don't have to agree with it, but he presents data in a cogent way. He talks about

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:24.960
the critics of that and he talks about their data in a cogent, non-personal way. It's a very

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:30.640
informative discussion. The book is called Human Diversity. He talks about race and he talks about

01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:38.320
gender, same thing, about sex differences. More recently, he's written what might be his final

01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:49.040
say on this, a book called Facing Reality, where he talks about this again. He can certainly defend

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:56.480
himself. He doesn't need me to do that, but I would urge people who have heard about him and

01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:04.000
the bell curve and who think they know what's in it, you are likely incorrect and you need to

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:13.440
read it for yourself. But it is scientifically, it's a serious subject. It's a difficult subject.

01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:20.560
Ethically, it's a difficult subject. Everything you said here calmly and thoughtfully is difficult.

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:28.480
It's difficult for me to even consider that G-factor exists. I don't mean that somehow

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:35.440
G-factor is inherently racist or sexist or whatever. It's difficult in the way that

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:41.360
considering the fact that we die one day is difficult. That we are limited by our biology

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:48.960
is difficult. At least from an American perspective, you would like to believe that

01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:56.880
everything is possible in this world. Well, that leads us to what I think we should do

01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:08.560
with this information. What I think we should do with this information is unusual because I think

01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:14.880
what we need to do is fund more neuroscience research on the molecular biology of learning

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:24.960
and memory because one definition of intelligence is based on how much you can learn and how much

01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:33.120
you can remember. If you accept that definition of intelligence, then there are molecular studies

01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:42.800
going on now and Nobel Prize is being won on molecular biology or molecular neurobiology

01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:50.480
of learning and memory. Now, the step those researchers, those scientists need to take

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:57.280
when it comes to intelligence is to focus on the concept of individual differences.

01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:08.880
Intelligence research has individual differences as its heart because it assumes that people

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:16.640
differ on this variable and those differences are meaningful and need understanding. Cognitive

01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:23.680
psychologists who have morphed into molecular biologists studying learning and memory hate

01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:30.960
the concept of individual differences historically. Some now are coming around to it. I once sat next

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:41.360
to a Nobel Prize winner for his work on memory and I asked him about individual differences and

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:49.120
he said, don't go there. It'll set us back 50 years. I said, don't you think they're the key

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:55.360
though to understand? Why can some people remember more than others? He said, you don't want to go

01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:00.560
there. I think the 21st century will be remembered by the technology and the science that

01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:07.280
goes to individual differences because we have now data. We have now the tools to much, much better

01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:13.920
to start to measure, start to estimate, not just on the sort of through tests and IQ test type of

01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:20.160
things sort of outside the body kind of things, but measuring all kinds of stuff about the body.

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:26.080
So you had to truly go into the molecular biology, to the neurobiology, to the neuroscience.

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:36.960
Let me ask you about the life. How does intelligence correlate with or lead to or

01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:40.720
has anything to do with career success? You've mentioned these kinds of things and

01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:46.640
is there any data? You've had an excellent conversation with Jordan Peterson, for example.

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:52.640
Is there any data on what intelligent means for success in life?

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:58.960
Success in life. There is a tremendous amount of validity data

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:10.320
that looked at intelligence test scores and various measures of life success.

01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:19.280
Now, of course, life success is a pretty broad topic and not everybody agrees on

01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:27.600
what success means, but there's general agreement on certain aspects of success

01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:35.040
that can be measured. Including life expectancy, like you said.

01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:44.560
Life expectancy. Now, there's life success. Life expectancy. I mean,

01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:52.720
that is such an interesting finding, but IQ scores are also correlated to things like

01:42:52.720 --> 01:43:01.440
income. Now, okay, so who thinks income means you're successful? That's not the point. The

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:09.680
point is that income is one empirical measure in this culture that says something about your

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:15.120
level of success. You can define success in ways that have nothing to do with income.

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:22.960
You can define success based on your evolutionary natural selection success.

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:32.000
You know, but for variables, and even that, by the way, is correlated to IQ in some studies.

01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:43.280
So, however you want to define success, IQ is important. It's not the only determinant.

01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:47.440
People get hung up on, well, what about personality? What about so-called emotional

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:55.040
intelligence? Yes, all those things matter. The thing that matters empirically, the single thing

01:43:55.040 --> 01:44:01.680
that matters the most is your general ability, your general mental, intellectual ability,

01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:09.280
your reasoning ability. And the more complex your vocation, the more complex your job,

01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:16.240
the more G matters. G doesn't matter, and a lot of occupations don't require complex thinking,

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:22.480
and there are occupations like that, and G doesn't matter. Within an occupation,

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:32.720
the G might not matter so much. So that if you look at all the professors at MIT

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:42.240
and had a way to rank order them on, you know, there's a ceiling effect is what I'm saying,

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:49.120
that, you know. Also, when you get past a certain threshold, then there's impact on wealth,

01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:54.320
for example, or career success, however that's defined in each individual discipline, but

01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:59.200
after a certain point, it doesn't matter. Actually, it does matter in certain things.

01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:06.880
So, for example, there is a very classic study that was started at Johns Hopkins

01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:11.200
when I was a graduate student there. I actually worked on this study at the very beginning.

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:16.560
It's the study of mathematically and scientifically precocious youth, and they gave

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:26.000
junior high school students, age 11 and 12, the standard SAT math exam,

01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:35.040
and they found a very large number of students scored very high on this exam, not a large number.

01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:40.640
I mean, they found many students when they cast the net, they're all a Baltimore,

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:47.040
they found a number of students who scored as high on the SAT math when they were 12 years old

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:56.080
as incoming Hopkins freshmen. And they said, gee, now this is interesting. What shall we do now?

01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:03.760
And on a case by case basis, they got some of those kids into their local community college

01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:11.920
math programs. Many of those kids went on to be very successful. And now there's a 50-year

01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:22.720
follow-up of those kids. And it turns out these kids were in the top 1%. So everybody in the study

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:29.760
is in the top 1%. If you take that group, that rarefied group and divide them into quartiles,

01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:40.720
so you have the top 25% of the top 1% and the bottom 25% of the top 1%, you can find

01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:51.600
unmeasurable variables of success. The top quartile does better than the bottom quartile.

01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:58.160
In the top 1%, they have more patents, they have more publications, they have more tenure at

01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:04.960
universities. And you're dividing them based on their score at age 12.

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:12.240
I wonder how much interesting data is in the variability, in the differences.

01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:21.680
Oh, boy. That's very interesting, but it's also, I don't know, somehow painful. I don't know why

01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:30.800
it's so painful. That G-factor is so determinant of even in the nuanced top percent.

01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:36.480
This is interesting that you find that painful. Do you find it painful that people with charisma

01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:42.880
are very successful, can be very successful in life even though having no other attributes other

01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:46.640
than they're famous and people like them? Do you find that painful?

01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:54.240
Yes, if that charisma is untrainable. So one of the things, again, this is like I learned

01:47:54.240 --> 01:48:01.600
psychology from the Johnny Depp trial, but one of the things the psychologist, the personality

01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:08.800
psychologist, he can maybe speak to this because he had interest in this for time, is she was saying

01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:16.800
that personality, technically speaking, is the thing that doesn't change over a lifetime.

01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:21.440
I don't know if she was actually implying that you're born with it.

01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:22.640
Well, it's a trait.

01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:28.880
It's a trait that's relatively stable over time. I think that's generally correct.

01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:37.200
So to the degree your personality is stable over time, yes, that too is painful. Because

01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:47.280
what's not painful is the thing, if I'm fat and out of shape, I can exercise and become healthier

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:54.400
in that way. If my diet is a giant mess and that's resulting in some kind of conditions that my body

01:48:54.400 --> 01:49:02.000
is experiencing, I can fix that by having a better diet. That's sort of my actions, my willed actions

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:09.200
can make a change. If charisma is part of the personality that's the part of the charisma that

01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:16.320
is part of the personality that is stable. Yeah, yeah, that's painful too. Because it's like,

01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:19.200
oh shit, I'm stuck with this. I'm stuck with this.

01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:26.320
Well, I mean, and this pretty much generalizes to every aspect of your being. This is who you are.

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:31.440
You got to deal with it. And what it undermines, of course, is a realistic appreciation

01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:41.520
for this undermines the fairly recent idea prevalent in this country that if you work hard,

01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:48.320
you can be anything you want to be, which has morphed from the original idea that if you work

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:57.520
hard, you can be successful. Those are two different things. And now we have, if you work

01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:05.200
hard, you can be anything you want to be. This is completely unrealistic. Sorry, it just is. Now,

01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:11.280
you can work hard and be successful. There's no question. But you know what, I could work very

01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:17.840
hard and I am not going to be a successful theoretical physicist. I'm just not.

01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:24.000
That said, I mean, we should, because we had this conversation already, but it's good to repeat

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:32.640
the fact that you're not going to be a theoretical physicist is not judgment on your basic humanity,

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:39.600
returning again to the old men, which means men and women are created equal. So again,

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:44.400
some of the differences we're talking about in quote unquote success, wealth,

01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:55.680
a number of whether you win a Nobel Prize or not, that doesn't put a measure on your basic humanity

01:50:55.680 --> 01:51:02.880
and basic value and even goodness of you as a human being because that,

01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:10.480
that your basic role and value in society is largely within your control.

01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:17.760
It's some of these measures that we're talking about. It's good. It's good to remember this.

01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:26.080
One question about the Flynn effect. What is it? Are humans getting smarter over the years,

01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:33.600
over the decades, over the centuries? The Flynn effect is James Flynn passed away about a year ago,

01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:45.520
uh, published a, uh, a set of analysis, uh, going back a couple of decades when we first noticed

01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:52.720
this, that IQ scores when you looked, uh, over the years seemed to be drifting up.

01:51:54.320 --> 01:52:02.160
Now this was not unknown to the people who make the test because they re-norm the test periodically,

01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:08.480
and they have to re-norm the test periodically because what 10 items correct

01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:16.720
meant relative to other people 50 years ago is not the same as what 10 items mean relative

01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:24.400
today. People are getting more things correct. Now the scores have been drifting up about three

01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:31.280
points. IQ scores have been drifting up about three points per decade. This is not a personal

01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:39.360
effect. This is a cohort effect was not for an individual, but the world. So what's that?

01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:46.960
And this has presented intelligence researchers with a great mystery. Two questions. First,

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:53.760
is it effect on the 50% of the variance? That's the G factor or on the other 50%.

01:52:53.760 --> 01:53:02.560
And there's evidence that it is a G factor effect. And second, what on earth causes this?

01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:09.520
And doesn't this mean intelligence and G factor cannot be genetic because the scale of natural

01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:18.400
selection is much, much longer than a couple of decades ago. And so it's been used to try to

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:25.840
undermine the idea that there can be a genetic influence on intelligence. But certainly,

01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:32.800
it can be the Flynn effect can affect the non-genetic aspects of intelligence because

01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:41.440
genes account for maybe 50% of the variance. It could be as high as 80% for adults, but

01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:49.520
let's just say 50% for discussion. So the Flynn effect, it's still a mystery.

01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:54.640
It's still a mystery. That's still a mystery. Although the evidence is coming out. I told you

01:53:54.640 --> 01:54:00.400
before I edited a journal on intelligence and we're doing a special issue in honor of James Flynn.

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:08.080
So I'm starting to see papers now on really the latest research on this. I think most people who

01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:15.440
specialize in this area of trying to understand the Flynn effect are coming to the view based on

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:24.480
data that it has to do with advances in nutrition and healthcare. And there's also evidence

01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:29.440
that the effect is slowing down and possibly reversing.

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:40.720
Oh boy. So nutrition would still be connected to the G-factor. So nutrition as it relates to

01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:46.480
the G-factor, so the biology that leads to the intelligence. That would be the claim,

01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:54.880
the hypothesis being tested by the researchers. Yes. And there's some evidence from infants

01:54:55.520 --> 01:55:01.840
that nutrition has made a difference. And so it's not an unreasonable connection,

01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:08.240
but does it negate the idea that there's a genetic influence? Not logically at all.

01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:14.400
So, but it is very interesting. So that if you take an IQ test today,

01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:23.200
but you normalize, but you take the score and use the tables that were available in 1940,

01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:30.000
you're going to wind up with a much higher IQ number. So are we really

01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:39.440
smarter than a couple of generations ago? No, but we might be able to solve problems a little better

01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:47.840
and make use of our G because of things like Sesame Street and other curricula in school.

01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:55.520
More people are going to school. So there are a lot of factors here that disentangle.

01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:00.160
It's fascinating though. It's fascinating that there's not clear answers yet.

01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:06.880
That as a population, we're getting smarter. We just zoom out. That's what it looks like as

01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:10.880
a population getting smarter. It's interesting to see what the effects of that are. I mean,

01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:16.720
this raises the question. We've mentioned it many times, but haven't clearly addressed it, which is

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:23.760
nature versus nurture question. So how much of intelligence is nature? How much of it is nurture?

01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:30.160
How much of it is determined by genetics versus environment? All of it. All of it is genetics.

01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:37.040
No, all of it is nature and nurture. Yeah. So yes. Yes. Okay.

01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:45.840
That's not as much of a variance. Can you apportion to either? Yeah. Most of the people who work in

01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:53.520
this field say that that is the framing of that. If the question is framed that way, it can't be

01:56:53.520 --> 01:57:00.400
answered because nature and nurture are not two independent influences. They interact with each

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:08.960
other and understanding those interactions is so complex that many behavioral geneticists say

01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:17.680
it is today impossible and always will be impossible to disentangle that no matter what

01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:25.280
kind of advances there are in DNA technology and genomic informatics. But there's still,

01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:32.480
to push back on that, that same intuition from behavioral geneticists would lead me to believe

01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:38.240
that there cannot possibly be a stable G factor because it's super complex.

01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:48.160
Many of them would assert that as a logical outcome, but because I believe there is a stable

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:54.640
G factor from lots of sources of data, not just one study, but lots of sources of data over decades,

01:57:55.600 --> 01:58:05.520
I am more amenable to the idea that whatever interactions between genes and environment exist,

01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:16.800
they can be explicated, they can be studied, and that information can be used as a basis

01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:21.920
for molecular biology of intelligence. Yeah. And we'll do this exact question because

01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:30.160
doesn't the stability of the G factor give you at least a hint that there is a

01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:37.680
biological basis for intelligence? Yes. I think it's clear that the fact that

01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:47.520
an IQ score is correlated to things like thickness of your cortex, that it's correlated to glucose

01:58:47.520 --> 01:59:00.480
metabolic rate in your brain, that identical twins reared apart are highly similar in their IQ

01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:10.240
scores. These are all important observations that certainly indicate, not just suggest,

01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:15.760
but indicate that there's a biological basis. And does anyone believe intelligence has nothing to

01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:23.520
do with the brain? I mean, it's so obvious. Well, indirectly definitely has to do with it,

01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:28.480
but the question is environment interacting with the brain or is it the actual

01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:39.120
raw hardware of the brain? Well, some would say that the raw hardware of the brain

01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:52.000
as it develops from conception through adulthood or at least through the childhood, that so-called

01:59:52.000 --> 02:00:00.880
hardware that you are assuming is mostly genetic in fact is not as deterministic as you might think,

02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:07.040
that it is probabilistic and what affects the probabilities are things like in uterine

02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:15.840
environment and other factors like that, including chance, that chance

02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:25.920
affects the way the neurons are connecting during gestation. It's not, hey, it's pre-programmed.

02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:32.320
So there is pushback on the concept that genes provide a blueprint

02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:41.360
that is a lot more fluid. Well, but also, yeah, so there's a lot, a lot, a lot happens in the first few

02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:51.440
months of development. So in nine months inside the mother's body and in the

02:00:54.400 --> 02:01:00.160
months, the few months afterwards, there's a lot of fascinating stuff, like including chance and luck,

02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:07.280
like you said, how things connect up. The question is afterwards, the neuroplasticity of the brain,

02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:12.160
how much adjustment there is relative to the environment, how much that affects the G factor,

02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:17.120
but that's where the whole conclusions of the studies that we've been talking about is

02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:25.120
that seems to have less and less and less of an effect as pretty quickly. Yes, and I do think

02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:33.040
there is more of a genetic, my view, and I'm not an expert on this, genetics is a highly technical

02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:40.720
and complex subject. I am not a geneticist, not a behavioral geneticist, but my reading of this,

02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:49.520
my interpretation of this is that there is a genetic blueprint more or less, and that has

02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:55.520
a profound influence on your subsequent intellectual development, including the G factor.

02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:04.640
And that's not to say things can't happen to, I mean, if you think of that genes provide a potential,

02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:12.640
fine, and then various variables impact that potential. And every parent of a newborn

02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:21.760
implicitly or explicitly wants to maximize that potential. This is why you buy educational toys.

02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:29.280
This is why you pay attention to organic baby food. This is why you do all these things because you

02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:35.120
want your baby to be as healthy and as smart as possible. And every parent will say that.

02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:45.760
Is there a case to be made, can you steal me on the case, that genetics is a very tiny component

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:52.160
of all of this and the environment is essential? I don't think the data supports that genetics is

02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:57.840
a tiny component. I think the data support the idea that the genetics is a very important,

02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:05.520
and I don't say component. I say influence, very important influence. And the environment is a lot

02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:11.440
less than people believe. Most people believe environment plays a big role. I'm not so sure.

02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:18.080
I guess what I'm asking you is, can you see where what you just said, it might be wrong?

02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:24.960
Can you, can you imagine a world and what kind of evidence would you need to see

02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:30.080
to say, you know what, the intuition, the study so far, like reversing the directions.

02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:35.120
So one of the cool things we have now more and more is we're getting more and more data and the

02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:42.880
rate of the data is escalating because of the digital world. So when you start to look at a

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:49.440
very large scale of data, both on the biology side and the social side, we might be discovering

02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:55.840
we might be discovering some very counterintuitive things about society. We might see the edge cases

02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:02.880
that reveal that if we actually scale those edge cases and they become like the norm that we'll

02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:11.200
have a complete shift in our, like you'll see G factor be able to be modified throughout life

02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:18.880
in the teens and in later life. So is it any case you can make or for

02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:22.560
what your current intuitions are wrong? Yes. And it's a good question because I

02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:26.320
think everyone should always be asked what evidence would change your mind.

02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:33.040
It's certainly not only a fair question, it is really the key question for anybody working on

02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:45.040
any aspect of science. I think that if environment was very important, we would have seen it clearly

02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:52.080
by now. It would have been obvious that school interventions, compensatory education, early

02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:57.760
childhood education, all these things that have been earnestly tried and well-funded,

02:04:57.760 --> 02:05:01.920
well-designed studies would show some effect and they don't.

02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:05.600
They don't. What if the school, the way we've tried school,

02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:11.520
compensatory school sucks and we need to do better? That's what everybody said to Jensen.

02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:18.400
He said, well, maybe we need to start earlier. Maybe we need not do pre-kindergarten,

02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:24.320
but pre-pre-kindergarten. It's always an infinite, well, maybe we didn't get it right,

02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:32.160
but after decades of trying, 50 years, 50 or 60 years of trying, surely something

02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:37.760
would have worked to the point where you could actually see a result and not need a

02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:47.440
probability level at 0.05 on some means. That's the kind of evidence that would change my mind.

02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:53.840
Population level interventions like schooling that you would see,

02:05:56.160 --> 02:06:00.000
this actually has an effect. Yes, and when you take adopted kids

02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:06.560
and they grow up in another family and you find out when those adopted kids are adults,

02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:11.440
their IQ scores don't correlate with the IQ scores of their adoptive parents,

02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:17.520
but they do correlate with their IQ scores of their biological parents whom they've never met.

02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:22.640
These are important, these are powerful observations.

02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:26.320
And it would be convincing to you if the reverse was true.

02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:31.360
Yes, that would be more. And there is some data on adoption that indicates

02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:38.880
that the adopted children are moving a little bit more toward their adoptive parents,

02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:46.400
but to me the overwhelming, I have this concept called the weight of evidence

02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:53.200
where I don't interpret any one study too much. The weight of evidence tells me genes are important,

02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:58.640
but what does that mean? What does it mean that genes are important knowing that gene expression,

02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:05.600
genes don't express themselves in a vacuum, they express themselves in an environment.

02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:11.280
So the environment has to have something to do with it, especially if the best genetic estimates

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:18.400
of the amount of variants are around 50 or even if it's as high as 80%, it still leaves 20%

02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:26.720
of non-genetic. Now maybe that was all luck, maybe that's all chance. I could believe that,

02:07:26.720 --> 02:07:36.160
I could easily believe that. But I do think after 50 years of trying various interventions

02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:41.760
and nothing works, including memory training, including listening to Mozart,

02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:48.880
including playing computer games, none of that has shown any impact on intelligence test scores.

02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:57.040
Is there data on the intelligence, the IQ of parents as it relates to the children?

02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:06.880
Yes, and there is some genetic evidence of an interaction between the parents' IQ and

02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:14.000
the environment. High IQ parents provide an enriched environment which then can

02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:20.720
impact the child in addition to the genes, it's that environment. So there are all these

02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:29.120
interactions that, but it's not, think about the number of books in a household. This was

02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:37.760
a variable that's correlated with IQ. It is. Yeah. Well, why? Especially if the kid never

02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:43.840
reads any of the books. It's because more intelligent people have more books in their

02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:49.760
house. And if you're more intelligent and there's a genetic component to that,

02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:58.240
the child will get those genes or some of those genes as well as the environment. But it's not

02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:05.200
the number of books in the house that actually directly impacts the child. So the two scenarios

02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:13.920
on this are you find that, and this was used to get rid of the SAT test. Oh, the SAT score

02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:18.880
is highly correlated with the social economic status of the parents. So all you're really

02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:24.320
measuring is how rich the parents are. Okay. Well, why are the parents rich?

02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:35.680
Yes. Okay. And so you could, the opposite kind of syllogism is that people who are very bright

02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:44.320
make more money. They can afford homes in better neighborhoods so their kids get better schools.

02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:50.160
Now the kids grow up bright. Where in that chain of events does that come from?

02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:59.040
Well, unless you have a genetically informative research design where you look at siblings that

02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:06.560
have the same biological parents and so on, you can't really disentangle all that. Most studies

02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:13.760
of social economic status and intelligence do not have a genetically informed design.

02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:20.720
So any conclusions they make about the causality of the social economic status being the cause of

02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:29.520
the IQ is a stretch. And where you do find genetically informative designs,

02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:38.720
you find most of the variance in your outcome measures are due to the genetic component.

02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:47.040
And sometimes the SES adds a little, but the weight of evidence is it doesn't add very much

02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:54.160
variance to predict what's going on beyond the genetic variance. So when you actually look at it

02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:59.760
in some, and there aren't that many studies that have genetically informed designs,

02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:05.280
but when you do see those, the genes seem to have an advantage.

02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:08.560
Sorry for the strange questions, but is there a connection between

02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:20.080
fertility or the number of kids that you have and G factor? So the conventional wisdom is

02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:27.840
people of maybe is it higher economic status or something like that or having fewer children?

02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:33.440
I just loosely hear these kinds of things. Is there data that you're aware of in one

02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:38.640
direction or another on this? Strange questions always get strange answers.

02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:44.560
Yes. Do you have a strange answer for that strange question?

02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:51.600
The answer is there were some studies that indicated the more children in a family,

02:11:54.320 --> 02:12:01.280
the firstborn children would be more intelligent than the fourth or fifth or sixth. It's not clear

02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:10.400
that those studies hold up over time. And of course what you see also is that families where

02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:16.320
there are multiple children, four, five, six, seven, really big families,

02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:26.320
the social economic status of those families usually in the modern age is not that high.

02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:34.240
It used to be the aristocracy used to have a lot of kids. I'm not sure exactly, but there have been

02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:45.120
reports of correlations between IQ and fertility, but I'm not sure that the data are very strong,

02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:51.840
that the firstborn child is always the smartest. It seems like there's some data to that,

02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:57.920
but I'm not current on that. How would that be explained? That would be a nurture.

02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:05.920
Well, it could be nurture. It could be in uterine environment. Boy, biology is complicated.

02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:15.840
Like many areas of science, you said earlier that there are a lot of gray areas and

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:27.120
no definitive answers. This is not uncommon in science that the closer you look at a problem,

02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:34.720
the more questions you get, not the fewer questions because the universe is complicated.

02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:43.600
And the idea that we have people on this planet who can study the first nanoseconds of the Big Bang,

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:51.440
that's pretty amazing. And I've always said that if they can study the first nanoseconds of the

02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:56.960
Big Bang, we can certainly figure out something about intelligence that allows that.

02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:03.120
I'm not sure what's more complicated, the human mind or the physics of the universe.

02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:09.680
It's unclear to me. I think we over-emphasize- Well, that's a very humbling statement.

02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:17.280
Maybe it's a very human-centric, egotistical statement that our mind is somehow super

02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:24.960
complicated, but biology is a tricky one to unravel. Consciousness, what is that?

02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:34.160
I've always believed that consciousness and intelligence are the two real fundamental

02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:40.320
problems of the human brain. And therefore, I think they must be related.

02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:48.880
Heart problems like walk together, holding hands, kind of idea.

02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:54.160
You may not know this, but I did some of the early research on anesthetic drugs with brain

02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:59.520
imaging trying to answer the question, what part of the brain is the last to turn off when someone

02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:05.600
loses consciousness? And is that the first part of the brain to turn on when consciousness is

02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:11.600
regained? And I was working with an anesthesiologist named Mike Alkyer, really brilliant at this.

02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:17.360
These were really the first studies of brain imaging using positron emission tomography

02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:27.120
long before fMRI. And you would inject a radioactive sugar that labeled the brain,

02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:31.600
and the harder the brain was working, the more sugar it would take up. And then you could make

02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:40.800
a picture of glucose use in the brain. And he was amazing. He managed to do this. In normal

02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:46.320
volunteers, he brought in and anesthetized as if they were going into surgery.

02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:55.600
He managed all the human subjects' requirements on this research, and he was brilliant at this.

02:15:56.080 --> 02:16:03.840
And what we did is we had these normal volunteers come in on three occasions.

02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:12.880
On one occasion, he gave them enough anesthetic drug so they were a little drowsy.

02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:18.400
And on another occasion, they came in and he fully anesthetized them.

02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:29.040
And he would say, Mike, can you hear me? And the person would say, uh, yeah.

02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:38.560
And then we would scan people and under no anesthetic condition. So same person.

02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:47.520
And we were looking to see if we could see the part of the brain turn off. He subsequently tried

02:16:47.520 --> 02:16:53.440
to do this with FMRI, which has a faster time resolution. And you could do it in real time as

02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:58.160
the person went under and then regain consciousness where you couldn't do that with PET. You had to

02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:03.840
have three different occasions. And the results were absolutely fascinating. We did this with

02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:09.520
different anesthetic drugs, and different drugs impacted different parts of the brain.

02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:16.080
So we were naturally looking for the common one. And it seemed to have something to do with the

02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:24.320
thalamus and consciousness. This was actual data on consciousness, real consciousness,

02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:29.520
actual consciousness. What part of the brain turns on? Uh, what part of the brain turns off?

02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:35.440
It's not so clear, but maybe has something to do with the thalamus.

02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:42.480
The sequence of events seem to have the thalamus in it. Boy. Um, now here's the question.

02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:48.480
Are some people more conscious than others? Are there individual differences in consciousness?

02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:55.360
And I don't mean it in the psychedelic sense. I don't mean it in the political consciousness

02:17:55.360 --> 02:18:00.640
sense. I just mean it in everyday life. Do some people go through everyday life more conscious

02:18:00.640 --> 02:18:05.840
than others? And are those the people we might actually label more intelligent?

02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:10.960
So now the other thing I was looking for is whether the parts of the brain we were

02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:15.200
seeing in the anesthesia studies were the same parts of the brain we were

02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:21.200
seeing in the intelligence studies. Now this is, you know, this was very complicated,

02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:26.240
expensive research. We didn't really have funding to do this. We were trying to do it on the fly.

02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:32.560
I'm not sure anybody has pursued this. You know, I, I, I'm retired now. Uh, he's gone on to other

02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:38.320
things. Uh, but it's, I think it's an area of research that, that would be fascinating to see

02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:44.560
the parts and there are a lot more imaging studies now of consciousness. I'm just not up on them.

02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:52.240
So, but basically the question is which imaging, so newer imaging studies to see in high resolution,

02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:58.800
spatial and temporal way, which part of the brain lights up while when you're doing intelligence

02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:03.920
tasks and which parts of the brain lights up when you're doing consciousness tasks and see the

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.400
interplay between them and try to infer. I mean, that's the challenge of neuroscience

02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:16.400
without understanding deeply looking from the outside, try to infer something about

02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:24.000
how the whole thing works. Well, imagine this, here's a simple question. Does it take more

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:35.680
anesthetic drug to put, to, to have a person lose consciousness if their IQ is 140 than a person

02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:42.880
with an IQ of 70? That's an interesting way to study it. Yeah. I mean, if there is, if there is

02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:49.200
if the answer to that is stable, yes, that's very interesting. So I tried to find out

02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:56.720
and I went to some anesthesiology textbooks about how you, you dose and they dose by weight.

02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:06.960
And what I also learned, this is a little bit off subject, anesthesiologists

02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:13.520
are never sure if you, how deep you are. Yeah. And they usually tell by poking you with a needle

02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:19.440
and if you don't jump, they tell the surgeon to go ahead. I'm not sure that's literally true,

02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:26.720
but it's. Well, it might be very difficult to know precisely how deep you are. It has to do

02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:30.080
with the same kind of measurements that you were doing with the consciousness with the,

02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:35.920
it's, it's, it's difficult, it's difficult to know. So I don't lose my train of thought. I

02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:42.160
couldn't find in the textbooks anything about dosing by intelligence. I asked my friend,

02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:47.280
the anesthesiologist, he said, no, he doesn't know. I said, can we do a chart review

02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:54.480
and look at people using their, their years of education as a proxy for IQ? Because if

02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:58.800
someone's gone to graduate school, that tells you something. You can make some

02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:03.120
inference as opposed to someone who didn't graduate high school. You know, can we do a

02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:09.760
chart review? And he says, no, they, they never really put down the exact dose. And no, he said,

02:21:09.760 --> 02:21:17.520
no. So to this day, that the, the, the, the simple question, does it take more anesthetic drug

02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:24.400
to put someone under if they have a high IQ or less or less? It could go either way,

02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:28.320
because by the way, our early PET scan studies of intelligence

02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:37.280
found the unexpected result of an inverse correlation between glucose metabolic rate

02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:44.560
and intelligence. It wasn't how much a brain area lit up. How much it lit up was

02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:51.040
negatively correlated to how well they did on the test, which led to the brain efficiency hypothesis,

02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:57.920
which is still being studied today. And there's more and more evidence that the efficiency of

02:21:57.920 --> 02:22:04.320
brain information processing is more related to intelligence than, than,

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:11.920
than just more activity. Yeah. And it'll be interesting. Again, it's the total hypothesis

02:22:11.920 --> 02:22:18.160
how much in the relationship between intelligence and consciousness, it's not obvious that those

02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:24.160
two, if there's correlation, there would be a core, they, they could be inversely correlated.

02:22:24.160 --> 02:22:34.080
Wouldn't that be funny? If you, the, the consciousness factor, the C factor plus the

02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:41.600
G factor equals one. It's a nice trade off. You get, you get, you got to trade off how

02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:47.920
deeply you experience the world versus how deeply you're able to reason through the world.

02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:53.920
What a great hypothesis. Certainly somebody listening to this can do this study.

02:22:53.920 --> 02:23:00.240
Even if it's the aliens analyzing humans a few centuries from now, let me ask you from an AI

02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:07.840
perspective. I don't know how much you've thought about machines, but in, you know,

02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:13.440
there's the famous Turing tests, tests of intelligence for machines, which is a beautiful,

02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:25.120
almost like a cute formulation of intelligence that Alan Turing proposed. Basically conversation

02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:34.720
being, if you can fool a human to think that a machine is, is, is a human that passes the test,

02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:42.640
I suppose you could do a similar thing for humans. If I can fool you that I'm intelligent,

02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:49.760
then that's a good test of intelligence, right? Like you're talking to two people

02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:59.440
and my, your, your, your, the test is saying who has a higher IQ.

02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:06.400
And it's an interesting test because yeah, maybe charisma can be very useful there.

02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:11.040
And you're only allowed to use conversation, which is the formulation of the Turing test.

02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:16.640
Anyway, all that to say is what are good tests of intelligence for machines?

02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:22.480
What do you think it takes to achieve human level intelligence for machines?

02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:29.840
Well, I have thought a little bit about this, but every time I think about these things,

02:24:29.840 --> 02:24:40.080
I rapidly reach the limits of my knowledge and imagination. So when Alexa first came out,

02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:49.760
and I think there was a competing one, well, there was Siri with Apple and Google had Alexa.

02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:52.480
No, no, no. Amazon had Alexa.

02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:55.520
Amazon had Alexa. Google has Google Home.

02:24:55.520 --> 02:25:01.280
Something. So I proposed to one of my colleagues that he buy one of these, each, you know,

02:25:01.280 --> 02:25:05.760
one of each and then ask it questions from the IQ test.

02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:08.020
Nice.

02:25:08.660 --> 02:25:13.380
But it became apparent that they all searched the internet.

02:25:14.260 --> 02:25:20.100
So they all can find answers to questions like how far is it between Washington and Miami

02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:28.740
and repeat after me. Now, I don't know if you said to Alexa, I'm going to repeat these numbers

02:25:28.740 --> 02:25:34.580
backwards to me. I don't know what would happen. I've never done it. But the, the, so, so one

02:25:34.580 --> 02:25:39.780
answer to your question is try. You're going to try it right now. Let's try. Let's try it.

02:25:39.780 --> 02:25:40.340
No, no, no.

02:25:40.340 --> 02:25:41.060
Ask Siri.

02:25:42.180 --> 02:25:47.780
So it would actually probably go to Google search and it will be all confusing kind of stuff.

02:25:48.420 --> 02:25:50.100
It would, it would fail.

02:25:50.100 --> 02:25:53.620
Well, then I guess there was a test that it would fail.

02:25:54.500 --> 02:26:02.100
Well, but that's not, that has to do more with the, you know, the language of communication

02:26:02.100 --> 02:26:08.180
versus the content. So if you did an IQ test to a person who doesn't speak English and the

02:26:08.180 --> 02:26:11.460
test was administered in English, that's not really the test of.

02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:15.060
Well, let's think about the computers that beat the Jeopardy champions.

02:26:16.420 --> 02:26:20.900
Yeah. So that, so that, because I happen to know how those are programmed,

02:26:20.900 --> 02:26:24.660
those are very hard coded and there's definitely a lack of intelligence there.

02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:34.500
There's something like IQ tests. There's a, there's a guy, artificial intelligence

02:26:34.500 --> 02:26:40.740
researcher, Francois Cholet. He's, he's a Google. He's one of the seminal people in machine learning.

02:26:40.740 --> 02:26:45.860
He also, as a fun aside thing, develop an IQ test for machines.

02:26:45.860 --> 02:26:48.820
Oh, I haven't heard that. I'd like to know about that.

02:26:48.820 --> 02:26:53.140
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll actually email you this because it'd be very interesting for you.

02:26:53.140 --> 02:26:59.860
It doesn't get much attention because people don't know what to do with it. But it deserves

02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:06.420
a lot of attention, which is it basically does a pattern type of tests where you have to do,

02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:12.740
you know, one standard one is you're given three things and you have to do a fourth one,

02:27:13.700 --> 02:27:18.500
that kind of thing. So you have to understand the pattern here. And for that, it's very,

02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:30.580
at least simplifies to, so the interesting thing is he's trying not to achieve high IQ.

02:27:30.580 --> 02:27:37.220
He's trying to achieve like pretty low bar for IQ, things that are kind of trivial for humans.

02:27:39.300 --> 02:27:42.580
And they're actually really tough for machines, which is seeing,

02:27:43.380 --> 02:27:50.820
playing with these concepts of symmetry, of counting. Like if I give you one object,

02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:56.340
two objects, three objects, you'll know that the last one is four objects. You can like count them.

02:27:56.340 --> 02:28:01.540
You can, you can cluster objects together. It's both visually and conceptually. We could do all

02:28:01.540 --> 02:28:07.700
these things with our mind that we take for granted, the objectness of things. We can like

02:28:08.660 --> 02:28:15.380
figure out what spatially is an object and isn't, and we can play with those ideas.

02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:22.580
And machines really struggle with that. So he really cleanly formulated these IQ tests.

02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:28.340
I wonder what like that would equate to for humans with IQ, but it'd be a very low IQ.

02:28:29.860 --> 02:28:34.500
But that's exactly the kind of formulation. Like, okay, we want to be able to solve this.

02:28:34.500 --> 02:28:38.420
How do we solve this? And he does this as a challenge and nobody's been able to,

02:28:39.700 --> 02:28:44.660
it's similar to the Alexa prize, which is Amazon is hosting a conversational challenge.

02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:52.500
Nobody's been able to do well on his, but that's an interesting, those kinds of tests are interesting

02:28:52.500 --> 02:29:01.380
because we take for granted all the, the ability of the human mind to play with concepts and to

02:29:02.100 --> 02:29:09.940
formulate concepts out of novel things. So like things we've never seen before, we were able to

02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:15.940
use that. I mean, that's, I've talked to a few people that design IQ tests, sort of online.

02:29:15.940 --> 02:29:21.860
They write IQ tests and I was trying to get some questions from them and they, they spoke to the

02:29:21.860 --> 02:29:26.740
fact that we can't really share questions with you because part of the,

02:29:26.740 --> 02:29:32.420
part of the, like, first of all, it's really hard work to come up with questions.

02:29:33.700 --> 02:29:37.300
It's really, really hard work. It takes a lot of, it takes a lot of research, but it also takes a

02:29:37.300 --> 02:29:46.100
lot of novelty generating. You're constantly coming up with really new things. And part of

02:29:46.100 --> 02:29:51.940
the point is that you're not, they're not supposed to be public. They're supposed to be new to you

02:29:51.940 --> 02:29:56.900
when you look at them. It's interesting that the novelty is fundamental to the hardness of the

02:29:56.900 --> 02:30:02.980
problem, at least a part of what makes the problem hard is you've never seen it before.

02:30:02.980 --> 02:30:08.660
Right. That's called fluid intelligence as opposed to what's called crystallized intelligence,

02:30:08.660 --> 02:30:16.340
which is your knowledge of, of facts. You know things, but can you use those things to solve a

02:30:16.340 --> 02:30:20.420
problem? Those are two different things. Do you think we'll be able to,

02:30:21.380 --> 02:30:25.860
because we spoke, and I don't want to miss the opportunity to talk about this. We spoke

02:30:25.860 --> 02:30:30.820
about the neurobiology, about the molecular biology of intelligence. Do you think one day

02:30:30.820 --> 02:30:42.660
we'll be able to modify the biology of, or the genetics of a person to modify their intelligence,

02:30:42.660 --> 02:30:46.340
to increase their intelligence? We started this conversation by talking about a pill you could

02:30:46.340 --> 02:30:54.980
take. Do you think that such a pill would exist? Metaphorically, I do. And I am supremely confident

02:30:54.980 --> 02:31:00.820
that it's possible because I am supremely ignorant of the complexities of neurobiology.

02:31:02.500 --> 02:31:04.820
And so I have written- Ignorance is bliss.

02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:11.140
Well, I have written that the nightmares of neurobiologists, understanding the complexities,

02:31:11.140 --> 02:31:22.020
this cascade of events that happens at the synaptic level, that these nightmares are what

02:31:22.020 --> 02:31:29.460
fuels some people to solve. So some people, you have to be undaunted. I mean, yeah, this is,

02:31:29.460 --> 02:31:36.900
this is not easy. Look, we're still trying to figure out cancer. It was only recently that

02:31:36.900 --> 02:31:44.180
they figured out why aspirin works. You know, these are not easy problems, but I also have

02:31:44.180 --> 02:31:53.380
the perspective of the history of science, is the history of solving problems that are

02:31:54.100 --> 02:31:58.580
extraordinarily complex. And seem impossible at the time.

02:31:58.580 --> 02:32:04.020
And seem impossible at the time. And so one of the things you look at at

02:32:04.100 --> 02:32:10.020
companies like Neuralink, you have brain computer interfaces, you start to delve into the human mind

02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:14.580
and start to talk about machines measuring, but also sending signals to the human mind.

02:32:14.580 --> 02:32:24.340
You start to wonder what that has, what impact that has on the G factor. Modifying in small ways

02:32:24.340 --> 02:32:33.380
or in large ways, the functioning, the mechanical, electrical, chemical functioning of the brain.

02:32:34.100 --> 02:32:39.620
I look at everything about the brain. There are different levels of explanation.

02:32:39.620 --> 02:32:46.820
On one hand, you have a behavioral level, but then you have brain circuitry. And then you have

02:32:48.100 --> 02:32:56.420
neurons. And then you have dendrites. And then you have synapses. And then you have

02:32:57.380 --> 02:33:04.500
the neurotransmitters. And the presynaptic and the postsynaptic terminals.

02:33:05.620 --> 02:33:11.540
And then you have all the things that influence neurotransmitters. And then you have

02:33:12.100 --> 02:33:21.860
the individual differences among people. Yeah, it's complicated. But 51 million people in the

02:33:21.940 --> 02:33:33.700
United States have IQs under 85 and struggle with everyday life. Shouldn't that motivate

02:33:35.140 --> 02:33:42.980
people to take a look at this? Yeah, but I just want to linger one more time that

02:33:44.580 --> 02:33:46.980
we have to remember that the science of intelligence,

02:33:47.780 --> 02:33:53.300
the measure of intelligence is only a part of the human condition. The thing that makes life

02:33:53.300 --> 02:34:01.380
beautiful and the creation of beautiful things in this world is perhaps loosely correlated,

02:34:01.940 --> 02:34:09.380
but it's not dependent entirely on intelligence. Absolutely. I certainly agree with that.

02:34:09.780 --> 02:34:16.740
I certainly agree with that. And so for anyone listening, I'm still not convinced

02:34:17.540 --> 02:34:24.820
that more intelligence is always better if you want to create beauty in this world.

02:34:26.020 --> 02:34:31.380
I don't know. Well, I didn't say more intelligence is always better if you want to create beauty. I

02:34:31.380 --> 02:34:38.260
just said all things being equal, more is better than less. That's all I mean. Yeah, but that's

02:34:39.460 --> 02:34:46.420
I just want to sort of say because a lot to me, one of the things that makes life great is the

02:34:46.420 --> 02:34:52.740
opportunity to create beautiful things. And so I just want to sort of empower people to do that

02:34:52.740 --> 02:34:59.300
no matter what some IQ test says. At the population level, we do need to look at IQ tests to help

02:35:00.100 --> 02:35:06.820
people. And to also inspire us to take on some of these extremely difficult scientific questions.

02:35:07.700 --> 02:35:13.060
Do you have advice for young people in high school, in college,

02:35:15.940 --> 02:35:20.500
whether they're thinking about career or they're thinking about a life they can be proud of?

02:35:20.500 --> 02:35:28.740
Is there advice you can give whether they're in the, they want to pursue psychology or biology

02:35:28.740 --> 02:35:32.740
or engineering, or they want to be artists and musicians and poets?

02:35:33.620 --> 02:35:43.300
I can't advise anybody on that level of what their passion is. But I can't say if you're

02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:52.820
interested in psychology, if you're interested in science and the science around the big

02:35:52.820 --> 02:36:01.060
questions of consciousness and intelligence and psychiatric illness, we haven't really talked

02:36:01.060 --> 02:36:08.980
about brain illnesses and what we might learn from. If you are trying to develop a drug to

02:36:08.980 --> 02:36:16.340
treat Alzheimer's disease, you are trying to develop a drug to impact learning and memory,

02:36:17.380 --> 02:36:24.340
which are core to intelligence. So it could well be that the so-called IQ pill will come

02:36:24.340 --> 02:36:29.140
from a pharmaceutical company trying to develop a drug for Alzheimer's disease.

02:36:29.140 --> 02:36:31.780
Because that's exactly what you're trying to do, right? Yeah.

02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:37.540
Well, what will that drug do in a college student that doesn't have Alzheimer's disease?

02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:43.060
So I would encourage people who are interested in psychology,

02:36:44.660 --> 02:36:54.020
who are interested in science, to pursue a scientific career and address the big questions.

02:36:54.980 --> 02:37:03.060
And the most important thing I can tell you, if you're going to be in kind of a research

02:37:03.060 --> 02:37:08.180
environment, is you've got to follow the data where the data take you. You can't decide in

02:37:08.180 --> 02:37:13.220
advance where you want the data to go. And if the data take you to places that you don't have the

02:37:13.220 --> 02:37:21.300
technical expertise to follow, like I would like to understand more about molecular biology,

02:37:21.300 --> 02:37:26.100
but I'm not going to become a molecular biologist now, but I know people who are.

02:37:26.900 --> 02:37:32.340
And my job is to get them interested, to take their expertise into this direction.

02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:38.260
And it's not so easy. And if the data takes you to a place

02:37:38.900 --> 02:37:48.100
that's controversial, that's counterintuitive in this world, no, I would say it's probably a good

02:37:48.100 --> 02:37:56.340
idea to still push forward boldly, but to communicate the interpretation of the results

02:37:56.340 --> 02:38:05.140
with skill, with compassion, with a greater breadth of understanding of humanity, not just

02:38:05.140 --> 02:38:12.260
the science, of the impact of the results. One famous psychologist wrote about this issue

02:38:12.260 --> 02:38:19.860
that somehow a balance has to be found between pursuing the science and communicating it

02:38:19.860 --> 02:38:23.620
with respect to people's sensitivities, the legitimate sensitivities.

02:38:24.660 --> 02:38:31.300
Somehow he didn't say how. Somehow, somehow. And this is. Every part of that sentence, somehow

02:38:31.300 --> 02:38:39.460
and balance is left up to the interpretation of the reader. Let me ask you, you said big questions,

02:38:39.460 --> 02:38:46.260
the biggest or one of the biggest. We already talked about consciousness and intelligence,

02:38:46.260 --> 02:38:50.180
one of the most fascinating, one of the biggest questions, but let's talk about the why.

02:38:51.220 --> 02:38:56.100
Why are we here? What's the meaning of life? Oh, I'm not going to tell you.

02:38:56.980 --> 02:39:02.500
You know, you're not going to tell me. This is very, I'm going to have to wait for your next book.

02:39:03.220 --> 02:39:09.140
The meaning of life, you know, we do the best we can to get through the day.

02:39:12.500 --> 02:39:17.860
And then there's just the finite number of the days. Are you afraid of the finiteness of it?

02:39:17.860 --> 02:39:25.940
You think about it more and more as I get older. Yeah, I do. And it's one of these human things

02:39:26.020 --> 02:39:34.260
that it is finite. We all know it. Most of us deny it and don't want to think about it.

02:39:35.300 --> 02:39:40.900
Sometimes you think about it in terms of estate planning. You try to do the rational thing.

02:39:41.780 --> 02:39:46.820
Sometimes it makes you work harder because you know your time is more and more limited

02:39:46.900 --> 02:39:53.940
and you want to get things done. I don't know where I am on that. It is

02:39:56.100 --> 02:39:59.380
just one of those things that's always in the back of my mind.

02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:06.260
And I don't think that's uncommon. Well, it's just like G factor intelligence.

02:40:06.260 --> 02:40:13.300
It's a hard truth that's there. And sometimes you kind of walk past it and you don't want to look at

02:40:13.300 --> 02:40:21.940
it, but it's still there. Yeah. Yes, you can't escape it. And think about the G factor in

02:40:21.940 --> 02:40:31.940
intelligence. Everybody knows this is true on a personal daily basis. Even if you think back to

02:40:31.940 --> 02:40:40.340
when you were in school, you know who the smart kids were. You know, when you are on the phone

02:40:40.340 --> 02:40:46.820
talking to a customer service representative that in response to your detailed question is

02:40:46.820 --> 02:40:54.580
reading a script back to you and you get furious at this. Have you ever called this person a moron

02:40:54.580 --> 02:40:59.940
or wanted to call this person a moron? You're not listening to me. Everybody has had the experience

02:40:59.940 --> 02:41:07.060
of dealing with people who they think are not at their level. It's just common because that's the

02:41:07.060 --> 02:41:15.780
way human beings are. That's the way life is. But we also have a poor estimation of our own

02:41:15.780 --> 02:41:22.340
intelligence. We have a poor, and we're not always a great, our judgment of human character of other

02:41:22.340 --> 02:41:33.140
people is not as good as a battery of tests. That's where bias comes in. That's where our

02:41:33.220 --> 02:41:38.500
history, our emotions, all of that comes in. So people on the internet, there's such a thing

02:41:38.500 --> 02:41:43.060
as the internet and people on the internet will call each other dumb all the time.

02:41:46.980 --> 02:41:55.460
That's the worry here is that we give up on people. We put them in a bin just because of one

02:41:55.460 --> 02:42:02.260
interaction or some small number of interactions as if that's it. They're hopeless. That's just

02:42:02.260 --> 02:42:08.580
in their genetics. But I think no matter what the science here says, once again,

02:42:09.620 --> 02:42:13.780
that does not mean we should not have compassion for our fellow man.

02:42:14.660 --> 02:42:21.460
That's exactly what the science does say. It's not opposite of what the science is.

02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:29.380
Everything I know about psychology, everything I've learned about intelligence, everything

02:42:30.100 --> 02:42:36.980
points to the inexorable conclusion that you have to treat people as individuals

02:42:36.980 --> 02:42:43.700
respectfully and with compassion. Because through no fault of their own, some people are not as

02:42:43.700 --> 02:42:49.540
capable as others. And you want to turn a blind eye to it. You want to come up with

02:42:50.900 --> 02:42:57.220
theories about why that might be true. Fine. I would like to fix some of it as best I can.

02:42:57.780 --> 02:43:04.980
And everybody is deserving of love. Richard, this is a good way to end it, I think.

02:43:05.940 --> 02:43:11.860
I'm just getting warmed up here. I know. I know you can go for another many hours, but

02:43:13.140 --> 02:43:17.060
to respect your extremely valuable time, this is an amazing conversation. Thank you for

02:43:18.980 --> 02:43:24.340
the teaching company, the lectures you've given with the New York Science of Intelligence,

02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:29.860
just the work you're doing. It's a difficult topic. It's a topic that's controversial and

02:43:29.860 --> 02:43:35.940
sensitive to people and to push forward boldly. And in that nuanced way, just thank you for

02:43:35.940 --> 02:43:41.940
everything you do. And thank you for asking the big questions of intelligence, of consciousness.

02:43:41.940 --> 02:43:46.260
Well, thank you for asking me. I mean, there's nothing like good conversation on these topics.

02:43:47.300 --> 02:43:51.300
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Heyer. To support this podcast,

02:43:51.300 --> 02:43:56.260
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

02:43:56.260 --> 02:44:02.900
Albert Einstein. It is not that I'm so smart, but I stay with the questions much longer.

02:44:04.100 --> 02:44:07.300
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
