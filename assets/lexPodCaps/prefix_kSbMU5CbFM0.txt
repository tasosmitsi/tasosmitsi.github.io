00:00.000 --> 00:03.320
The following is a conversation with Alex Gladstein,

00:03.320 --> 00:06.240
Chief Strategy Officer at the Human Rights Foundation

00:06.240 --> 00:08.400
and the Oslo Freedom Forum.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.880
In recent times, Alex has focused on how cryptocurrency

00:11.880 --> 00:15.360
and especially Bitcoin can be a tool for empowering democracy

00:15.360 --> 00:17.880
and civil liberties in the world.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.000
Most crucially, parts of the world

00:20.000 --> 00:23.560
that are living under authoritarian regimes.

00:23.560 --> 00:27.000
As a side note, let me say that I have been learning a lot

00:27.040 --> 00:30.520
about the ways in which money can be used to amass power.

00:30.520 --> 00:33.360
And in the same way, the decentralization of money

00:33.360 --> 00:36.960
can be used to resist the corrupting nature of this power.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.920
Alex and I do not agree on everything,

00:39.920 --> 00:42.600
but we strive for the same betterment of humanity.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.240
He's sensitive to the suffering in the world

00:45.240 --> 00:48.160
and is dedicating his life to finding solutions

00:48.160 --> 00:49.920
that lessen that suffering.

00:49.920 --> 00:53.440
Whether Bitcoin is one such solution, I don't know,

00:53.440 --> 00:55.200
but I think it has a chance.

00:55.240 --> 00:58.600
And that means it is worth exploring deeply.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.280
I'm staying in this path of learning patiently

01:01.280 --> 01:03.720
with as little ego as possible.

01:03.720 --> 01:07.200
I hope you come along with me on this journey as well.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.360
This is the Alex Fridman podcast.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.440
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:11.440 --> 01:13.000
in the description.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.720
We recorded this conversation a while ago

01:15.720 --> 01:17.640
and I thought I lost the audio

01:17.640 --> 01:20.600
and was really disappointed with myself

01:20.600 --> 01:22.360
for messing this thing up.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.400
But luckily, last week I found it

01:25.400 --> 01:30.400
and so rescued from out of the abyss of nonexistence.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.640
Here's my conversation with Alex Glasstein.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.960
What are some universal human rights

01:36.960 --> 01:39.040
that you believe all people should have?

01:39.960 --> 01:44.680
So free speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of belief,

01:44.680 --> 01:46.840
freedom to participate in your government,

01:46.840 --> 01:48.440
the freedom to have privacy,

01:48.440 --> 01:51.160
the freedom to own things, property rights.

01:51.160 --> 01:54.520
These are all basic fundamental negative rights,

01:54.520 --> 01:55.760
what we call them.

01:55.760 --> 01:59.080
These are the basic fundamental human freedoms.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.680
What does negative rights mean?

02:02.320 --> 02:04.920
Negative rights are liberties

02:04.920 --> 02:07.280
and positive rights are entitlements.

02:07.280 --> 02:10.880
So after World War II, when the UN came together,

02:10.880 --> 02:12.760
it was largely a compromise between the communist

02:12.760 --> 02:16.080
Soviet Union and the free United States, right?

02:16.080 --> 02:20.120
So the US had on its side of the UN declaration

02:20.120 --> 02:23.480
of human rights, a bunch of liberties, essentially,

02:23.480 --> 02:26.000
things like free speech, freedom of association,

02:26.000 --> 02:27.280
freedom of assembly.

02:27.280 --> 02:30.720
The Soviets wanted entitlements like the right to work,

02:30.720 --> 02:32.680
the right to have housing, the right to water,

02:32.680 --> 02:34.120
the right to a vacation.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.800
So you actually read the UN declaration for human rights,

02:36.800 --> 02:40.440
it's a negotiation between the Soviets and the Americans.

02:40.440 --> 02:43.400
Later, there was another document in the 70s released

02:43.400 --> 02:44.960
called the International Covenant

02:44.960 --> 02:46.800
on Civil and Political Rights.

02:46.840 --> 02:50.760
And this is what Ahrefs uses as its sort of like load star,

02:50.760 --> 02:51.960
its founding document.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.440
And this is like essentially an international agreement

02:54.440 --> 02:56.280
on the negative rights.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.360
Those are the things we choose to focus on

02:58.360 --> 03:02.040
because essentially authoritarian regimes can commit fraud

03:02.040 --> 03:04.280
and claim they're giving the positive rights,

03:04.280 --> 03:06.800
the entitlements, without having any

03:06.800 --> 03:08.280
of the negative liberties.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.880
And they can do that because they don't have

03:09.880 --> 03:11.920
any like free speech or press freedom.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.560
When you take people's basic fundamental freedoms away,

03:15.560 --> 03:17.880
it's quite easy to make like a Potemkin village

03:17.880 --> 03:20.000
and pretend that there's the entitlements

03:20.000 --> 03:22.360
and that we have good healthcare.

03:22.360 --> 03:25.440
And it's the same sort of thing that authoritarians

03:25.440 --> 03:28.520
have done for decades, Cuba and Venezuela

03:28.520 --> 03:29.800
and the Soviet Union.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.120
Do you think it's possible for authoritarian regimes

03:32.120 --> 03:35.600
to manipulate, to kind of lie about the negative rights

03:35.600 --> 03:39.400
as well by saying that the people have free speech,

03:39.400 --> 03:41.640
the people have the freedom for assembly

03:41.640 --> 03:42.920
and all those kinds of things?

03:42.920 --> 03:46.160
Can't you still manipulate the idea

03:46.160 --> 03:49.160
that the citizenry still has those rights?

03:49.160 --> 03:52.680
The opposition leader of Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim,

03:52.680 --> 03:57.440
he once told me the funny joke that in my country,

03:57.440 --> 03:58.400
we have freedom of speech,

03:58.400 --> 04:00.480
we don't have freedom after speech.

04:00.480 --> 04:04.200
So yeah, they can absolutely manipulate whatever they want.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.400
But I've done research into socioeconomic data.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.440
And I guess what I'm telling you

04:08.440 --> 04:10.240
is that authoritarian regimes,

04:10.280 --> 04:13.640
which make up 53% of the world's population

04:13.640 --> 04:18.440
across 95 countries, about 4.3 billion people,

04:18.440 --> 04:20.400
those who live under those regimes

04:20.400 --> 04:23.520
are subject to massive fraud

04:23.520 --> 04:26.600
when it comes to things like literacy rates,

04:26.600 --> 04:30.360
life expectancy, any sort of socioeconomic data,

04:30.360 --> 04:32.520
economic growth, they can do this

04:32.520 --> 04:34.720
because there's no free press.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.760
So for us at the Human Rights Foundation

04:36.760 --> 04:38.520
and for people like me,

04:38.520 --> 04:41.360
we believe that the negative rights, the liberties,

04:41.360 --> 04:43.280
the things that are in, for example,

04:43.280 --> 04:45.240
the Bill of Rights and the US Constitution,

04:45.240 --> 04:46.560
these things are the table.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.040
And then we can build on top of that.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.560
We can build the rest of our societies on top of that.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.840
The freest countries in the world

04:51.840 --> 04:55.120
have both the negative liberties and the entitlements,

04:55.120 --> 04:56.640
like Norway, for example.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.720
But there's a big difference between Norway and North Korea.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.480
In North Korea, they only claim to have the entitlements

05:02.480 --> 05:05.000
and they definitely don't have the liberties.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.240
Do you think there's one right

05:06.240 --> 05:07.560
that's more important than others?

05:07.560 --> 05:09.920
You kind of suggested the freedom of the press,

05:09.920 --> 05:13.560
maybe freedom of speech, that if you take that away,

05:13.560 --> 05:16.240
all the other ones kind of collapse along

05:16.240 --> 05:17.280
from a ripple effect.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.720
Is there something fundamental

05:18.720 --> 05:22.880
that you like to focus your attention on to defend,

05:22.880 --> 05:25.160
to protect, to make sure it's there?

05:25.160 --> 05:27.640
Yeah, I think free speech is probably the most fundamental.

05:27.640 --> 05:29.800
It's probably why the founders chose to make it

05:29.800 --> 05:31.040
into the First Amendment.

05:32.440 --> 05:34.600
A lot of things are downstream from there.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.800
Property rights are also very, very important.

05:37.720 --> 05:42.040
Obviously, we've seen the toll of violent redistributionism

05:42.040 --> 05:44.120
over the last hundred years,

05:44.120 --> 05:48.840
whether it was Lenin or Stalin or Mao or other regimes

05:48.840 --> 05:53.320
and everywhere from Ethiopia to colonialists everywhere

05:53.320 --> 05:54.560
to North Korea.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.720
It's not a pretty legacy.

05:56.720 --> 06:00.440
Is free speech clear to you as a concept?

06:00.440 --> 06:01.920
There's been quite a few debates,

06:01.920 --> 06:04.200
especially in the digital age,

06:04.200 --> 06:06.280
what it means to violate freedom of speech.

06:06.320 --> 06:10.160
There's been a lot of new novel mechanisms

06:10.160 --> 06:12.440
for people to communicate with each other,

06:12.440 --> 06:14.280
especially on social networks.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.920
And it seems that unclear,

06:16.920 --> 06:18.840
because a lot of times those are managed

06:18.840 --> 06:20.600
by private companies,

06:20.600 --> 06:24.040
it's unclear how much protection do the citizens

06:24.040 --> 06:26.680
have to have when they're communicating.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.360
A lot of people are being censored

06:28.360 --> 06:30.160
on these social platforms.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.760
Some people, even presidents,

06:31.760 --> 06:35.360
get removed from those social platforms.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.880
Have you thought about the freedom of speech

06:37.880 --> 06:40.520
in the United States, but in the world

06:42.600 --> 06:47.480
as it's implemented in the 21st century,

06:47.480 --> 06:50.440
given the internet and all those kinds of things?

06:50.440 --> 06:55.000
There is a Soviet dissident named Natan Sharansky

06:55.000 --> 06:59.920
who survived the regime.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.080
And he wrote a book in which his thesis

07:03.080 --> 07:05.400
was essentially the way that you can define

07:05.400 --> 07:06.960
a free society is through something called

07:06.960 --> 07:08.600
the town square test.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.200
Can you go to a public space where you live

07:11.200 --> 07:13.840
and criticize your ruler loudly

07:13.840 --> 07:15.960
without fear of retribution?

07:15.960 --> 07:18.320
If you can do that, you have free speech.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.440
I think that's a pretty good litmus test.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.920
Most people in this world cannot do that.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.600
If you live in Havana, if you live in Moscow,

07:24.600 --> 07:27.200
if you live in Beijing, you cannot do that.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.680
And that's not a free society.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.800
In Austin, Texas, in Boston, Massachusetts,

07:33.760 --> 07:36.840
in London, in Santiago, Chile, in Tokyo, Japan,

07:36.840 --> 07:38.840
in many democracies, you can do that.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.280
And I think that that's a really helpful

07:40.280 --> 07:42.560
basic sort of litmus test.

07:42.560 --> 07:45.920
Does the content of the criticism matter?

07:45.920 --> 07:48.960
Can it be complete lies?

07:48.960 --> 07:53.720
Meaning conspiracy theories that involve claiming

07:53.720 --> 07:58.720
that the leader is, let's say, a lizard slash pedophile

07:59.680 --> 08:03.720
slash, you know, I'm not saying that those are lies,

08:03.720 --> 08:08.640
look into it, but they're very unlikely phenomena.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.440
So like, does that matter?

08:10.440 --> 08:13.520
I think it ends poorly when the state

08:13.520 --> 08:15.040
tries to restrict speech.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.480
I think that's kind of how I would define censorship.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.600
I think censorship and deplatforming

08:20.600 --> 08:22.480
are two different things.

08:22.480 --> 08:26.360
Private companies, you know, they get to make up

08:26.360 --> 08:29.280
their own rules about what's allowed on their platforms.

08:29.280 --> 08:30.920
And I think that's very different from a government

08:30.920 --> 08:34.480
with guns and an army restricting the speech

08:34.480 --> 08:37.000
of its citizens with threats of violence.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.920
These things are different for me.

08:38.920 --> 08:41.360
That violence is a fundamental difference.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.480
I don't know, I've gotten a chance to have dinner

08:45.480 --> 08:50.480
with Alex Jones and I've talked to him a few times offline

08:51.200 --> 08:55.760
and it does, I understand why people are so off-put by him,

08:55.800 --> 08:58.400
but it does bother me that he's universally removed

08:58.400 --> 09:00.160
from every platform.

09:00.160 --> 09:05.160
It feels like there's many more evil people, bad people,

09:05.960 --> 09:10.960
compared to Alex Jones, who still are given a voice

09:11.000 --> 09:12.480
on these platforms.

09:12.480 --> 09:17.040
And so I'm uncomfortable with the universality

09:17.040 --> 09:22.040
of the application of the censorship by these platforms,

09:22.440 --> 09:25.400
but on the flip side, you're right, there's not a violence,

09:25.400 --> 09:29.520
there's not tanks, there's not guns behind that censorship.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.000
Yeah, it's a bit of a generalization,

09:31.000 --> 09:34.400
but Alex Jones would be in prison or dead

09:34.400 --> 09:37.800
if he were in North Korea or in Cuba or in Russia

09:37.800 --> 09:40.840
or in China, that the authorities would not tolerate him

09:40.840 --> 09:42.280
to do what he did.

09:42.280 --> 09:45.160
And here he can kind of do what he wants.

09:45.160 --> 09:46.680
He's encountering some resistance

09:46.680 --> 09:50.280
in the marketplace of ideas, large organizations,

09:50.280 --> 09:53.920
corporations, and a lot of public sentiment

09:54.800 --> 09:58.600
in different parts of our country don't like him.

09:58.600 --> 10:01.000
They're doing their best to drown out his voice,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.800
but that's very different from a violent threat

10:03.800 --> 10:06.440
of censorship from the state, and that's what we study.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.520
That's what I study, what is the state doing?

10:09.520 --> 10:11.560
That's kind of paramount for me.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.200
Yeah, and that's true, because in the marketplace of ideas,

10:14.200 --> 10:15.840
there could be a company that springs up

10:15.840 --> 10:17.880
that gives Alex Jones a platform,

10:17.880 --> 10:20.920
and the United States is not going to prevent

10:20.920 --> 10:23.360
those companies from functioning.

10:23.400 --> 10:28.400
Of course, from a technology perspective,

10:28.400 --> 10:32.080
there is AWS removing Parler from the platform

10:32.080 --> 10:35.880
and gets a little weird as you get closer and closer

10:35.880 --> 10:37.200
to the computer infrastructure,

10:37.200 --> 10:39.240
because then you get closer and closer to the state.

10:39.240 --> 10:43.400
Actually, the more you get to the infrastructure

10:43.400 --> 10:45.320
that's usually managed by the state,

10:45.320 --> 10:48.400
the closer it gets to the control of the state.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.680
I would argue AWS is pretty damn close to infrastructure

10:51.680 --> 10:53.760
that's kind of controlled by the state.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.760
If you especially look at other nations,

10:56.760 --> 11:01.760
China, Russia, I don't know who runs

11:01.800 --> 11:03.760
the computer infrastructure for Russia and China,

11:03.760 --> 11:07.240
but I bet the state has complete oversight over that.

11:07.240 --> 11:10.640
And so that level of computer infrastructure

11:10.640 --> 11:14.720
having control about which social networks can

11:14.720 --> 11:17.320
and cannot operate is very uncomfortable to me,

11:17.320 --> 11:20.480
but you're right, I think it's good to focus

11:20.480 --> 11:22.880
on the obvious violations of these principles

11:22.880 --> 11:25.280
as opposed to the gray areas.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.320
Of course, the gray areas are fascinating.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.560
You mentioned HRF, Human Rights Foundation.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.360
What is it, what is its mission?

11:34.360 --> 11:38.160
Yeah, so I've been working for HRF since 2007.

11:39.560 --> 11:44.400
We are a charity, a nonprofit, a 501c3 based in New York,

11:44.400 --> 11:48.800
and our mission is to promote and protect individual rights

11:48.800 --> 11:52.440
and freedoms in authoritarian societies around the world.

11:52.440 --> 11:55.760
So again, we define about 95 countries as authoritarian,

11:55.760 --> 11:57.880
meaning it's either a one-party state

11:57.880 --> 12:01.880
or opposition politicians are outlawed or persecuted.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.040
There's no real free speech, there's no press freedom,

12:04.040 --> 12:05.640
there's no independent judiciary.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.400
There really aren't checks and balances.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.440
And even trying to create like a human rights organization

12:10.440 --> 12:13.880
or like an environmental group would be illegal.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.600
And the majority of the world's population

12:15.600 --> 12:16.480
lives in that environment.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.320
That's very important.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.640
That's 53%. 53%, 4.3 billion people.

12:20.640 --> 12:25.200
And I saw you outlined a lot of different sources

12:25.200 --> 12:27.560
of suffering in the world,

12:27.560 --> 12:29.720
and then you sort of put people living

12:29.720 --> 12:34.280
under authoritarian governments as like more than all of them.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.520
I forget all the examples you provided, but.

12:38.520 --> 12:39.720
Sure, I mean.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.840
Yeah, maybe you can mention if you remember.

12:41.840 --> 12:43.280
The number of people who are refugees,

12:43.280 --> 12:45.480
the number of people who suffer from natural disasters,

12:45.480 --> 12:47.720
the number of people who live under abject poverty,

12:47.720 --> 12:49.600
the number of people who don't have access

12:49.600 --> 12:50.880
to clean drinking water.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.720
All of these are dwarfed by the number of people

12:52.720 --> 12:54.840
who live under authoritarianism.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.800
And yet it's not something that we talk about a lot

12:57.800 --> 12:59.560
because people are mercantilist

12:59.560 --> 13:02.360
and the powers that be are happy to sacrifice

13:02.360 --> 13:04.840
freedoms and privacy for money.

13:04.840 --> 13:07.440
We live in a profit-seeking world.

13:07.440 --> 13:10.400
To get evidence of this, take a look at the list of sponsors

13:10.400 --> 13:13.480
of the upcoming Olympics in China,

13:13.480 --> 13:15.400
where the CCP is currently committing genocide

13:15.400 --> 13:17.040
against the weaker population,

13:17.040 --> 13:19.920
or look at the number of people and the famous investors

13:19.920 --> 13:22.080
who went to Saudi Arabia a couple of months ago

13:22.080 --> 13:23.880
for the Davos in the desert.

13:23.880 --> 13:27.000
I mean, Ray Dalio was there, all kinds of people were there,

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
or at least they were invited

13:28.000 --> 13:29.600
and they said they were gonna go.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.800
And this is a government that at the time

13:32.800 --> 13:35.360
was torturing a female activist

13:35.360 --> 13:37.000
who just wanted to drive a car.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.240
This is a government that had murdered Jamal Khashoggi

13:40.240 --> 13:44.200
in a brutal fashion just a couple of years earlier.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.280
So, I mean, at the end of the day,

13:45.280 --> 13:47.280
when it comes down to brass tacks,

13:47.280 --> 13:52.000
I mean, the powers that be, even the free countries

13:52.000 --> 13:55.480
are led by people who are very, very happy

13:55.480 --> 13:58.800
to sacrifice all these pretty words about human rights

13:58.800 --> 14:01.120
when it comes down to profits, unfortunately.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.800
So do you think capitalism,

14:02.800 --> 14:04.880
that's maybe one of the flaws of capitalism,

14:04.880 --> 14:09.480
is it turns a blind eye to injustices against human nature,

14:09.480 --> 14:11.600
against the human rights,

14:11.640 --> 14:15.040
or like it turns a blind eye to authoritarian governments?

14:15.040 --> 14:17.160
Look, I think that at the end of the day,

14:18.720 --> 14:22.600
free trade is actually really good.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.600
And you can just look at France and Germany

14:24.600 --> 14:28.400
as an example of how a capitalist structure would develop.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.160
If you have two capitalist actors,

14:30.160 --> 14:31.520
they're very unlikely to fight each other.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.400
There's very unlikely to be violence, right?

14:33.400 --> 14:36.840
These are two countries which basically murdered

14:36.840 --> 14:39.360
some large percentage of each other's male population

14:39.360 --> 14:42.120
three times in 100 years in three different wars, right?

14:42.120 --> 14:44.520
And now today, war is like unthinkable.

14:44.520 --> 14:47.440
And a lot of that is because of increased collaboration,

14:47.440 --> 14:48.720
increased trade.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.480
So when you have two capitalist actors,

14:51.480 --> 14:54.600
they act in a very productive way with each other.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.280
But as soon as you introduce an authoritarian actor,

14:58.280 --> 14:59.680
all bets are off.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.800
So I think what you have is a conflict

15:01.800 --> 15:05.520
between capitalist actors and authoritarian actors.

15:05.520 --> 15:08.920
And at the end of the day, people need to,

15:08.920 --> 15:12.240
yes, have more than just capitalist intentions.

15:12.240 --> 15:16.360
In the geopolitical level I'm talking about,

15:16.360 --> 15:19.080
they need to actually take a stand for principles.

15:19.080 --> 15:23.920
Otherwise you have athletes and businesses and governments

15:23.920 --> 15:25.920
that are all too happy to do business

15:25.920 --> 15:28.480
with the Chinese Communist Party, for example, right now.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.720
I think that there is a little more

15:29.720 --> 15:34.120
than just kind of the pure profit, yes.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.160
You mentioned what are the signs

15:37.160 --> 15:40.560
that the state is an authoritarian state.

15:41.560 --> 15:44.480
How do you know if you're living in an authoritarian state

15:44.480 --> 15:46.120
or when you study another nation

15:46.120 --> 15:48.000
and analyze the behavior of another nation,

15:48.000 --> 15:51.760
how do you know that's an authoritarian state?

15:51.760 --> 15:54.600
Is it as simple as them having a dictator?

15:54.600 --> 15:56.360
Is it as simple as them as declaring

15:56.360 --> 15:57.560
that they don't have a democracy

15:57.560 --> 15:59.160
or is there something more subtle?

15:59.160 --> 16:01.280
There's a couple of good litmus tests.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.680
One is actually, can you have a gay pride parade?

16:04.800 --> 16:05.640
That's a good one.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.120
It actually lines up perfectly.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.960
It doesn't matter what religion the dictatorship is.

16:09.960 --> 16:13.120
They don't like minorities and they love to scapegoat,

16:13.120 --> 16:15.920
whether it's gays or religious minorities, et cetera.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.120
So it lines up pretty well.

16:17.120 --> 16:17.960
That's really interesting.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.440
If you cannot have a gay pride parade in your country

16:20.440 --> 16:22.480
because you're fearful that you're gonna get

16:22.480 --> 16:23.960
the crap kicked out of you,

16:23.960 --> 16:25.960
probably live in an authoritarian regime.

16:27.280 --> 16:31.440
I'm sure that's not just about some kind of homophobia.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.260
Why is that?

16:32.260 --> 16:33.100
That's really interesting.

16:33.100 --> 16:33.920
It's scapegoating.

16:34.920 --> 16:35.760
So the-

16:35.760 --> 16:37.240
Fascism scapegoats minorities.

16:37.240 --> 16:40.920
There's an other, you create an other group and then you-

16:40.920 --> 16:43.680
Yeah, Uganda is a great example of this,

16:43.680 --> 16:48.480
but so is Saudi Arabia, so is China, so is Cuba.

16:48.480 --> 16:52.900
These are all regimes which demonize the LGBT communities.

16:53.760 --> 16:56.440
It's interesting because maybe you can correct me,

16:56.440 --> 16:59.240
but from my very distant outsider perspective,

17:03.960 --> 17:07.080
the way that certain authoritarian governments

17:07.080 --> 17:11.480
speak about gay people is it's almost like,

17:11.480 --> 17:15.920
what is it, we don't have gay people in our country

17:15.920 --> 17:20.080
kind of idea as opposed to scapegoating, which is like-

17:21.100 --> 17:23.800
Well, denial is the most powerful form of demonization.

17:23.800 --> 17:27.000
I mean, this is what the Iranian dictatorship does.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.480
A few years ago when Ahmadinejad,

17:29.480 --> 17:31.440
who was then sort of the de facto leader,

17:31.440 --> 17:32.800
he came to Columbia University

17:32.800 --> 17:35.120
and he tried to give a speech, which you can look up,

17:35.120 --> 17:37.720
and he tried to claim that there were no gays in Iran.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.800
And that's the most powerful form of demonization

17:39.800 --> 17:42.160
is trying to just wipe out your outer existence.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.960
There's other good litmus tests too.

17:45.960 --> 17:49.320
For example, you can think about comedy.

17:49.320 --> 17:51.920
Can you make money making fun of your government

17:51.920 --> 17:53.260
on television?

17:53.260 --> 17:55.880
If you cannot, you live in a dictatorship most likely.

17:55.880 --> 17:58.540
I mean, it's shocking to people that I work with

17:58.540 --> 18:00.800
who live in dictatorships when I tell them

18:00.800 --> 18:04.400
that not only are comedians able to safely make fun

18:04.400 --> 18:07.240
of our government, but they get paid very well to do so.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.160
That's a hallmark of a free society.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.680
So that's another good litmus test.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.920
Hear that Tim Dillon, you should go to North Korea.

18:13.920 --> 18:14.760
Check it out.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.680
Yeah, and look, there are tons of flaws with democracies.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.000
These are really good tests by the way.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.280
United States is a deeply flawed country in many ways.

18:21.280 --> 18:24.040
Our prison system is a disaster.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.880
There's a horrible war on drugs.

18:26.880 --> 18:30.780
We committed a grievous crime, in my opinion,

18:31.760 --> 18:32.600
by invading Iraq.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.860
Like we did a lot of problematic things,

18:34.860 --> 18:38.500
but our core architecture is still an open society.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.560
The people who criticize the US the most

18:41.560 --> 18:43.980
usually live within it.

18:43.980 --> 18:47.340
And if they were to move to a different country

18:47.340 --> 18:49.780
and try to use that criticism against their new rulers,

18:49.780 --> 18:51.560
they wouldn't fare so well.

18:51.560 --> 18:55.020
So whether it's Chomsky or whomever,

18:55.020 --> 18:56.940
if they were to go to Cuba and live in Cuba

18:56.940 --> 18:59.560
and try to criticize Cuba like they do America,

18:59.560 --> 19:01.160
it wouldn't last very long.

19:01.160 --> 19:03.360
So I think what's important to distinguish

19:03.360 --> 19:06.160
between open societies and closed ones,

19:06.160 --> 19:09.080
or like free societies and authoritarian regimes,

19:09.080 --> 19:10.840
it doesn't mean that your government's

19:10.840 --> 19:13.240
gonna be good all the time.

19:13.240 --> 19:14.760
What it means is that the citizens

19:14.760 --> 19:16.780
have a way to push for reform,

19:16.780 --> 19:18.780
have a way to hold the rulers accountable.

19:18.780 --> 19:21.880
So even if you don't like what the US government does,

19:21.880 --> 19:24.920
whether it was under Biden or Trump or Obama or Bush,

19:24.920 --> 19:26.960
we can rotate them through voting.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.440
And we have an independent Supreme Court

19:30.320 --> 19:31.140
that rotates over time.

19:31.140 --> 19:33.400
And we have people that we can elect directly

19:33.400 --> 19:34.720
to serve our interests.

19:34.720 --> 19:37.840
And then there's like a free press and there's lobbyists

19:37.840 --> 19:40.080
and all kinds of people that jostle for power.

19:40.080 --> 19:42.200
So there's a separation of powers.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.980
And I like to think about a free society really

19:44.980 --> 19:48.680
as like at the bottom of the foundation of the pyramid

19:48.680 --> 19:50.560
really would be free speech.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.320
And then you would have civil society,

19:52.320 --> 19:55.000
like for example, human rights organizations,

19:55.000 --> 19:57.600
environmental groups, stamp collectors, athletes,

19:57.640 --> 19:59.120
any groups that come together

19:59.120 --> 20:01.600
beyond the government's sort of strict instruction.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.600
And then on top of that,

20:02.600 --> 20:04.800
in the third level you have separation of powers.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.760
Again, what I'm describing.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.400
So authoritarian regimes don't really have any

20:08.400 --> 20:10.160
of these layers to them, right?

20:10.160 --> 20:13.200
And then at the top, then you put elections,

20:13.200 --> 20:14.280
but the elections are meaningless

20:14.280 --> 20:15.980
if you don't have the foundation below.

20:15.980 --> 20:17.560
Every dictator gets elected.

20:17.560 --> 20:19.200
Kim Jong-un gets elected.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.220
He's the only person on the ballot.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.920
Every dictator from Hitler to Chavez, they all got elected.

20:24.920 --> 20:27.560
Elections on their own mean literally nothing.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.680
You have to have these other layers beneath

20:29.680 --> 20:31.760
to actually be an open and free society.

20:31.760 --> 20:34.200
I think it's very important for people to understand.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.640
Although Hitler in an interesting way,

20:37.640 --> 20:39.240
at a certain point just said,

20:39.240 --> 20:42.160
I'm gonna be a ruler forever, which is interesting.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.360
There's an important switch that happens

20:44.360 --> 20:46.960
when you, as opposed to having a facade of elections,

20:46.960 --> 20:48.680
you even, you just put that aside

20:48.680 --> 20:50.920
and saying basically like, we're not even doing this.

20:50.920 --> 20:53.680
Yeah, there's like a ladder that you climb the election

20:53.680 --> 20:54.800
and you pull the ladder up

20:54.800 --> 20:56.280
and then no one else can climb up.

20:56.440 --> 20:59.520
This sadly happened in Egypt and it was quite predictable

20:59.520 --> 21:02.680
after Mubarak was ousted after the Arab Spring.

21:02.680 --> 21:06.640
Morsi came in and it looked like the Muslim Brotherhood

21:06.640 --> 21:09.600
was not really gonna be very democratic,

21:09.600 --> 21:10.440
but it didn't really matter

21:10.440 --> 21:11.720
because then the military came back

21:11.720 --> 21:14.160
and now we have Sisi, who's even worse than Mubarak.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.480
So a lot of times in these regimes,

21:16.480 --> 21:18.640
unfortunately, it's very difficult for people

21:18.640 --> 21:20.940
to build that democratic society afterwards.

21:22.040 --> 21:24.000
Some people have told me that when you live

21:24.000 --> 21:25.920
in a totalitarian or authoritarian regime,

21:25.920 --> 21:27.440
it's kind of like a political desert.

21:27.440 --> 21:28.640
What grows in the desert?

21:28.640 --> 21:30.360
Scorpions and cacti, right?

21:30.360 --> 21:32.960
So basically people with very extreme views

21:32.960 --> 21:35.160
because you as an authoritarian ruler,

21:35.160 --> 21:38.480
your best method for control is to get rid of the moderates.

21:38.480 --> 21:39.600
You have to crush the moderates.

21:39.600 --> 21:40.600
That's very important.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.800
You wanna have the only opposition to you be extremists.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.440
That way, when you go and have negotiations

21:45.440 --> 21:46.560
with the United States,

21:46.560 --> 21:48.620
you can kind of hold up the terrorists or whomever,

21:48.620 --> 21:51.240
the extremists and say, it's either us or them, right?

21:51.240 --> 21:52.960
And then the realists who run the US government

21:52.960 --> 21:53.880
are gonna choose you.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.320
And that's one of the reasons why the US government

21:56.320 --> 21:58.520
has supported so many dictators around the world

21:58.520 --> 22:00.640
over the last few decades.

22:00.640 --> 22:04.840
Do you think authoritarian systems emerge naturally?

22:04.840 --> 22:06.880
That's the natural state of things?

22:06.880 --> 22:10.040
If you incorporate what human nature is,

22:11.080 --> 22:13.320
is there always going to be corrupt people

22:13.320 --> 22:14.520
the rest of the top?

22:14.520 --> 22:17.840
And we almost have to construct systems

22:17.840 --> 22:20.920
that protect us against ourselves kind of thing?

22:21.720 --> 22:24.800
Another way to ask that is,

22:24.800 --> 22:29.600
what kind of systems protect us from our own human nature?

22:30.680 --> 22:34.400
We started with authoritarianism or autocracy, right?

22:34.400 --> 22:38.000
Rule by one or a small group oligarchy.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.680
And all humans lived under this structure

22:40.680 --> 22:44.960
for the virtual bulk of all human existence.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.360
Only until pretty recently

22:46.360 --> 22:49.040
did we start having actual democracy.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.400
The idea that we should be ruled by rules,

22:51.400 --> 22:53.280
not by rulers, very powerful.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.960
Invented in many places across the world,

22:56.960 --> 22:58.920
Western Africa had this idea,

22:58.920 --> 23:01.000
and so did the ancient Greeks.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.680
And they started to implement it.

23:02.680 --> 23:05.040
Although as most know, we didn't have full democracy

23:05.040 --> 23:06.440
for a long, long time,

23:06.440 --> 23:09.040
because it was only property owners or only men,

23:09.040 --> 23:11.440
only people of a certain race.

23:11.440 --> 23:15.120
But this idea that we can like rotate our rulers

23:15.120 --> 23:18.360
and that we could be ruled by rules is extremely powerful.

23:18.360 --> 23:22.400
And it really, like for me, the ideas behind this,

23:22.400 --> 23:25.480
I think unlocked a lot of the industrial revolution,

23:25.480 --> 23:26.600
these small personal freedoms

23:26.600 --> 23:28.600
that were allowed in some countries, but not others.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.800
And they unlocked a lot of the scientific innovation

23:30.800 --> 23:32.560
over the last few hundred years.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.960
And to me, there's like a really straight line

23:34.960 --> 23:37.960
between like scientific inquiry, free speech, freedoms,

23:37.960 --> 23:40.760
and then more prosperity and more effectiveness

23:40.760 --> 23:42.800
as a civilization.

23:42.800 --> 23:47.120
So I think that democracy, you know, ruled by the people

23:47.120 --> 23:51.160
is definitely an upgrade from autocracy or oligarchy,

23:51.160 --> 23:52.920
you know, which would be ruled by one

23:52.920 --> 23:55.360
or ruled by a small group.

23:55.360 --> 23:58.400
And I think that the democratic revolution

23:58.400 --> 24:00.960
has been an incredible thing for our world.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.480
And it's, you know, you can do half-class full,

24:03.480 --> 24:04.640
half-class empty.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.440
The half-class full is that almost half the world

24:06.440 --> 24:07.600
lives under democracy.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.400
Like that's an incredible achievement.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.720
But just under half.

24:12.720 --> 24:13.720
Yeah, just under half.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.360
So.

24:15.360 --> 24:16.480
But that's billions of people.

24:16.480 --> 24:17.840
There's billions of people.

24:17.840 --> 24:20.600
And if you look at the progress of things,

24:20.600 --> 24:22.400
it's getting better and better and better.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.120
I mean, if you, you know.

24:24.120 --> 24:28.080
Yeah, we're a little bit of a stalemate here.

24:28.080 --> 24:31.240
Democracies really blossomed

24:31.240 --> 24:34.440
between World War II and the year 2000,

24:34.440 --> 24:35.760
especially in the 80s and 90s.

24:35.760 --> 24:39.960
You had an incredible wave of fall, you know,

24:39.960 --> 24:42.120
where many, many authoritarian regimes fell

24:42.120 --> 24:44.040
and were replaced by democracies.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.360
I think around 2015,

24:46.360 --> 24:51.240
the acceleration kind of came to a standstill a little bit.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.440
There's some good news in some countries

24:54.440 --> 24:56.800
and there's bad news in others.

24:56.800 --> 25:00.040
Like in the last 10 years, you've had, for example,

25:00.040 --> 25:02.680
the Philippines has gone backwards.

25:02.680 --> 25:04.520
Thailand has gone backwards.

25:04.520 --> 25:05.880
Bangladesh has gone backwards.

25:05.880 --> 25:07.120
Turkey has gone backwards.

25:07.120 --> 25:09.440
That's like a half billion people right there.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.120
So you've had some positives.

25:11.240 --> 25:15.440
Like, you know, there was positive movement forward

25:15.440 --> 25:18.760
in Armenia, Malaysia, some other countries.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.960
But we're kind of at a stalemate right now.

25:20.960 --> 25:25.840
And what most people fear about where we are right now,

25:25.840 --> 25:29.160
who I respect, is what does the digital transformation

25:29.160 --> 25:32.440
of the world do to this like progress of democracy

25:32.440 --> 25:34.080
or of open societies?

25:34.080 --> 25:36.760
And that's what concerns me the most.

25:36.760 --> 25:37.600
Oh, interesting.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.200
So I've, and we'll talk about one

25:40.200 --> 25:42.720
of the most fascinating technologies, which is Bitcoin,

25:42.720 --> 25:43.560
how it can help.

25:43.560 --> 25:47.080
But I have a sense that technology,

25:47.080 --> 25:50.440
like most technological innovations

25:50.440 --> 25:52.960
will give power to the individuals,

25:52.960 --> 25:57.760
will give, will fight authoritarian governments

25:57.760 --> 26:00.320
as opposed to give more power to authoritarian governments.

26:00.320 --> 26:03.720
But your sense is there's ways to give,

26:03.720 --> 26:06.880
for technology to be utilized as a tool

26:06.880 --> 26:08.880
for the abuse of the citizenry.

26:08.880 --> 26:10.400
I've seen both.

26:10.400 --> 26:13.120
In my work at Ahrefs, I started by helping

26:13.120 --> 26:15.840
to put together backpacks with foreign information

26:15.840 --> 26:18.520
that we sent to the Cuban underground library movement.

26:18.520 --> 26:21.640
So in Cuba, you know, to own a book at the time,

26:21.640 --> 26:23.480
you had to have the government's permission.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.800
There was very little internet penetration, okay?

26:25.800 --> 26:28.400
So we would send in movies, you know,

26:28.400 --> 26:30.280
V for Vendetta, dubbed into Spanish,

26:30.280 --> 26:32.920
and people would sit inside their homes

26:32.920 --> 26:35.240
and they'd watch it and they would answer questions

26:35.240 --> 26:36.840
with each other and it was very powerful.

26:36.840 --> 26:38.480
And then after that, I worked with people

26:38.480 --> 26:39.760
outside North Korea.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.160
We would send in flash drives.

26:41.160 --> 26:42.760
We have this program called Flash Drives for Freedom.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.840
We've sent over 100,000 flash drives

26:45.840 --> 26:47.720
in our work into North Korea,

26:47.720 --> 26:49.480
a country of about 25 million people.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.120
That's a lot, it's a big difference.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.960
That's, you know, many, many millions of hours

26:52.960 --> 26:55.160
of films, books, movies, et cetera.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.280
So I've seen the power that technology can have

26:57.280 --> 27:00.320
where, you know, in the 60s and 70s,

27:00.320 --> 27:02.280
you know, to get, to break an information blockade,

27:02.280 --> 27:03.840
you had to like send in crates of books

27:03.840 --> 27:05.320
into a communist country.

27:05.320 --> 27:07.840
So now all of a sudden you can send the entire contents

27:07.840 --> 27:10.240
of what was once the Library of Alexandria

27:10.240 --> 27:11.960
on something the size of your thumbnail.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.120
Like that's remarkable.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.520
So obviously I've seen the positives of technology

27:15.520 --> 27:17.120
and we'll certainly get into Bitcoin,

27:17.120 --> 27:19.320
but I'm, you know, very concerned about essentially

27:19.320 --> 27:23.200
big data analysis, like what people call AI or general,

27:23.200 --> 27:26.680
you know, specific kinds of AI, like very concerning.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.400
I think these are very authoritarian.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.600
I mean, it's very hard to make a case

27:30.600 --> 27:33.640
that AI is going to be good for human rights.

27:33.640 --> 27:35.720
Very difficult, in my opinion.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.080
It may be good for health.

27:37.080 --> 27:40.360
It may be good for our efforts to protect the planet.

27:40.360 --> 27:43.040
It may be good for a lot of scientific things.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.120
I find it very hard to believe

27:44.120 --> 27:45.760
it'll be good for civil liberties.

27:45.760 --> 27:46.640
Oh, that's fun.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.560
This is fun, because I disagree.

27:49.480 --> 27:50.640
Give me your examples.

27:51.560 --> 27:54.000
I'm serious, what AI applications

27:54.000 --> 27:55.480
will improve civil liberties?

27:55.480 --> 27:58.840
I thought you meant examples of stuff

27:58.840 --> 28:00.200
that's already out there.

28:00.200 --> 28:03.040
Because I can give you examples that, for example,

28:03.040 --> 28:04.880
the kind of things that I would like to work on,

28:04.880 --> 28:07.640
but also the kind of things I'm hoping to see,

28:07.640 --> 28:12.640
which is AI could be used by centralized powers,

28:13.280 --> 28:16.280
by governments, by big organizations

28:16.280 --> 28:18.800
like Facebook and Twitter and so on,

28:18.800 --> 28:21.880
to collect data about people.

28:21.880 --> 28:23.520
Right. Right.

28:23.520 --> 28:27.800
But I believe there's a huge hunger among people

28:28.640 --> 28:31.360
to have control over their own data.

28:31.400 --> 28:35.400
So instead, you can have AI that's distributed,

28:35.400 --> 28:37.040
where people have complete ownership

28:37.040 --> 28:39.200
of their little AI systems.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.920
So the kind of stuff that I would like to build

28:41.920 --> 28:45.080
or like to see to be built is,

28:45.080 --> 28:47.480
you could think of it as personal assistance

28:47.480 --> 28:51.360
or AI that's owned by you,

28:51.360 --> 28:53.360
and you get to give it out.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.640
You have complete control over all of your data.

28:55.640 --> 28:58.120
You have complete control over everything

28:58.120 --> 29:01.800
that's learnable about your day-to-day experiences

29:01.800 --> 29:06.800
that could be useful in the market of goods and ideas

29:07.200 --> 29:08.160
and all those kinds of things.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.240
So it has to do with,

29:10.240 --> 29:13.080
so I know you talk about the surveillance,

29:13.080 --> 29:14.560
which is very interesting.

29:14.560 --> 29:17.400
It's who gets to have control of the data.

29:17.400 --> 29:21.040
And I think, I believe there's a lot of hunger

29:22.280 --> 29:27.280
among regular people to have control over their data.

29:27.960 --> 29:31.360
Such that if you wanna create a business,

29:31.360 --> 29:33.240
you have a lot of money to be made

29:33.240 --> 29:35.080
from a capitalist perspective

29:35.080 --> 29:38.600
by providing products that let people control their data

29:38.600 --> 29:40.680
where you have no control.

29:40.680 --> 29:43.320
Sounds like to me you're describing encryption

29:43.320 --> 29:45.560
or at least the ability to encrypt,

29:45.560 --> 29:49.840
the ability to use digital keys to secure your property.

29:49.840 --> 29:54.480
And that to me is a very powerful force

29:54.480 --> 29:56.440
for individual rights, very powerful.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.680
And it's what animates Bitcoin ultimately,

29:58.680 --> 30:00.160
which we'll get into.

30:00.160 --> 30:03.960
But for me, at least the way I look at it today in 2021,

30:03.960 --> 30:07.120
the threat from big data analysis

30:07.120 --> 30:10.360
used by governments and authoritarian regimes is terrifying.

30:10.360 --> 30:11.320
I mean, to actually see

30:11.320 --> 30:13.480
what the Chinese Communist Party is doing

30:13.480 --> 30:15.760
where they have hundreds of millions of cameras

30:15.760 --> 30:17.240
overseeing society,

30:17.240 --> 30:20.560
cameras that can tell who's a Uyghur and who's a Han,

30:20.560 --> 30:22.120
that to me is terrifying.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.360
And everything is sorted instantly.

30:24.760 --> 30:27.680
There are supercomputers that are built in Urumqi,

30:27.680 --> 30:30.440
in Xinjiang for this explicit purpose.

30:30.440 --> 30:33.640
And it allows the government to quickly sort

30:33.640 --> 30:35.760
and basically commit genocide a lot faster.

30:35.760 --> 30:36.960
And it's really scary.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.640
So I do agree and I've seen personally

30:39.640 --> 30:43.760
how powerful technology can be as a force for freedom,

30:43.760 --> 30:46.960
but I'm very, very worried about big data analysis

30:46.960 --> 30:48.120
in the hands of governments.

30:48.120 --> 30:48.960
See, that's funny,

30:48.960 --> 30:52.640
because I tend to see governments as ultimately incompetent

30:52.640 --> 30:53.840
in the space of technology

30:53.840 --> 30:56.400
to where there will always be lagging behind.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.880
So you look at what the Chinese surveillance systems

30:58.880 --> 31:00.080
are doing.

31:00.080 --> 31:03.040
I believe once it starts getting bad enough

31:03.960 --> 31:08.960
that technologies will be created to resist that.

31:09.040 --> 31:12.160
So to mess with it from the hacker community,

31:12.160 --> 31:14.760
but also from the individual community.

31:14.760 --> 31:16.480
So surveillance is actually very difficult

31:16.480 --> 31:20.280
from a centralized perspective to detect,

31:20.280 --> 31:22.360
to collect data by you to detect everything you are

31:22.360 --> 31:24.760
because you can spoof a lot of that information.

31:24.760 --> 31:26.720
So I believe you could put power in the hands

31:26.720 --> 31:31.000
of the citizens to sort of feed the government fake data

31:31.000 --> 31:33.200
to confuse it at a mass scale

31:33.200 --> 31:36.680
to where it'll make their surveillance less effective.

31:36.680 --> 31:39.720
But that, okay, that could be very sort of hopeful.

31:39.720 --> 31:42.240
Yeah, I mean, the practical application in Xinjiang,

31:42.240 --> 31:44.600
which is a territory the size of Alaska

31:44.600 --> 31:46.600
where a large percentage of the population

31:46.600 --> 31:48.840
has been put into prison camps.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.040
The current issue of the New Yorker

31:50.040 --> 31:52.480
has an absolutely harrowing essay

31:52.480 --> 31:55.200
that tells the story of one such woman

31:55.200 --> 31:59.840
who in I believe 2017 got sucked into one of these camps

31:59.840 --> 32:03.200
and it took her a year or more to get out.

32:03.200 --> 32:08.040
And she's talking about how in each home in Xinjiang,

32:08.040 --> 32:10.600
each home has a QR code on it that the police can scan

32:10.600 --> 32:13.320
and get like a quick instant download of who lives there.

32:13.320 --> 32:17.120
Each car has like a scannable code.

32:17.640 --> 32:20.280
Every single person has their DNA taken

32:20.280 --> 32:22.120
and the DNA is being sifted through

32:22.120 --> 32:24.120
and analyzed by algorithms.

32:24.120 --> 32:26.520
So this is like the Chinese government's laboratory

32:26.520 --> 32:29.720
for how can we use technology to oppress

32:29.720 --> 32:31.280
this sort of like digital Leninism.

32:31.280 --> 32:34.920
And that to me is one of the biggest risks

32:34.920 --> 32:37.280
in our world today and it's not talked about enough.

32:37.280 --> 32:38.120
That's interesting.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.880
So technologies basically enables

32:40.880 --> 32:42.400
the automation of oppression.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.240
Absolutely.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.520
So like.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.960
But define technology.

32:46.960 --> 32:51.720
Big data analysis and maybe specific AI, et cetera does.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.840
But encryption allows us to fight back.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.080
It's very important people understand

32:55.080 --> 32:56.480
we have tools to fight back.

32:57.960 --> 33:02.200
Big brother can only grow if it can feed on your data.

33:02.200 --> 33:04.560
If it can't get your data, it can't grow.

33:04.560 --> 33:08.760
So you have to willingly give up stuff to the cloud

33:08.760 --> 33:10.240
for this monster to grow.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.800
We can like make the monster hungry

33:12.800 --> 33:15.080
and shrink it if we give it less data.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.440
And I think that's where I would agree with you

33:16.440 --> 33:18.360
in terms of like wanting to empower people

33:18.360 --> 33:22.560
to be able to do stuff on their own terms in a sovereign way.

33:22.560 --> 33:25.160
And yeah, maybe you're kind of thinking

33:25.160 --> 33:27.240
like the personal assistant who helps out Tony Stark

33:27.240 --> 33:28.400
or something like that.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.840
And that's, yeah, as long as there's no back doors

33:30.840 --> 33:32.680
and that's a sovereign thing that you've popped up

33:32.680 --> 33:36.000
and created and you have the keys to, absolutely.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.280
But practically speaking,

33:38.280 --> 33:41.920
if we're talking about the world today as is,

33:41.920 --> 33:43.640
we need to be concerned about the way

33:43.640 --> 33:46.440
that authoritarian regimes are using big data analysis

33:46.440 --> 33:48.160
and they're gonna buy the software

33:48.160 --> 33:49.680
and this equipment from the Chinese government.

33:49.680 --> 33:50.920
They're already doing it.

33:50.920 --> 33:53.400
Street level surveillance has already been purchased

33:53.400 --> 33:55.000
by governments everywhere from Latin America

33:55.000 --> 33:58.080
to Sub-Saharan Africa to the heart of Europe.

33:58.080 --> 33:59.840
There's been huge scandals in Britain

33:59.840 --> 34:03.480
over their purchase of Chinese surveillance technology.

34:03.480 --> 34:06.240
Part of the Chinese government's Belt and Road campaign,

34:06.480 --> 34:09.360
which is basically to build the infrastructure

34:09.360 --> 34:12.360
of this century and to be in control of it,

34:12.360 --> 34:14.920
part of that idea is to ship out

34:14.920 --> 34:17.640
and install surveillance technology,

34:17.640 --> 34:20.360
both at the telecom level and at the surveillance level

34:20.360 --> 34:22.400
across dozens of countries around the world

34:22.400 --> 34:24.000
and have that back door.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.040
There's this national security law in China,

34:26.040 --> 34:28.400
which states that companies that are Chinese,

34:28.400 --> 34:30.040
which are abroad, are mandated

34:30.040 --> 34:32.040
to send data back to Beijing.

34:32.040 --> 34:35.360
So they are building this huge global surveillance state.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.360
And again, not talked about enough.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.080
You should go Google and research the Belt and Road.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.600
I think it's very important that we confront this.

34:43.960 --> 34:45.760
Yeah, I'm really glad you're talking about it

34:45.760 --> 34:48.320
because it's probably important to understand.

34:48.320 --> 34:52.760
I'm also hopeful that as people get educated

34:52.760 --> 34:57.600
about how much their data, when collected, unencrypted,

34:57.600 --> 35:01.120
but in general, can be used to harm them.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.920
I mean, it's almost like an education.

35:02.920 --> 35:07.920
I feel like if you know, it's a double-edged sword

35:08.720 --> 35:11.200
because I feel like people become fearful too easily

35:11.200 --> 35:12.960
and that actually has a very negative effect

35:12.960 --> 35:14.640
on the quality of life.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.680
In some sense, you want to have tools

35:16.680 --> 35:19.160
that allow you to live freely as opposed to live in fear.

35:19.160 --> 35:22.560
If you live in fear, that's not a good way to live.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.400
So it's a balance.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.160
It's a free society versus a fear society.

35:26.160 --> 35:27.000
Yeah, fear society.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.280
And look, people are,

35:28.280 --> 35:31.120
it's all about the trade-offs you make in your daily life.

35:31.120 --> 35:35.600
Living more privately with more freedom is less convenient.

35:35.600 --> 35:39.480
You trade freedom and privacy for convenience

35:39.480 --> 35:41.200
and comfort and speed.

35:41.200 --> 35:43.040
Absolutely, it's an engineering decision

35:43.040 --> 35:44.400
in everything that you do.

35:45.560 --> 35:49.120
In the West, in advanced democracies,

35:49.120 --> 35:53.440
we have not necessarily personally seen

35:53.440 --> 35:54.520
the results of that trade-off

35:54.520 --> 35:56.920
because we live in these free societies

35:56.920 --> 35:59.160
that have these checks and balances and freedoms.

35:59.160 --> 36:01.240
But as soon as you step into an authoritarian state

36:01.240 --> 36:02.600
and you make those trade-offs,

36:02.600 --> 36:05.840
your life immediately becomes more restrictive.

36:05.840 --> 36:07.920
And what people are worried about is that

36:07.920 --> 36:12.920
even in advanced economies, market democracies, et cetera,

36:13.160 --> 36:16.080
the people are worried that they might not survive

36:16.080 --> 36:20.520
the great social digital transformation.

36:20.520 --> 36:23.000
Look at what the NSA is capable of doing.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.560
I mean, for now, it's not that big of a problem

36:26.560 --> 36:28.960
because we still have free speech,

36:28.960 --> 36:31.720
but it's deeply concerning what Snowden revealed.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.920
And it's a nice reminder that we need to be focused

36:34.920 --> 36:38.040
on privacy and encryption and on helping users

36:38.040 --> 36:41.360
become more sovereign, regardless of where you live.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.760
It's kind of like a crutch to live in a free society.

36:43.760 --> 36:47.200
Like, you know, it's almost like a free lunch in a way.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.280
You're not gonna be sent to a prison camp

36:49.280 --> 36:51.920
because of the color of your skin or your beliefs

36:51.920 --> 36:54.080
or what you say about the government.

36:54.080 --> 36:55.440
And you're very lucky.

36:55.440 --> 36:57.520
Again, most people do live in a society

36:57.520 --> 37:00.320
where you can be persecuted for those things.

37:00.320 --> 37:03.560
And I feel like, especially in America, we forget that.

37:03.560 --> 37:07.960
We're distanced from that really strong reality, you know?

37:07.960 --> 37:11.120
On the topic of Snowden and the NSA,

37:11.120 --> 37:12.960
what should we be thinking about?

37:12.960 --> 37:14.320
Because that feels like already

37:14.320 --> 37:16.400
an outdated set of conversations

37:16.400 --> 37:19.440
because of the information we've gotten from the past.

37:19.440 --> 37:21.440
It feels like everything's gotten quiet now

37:21.440 --> 37:23.360
in terms of how much we actually know about the-

37:23.360 --> 37:24.440
It's hugely important.

37:24.920 --> 37:27.960
I think the two lessons from Snowden are, A,

37:27.960 --> 37:31.040
the Patriot Act and the War on Terror and mass surveillance

37:31.040 --> 37:34.920
are not necessary for our democracy and for our freedoms.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.200
This was a false choice.

37:37.200 --> 37:40.200
We never had to sacrifice them to be safer.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.640
And we've seen that.

37:41.640 --> 37:43.120
Government has spent hundreds and hundreds

37:43.120 --> 37:45.560
of millions of dollars on these surveillance programs

37:45.560 --> 37:48.680
that you can read about have amounted to very little,

37:48.680 --> 37:50.320
except for tremendous bureaucratic waste

37:50.320 --> 37:54.200
and the erosion of our freedoms.

37:54.240 --> 37:57.240
But at the same time, we need to practice more privacy.

37:57.240 --> 38:00.440
And the dramatic increase in the usage of Signal,

38:00.440 --> 38:03.920
for example, has been really, really great to see.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.920
It's fantastic that tens of millions of people

38:05.920 --> 38:08.320
are downloading Signal and using it.

38:08.320 --> 38:10.840
You should try to be onboarding more and more

38:10.840 --> 38:13.480
of your conversations onto Signal, for example,

38:13.480 --> 38:16.200
where governments can't see what you're saying.

38:16.200 --> 38:17.800
Maybe they can see the metadata.

38:17.800 --> 38:20.200
Maybe they can see that you sent your phone number,

38:20.200 --> 38:23.480
sent a message to someone else's phone number at this time,

38:23.520 --> 38:25.040
but they can't see what's inside.

38:25.040 --> 38:27.560
So using encryption in your life is very, very important.

38:27.560 --> 38:29.080
That's a good starting point.

38:29.080 --> 38:30.720
I would say that's kind of step A.

38:32.400 --> 38:36.360
The ideas of democracy, the ideas of the balance of power,

38:38.800 --> 38:40.560
all the ideas that we were talking about,

38:40.560 --> 38:44.200
the constructs, were inventions.

38:44.200 --> 38:46.480
I wonder if there's other inventions

38:46.480 --> 38:50.080
that will allow us to sort of not engage,

38:50.120 --> 38:53.760
not give governments or any centralized institutions

38:53.760 --> 38:55.480
so much power.

38:55.480 --> 38:59.120
Like, why do citizens have to use Signal?

38:59.120 --> 38:59.960
Why?

38:59.960 --> 39:00.800
Because that's an effort.

39:00.800 --> 39:03.880
You have to be, because you have to understand exactly why.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.200
So that's a nice little solution

39:05.200 --> 39:06.480
for a particular set of problems.

39:06.480 --> 39:09.360
But there's a million other ways that data, I'm sure,

39:09.360 --> 39:11.600
is being collected constantly.

39:11.600 --> 39:16.520
If we don't create a system that prevents

39:16.520 --> 39:18.800
the establishment of these centralized powers,

39:18.800 --> 39:20.840
then we'll always have this problem.

39:20.840 --> 39:22.080
Yeah, I think we can keep it simple

39:22.080 --> 39:23.720
for the purposes of this conversation.

39:23.720 --> 39:25.960
You have politics, information, and money.

39:25.960 --> 39:26.800
Those are the three things

39:26.800 --> 39:28.840
I would encourage us to focus on.

39:28.840 --> 39:32.200
In politics, yes, someone invented democracy.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.360
I mean, whether it was the Greeks,

39:34.360 --> 39:36.640
the West Africans, or many others around the world,

39:36.640 --> 39:38.400
around the same time invented this idea

39:38.400 --> 39:41.680
that we should be ruled by rules and not by rulers, right?

39:42.800 --> 39:45.400
And that has evolved dramatically, right?

39:45.400 --> 39:46.920
And then you have information.

39:46.920 --> 39:50.080
Information also used to be highly centralized, right?

39:50.080 --> 39:52.280
Think about how rich you had to be

39:52.280 --> 39:54.720
to gain access to a library before the printing press,

39:54.720 --> 39:57.000
or how much money you had to have,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.800
or how close to the king or the feudal lord

39:59.800 --> 40:02.640
that you had to be to be able to have that ability.

40:02.640 --> 40:05.920
But now, the majority of the world,

40:05.920 --> 40:08.000
billions of people have access to all information

40:08.000 --> 40:09.600
in their pocket, and they can set up an account

40:09.600 --> 40:11.520
on social media and get their word out.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.400
So not only politics,

40:13.400 --> 40:17.160
but information has been dramatically decentralized.

40:17.160 --> 40:19.880
And I would say that encrypted messaging

40:19.880 --> 40:22.880
is kind of a corollary to that second innovation.

40:22.880 --> 40:26.120
And as much as now people are like more effortlessly,

40:26.120 --> 40:29.600
like Signal is a lot easier to use than PGP, for example,

40:29.600 --> 40:32.040
they're more easily able to practice privacy

40:32.040 --> 40:36.040
when it comes to having private messages globally.

40:36.040 --> 40:38.320
These are all good things, and we need to keep pushing.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.960
And I think money is like, honestly,

40:40.960 --> 40:42.600
maybe the most important piece.

40:42.640 --> 40:45.480
And that's why I spent so much time thinking about Bitcoin.

40:45.480 --> 40:49.680
Okay, so politics, information, money.

40:49.680 --> 40:50.520
Yes.

40:50.520 --> 40:52.000
Let's talk about money.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.320
What is money and why is it important to think about

40:55.320 --> 40:57.520
in the context of human rights?

40:58.520 --> 41:03.520
I have witnessed money be peripheralized.

41:04.720 --> 41:07.720
It has taken a back seat in the human rights conversation.

41:07.720 --> 41:10.000
The idea of currency, who makes the money,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.040
who makes the rules, who issues it,

41:12.040 --> 41:14.760
who sets the interest rates, all these things.

41:14.760 --> 41:17.160
It is not on the menu of human rights activists.

41:17.160 --> 41:18.760
If you just do like a systematic study

41:18.760 --> 41:20.160
of like the human rights discourse

41:20.160 --> 41:23.520
over the last several decades, money is not there.

41:23.520 --> 41:25.080
It's also not really taught in schools.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.960
Like children don't really learn about money.

41:26.960 --> 41:28.040
Where does it come from?

41:28.040 --> 41:31.980
It's kind of hidden from a lot of our discourse.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.160
Only really when I got into Bitcoin

41:35.160 --> 41:37.920
did I start learning more about money.

41:37.920 --> 41:40.560
I spent 10 years at the Human Rights Foundation

41:40.560 --> 41:43.120
and we did all kinds of programs around the world.

41:43.120 --> 41:45.680
We convened Oslo Freedom Forums in different places

41:45.680 --> 41:47.720
and I got to meet hundreds of dissidents.

41:47.720 --> 41:50.160
And very rarely did they ever speak about currency

41:50.160 --> 41:53.740
or bank accounts or moving money from one place to another.

41:53.740 --> 41:55.600
But when I started asking them,

41:55.600 --> 41:58.320
they always had amazing stories about money, always.

41:58.320 --> 41:59.800
I mean, my friend Ivan Mawire,

41:59.800 --> 42:03.160
who started the This Flag movement in Zimbabwe,

42:03.160 --> 42:05.320
which ended up toppling Robert Mugabe,

42:05.320 --> 42:07.160
when I asked him to come to San Francisco

42:07.160 --> 42:10.320
to give a talk about hyperinflation, which he lived through,

42:10.360 --> 42:12.720
he said, no one's ever asked me to do that before,

42:12.720 --> 42:13.560
but I'll come.

42:13.560 --> 42:15.560
And he came, this was about three years ago.

42:15.560 --> 42:17.200
And the first thing he did when he got on the stage

42:17.200 --> 42:19.640
is he opened up a shirt and he brought out a necklace

42:19.640 --> 42:21.920
that had the 1980 Zimbabwean dollar on it.

42:21.920 --> 42:25.260
And he said, we in the activist community wear this

42:25.260 --> 42:27.120
as a symbol of where our country used to be

42:27.120 --> 42:28.400
because the Zimbabwean dollar

42:28.400 --> 42:30.240
used to be worth two British pounds.

42:30.240 --> 42:33.640
And then of course, over the next two and a half decades

42:33.640 --> 42:37.060
of economic mismanagement and corruption by Mugabe,

42:37.060 --> 42:38.580
it got inflated out of existence, right?

42:38.580 --> 42:40.160
You've seen those like hundred trillion dollars

42:40.160 --> 42:41.840
in Zimbabwean notes.

42:41.840 --> 42:43.000
So he had to live through that,

42:43.000 --> 42:45.360
which was terrible and crushing,

42:45.360 --> 42:47.400
but he is an expert on money.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.880
If you actually talk to human rights activists about money,

42:49.880 --> 42:51.760
they know a lot about money.

42:51.760 --> 42:54.160
They're just not usually asked to talk about it.

42:54.160 --> 42:59.160
So for me, when I studied money or look at money,

42:59.560 --> 43:02.520
it's really about control, who's creating it

43:02.520 --> 43:04.240
and how much does the population know

43:04.240 --> 43:06.440
about the creation of that money.

43:06.440 --> 43:07.880
And when it comes to Bitcoin,

43:07.880 --> 43:09.320
it's really the people's money.

43:09.360 --> 43:12.480
Like there is no shadowy force in charge of it.

43:12.480 --> 43:13.960
We all know the rules.

43:13.960 --> 43:15.580
We all know how it's gonna get minted

43:15.580 --> 43:17.280
and how it's gonna get printed.

43:17.280 --> 43:20.400
And that information is out there for everybody to see.

43:20.400 --> 43:22.300
And there's no like special group of rules

43:22.300 --> 43:25.520
for one group of people or another group.

43:25.520 --> 43:28.160
A billionaire and a refugee are the same

43:28.160 --> 43:29.980
in the eyes of the protocol.

43:29.980 --> 43:33.120
This is a rather revolutionary concept.

43:33.120 --> 43:35.860
And in the same way that democracy allowed us

43:35.860 --> 43:38.900
to decentralize politics and have checks and balances.

43:39.420 --> 43:40.380
And in the same way that the internet

43:40.380 --> 43:41.920
is this culmination of technologies

43:41.920 --> 43:44.700
that allowed us to decentralize information,

43:44.700 --> 43:47.020
access to and control over it.

43:47.020 --> 43:49.840
Bitcoin, decentralizes money.

43:49.840 --> 43:52.960
I mean, no longer, again, is there one group of people

43:52.960 --> 43:54.880
who can just change it arbitrarily.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.940
We're all in the same playing field.

43:56.940 --> 43:59.340
And I think that that is a tremendous innovation.

44:01.380 --> 44:05.120
From one perspective, money and inflation, hyperinflation

44:05.120 --> 44:08.100
is a kind of symptom of corruption

44:08.100 --> 44:10.380
as opposed to the core of the corruption.

44:11.620 --> 44:15.460
And at the flip side, in terms of resisting the corruption,

44:15.460 --> 44:19.300
resisting the abuse of human rights,

44:20.340 --> 44:24.840
it's interesting to think that fighting inflation

44:24.840 --> 44:29.840
or fighting the mismanagement of the money supply

44:32.340 --> 44:34.980
is a way to fight back authoritarianism

44:34.980 --> 44:37.040
or to fight authoritarianism.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.680
And that's an interesting concept

44:40.680 --> 44:42.480
that I think was introduced to me

44:42.480 --> 44:45.000
by just plugging myself intellectually

44:45.000 --> 44:46.120
into the Bitcoin community,

44:46.120 --> 44:48.120
but also just cryptocurrency in general.

44:50.800 --> 44:54.160
It's not that money is a symptom.

44:55.120 --> 44:57.860
Money is a tool to fight back to.

44:58.760 --> 45:00.140
Absolutely.

45:00.140 --> 45:03.640
So in what way can Bitcoin be used

45:04.080 --> 45:07.720
to fight authoritarianism?

45:08.840 --> 45:09.680
Yes.

45:09.680 --> 45:10.500
Not just in the United States,

45:10.500 --> 45:13.680
but all of those 53% that you're referring to,

45:13.680 --> 45:15.360
how can Bitcoin help?

45:15.360 --> 45:17.520
So we talked about authoritarianism

45:17.520 --> 45:20.240
and we talked about the surveillance state.

45:20.240 --> 45:23.560
To me, Bitcoin has two kind of key mechanisms

45:23.560 --> 45:25.000
through which it can help us.

45:25.900 --> 45:29.160
Number one, it's a sovereign savings account.

45:29.160 --> 45:31.800
It's debasement proof, meaning the government cannot print

45:31.800 --> 45:33.000
more whenever they want.

45:33.720 --> 45:35.960
This is very, very different from fiat currency,

45:35.960 --> 45:38.520
which by its very name, its very nature,

45:38.520 --> 45:41.840
can be issued on sort of demand by the rulers.

45:41.840 --> 45:43.920
And while I live in a country

45:43.920 --> 45:47.440
where the rulers do a reasonable job managing the money,

45:47.440 --> 45:48.800
most people aren't so lucky.

45:48.800 --> 45:52.320
So only 13% of humans in the world live in a country

45:52.320 --> 45:54.640
that's a liberal democracy with property rights

45:54.640 --> 45:57.060
and has what we call a reserve currency,

45:57.060 --> 45:58.960
meaning a currency so stable and desirable

45:58.960 --> 46:00.400
that other countries save in it

46:00.400 --> 46:02.120
at the central bank level, right?

46:02.120 --> 46:07.120
You basically have the US, the UK, Australia, Switzerland,

46:07.320 --> 46:09.000
the Euro and Canada.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.640
I mean, those are like reserve currencies

46:10.640 --> 46:11.880
and these are liberal democracies

46:11.880 --> 46:14.280
where people have reasonable guarantees over property rights.

46:14.280 --> 46:17.820
Everybody else either lives under like a weaker currency

46:17.820 --> 46:19.440
or an authoritarian regime.

46:19.440 --> 46:21.280
That's 87% of the world's population,

46:21.280 --> 46:22.720
almost 7 billion people.

46:22.720 --> 46:26.120
So for them, a sovereign savings account

46:26.120 --> 46:28.080
that's permissionless, meaning you don't have to have ID

46:28.080 --> 46:30.160
to use it is a big, big deal.

46:30.160 --> 46:31.920
And a lot of people talk about Zimbabwe

46:32.600 --> 46:34.440
or Venezuela has some like isolated cases.

46:34.440 --> 46:37.440
Oh, well, you know, hyperinflation only happens

46:37.440 --> 46:39.240
in those two countries.

46:39.240 --> 46:40.720
I actually did some research into this

46:40.720 --> 46:45.320
and there's about one point over, you know,

46:45.320 --> 46:47.760
close to 1.3 billion people who live under double

46:47.760 --> 46:49.200
or triple digit inflation.

46:49.200 --> 46:51.240
This is not an isolated instance.

46:51.240 --> 46:54.800
We're talking huge countries, Nigeria, 200 million people,

46:54.800 --> 46:58.240
15% inflation, Turkey, 15% inflation

46:58.240 --> 47:01.160
for 100 million people, Argentina, 40% inflation

47:01.160 --> 47:04.040
for a country of 45 million people.

47:04.040 --> 47:06.600
So you can go down the list, there's about 35 countries

47:06.600 --> 47:09.720
where like people's earnings, their wages

47:09.720 --> 47:12.240
are literally disappearing in front of their eyes

47:12.240 --> 47:14.080
over a matter of weeks or months

47:14.080 --> 47:17.280
against things like the dollar, gold, real estate, right?

47:17.280 --> 47:19.480
So this is a huge issue.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.240
It absolutely is a human rights issue for me.

47:21.240 --> 47:23.260
I mean, when it comes to your time and energy,

47:23.260 --> 47:26.280
having control over that or having it stolen from you,

47:26.280 --> 47:27.880
I think this is pretty clear.

47:27.880 --> 47:31.480
And Bitcoin is like an immediate, low cost,

47:31.480 --> 47:34.040
easily accessible solution for people.

47:34.040 --> 47:37.200
And I've learned this not from my own assumptions,

47:37.200 --> 47:40.840
but by talking to people, by interviewing dozens of people,

47:40.840 --> 47:42.680
whether it's in Sudan,

47:42.680 --> 47:44.800
which currently has triple digit inflation

47:45.720 --> 47:48.840
or people who've escaped from Syria,

47:48.840 --> 47:51.520
who have used Bitcoin to get their wealth out of the country

47:51.520 --> 47:54.600
and then also to make payments back to people inside

47:54.600 --> 47:56.240
or Venezuela or elsewhere.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.320
It's very, very powerful.

47:58.320 --> 48:00.400
I think some very small percentage of people

48:00.400 --> 48:02.720
who have used, have owned Bitcoins

48:02.720 --> 48:05.280
was something like 1% of the world.

48:05.280 --> 48:07.080
Whatever that number is, it's small.

48:07.080 --> 48:09.360
Call it 2% for the purposes of our calculation.

48:09.360 --> 48:12.240
About a little under 200 million people.

48:12.240 --> 48:13.200
Wow, yeah.

48:14.160 --> 48:15.080
At most, right now.

48:15.080 --> 48:17.960
So if we look at Zimbabwe, Sudan, if we look at-

48:17.960 --> 48:19.860
Small percentages of people.

48:19.860 --> 48:22.340
Do you think the technology is mature enough?

48:22.340 --> 48:23.720
Because it's not just about the idea,

48:23.720 --> 48:25.680
it's also about the implementation of it.

48:25.680 --> 48:29.620
Like, you know, Bitcoin, for the most part,

48:29.620 --> 48:32.880
requires access to the internet.

48:32.880 --> 48:33.720
Yeah.

48:33.720 --> 48:38.720
And what do you think about accessibility

48:39.200 --> 48:41.920
of this technology now as a method of activism

48:41.920 --> 48:43.400
in the worst parts of the world?

48:43.400 --> 48:45.460
We often think, like all the conversations we've had

48:45.460 --> 48:48.280
about Bitcoin is essentially middle class,

48:48.280 --> 48:51.120
like wealthy people relative to the rest of the world.

48:51.120 --> 48:53.440
They're kind of talking the sort of investment

48:53.960 --> 48:55.880
in high concept ideas.

48:55.880 --> 48:57.340
Then there's also the people in the world

48:57.340 --> 49:01.000
who are suffering, who are living through hyperinflation.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.800
They may not have a computer access to the internet.

49:03.800 --> 49:05.920
How do you think Bitcoin can help there?

49:05.920 --> 49:08.960
Yeah, so again, we have one clear use case,

49:08.960 --> 49:10.660
which is a sovereign savings account

49:10.660 --> 49:11.980
that you can control, right?

49:11.980 --> 49:15.120
The other use case is an unstoppable payments network.

49:15.120 --> 49:17.000
This is very important for people who live behind,

49:17.000 --> 49:18.520
for example, sanctions.

49:18.520 --> 49:21.720
Like the U.S. basically weaponizes the dollar

49:21.720 --> 49:24.200
and it like sanctions different countries.

49:24.200 --> 49:26.980
And instead of sanctioning like a handful of rulers,

49:26.980 --> 49:28.360
for example, which I would support,

49:28.360 --> 49:30.700
this is like a Magnitsky or smart sanctions.

49:30.700 --> 49:31.680
Sometimes we'll just say,

49:31.680 --> 49:33.080
we're just gonna shut off this whole country.

49:33.080 --> 49:34.120
So the people suffer.

49:34.120 --> 49:35.960
Cuba or Iran are good examples.

49:35.960 --> 49:37.560
Average people suffer, right?

49:37.560 --> 49:40.020
So people in those two countries I just mentioned,

49:40.020 --> 49:41.800
Cuba, Iran, or even Palestine,

49:41.800 --> 49:45.440
which is also sort of like blockaded by the Israelis.

49:45.440 --> 49:48.600
So you have Cuba, Iran, Palestine are three good examples

49:48.600 --> 49:50.840
where people inside all three of those countries now

49:50.840 --> 49:53.640
are using Bitcoin to do commerce, do their business,

49:53.640 --> 49:54.840
send money back and forth.

49:54.840 --> 49:56.280
So it's sanction resistant.

49:56.280 --> 49:57.600
Sanctions resistant.

49:57.600 --> 49:59.840
It does not get stopped by sanctions, right?

50:00.840 --> 50:03.960
And also it's, again, remittances are extortionate.

50:03.960 --> 50:08.400
I mean, the average remittance costs has a high fee,

50:08.400 --> 50:09.520
takes several days.

50:09.520 --> 50:11.840
If your family is in Ghana or something like that

50:11.840 --> 50:13.560
or Nigeria and you live in the United States,

50:13.560 --> 50:16.000
it can take time to use Western Union.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.040
Sometimes it gets paused, it gets lost, there's issues.

50:19.040 --> 50:20.720
You have to deal with customer service.

50:21.640 --> 50:22.480
Screw that.

50:22.480 --> 50:24.000
I mean, the person has a cell phone,

50:24.000 --> 50:25.960
which increasingly is the case.

50:25.960 --> 50:27.560
I mean, by the end of next year,

50:28.920 --> 50:30.840
more than five or 6 billion people,

50:30.840 --> 50:31.840
depending on different estimates,

50:31.840 --> 50:35.680
will have smartphones basically by the end of 2022.

50:35.680 --> 50:38.240
We're talking like the vast majority of humans

50:38.240 --> 50:40.040
will have access to smartphones.

50:40.040 --> 50:42.360
They can all have sovereign Bitcoin wallets.

50:42.360 --> 50:45.200
And there's even ways to access Bitcoin

50:45.200 --> 50:46.240
without the internet.

50:47.160 --> 50:48.760
But I mean, we can get into that.

50:48.760 --> 50:50.440
There's like hardware wallets and so on.

50:51.120 --> 50:54.120
What do you mean by sovereign Bitcoin wallet?

50:55.600 --> 51:00.280
Most users today are using Bitcoin in a custodial manner.

51:00.280 --> 51:03.320
So this is kind of like having a bank account

51:03.320 --> 51:07.240
where you have a deposit account at a bank, right?

51:07.240 --> 51:08.640
So you have a claim, right?

51:08.640 --> 51:10.840
You go to the bank and they have some of your money

51:10.840 --> 51:13.240
and you take it out, right, with an ATM.

51:13.240 --> 51:18.000
So what I would call non-custodial Bitcoin use

51:18.000 --> 51:20.960
would be similar to withdrawing cash from an ATM.

51:20.960 --> 51:23.080
You have it, it's a bearer instrument, okay?

51:23.080 --> 51:25.400
So when I, it's what's called, the bearer instrument.

51:25.400 --> 51:26.560
I know, I apologize.

51:26.560 --> 51:28.080
I'm outside this community, it just sounds funny.

51:28.080 --> 51:28.920
No, no, no, it's, yeah.

51:28.920 --> 51:30.960
So like a bearer instrument would be like a bar of gold

51:30.960 --> 51:35.200
or a bank note or Bitcoin that you control,

51:35.200 --> 51:37.280
meaning you have the seed phrase, right?

51:37.280 --> 51:41.520
Which for the listeners essentially is 12 to 24 English words

51:41.520 --> 51:42.800
that you write down on a piece of paper.

51:42.800 --> 51:46.240
That's your like password to get into your Bitcoin account.

51:46.240 --> 51:49.440
And that gives you that bearer instrument quality, right?

51:49.440 --> 51:53.520
But unfortunately, most users still use Bitcoin

51:53.520 --> 51:56.320
in a custodial way, meaning they buy it on Coinbase.

51:56.320 --> 51:57.160
So Coinbase-

51:57.160 --> 51:58.440
Or Square or something like that.

51:58.440 --> 52:00.440
You would put into the-

52:00.440 --> 52:01.280
Custodial.

52:01.280 --> 52:03.880
Into the custodial category like a bank, yeah.

52:03.880 --> 52:06.320
And look, the good news is you can withdraw

52:06.320 --> 52:07.480
to your own control.

52:07.480 --> 52:09.000
And in the Bitcoin community,

52:09.000 --> 52:11.240
we try to teach this idea that it's not your keys,

52:11.240 --> 52:13.160
not your coins in the same way

52:13.160 --> 52:14.720
that if you deposit your money at the bank,

52:14.720 --> 52:15.720
you might not get it back.

52:15.720 --> 52:19.640
I mean, it's low likelihood, but it's very possible.

52:19.640 --> 52:20.560
Same thing in Bitcoin.

52:20.560 --> 52:22.080
Like if you wanna get the full experience,

52:22.080 --> 52:24.360
you wanna actually custody your own Bitcoin.

52:24.360 --> 52:26.920
You wanna put it, whether it's on an open source

52:26.920 --> 52:29.240
software wallet, like the blue wallet is a good one

52:29.240 --> 52:30.920
for people to check out,

52:30.920 --> 52:33.600
or a hardware wallet like cold card, for example.

52:33.600 --> 52:35.600
There's different ways to do this.

52:35.600 --> 52:38.000
But essentially like around the world,

52:38.000 --> 52:39.560
people are innovating.

52:39.560 --> 52:41.920
Like don't think so low of your fellow man.

52:41.920 --> 52:42.760
You know what I mean?

52:42.760 --> 52:44.640
Like people are able to figure this out.

52:44.800 --> 52:46.320
I get a lot of flack from people saying,

52:46.320 --> 52:47.800
oh, Bitcoin's so hard to use.

52:47.800 --> 52:49.400
I've read this article in the New York Times saying

52:49.400 --> 52:51.800
this guy in Silicon Valley lost all of his Bitcoin.

52:51.800 --> 52:54.240
That's because he was a moron and didn't care about it.

52:54.240 --> 52:55.600
This guy lost all this Bitcoin

52:55.600 --> 52:57.760
because it wasn't worth much 10 years ago.

52:57.760 --> 52:59.440
And he forgot the password.

52:59.440 --> 53:01.560
But if you're like receiving your remittance

53:01.560 --> 53:04.600
from a family member, you're not gonna lose the password.

53:04.600 --> 53:06.680
And you trust in the basic intelligence of people

53:06.680 --> 53:09.640
to figure this out and to innovate and so on

53:09.640 --> 53:10.840
and figure out.

53:10.840 --> 53:12.600
We're watching it, man.

53:12.640 --> 53:15.800
Yeah, you know, it's kind of funny that

53:15.800 --> 53:17.720
but people in the United States

53:17.720 --> 53:19.760
are not very savvy with money.

53:19.760 --> 53:21.560
It's exactly the way you're describing.

53:21.560 --> 53:24.600
It's like when you have very little money,

53:24.600 --> 53:26.920
you're going to be savvy with money.

53:26.920 --> 53:30.440
You're going to understand exactly the mechanisms that work,

53:30.440 --> 53:33.080
that are resistant to the corruption that's around you.

53:33.080 --> 53:36.880
I mean, I remember sort of growing up in the Soviet Union,

53:38.200 --> 53:41.040
the general bureaucracy and the corruption

53:41.040 --> 53:42.080
of everything around you.

53:42.080 --> 53:44.000
You figure out ways around that.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.760
You figure out ways how to function

53:45.760 --> 53:46.920
within that kind of system

53:46.920 --> 53:50.240
to survive under inflation, under hyperinflation,

53:50.240 --> 53:54.200
under all like basically being unable to trust any kind of

53:54.200 --> 53:56.160
even the police force and all those kinds of things.

53:56.160 --> 53:57.240
You figure it out.

53:57.240 --> 54:00.520
And in that same way, perhaps Bitcoin could be

54:00.520 --> 54:05.120
all the different ways to store and gain Bitcoin.

54:05.120 --> 54:08.160
These mechanisms could be something that's figured out

54:08.160 --> 54:11.000
in the third world as opposed to in the United States.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.200
The capital of Bitcoin could easily be Lagos

54:13.200 --> 54:15.640
and not San Francisco in terms of users,

54:15.640 --> 54:16.880
in terms of people using it.

54:16.880 --> 54:20.120
And again, the two use cases as a savings account

54:20.120 --> 54:22.040
and as an unstoppable payment rail.

54:22.040 --> 54:23.920
These are the two ones that you should really think about.

54:23.920 --> 54:25.560
This is how people are using it today.

54:25.560 --> 54:29.680
Now, when it comes to, could it possibly be adopted

54:29.680 --> 54:32.680
by like a sufficient majority of the population?

54:32.680 --> 54:33.520
I say yes.

54:33.520 --> 54:36.320
And it's very similar to the way the mobile phone spread.

54:36.320 --> 54:39.840
At the beginning, the cell phone was only for rich people.

54:39.840 --> 54:40.840
It was only for the elite.

54:41.680 --> 54:42.520
It was huge, it didn't work very well.

54:42.520 --> 54:44.600
The interface sucked, it was clunky.

54:44.600 --> 54:47.120
Over time, it got smaller and smaller

54:47.120 --> 54:49.040
and cheaper and cheaper and easier to use

54:49.040 --> 54:52.000
and easier to use and today, everyone benefits.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.960
So you're gonna watch a similar technology

54:53.960 --> 54:55.640
upgrade process with Bitcoin.

54:55.640 --> 54:57.360
Already in the last 10 years,

54:57.360 --> 54:59.480
Bitcoin has gotten so much easier to use.

54:59.480 --> 55:02.480
I mean, there are now mobile wallets that are so slick.

55:02.480 --> 55:05.160
There's one called Moon, M-U-U-N wallet

55:05.160 --> 55:06.400
from a team in Argentina.

55:06.400 --> 55:08.640
And these guys created it because they saw

55:08.640 --> 55:11.320
their own currency devalued like three times

55:11.320 --> 55:12.680
in the last 20 years.

55:12.680 --> 55:14.720
And they've had a hell of a time trying to get their money

55:14.720 --> 55:16.360
back and forth in different countries.

55:16.360 --> 55:19.080
So they were like, let's make this easy for people.

55:19.080 --> 55:22.000
Again, this is the people's money.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.040
This is something that cannot be controlled

55:24.040 --> 55:25.920
by governments or corporations

55:25.920 --> 55:27.840
and that makes it very powerful.

55:27.840 --> 55:30.560
And I think it's actually quite exciting to be here

55:30.560 --> 55:31.840
in the adoption phase.

55:31.840 --> 55:32.960
In the early days.

55:32.960 --> 55:34.480
Yeah, man, this is the early days.

55:34.480 --> 55:36.880
And you also mentioned that sort of Bitcoin

55:37.760 --> 55:40.040
is the mechanism of a peaceful revolution.

55:40.040 --> 55:44.000
So it's a way to resist authoritarianism

55:44.000 --> 55:45.080
in a peaceful way.

55:45.080 --> 55:48.280
It's ultimately, you mentioned sort of

55:49.440 --> 55:53.360
politics, information and money.

55:53.360 --> 55:55.640
It seems like in the space of money,

55:55.640 --> 55:57.760
this is one of the peaceful mechanisms.

55:57.760 --> 55:59.720
It's a way to opt out.

55:59.720 --> 56:02.760
You can opt out peacefully from the system.

56:03.960 --> 56:06.360
Yeah, it's beautiful, it's beautiful.

56:06.360 --> 56:10.280
So Bitcoin is currently by far the most popular

56:10.280 --> 56:12.320
sort of dominant cryptocurrency.

56:12.320 --> 56:15.240
That said, and I look forward to your letters,

56:15.240 --> 56:18.920
Bitcoin maximalists, that said,

56:18.920 --> 56:22.960
Internet Explorer was the most popular browser

56:22.960 --> 56:23.960
for quite a long time.

56:23.960 --> 56:27.920
And then other browsers came along that out-competed it

56:27.920 --> 56:32.360
like Chrome, Firefox, people's checkout brave.

56:32.360 --> 56:34.040
It's a great browser.

56:34.040 --> 56:36.320
I think it's my favorite browser at this point.

56:36.320 --> 56:38.000
Anyway, so why Bitcoin?

56:38.000 --> 56:39.760
Why not another cryptocurrency?

56:39.760 --> 56:43.600
If you look in the next 10, 20, 50, 100 years,

56:43.600 --> 56:46.520
do you think it's possible for another cryptocurrency

56:46.520 --> 56:49.880
like Ethereum or something that's not even here yet

56:49.880 --> 56:52.440
to overtake Bitcoin as a mechanism?

56:53.320 --> 56:57.360
When you say overtake, what do you mean?

56:57.360 --> 56:58.200
What do you mean overtake?

56:58.200 --> 56:59.320
Do you mean number of users?

56:59.320 --> 57:02.040
Do you mean a price per coin?

57:02.040 --> 57:03.080
Yeah, the number of users,

57:03.120 --> 57:05.440
because we're talking about 1%, 2%.

57:05.440 --> 57:10.440
And if we are serious about this being in the space of money

57:11.960 --> 57:16.960
as a way to give individuals power,

57:17.320 --> 57:20.520
fight the centralized powers that abuse the money system

57:20.520 --> 57:24.880
and so on, how do we get from 2% to 50%, right?

57:24.880 --> 57:28.240
To 60% to 80%.

57:28.240 --> 57:31.520
That jump, is it obvious to you?

57:31.600 --> 57:35.680
Not obvious, but do you think Bitcoin is the way

57:35.680 --> 57:38.320
to get from 2% to 50%

57:38.320 --> 57:41.080
or are there going to be other cryptocurrencies

57:41.080 --> 57:43.320
that may emerge that get us to 50%?

57:43.320 --> 57:45.480
No, I mean Bitcoin is the innovation.

57:45.480 --> 57:48.600
The innovation is in having the decentralized mint.

57:48.600 --> 57:51.120
No one can change the monetary policy.

57:51.120 --> 57:53.200
Everything else is downstream from there.

57:53.200 --> 57:55.560
In Bitcoin, the meme would be 21 million.

57:55.560 --> 57:57.800
There's never gonna be any more than 21 million.

57:57.800 --> 57:59.280
Every other cryptocurrency

57:59.280 --> 58:01.680
either has an inflationary policy,

58:01.680 --> 58:02.520
meaning there's gonna continue

58:02.520 --> 58:04.480
to be more and more of it over time,

58:04.480 --> 58:06.640
or its monetary policy can be changed

58:06.640 --> 58:08.080
by a small group of people.

58:08.080 --> 58:09.920
This is vividly on display in Ethereum,

58:09.920 --> 58:11.360
which is like the second largest

58:11.360 --> 58:14.040
and second most robust cryptocurrency, right?

58:14.040 --> 58:17.240
I've talked to senior Ethereum engineers

58:17.240 --> 58:19.480
over the last couple of weeks trying to figure out

58:19.480 --> 58:21.960
what is the monetary policy of Ethereum?

58:21.960 --> 58:23.120
No one can tell me.

58:23.120 --> 58:25.360
No one knows how much ETH is gonna be minted

58:25.360 --> 58:29.960
in 2022 and 2023 after they shift to proof of stake.

58:29.960 --> 58:33.200
I've seen estimates that range from 100,000 to 2 million.

58:33.200 --> 58:34.040
So at the end of the day,

58:34.040 --> 58:35.720
you're gonna be trusting a small group of people

58:35.720 --> 58:36.960
to make those decisions.

58:36.960 --> 58:39.240
That is what we are escaping with Bitcoin.

58:39.240 --> 58:41.400
So all these other cryptocurrencies,

58:41.400 --> 58:43.040
they might have their use cases.

58:43.040 --> 58:44.640
Virtually all of them are not.

58:44.640 --> 58:46.040
It's very important for people to know

58:46.040 --> 58:48.520
that if you take like the 4,500 cryptocurrencies

58:48.520 --> 58:52.760
on CoinMarketCap, almost all of them are scams straight up.

58:52.760 --> 58:55.760
Even the ones that have like noble intentions,

58:55.760 --> 58:57.200
I just don't think they're gonna add

58:57.200 --> 58:59.560
that much value ultimately.

58:59.560 --> 59:02.240
I think Bitcoin to me is the innovation

59:02.240 --> 59:05.320
and that's because it has a monetary policy

59:05.320 --> 59:08.400
and an issuance schedule that cannot be changed.

59:08.400 --> 59:09.640
And that's what gets me so excited about.

59:09.640 --> 59:11.440
I mean, that's why it's such an important tool

59:11.440 --> 59:12.320
for human rights.

59:12.320 --> 59:13.520
Yeah, it's interesting,

59:13.520 --> 59:15.320
because when you grow from 2%,

59:15.320 --> 59:18.480
when you grow in the number of people using it,

59:18.480 --> 59:20.000
at the scale they're using it,

59:21.000 --> 59:25.440
it's going to need to be resistant to governments

59:25.440 --> 59:27.560
and institutions messing with it.

59:27.560 --> 59:32.200
So it's interesting to see what kind of cryptocurrency

59:32.200 --> 59:33.360
would be resistant to that.

59:33.360 --> 59:36.600
Obviously Dogecoin is gonna win, let's be honest.

59:38.240 --> 59:41.360
Well, I mean, look, the number two cryptocurrency

59:41.360 --> 59:44.440
in the world, probably by like how useful it is to people

59:44.440 --> 59:48.960
is Tether, which is totally centralized, has blacklists.

59:48.960 --> 59:52.440
So I'm not saying there won't be like new digital assets

59:52.440 --> 59:55.640
that are lumped into this category that have usage,

59:55.640 --> 59:59.240
but it's not the same innovation as Bitcoin.

59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.280
It's just sort of building on this idea

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.560
of like a Euro dollar maybe,

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.600
like a dollar that is minted outside

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:07.240
of the control of the US Federal Reserve, right?

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.080
It would be a Euro dollar.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.600
So stable coins are kind of like Euro dollars

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.840
just minted by private actors in a way, right?

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.200
But they're still tied to the dollar.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.680
They're pegged to the dollar.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.280
They're not escaping the system.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.160
Escaping the system is Bitcoin.

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.480
We aren't reliant on the dollar.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.160
We have our own full store value,

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.520
medium of exchange, unit of account eventually.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:29.480
And the Bitcoin world will be denominated

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.520
in different terms.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.680
And I think everything else will be tied to it.

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:33.720
I really do.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:37.720
It does feel currently like Bitcoin is like pirates

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.640
or something like that.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.440
And there's still like the central banks

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:44.160
that are like the main navies of the different nations.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.360
It's just, if you talk about scale,

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.000
so there's going to be a moment

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.960
if Bitcoin continues to grow in its impact

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.400
when governments are going to seriously contend with,

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.800
what do we do with this?

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.400
Do you think about those moments?

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:02.000
Is Bitcoin, is the cryptocurrency world in general

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000
going to be able to withstand the serious legal pushback

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.120
from countries, from nations,

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.600
especially authoritarian nations?

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.160
Yeah, so it's been interesting.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.800
It's been 12 years, okay?

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.320
More than 12 years since Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.440
And they haven't been able to stop it.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.640
They've tried.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.640
They've tried a lot.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.640
I wrote a long essay for Quillette on this.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.840
Like, why haven't governments been able to stop Bitcoin?

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.800
And my thesis is essentially that there's been like

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.080
this mix of different kinds of technical, social,

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:37.520
and economic and political incentives and disincentives

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.240
that make it very difficult.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.440
And I think to me, the best way to think about it

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.320
is that Bitcoin's like a Trojan horse.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.840
So just to actually tell that story just a little bit,

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.480
because I think it's important to understand

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:52.520
the classical mythology tale.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.880
I find this very interesting.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:54.720
Of the actual Trojan horse?

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:55.640
Of the actual Trojan horse, yeah,

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:59.080
which was told in the Aeneid actually by Virgil, right?

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.960
And the idea was the Greeks had been like

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.560
trying to take the city of Troy for like a decade

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.400
at these like impregnable walls and they couldn't do it.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.560
And Ulysses and the rest of the Greek army were like,

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.040
we don't know what to do.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:13.960
So Minerva, the god of strategy and war,

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.960
they get this idea from her, I guess,

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.520
to actually try to use subterfuge and trickery

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.240
to take over the city.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.400
So the idea is, and this was sort of hatched by Ulysses,

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.400
to put this horse together that would kind of be like a gift.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.120
So the idea was the Greeks just like pretended to leave,

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:34.800
they deserted, they left behind one soldier and this horse.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.280
And the Trojans looked at it and they were like,

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.520
what's going on here?

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.680
And they brought in the soldier and the soldier's like,

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.480
look, they left, they're so sorry

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.600
for all of the desecration and blood spill.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:44.600
This is their gift to you.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.040
It's honoring Minerva.

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:50.120
It's like this trophy for you guys.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:53.480
And there were actually people inside Troy,

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.760
Cassandra, a prophet, as well as Lauquan,

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.080
who was like a priest who said, no, no, no,

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.200
this is obviously a trick.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.960
This is obviously a trick.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.880
But they were like dispatched and ignored

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.440
because the horse was like, it was just like so bad ass.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.480
So the Trojans were like bringing it in the city.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:08.920
So they brought it in themselves.

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:10.400
No blood spilled at all, right?

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.720
In the middle of the night, of course,

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.320
what you realize is the horse was packed

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.480
with Greek soldiers and they come out

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.320
and they let the army in,

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.840
which was like hiding behind an island.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:21.600
So this idea that like something could be so attractive

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.840
that you really can't say no,

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:24.280
even if you know what's inside of it,

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.080
is it played in Bitcoin.

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.520
So like Bitcoin has this number go up technology, right?

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:33.720
It is what we call it in sort of shorthand, NGU, right?

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:36.200
But what people don't realize is that NGU

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.640
is like the Trojan horse.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:41.120
Inside the Trojan horse is FGU, freedom go up technology.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.760
So dictators and rogue regimes and corporations

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:48.520
are gonna buy, mine, tax, accumulate this thing

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.680
because it's the best performing financial asset

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:51.520
in the world.

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:55.080
What they don't realize or they're gonna have to ignore

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.800
is that they're also aiding and abetting

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.880
this freedom technology,

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.080
which allows individuals to be sovereign

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.040
and eventually erodes their power.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.480
There's no question that rogue regimes and bad actors

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.800
have already used and will continue to use Bitcoin.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.480
The thing is, when you think about a North Korea

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.640
or a Venezuela and that government instructs

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.280
some of its bureaucrats and cronies and officials

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.040
to start stealing Bitcoin or accumulating it or whatever

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.280
for short-term gain to get around sanctions

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:22.480
and use it to buy dollars or something like that, right?

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.000
Which they can't get normally.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:24.840
Well, guess what?

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.480
All those people who the regime has instructed

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.320
to like figure this thing out and use it,

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.160
they're all gonna realize,

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.280
oh my God, this is money the government doesn't control

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.240
and it's gonna spread like a virus, okay?

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.880
So this is like the idea of the Trojan horse allegory.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.320
I think it's so important and powerful with Bitcoin.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.440
All the people talking about Bitcoin today on TV,

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.360
they don't care about freedom or privacy.

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.000
They just care about number go up.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.160
But what they don't realize is what's concealed within.

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:50.040
And that's very, very powerful to me.

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:52.440
So the people talking about Bitcoin on TV

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.520
are maybe investor types.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:58.240
Professional investors, corporations and soon governments.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.040
I mean, you just had today this morning on CNBC,

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:05.920
the Republican leader of the House of Representatives,

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.400
a congressman saying like,

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.400
we need to be pro-Bitcoin as a country.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:12.320
And the other day, Peter Thiel had a very interesting comment

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.240
where he was basically like,

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.920
let's not fall behind China in this race.

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.880
So you have influential people in our government

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:23.520
like sort of posturing for this like Bitcoin race

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.080
that's gonna happen in the next 10 years.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.240
You're gonna see this.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:29.720
Countries are gonna compete to stack Bitcoin, absolutely.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.320
So you believe the thing that's shiny and sexy

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.400
like the Trojan horse, the number go up.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.160
It's too hard to ignore.

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:42.680
And to define that a little further is meaning

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:45.600
it does seem like the more people get excited

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:48.200
and start using Bitcoin, the more its value grows.

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.160
So it's just a good-

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.000
Feedback loop.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.160
Yeah, it's a feedback loop.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.240
And then the reason you're excited about it,

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:56.280
especially is the FG-

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.480
Yeah, freedom go up.

01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:01.160
Freedom go up, which is it ultimately gives power

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:04.520
to the individuals to decentralize the entire system.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.800
When Tesla stacks Bitcoin,

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.480
they're just doing that as self-interest.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.040
They think it's gonna be a good inflation hedge, fine.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.600
But what they maybe don't care about, don't realize,

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.680
or they don't need to care.

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:17.920
I mean, Bitcoin's power is it like co-opts people

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.400
into promoting a freedom tool,

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.480
even if they don't care about,

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.720
or even if they hate freedom, it doesn't matter.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.520
So when Tesla stacks Bitcoin and the price goes up

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.800
and more interest goes up and more people around the world

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:31.040
are like, wow, Bitcoin, then more people get involved

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.760
again, more adoption, more price, more developers,

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:36.400
better user interface, more privacy tools,

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.040
more mining, more network security.

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.920
It's just this positive feedback loop that continues to grow

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.560
and it will grow intensely in the next decade

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.120
as we go through the adoption cycle.

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.120
And the reason why I'm so excited about this

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.120
is the human rights world,

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.560
again, to get back to our previous conversation,

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:54.480
it is very hard to find people who have the empathy

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:57.040
or the altruism to actually make a difference abroad

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.920
in places like China or Saudi Arabia or North Korea.

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.880
People are very quick to just like,

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.640
they'll just quickly toss off the pretty words

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.000
that they care about human rights

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.720
as soon as profits come into play.

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.920
So there's no alignment of incentives, right?

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.360
The reason why Bitcoin is so powerful

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.080
is that it aligns the incentives.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.920
All of a sudden, they can be as greedy as they want.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.400
They are being forced to promote a freedom tool.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.320
This I've never seen before and it makes me,

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.680
it gives me a lot of like excitement.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:24.400
It's very refreshing because we've been laboring

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.760
in the human rights space and you have to like raise money

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.280
and it's all like nonprofit work

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.440
and you're like begging for people

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.680
to make a difference for you.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.400
Here, you have this like incredible asset

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.840
which people will accumulate out of self-preservation,

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.120
self-interest and greed,

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.360
and yet it will strengthen the power of the individual.

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.440
That is what we need to fight, big brother.

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:43.680
That's what we need to fight.

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.760
Like what I'm scared is happening in China.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.960
Like this growing authoritarian state

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.280
which is powered by big data analysis,

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.960
this is our way to fight back.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:56.040
And it runs on this like really interesting engine,

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.600
again, that like takes advantage

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.320
of our base nature as humans.

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.600
And I know that it sounds terrible for me to say this,

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.400
but I mean, ultimately we are self-interested

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.840
and it is hard to get people to care

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:10.160
about others living a thousand miles away.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:13.960
You know, we are kind of localized in our empathy.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.760
Speaking as someone who works to help people

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.160
who live in like a hundred different countries,

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.240
it's very difficult to get Americans to care

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.240
about what's happening in Belarus or in Kashmir.

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.720
It just is, but guess what?

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.320
They're going to definitely care about Bitcoin

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.840
because they want to see their net worth go up.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.920
They want to do better for their family, et cetera.

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.680
They're going to get into this thing

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.160
and it's really going to like make that powerful tool

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.800
for everyone else who's using it.

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:42.240
So this interplay dynamic is fascinating to me.

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:47.160
Yeah, I have to, so I'm somebody who doesn't like

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.480
the corrupting effects of greed,

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.200
but it is also human nature.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.040
Yeah, I don't like it either,

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.840
but we have to be realists here.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.320
You have to acknowledge it

01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:00.560
and then maybe use it for your advantage.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.080
And it's not just Bitcoin itself.

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.280
Like exchanges today are adopting something

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:05.560
called Lightning Network,

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:07.920
which is a way to scale Bitcoin on a second layer.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.080
Much like we had gold bars,

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.520
which we scaled with paper money,

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.200
and then we had Visa credit cards,

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.760
which were a way of scaling the paper notes.

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.480
Bitcoin scales through Lightning Network.

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:20.240
It's a private, instant, globally final settlement network.

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.440
It's something you all should check out.

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.400
That's very, very interesting.

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.000
The exchanges aren't adopting Lightning

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.800
for its privacy benefits.

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.840
Like Lightning operates off the chain,

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.640
meaning surveillance companies can't see,

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.240
they can't do chain analysis on Lightning

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.520
because it's on an onion-routed second layer

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.640
that works kind of like the Tor project.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.960
The exchanges don't care about privacy.

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.080
They're doing it because it reduces fees.

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.000
Lightning is cheaper and faster.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
So again, we have this really interesting alignment

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.840
of incentives where like the freedom tech

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.720
is being promoted by people who don't,

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.840
it doesn't matter what their incentives are.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.360
I could care less if they were altruistic or not.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.520
And I think this is,

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.720
and you're gonna maybe see this even in the future.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.560
There's more things coming in Bitcoin down the pike.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.280
Lightning was enabled by an upgrade called SegWit, right?

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.520
Which took place a few years ago,

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.280
which was the culmination of the block size conflict.

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.440
There's another thing coming up

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.320
called cross-input signature aggregation,

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:15.440
which may, if it takes effect in the next few years,

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.280
it may compel exchanges

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.680
to collaboratively spend all their Bitcoin together

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.280
in a way that really protects our privacy

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.200
and fights surveillance.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.160
But they're not gonna do it for moral reasons.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.640
They're gonna do it because it's gonna save them money

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.240
and improve their bottom line.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.680
Can you speak to that kind of collaborative

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:31.840
so that you can have multiple parties

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.200
in a single transaction kind of thing?

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.400
Yeah, like you could do that today, absolutely.

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.160
It's called the coin join, for example.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.280
But right now it's more expensive to coin join in Bitcoin.

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.200
You have to pay a premium for your privacy.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:43.600
This would flip that on its head

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:46.200
and would basically say if you have one transaction,

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.520
hey, pile them all in, have as many parties as you want.

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.480
The more parties you get in,

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:51.720
the cheaper it's gonna be per party, okay?

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.600
And that's not possible in Bitcoin today,

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.040
but it might be in the future.

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:59.000
But again, the beauty in Bitcoin are these ways

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.600
that it just aligns human incentives

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:04.200
and it aligns our most base desires and needs

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:07.800
and realities with freedom and privacy.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.520
And that I've never seen before.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:12.120
And that's why I think it's so interesting.

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:15.240
So something that somebody like Eric Weiss

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.680
that actually spoke to this,

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.840
the idea of blockchain in general.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:24.800
From like a 10,000 foot view,

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.920
the blockchain is a centralized place

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:30.080
to keep the record of everything that ever happened.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:33.000
And does that concern you?

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.560
From a privacy perspective, from a control perspective,

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.880
even though it's managed, especially,

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.200
given the low frequency of transactions for Bitcoin,

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.640
you can have a lot of small computers across the globe

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.760
contain the entirety set of transactions,

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.320
all of those kinds of features.

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.600
Does that concern you that there's one place

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.480
where everything is made public

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.120
in terms of everything that ever happened?

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.200
No, and I'll give you two reasons.

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.000
Number one, the Bitcoin blockchain

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.160
is ultimately a settlement layer.

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.720
It's kind of like something like Fedwire

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:10.560
in the United States.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:13.840
It's a way for like institutions to settle with each other.

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:15.280
That's what I think it's gonna be like

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.200
in 20, 30 years from now.

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.880
The average person is never gonna touch

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.760
the Bitcoin blockchain probably.

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.480
They're gonna use things like lightning,

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.920
or unfortunately they may use Bitcoin banks,

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.320
but they'll either use custodians

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.520
or they'll use second layer non-custodial solutions

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:30.360
to interact.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.200
The main chain is gonna get very expensive.

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.920
It's gonna be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:37.800
or even more if the dollar starts to weaken

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:39.760
to make a transaction on the main chain.

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:43.200
And that will be reserved for like very large transactions

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:45.560
or transactions that need final, final settlement,

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.640
et cetera, et cetera.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And I think that that's fine and that's okay.

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:56.480
And it's very important that that ledger,

01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:00.320
that settlement layer be kept by thousands of people

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:01.280
around the world.

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.120
The Bitcoin blockchain is not centralized.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:04.720
It is decentralized.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.880
It is run by people like me who run a node at home.

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.200
I run a personal server.

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.760
I run the Bitcoin blockchain.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:10.600
No one else.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.480
You run it.

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:12.320
That person runs it.

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:13.440
There's no one in charge.

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:14.680
Well, you have a full node?

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:16.400
Yeah, I run a full node.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.240
It's great.

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.080
I mean, it's pretty easy, man.

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.200
You run it and that way you can be sovereign

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.960
over all of your usage, right?

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.720
And you can run it on a Raspberry Pi

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.000
with less than 150 bucks of equipment.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.600
And that's so important because again,

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.440
there is no Amazon web service vulnerability here.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.040
That is a problem and I agree with you.

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.360
We're trending in a bad direction.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.960
We're like the government could just turn off

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:37.800
a big important website or a new source.

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.160
Well, they can't turn off Bitcoin

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.280
because it doesn't live on AWS.

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.200
It lives with us.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.080
We are Bitcoin.

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.240
And I think that that's very, very powerful.

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:48.600
And then you can have something like a lightning network

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.240
where you can escape some of the constraints

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:53.840
of the blockchain depending on your needs

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:56.080
of the privacy and all those kinds of things.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.400
Everything's an engineering trade-off,

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.320
but yeah, you can trade off some of the assurances

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.400
of the base layer to go into lightning, for example.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.560
And there you can get more speed and more privacy

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.960
and the things that Bitcoin lacks,

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:09.120
speed and privacy, for example,

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.640
you can get on these second layers.

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.600
So there's all kinds of cool engineering things

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.520
that people are coming up with.

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:18.240
But I also would say anyone who says the blockchain,

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.720
that's a red flag for that person

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.440
doesn't really know what they're talking about.

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:25.120
Satoshi didn't use the blockchain in the white paper.

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:27.000
Blockchain was a marketing term

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.280
that people came up with later to try and do this thing

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.040
that was kind of like it peaked in 2015

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.240
and it continues to be an issue today

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:37.480
of it's blockchain, not Bitcoin.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:41.160
And that was like a very corporate kind of social attack

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:44.280
on Bitcoin to say we could take this like ledger part

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.280
of this radical thing that's for criminals

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:47.360
and all these bad people,

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.960
but we could take one part of it out

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.240
and we could bring it over here

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.920
and we could make it safe for everybody.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.800
The real McCoy's Bitcoin,

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:57.040
I mean, Satoshi referred to it as a time chain.

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.400
I mean, really what they're talking about

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.100
is just these like blocks that are connected

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:02.040
chronologically of transactions.

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.560
It's really not that exciting.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:06.800
The exciting part of Bitcoin is the proof of work,

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.480
where the transaction processing is done by mining

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.840
and by energy and by real world expenditures

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.480
instead of like some central ledger.

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:18.360
And when you remove the blockchain from Bitcoin,

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:22.600
it's not very, to me, it's just not that interesting.

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.440
I don't know.

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.720
To me, the blockchain and time chain, whatever,

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.960
philosophically, it's a pretty beautiful idea.

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.600
I mean, it's pretty simple,

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:32.560
but it's nevertheless as beautiful from a,

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.800
I'm a big database person.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:36.120
It's an interesting way to store information

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:39.240
that especially that's totally publicly accessible.

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:43.480
I know that to Bitcoin, proof of work

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.440
is the fundamental idea,

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:48.640
but to cryptocurrency and digital money in general

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.120
and to money, the blockchain

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.820
is a really interesting idea to me.

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:55.600
The way I think about it is it's kind of physics.

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:58.720
I like that there's a place that you can rely on

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.520
that's very difficult to mess with.

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:03.800
But it's not though, like it's outside of maybe Ethereum.

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:06.120
Every other blockchain is easy to mess with.

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.920
So you're saying that proof of work

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.720
is what makes it hard to mess with.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.960
Absolutely, proof of work is the key.

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:14.040
And Ethereum is about to leave proof of work.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.920
So it's about to go to proof of stake,

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.760
which is literally the existing system

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:19.640
where a small group of people

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:21.160
get to decide the monetary policy.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.840
Yeah, reputation has a lot of value there

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.840
and that you could be manipulated.

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:26.680
I may sound brutal,

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.960
but I'm coming at it from a political science perspective.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.800
For me, it's all about freedom versus dictatorship.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:33.840
And that's why I find it so compelling

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.960
that regardless of how much power or might

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.720
or how many armies you have,

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.840
you can't change the rules of Bitcoin.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:45.440
If you're wrong about Bitcoin, what would that look like?

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:50.440
What kind of thing that in 10, 20 years,

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:53.280
that you're not wrong.

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.680
Right, it doesn't pan out.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:57.040
It doesn't pan out, but other things

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.320
that actually make you feel good

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:01.160
about all the hard work you've done do pan out.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:04.440
Something you haven't expected, what might that be?

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:05.920
Well, as we've talked about,

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.720
my career started in human rights

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:09.240
and in promoting individual freedom

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.760
and fighting authoritarianism.

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.920
That fight will continue on,

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.200
no matter what happens with Bitcoin.

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:18.400
I think it would be a massive failure and a tragedy

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.560
if this project didn't work.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:21.400
The Bitcoin project?

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:22.880
Yes, if the Bitcoin project didn't work,

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:25.680
we would, honestly, it's one of the only things

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:28.000
that gives me hope because it is an effective way

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.600
to push back against creeping centralized control.

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:34.040
If for whatever reason, and I can't really see,

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.920
one of the reasons I'm so into it is I can't really see

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:37.360
how it's not gonna work.

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.240
Again, I think the Trojan horse allegory is too powerful.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.680
These big centralized actors are gonna be too greedy

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:45.960
and they're gonna want some as opposed to banning it.

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.840
It's way easier for them to buy it than to ban it.

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.280
I think that's just what's gonna happen.

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:51.720
But if for whatever reason it failed,

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:52.960
I would have very little hope left

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.240
because really, I mean, the Chinese model

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:58.640
of centralizing all of your data and controlling it,

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:02.440
I mean, ultimately is a very, very powerful

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:05.960
sort of like arch force and I would be concerned

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:09.280
that that would be all of our sort of destiny.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.880
I do have to sort of push back at a style of communication

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.840
and you're not doing it today.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.600
You're being exceptionally eloquent

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.280
and arguing these ideas.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:22.160
But me, especially just from studying history

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.320
and being very skeptical

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.160
from growing up in the Soviet Union,

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:29.680
I'm very skeptical and cautious

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:34.680
when I see a community of people being very sure of an idea.

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.360
It doesn't matter what that idea is.

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:40.040
And there's a huge amount of certainty around Bitcoin.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.520
Part of it is an important feature

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.480
because it's number go up.

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:47.440
So far.

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:50.600
Number go up is a really important part of the mechanism

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:55.600
to make sure that it grows and impact network effects

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.880
because I mean, it's really important to get excited

01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.160
about idea for a take hold.

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.360
That's the way human nature works and so on.

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:06.360
But I also get even something that you mentioned

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.000
that others may not, if you mentioned blockchain,

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:16.880
you're sensitive to the attacks that have been mounted

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.440
or the word blockchain have been used.

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:19.400
People have been fooled.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.160
I mean, and people in the humanitarian sector

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:23.200
have been fooled into thinking

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.840
that some centralized blockchain project

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.440
is gonna help some refugee, all collapsed.

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.960
There's a huge, it makes me sad

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.600
that there's a huge number of scams.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.280
Like, you know what makes me really sad?

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.480
And just a tiny little tangent.

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.040
There's been recently,

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.680
I guess with the growing platform or something,

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:41.920
there's been a bunch of fake Lex Fridman accounts.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.200
Yeah, you must have a million.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:47.320
But not only do they do stupid stuff,

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.480
but they've been messaging people.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:50.640
Oh, to get the Bitcoin and stuff like that.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.480
I'm licked in.

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:52.320
Totally.

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:55.000
And people write to me and they're saying like-

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.360
Tough man.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.880
I think it gets people.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:59.280
I think they click on stuff.

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.000
I think they were not sure.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.000
And it makes me think like people are gullible

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:11.080
or not gullible, but like they're just like I am,

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.840
which is they're like hopeful about the world.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:14.160
They're optimistic about the world.

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.000
You know what?

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:15.840
It's naive about the evil that's out there.

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.640
This is what goes wrong with Bitcoin.

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.480
And I've seen it.

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.080
People fall for these.

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:22.520
I mean, like in these different countries,

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:25.000
I'm trying to like talk to different people about Bitcoin.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
And like the amount of like MLM schemes, pyramid schemes,

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.200
Ponzi schemes, they're just so many of them.

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.320
And there's plenty here too.

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.880
But like in Zimbabwe, I was talking to this guy

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.320
who is a reporter who studies the effects

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:39.800
like the foreign currency exchange markets.

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.200
He's just saying one of the main reasons

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.800
people don't wanna get into Bitcoin

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.280
is because they've been scammed so hard

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:45.600
by all these other things.

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.800
So I would say that that's one way it could go wrong

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:51.800
is that like people just continue to be like afraid of it

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:54.400
because of things that are like that in the past.

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.440
Well, it's not just the volatility.

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:59.680
It's just the, you know, yeah, having-

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:00.760
If you think it's a pyramid scheme,

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.600
you're not gonna wanna get involved.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:05.440
And in some sense, if I were to speak

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:08.360
to the Bitcoin maximalist community,

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.360
is to maybe ease up on the certainty

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:13.040
because that gives me the signal that it's a scam,

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:13.880
to be honest.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.120
So whenever somebody,

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.320
whenever there's a lot of people being

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:23.120
cultishly excited about something,

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:24.680
I start being very skeptical.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:27.000
It's like, you know, I used to like Green Day

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.200
before they became really popular.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.200
And then the moment they became really popular,

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.200
I'm like, I don't know, he started wearing mascara

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.120
and he's like, I don't like them anymore.

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:40.120
So like I'm very skeptical about evangelists of an idea

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.040
because I think Bitcoin on its own

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.120
is just a powerful idea that stands.

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:46.320
But I also understand that in a world

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:50.560
of a lot of competing ideas where there's a lot of scams

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:53.120
and a lot of money to be made through those scams

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.880
that you have to be innovative in the kind of mechanisms

01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:00.800
you use to break through the scam, the ocean of scams.

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:05.240
I took this personality test and I'm a 99 skepticism.

01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:07.120
So I was first, sadly,

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:10.280
because I was first introduced to Bitcoin in 2013.

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:12.000
And I was like, ah, whatever.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.280
And it took me four years to actually get into it,

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.240
to go down the rat hole.

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:17.920
I didn't really start to grasp it

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:20.720
and start getting excited about it until 2017.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:24.880
So I was regrettably very, very skeptical for a long time.

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.600
And I just thought it was like, whatever.

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:30.240
So I appreciate that and you should be skeptical,

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.960
but ultimately you gotta believe in things like,

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.040
I believe in democracy, I believe it's good for people.

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:36.640
I believe it's better than tyranny.

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.560
I believe in the internet.

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.920
I know that we've had issues with centralization

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:41.800
of the internet, but I still believe it's better

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:44.480
to be connected than to have bridges between us.

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:45.520
And I believe in Bitcoin.

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:49.480
And to me, it's like a very similar progressive force

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:50.720
that we're encountering.

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.960
But yeah, be skeptical.

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:57.960
Nothing will befall you that's bad

01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.680
if you're like cautious and skeptical.

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:02.880
That's like a good mentality to have.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:05.280
One thing we haven't talked about,

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.960
all the violations of the human rights

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:11.760
that authoritarian regimes do,

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:15.280
there's a, not a positive,

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:18.680
but there is, you mentioned that nationalism is a drug.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:19.640
Yeah.

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:22.840
There's something beautiful about loving your country,

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:26.840
having pride in your country, loving the,

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:30.200
there's a feeling of belonging.

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:33.760
It could be country, it could be tribe, it could be family.

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.040
That's really powerful.

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.480
And that speaks to human nature as well.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:40.760
And that can sometimes overpower everything else.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.360
Patriotism. Patriotism.

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.200
Yeah.

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:47.040
And sometimes it can be seen when you study history,

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:51.920
when you look at Stalinist, the Soviet Union,

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:55.000
or you can even look at Hitler and Nazi Germany,

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.560
we tend to paint patriotism in a negative light.

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.640
And then maybe when we look at the United States,

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:01.840
but even here in the United States,

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:06.520
people often paint patriotism in a bad light.

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:10.160
Every time I say I love America as an immigrant,

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.200
I love this country.

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:15.120
It's funny how that's taken as a political statement

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:21.480
that people I guess on the right have been more active

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:22.840
in saying that they love the country

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:26.640
and people on the left have not,

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:28.760
sort of it's almost become a weird slogan

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:31.880
as opposed to a statement of just love.

01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:35.040
And I understand that patriotism can be a slippery slope

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:37.320
into letting your government,

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:38.800
I mean, it's exactly what you're saying,

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:42.320
the value of freedom of speech is you hold your government

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:45.280
to account for all the ways they mess up.

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.280
I mean, look, you have patriotism

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:47.520
and then you have jingoism, right?

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:49.840
It's very important and we stay on the patriotic side.

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.480
Like as an American, I'm very patriotic in terms of,

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:55.080
I love the values that this country was founded on

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:56.560
if you read the Bill of Rights.

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.360
And I love the fact that it was just flexible enough

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.560
that we were able to change it to grant,

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:03.320
or at least to try to grant all people the same rights.

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:05.200
It was not the original plan of the founders, right?

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.440
It had to be changed.

01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.800
But since then we've remained,

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:15.000
those laws have remained and they're very good.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.280
And I'm very proud of that.

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:19.440
What I'm not proud of is the jingoistic part of our country

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:21.600
where we invade other countries and bomb other countries.

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.440
I'm not proud of our prison system.

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:25.240
I think it's a huge stain on our nation.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:26.520
I'm not proud of a lot of things.

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:27.880
So I think you can be patriotic,

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:30.720
but you can be critical of your country.

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.720
And that's important.

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:34.280
I feel like the jingoistic thing

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:36.440
is the thing that we need to watch out for.

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.360
That's just my own personal take.

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:41.360
Out of all the projects

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.360
that the Human Rights Foundation works on,

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.520
what's the most important one to you right now?

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.960
Like what's been occupying your mind?

01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:50.120
Yeah, I just read, again, this New Yorker piece

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.840
that just came out that you should read.

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.240
It's called Ghost Walls.

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:57.400
And it's the story of how the Chinese Communist Party

01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.000
is committing genocide right now,

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.720
just like other regimes did and the Turks did

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.400
to the Armenians and the Nazis did to the Jews.

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:06.040
And it's happening again right now.

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:07.120
We said never again.

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.880
And that's just not true.

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:09.840
We're letting it happen.

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:12.080
And again, with the business stuff,

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:15.440
like Airbnb is like a sponsor of the Olympics.

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.280
What?

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:18.600
At the individual level, at a business level,

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.880
how does somebody like me, who's just one little aunt,

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:24.480
how does somebody like Elon Musk,

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:28.880
who is in charge of 10,000 ants, fight it?

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:31.960
How do we push back?

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:34.240
A great blueprint is the fight

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:36.040
against the South African apartheid.

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:39.160
So we did a few events down in Johannesburg

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.720
and I've had the pleasure of being able to go

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:43.680
to the apartheid museum several times.

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.320
And it really does a good job of chronicling

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:46.160
how they were able to do it.

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:47.920
It took a while, there's no doubt,

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.520
but the way it was done was good.

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:54.080
Peaceful action from abroad was very important.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.680
So there was like the Sullivan principles.

01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:58.960
So like you can peacefully protest

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:02.320
as a company, particular regimes.

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:05.520
And it's very effective and not just corporations,

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.160
but like the Olympics is a great example.

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.000
Like Chinese government should not be able

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:10.840
to host the Olympics.

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:12.080
The IOC should say no,

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:14.240
not until you close down those prison camps.

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.640
This is a perfect peaceful way to push back.

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:17.760
No one gets hurt.

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:20.520
Same thing when we had the Korean Olympics a few years ago,

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:21.760
North Korea should not have been allowed

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:24.760
any sort of symbolistic kind of hosting rights there.

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:26.480
They have prison camps, gulags

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:28.840
that we can see from outer space very clearly.

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:31.120
And their regime is the cruelest one

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.400
on the planet, probably.

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:34.120
Why were they able to sit and cheer

01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:37.400
and get to sort of co-host the Olympics?

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:38.400
This is spineless.

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.520
Like the IOC, the Olympics,

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:43.160
and major corporations should stand up,

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.760
especially in the cultural sector

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:46.080
where you don't lose anything.

01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:49.200
Like, you know, or you shouldn't have to lose anything.

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:50.360
So I think if we look at the way

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:54.560
that we forced the apartheid regime out,

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:57.480
this international solidarity of musicians, athletes,

01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:59.840
performers, celebrities is very, very powerful.

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:02.680
Unfortunately, today's celebrities are doing the opposite.

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:04.400
We just, you know, had this press release

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.160
go out yesterday about Aikon,

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:08.560
and he's off whitewashing the crimes

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.600
of the dictator of Uganda

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:13.520
and trying to build a future city there with him.

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:15.560
You know, if this was the 1980s,

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:18.160
Aikon would be raising his fist and saying,

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:20.200
we need to, you know, fight the apartheid regime.

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.680
How do we get back to that?

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:22.960
You know, we need to think about that.

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:25.480
We have to figure out how to harness celebrities,

01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:27.360
influencers, and companies,

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.040
and get them to actually stand up for something for once.

01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.480
I mean, that's something we've lost.

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:33.840
We've really had a spine against that.

01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.240
And, you know, we've lost it, you know?

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.280
And you lose things, you lose them forever.

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.360
Look at Tibet.

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.600
Tibet was a big cause for people in the 90s.

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:43.640
Used to go to colleges,

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:45.120
and kids would have the Tibetan flags

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.040
all over their dorm rooms.

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:49.560
It was like Radiohead would have Tibet on the stage,

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:52.600
and everybody wanted, you know, free Tibet was a big thing.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:53.440
Well, guess what?

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:55.280
Like, we lost it for some reason.

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:56.240
It's not a thing anymore,

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.480
and Tibet has been totally colonized, you know?

01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:02.160
So I think it's important that we find a way to unlock

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:05.160
an interest in the celebrity classes

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:08.240
among athletes, singers, presidents.

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:11.360
You know, we need to find a way to punish these people.

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:12.200
Yeah, it's surprising,

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:15.320
because we've become more and more connected

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:17.840
so we can communicate more effectively at a large scale,

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:22.560
and yet we seem to be worse and worse at real activism.

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:25.280
It seems like the outrage that's overtaken

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:28.000
the communication channels has been very US-focused,

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.040
and often more about outrage

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:34.280
and less about productive activism.

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:35.120
I'm very jaded.

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.680
I mean, it's very difficult to do these things

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:39.000
at scale effectively.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.880
I do not believe we will be successful

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:43.440
in boycotting the Chinese Olympics.

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.720
We weren't in 2008.

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:46.800
I don't think, and they're much more evil now,

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:49.360
and I don't think we're gonna be able to do it this time.

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:51.760
And again, to go back to the Bitcoin piece,

01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:54.120
that's why I'm very interested in this thing,

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.920
because it doesn't require my altruism.

01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:57.320
It doesn't require some famous singer

01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:00.480
or some corporation to sacrifice anything.

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:03.080
They're literally just gonna follow their own profits

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:04.680
seeking self-interested motives,

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.000
and they're gonna end up

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.600
making a stronger human rights tool for other people.

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:09.800
Freedom go up.

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:11.640
FGU, man.

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:15.200
Do you think we're, it's kind of a dark question,

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.840
but you think we're headed towards a war with China,

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:19.520
the United States versus China?

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:21.400
I hope not.

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:25.520
In the cyberspace and potentially even a hot war.

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.760
I think there's too many people with too much money

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:31.280
to be lost to go to a hot war on both sides,

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:32.920
but eventually we're just gonna,

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.080
someone's gonna have to stand up.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.720
I mean, the subjugation of Hong Kong

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:37.280
and the genocide of the Uyghurs

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:39.000
and the colonization of Tibet.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.760
I mean, Taiwan is the next big thing.

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:43.040
I mean, Xi Jinping has made it very clear.

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:46.000
Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong, Taiwan.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.640
So we're gonna have to stand up for Taiwan

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.880
for different reasons, both for moral reasons,

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:52.440
but also for semiconductor reasons.

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:54.520
We need TSMC to be on our side.

01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:56.880
We cannot have China take over TSMC.

01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:58.680
So there's different reasons

01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:01.120
why we're gonna have to protect Taiwan.

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.800
And you just hope it's not a hot war.

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.720
I mean, at this point.

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:07.440
Well, but also from inside the governments of China

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:08.280
and Russia as well,

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:10.840
but China, I guess is the powerhouse here,

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:13.600
is how do these governments get reformed?

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.720
Is there a hope for them to become democracies,

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:19.080
like true democracies, representative democracies

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:24.080
and sort of reform them to be ethical players

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:26.880
on the world stage?

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:28.640
No empire lasts forever.

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:31.160
And it's impossible to predict when these regimes fall.

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:33.400
I mean, no one thought the Soviet Union

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:34.560
was gonna fall when it fell.

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:37.080
Like if you study like the news

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:39.040
and the scholarship of the era,

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:42.120
no one knew that the Tunisian government was gonna fall

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:44.280
after Mohammed Bozizi lit himself on fire.

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:47.000
No one predicted that that would become

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.600
what we now know as the Arab Spring, right?

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.040
These things are impossible to predict.

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:54.080
And one day the Chinese regime will fall.

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:56.720
I just, we don't know when.

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:59.400
Yes, you know, but, and there's quite a few folks

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:02.600
who talk about the fall of the American empire.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.520
And it also concerns me

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:06.320
that we don't know when that might fall.

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:10.080
You assume me as a very excited, naive American,

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:12.000
I'm very excited by this project

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.680
that I think is the beacon of hope in the world still.

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:20.680
But that's probably how you feel before it's the end.

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:24.680
It's a-

01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:25.960
Yeah, the party, you wanna leave the party

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:28.480
before it starts to deteriorate.

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:31.080
I think America could continue to have

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:34.520
like a major, major leadership role for a long, long time.

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:36.080
I think certain things we do

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:37.680
will become maybe no longer possible

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:40.080
in terms of the way we intimidate people on the world stage

01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:43.640
and especially the way we use our currency as a weapon.

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:45.800
I think that that's going to decline over time

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:48.640
as we become more of a multipolar world.

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.760
But I do still believe in America

01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:52.400
and the values that we're founded on,

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:54.760
despite all the warts, I do believe in us.

01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:57.520
And I would prefer us absolutely to be

01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.880
the most prominent of the multipolar world,

01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:02.240
vis-a-vis a regime like Russia or China.

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.680
Absolutely, there's no question.

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:05.960
So we've been talking about states and nations,

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:09.000
but can we just briefly talk about Facebook and Twitter

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.720
and companies that have a huge impact on the world as well.

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:12.720
And actually one of the things

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:15.000
that make America a great nation is,

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.640
it is the place from which

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:18.880
these great companies have sprung up.

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:22.560
Is there, from a human rights perspective,

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:24.760
is there something that bothers you about Facebook,

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:26.280
about these large companies?

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:28.960
Is there something we need to fix,

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:33.480
something we need to be upset about,

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:38.480
fight back on, reform, do some sort of real activism about?

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:42.440
I'm very concerned about social media platforms

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:44.240
and companies.

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:45.080
It almost feels like we're losing

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:46.360
the golden age of the internet.

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:49.680
We could like go online and interact with each other

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:52.360
and share and not be worried about censorship.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.160
It feels like that was a golden age,

01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:56.880
like in the late 90s, the 2000s.

01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:59.720
And now everything is becoming very politicized.

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:02.080
And I'm not sure that there's a solution.

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:05.360
Like I don't think there's a button we can press to fix it.

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:08.960
I'm kind of afraid that this is sort of just what happens

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:12.640
when societies digitize.

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:16.120
Like, I think that certain opinions

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:19.760
just become demonized in the sort of,

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.360
in the room and then the social room

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.480
that we have on the internet.

01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:28.640
And I don't know if there's a magical solution there.

01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:31.600
I do know that there's technological solutions

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.840
that will allow us to continue to communicate

01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:37.400
and for creators to reach their audiences

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:38.800
without censorship.

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:41.040
And that's very exciting.

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:44.400
Like right now you could be de-platformed from your,

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:49.560
from like whether it's a Patreon or YouTube or whatever,

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:52.120
and your bank account can be closed down, right?

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:55.560
There are emerging ways that Adam Curry,

01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:57.280
like the Podfather and a bunch of other people

01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:58.760
are experimenting with,

01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:01.400
where you can essentially have your audio podcast

01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:04.920
across a whole bunch of different platforms.

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.920
So it's censorship resistant.

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:10.480
And then your audience can pay you over Lightning

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.560
in streaming money.

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:13.760
Like they can stream you money as they listen.

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:16.040
So you're removing the whole advertising piece.

01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:18.320
You don't need to do advertising anymore.

01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:23.320
You have this direct relationship with your audience.

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:27.240
And this is possible with something like Lightning

01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:30.360
where you can do streaming money that's censorship resistant.

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:31.440
And a lot of the people

01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:33.760
who are building a Lightning network,

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:35.560
for example, Elizabeth Stark,

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:37.680
who started Lightning Labs

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:40.920
and has done within her company,

01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.680
the people that work with her

01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:45.320
have built a huge part of the Lightning infrastructure.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:48.120
What animates her is this idea of like,

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.840
again, artists and creators being able to have

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:54.040
that direct ability to reach out

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:57.200
and have that peer-to-peer relationship with their audience.

01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:59.000
And I'm excited for that.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.760
And I do think that's coming,

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:04.720
but I am very worried that the golden age of like,

01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:08.560
centralized social media platforms is kind of behind us.

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.120
And I'm not sure how to fix that.

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:12.000
I don't know if that's like a fixable problem.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:12.840
Interesting.

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:15.640
I have a hope that it's a fixable problem.

01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:18.680
I think it's fixable because there's demand

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:19.560
for it to be fixed.

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:20.960
That's the way I think about it.

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.600
Well, is Twitter that bad right now?

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:23.600
Like, I mean, it's fixable

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.640
in as much as you can do a verification.

01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:27.600
So you can give a blue check to someone

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:29.680
and then that person is like more credible

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:31.600
and they go to the top of the comments

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:33.000
and there's like tweaks you can do.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.800
You can continue to improve it,

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:37.080
but it's not gonna fix the fact that like Twitter

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:39.520
can decide to kick off the president.

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.960
And like a lot of people are gonna be upset by that.

01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:45.240
Like there's ways you can improve the UX over time

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:46.760
and they continue to do so.

01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:50.520
Like Clubhouse is a lot of fun, great phenomenon.

01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:51.920
So is Twitter Spaces.

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:53.560
So they continue to iterate,

01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:56.280
but the censorship deplatforming piece,

01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:57.800
I'm not sure is fixable

01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:59.720
because I mean, you watch the U.S. government

01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:03.960
haul Zuckerberg and Dorsey and whatever

01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:07.120
in front of Congress, they want more censorship.

01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:11.600
I mean, our elected leaders want more censorship, right?

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:16.320
See, I just believe censorship is a really harsh word.

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.160
I believe it's possible to create technologies

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:20.800
where it's not Twitter doing the censorship,

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:24.840
but it's individuals doing their own selection

01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:26.840
of what they want and don't want to see.

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:30.200
So for example, if you get sick and tired of Donald Trump

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:33.120
and whatever he says, or you love Donald Trump,

01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:35.440
you get to select yourself.

01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:39.560
Like you get to have more control over what you consume.

01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:41.600
Twitter tries to do that a little bit,

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:46.600
but they obviously fail where ideas infiltrate our view

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:52.480
that like misinformation spreads really fast

01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:54.840
and conspiracy theories spread really fast

01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:57.760
to where the immune system that Twitter has created

01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:02.280
to try to censor conspiracy theories and misinformation

01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:07.280
is overfiring and you're now censoring too many people.

01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:11.880
So it's exactly the same intuition as you said before.

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:14.600
If the state is doing it, in this case,

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.520
Twitter is kind of the state

01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:18.560
that's not going to work out well.

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:20.920
But if you give power to the individuals

01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.120
to do this sort of the, not even censorship,

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:28.760
but incentivization and de-incentivization

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:33.760
of great thoughtful content and terrible low effort content,

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:38.840
then I feel like that's going to create a system

01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:41.400
where there's going to be a much more open discourse

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:44.240
of ideas, dangerous ideas, difficult ideas,

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:48.320
controversial ideas, and people in a decentralized way

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:50.440
will be able to use their own intelligence

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:53.440
to select content, to share content, spread content.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:55.480
Let's keep it simple.

01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:58.640
Let's look at one example, Twitter and Jack Dorsey.

01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:00.440
And I think it's quite clear

01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.840
that what he believes is the solution

01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:04.680
is as you're kind of hinting at

01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:09.080
a more kind of like regionalized system,

01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:12.480
which is not have one, we call federated system, right?

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:13.920
Which does not just have like one company

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:16.560
in charge of everything, but there's an open protocol

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.760
and then there's like different instances, right?

01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:21.880
So Twitter make, you know, Jack's dream for Twitter

01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:24.120
is that Twitter is this open protocol

01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:25.760
that the Russian government can use

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:26.920
and the Chinese government can use

01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:28.040
and the Iranian government can use

01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:29.120
and the American government can use

01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:31.520
and then Twitter as a company is going to use too.

01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:32.920
And you as the customer decide

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:35.000
which implementation you want to join.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.520
And there's going to be different censorship

01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:39.800
on each instance or each federation,

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:43.520
but the protocol itself would be like untouchable.

01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.960
This is kind of like the idea behind the internet, right?

01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:48.080
There's like different parts of the internet

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:51.000
that are censored, but like at the very bottom

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.120
of the very bottom of the backbone of it,

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:56.480
it's like this globally connected,

01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:58.840
relatively unstoppable thing, right?

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:00.440
So I think that's a pretty good vision

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:01.680
and Twitter's working towards that

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:04.120
with the Blue Sky initiative.

01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:06.520
We'll see, I'm a little skeptical that it like works out

01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:08.960
because I've used, I use Mastodon for example.

01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:13.200
Mastodon is an example of a federated social media.

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:15.240
Now it's ruled by a benevolent,

01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:17.800
each instance is ruled by a benevolent dictator.

01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:20.480
It's just like, I happen to like this one, so I know.

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:24.240
So rather than trust one dictator, Twitter,

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:27.040
you could choose which dictator you want to trust.

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:28.720
And that's kind of the federated model.

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:30.840
And maybe we head that way, but you lose things.

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:33.520
When it's federated, you lose the UX,

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:36.000
you lose the slickness and the feel

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.280
and all the millions of dollars

01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:38.760
that they spend on developers.

01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:41.080
Like Mastodon is like not anywhere close

01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:43.240
to as nice to use as Twitter.

01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:45.440
So I feel like it's, again, it's this trade-off

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.400
that we make with everything where it's convenience,

01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:50.040
comfort, speed versus privacy and freedom, right?

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:52.360
It's very hard to have something that gives you both.

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:53.200
I don't know.

01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:55.320
I think, yeah, it is a trade-off.

01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:56.560
Have you used one of these things that I feel is good?

01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:57.400
I have not.

01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:58.240
The federator?

01:40:58.240 --> 01:40:59.080
Not as good.

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:00.720
They're not, they're not, but the federator,

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:03.120
I don't think it's a good,

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:05.840
I think it requires genius, it requires skill,

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:08.680
it requires great design to come up with a way to,

01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:13.440
there's a Pareto front here.

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:15.880
There's a right way to hit that trade-off.

01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:19.720
And I honestly think there's the UX,

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:23.640
the experience should be centralized,

01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:26.200
should be designed by the company.

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:30.080
But the data and like a lot of stuff

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:33.120
that could be used to violate your basic rights

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:34.520
should be owned by the individual.

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:36.800
And I think there's a way to decouple those

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:38.960
that create an incredible experience

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:43.480
to where you go there and you enjoy the market

01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:46.160
where you can share your data

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:49.080
and have complete control over it and always have,

01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:52.240
there's a lot of basic UX ideas.

01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:55.840
Just as an example, I think there should always be

01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:00.360
in everything you design, a one button that's always there

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:03.760
that says, forget I ever existed.

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:06.440
Delete everything you know about me.

01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:10.600
And maybe it's one button you click and it asks,

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:11.600
are you sure?

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.600
And you have to be able to say yes.

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:15.560
That's a feature that's fundamental

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.640
to a good social network, I believe.

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.280
Currently social networks, first of all,

01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.400
most of them don't allow you to do that.

01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:25.840
They don't make it transparent how much data they had,

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.040
who they shared it with.

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.160
And they also make it exceptionally difficult

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:30.280
to delete accounts.

01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:33.040
So like that's a very basic starting point.

01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:38.040
But having that button means that you have control.

01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:39.880
But that's step one of the control.

01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:43.120
There's a transparency of knowing exactly when

01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:45.760
what data is being shared about you,

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:48.440
how much data is already being recorded about you.

01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:50.080
All that is transparency.

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:53.840
And I believe that's a really good business model.

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:56.080
Because when there's transparency and control,

01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:59.080
people would be willing to give over a lot more data

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:01.640
as long as they know what they're giving over,

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:03.840
as long as they know what they can delete.

01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:06.360
Yeah, I guess maybe you're more optimistic

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:07.680
about people caring.

01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:11.000
I feel like not so few people actually care

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.440
about their privacy and freedom.

01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:15.320
I've just watched everybody give it up, you know.

01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:16.560
But we'll see.

01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:18.800
I guess just to bookend that,

01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:20.120
I think we're at this moment where obviously

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:22.240
the centralized platforms are just so much easier

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:23.360
and better to use.

01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:27.000
And to strike it out and adventure out

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.720
and use a federated instance or something,

01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:33.040
even like Keybase, which is kind of like a cool encrypted way

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:37.760
to have group chats, it just requires a lot of your time.

01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:39.520
And a lot of people don't have that time.

01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:40.680
But I will say one thing,

01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:44.440
I do think there's this future where we do go into more

01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:49.440
of this, it's called a tribal model or like tribes,

01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:52.480
which is this social environment being built

01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:57.360
on top of lightning by an app called Sphinx.

01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:58.680
And the idea is like kind of like,

01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:00.120
it's like a decentralized Slack.

01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:02.080
Like you have your Slack instance,

01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:04.000
which has like a bunch of people in the community

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.400
and you have different ways to message each other

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:07.400
and it's all encrypted.

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:09.440
And then it has like plugins for like things

01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:11.120
like Jitsi instead of Zoom.

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:14.600
So like an open source encrypted video messenger.

01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:17.320
It has ways to like plug in the content you wanna get

01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:21.520
from like different platforms that you follow,

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:23.120
like podcasts, things like that.

01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:25.400
And again, it allows you to pay those people directly

01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:27.520
in a censorship resistant private way.

01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:29.640
So it's really nice to connect to the Lightning Network.

01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:31.320
Yeah, so it's all sort of built on lightning,

01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:33.640
but the idea you can think about it is like,

01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:36.840
you're slowly starting to build up the idea of a WeChat,

01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:38.520
but with freedom principles.

01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:40.720
Because right now WeChat is like the king of convenience

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:42.600
and comfort, but of course it's feeding all that data

01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:44.720
to the big brother and the surveillance state.

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:47.520
And then we have like our own versions over here in America

01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:50.120
that are not quite as convenient or amazing,

01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:53.360
but like we give up slightly less privacy and freedom.

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:55.880
But this thing has a lot of promising features to it.

01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:56.800
It's worth checking out.

01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:58.080
It's very like early days.

01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:00.360
Like it feels like, I mean, I was pretty young,

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:03.320
but it feels like the nineties in the internet.

01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:04.680
Like it has that feeling.

01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:05.520
A sphynx does.

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:07.640
Yeah, you know it's rough around the edges,

01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:08.920
but you can feel the magic.

01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:10.160
It's pretty cool.

01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:12.960
I'm very much like with Steve Jobs on this.

01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:16.120
I think the founding principles are exceptionally important,

01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:17.280
but at the end of the day,

01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:22.280
the design of how sleek it is, how easy it is to use.

01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:26.720
And that's not just like pretty icing on the cake.

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:30.120
That is, the icing is the cake.

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:33.000
Because like how easy it is to use, how natural it is.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.240
It's the Trojan horse thing.

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:37.880
Like you don't get, it has to be pretty and shiny.

01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:41.000
It has to fundamentally connect to the basics

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.360
of human nature, which is what is pleasant to use,

01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:45.480
what feels good to use.

01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:48.280
You have to, you know, to trick people into eating

01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:51.520
a broccoli, you have to put like a delicious whatever on it.

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:54.120
Well again, PGP is a kind of a pain to use, right?

01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:54.960
You want privacy.

01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:56.360
Yeah, so signals are an upgrade.

01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:57.200
It's way better.

01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:59.680
I mean, and it's way better than it was five years ago.

01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:02.640
And it's not quite as good as like,

01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:04.000
not quite as seamless, right?

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:07.400
It's like a WhatsApp yet, but it's almost there.

01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:08.840
And they were able to do it.

01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:12.760
And you're going to see that with Bitcoin wallets as well.

01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:14.160
I mean, they're almost there.

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:17.480
They're like, if you use like a moon wallet is like,

01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:19.520
I mean, it's so cool looking and it's so seamless.

01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:20.840
And they've spent so many hours

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:22.720
thinking about your experience.

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:23.800
We are getting there.

01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:25.840
Whereas 10 years ago, it was like impossible to use.

01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:27.600
One of the things that Signal doesn't have,

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:32.600
and I believe these kinds of applications need to have

01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:35.480
is like a, I hate the term, but killer app,

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:40.160
which is like a dumb, but very viral

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:42.680
and popular reason to switch.

01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:45.800
I didn't see exactly, I mean, I've been using Signal,

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:50.800
but I haven't seen a, you know, a big reason to switch.

01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:54.040
I mean, the reason-

01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:55.800
No, but I haven't switched everything to it.

01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:57.040
You know what I mean?

01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:00.240
Yeah, the exodus to Signal was in January.

01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:04.320
They had a huge user surge for two main reasons.

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.880
One hilariously enough, of course,

01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:09.320
was Elon tweeted like, you should use Signal, right?

01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:10.680
Which is not insignificant.

01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:13.600
And then the other one was that like WhatsApp changed

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.040
kind of some of its terms of service and like, you know,

01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:19.280
announced to all of its users in this little pop-up

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:20.480
that it was going to be sort of like changing

01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:21.720
the way it handled your data.

01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:23.080
That spooked a lot of people.

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:25.520
So these two things really combined

01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:28.720
and tens of millions of people in the following weeks

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:30.680
between January and February joined Signal.

01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:33.840
It's like, it really has had its day in the sun.

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:36.760
And they are like frantically trying to keep up with it.

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:39.040
Like, and it's really nice to see

01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:42.160
that this encrypted messaging service,

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:46.800
which prioritizes your privacy in a way that, you know,

01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:49.760
you know the government, again, may know like the metadata,

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:51.200
but doesn't know exactly what you're saying

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.080
unless they can get your hands on your phone.

01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:54.240
I think that's very, very powerful.

01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:55.640
So it can be done.

01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:57.520
I don't want to be too jaded here.

01:47:57.520 --> 01:47:58.480
I think it can be done.

01:47:58.480 --> 01:47:59.520
Yeah, I think so.

01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:01.120
I think we can fight back.

01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:02.480
And I think we can make,

01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:04.560
continue to make these digital communications tools

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:09.120
and platforms in a way that really benefits us.

01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:12.600
Yeah, I'm not sure, but I'm hopeful as well.

01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:16.840
I'm hopeful that if you look at the trend of technologies,

01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:19.560
they ultimately are ones that respect privacy,

01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:23.640
respect security and basic human rights.

01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:25.840
I mean, that's at least the hope.

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:28.480
So Garry Kasparov, I'm Russian.

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:30.880
He means a lot to me on a personal level.

01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:34.320
He is the chairman of Human Rights Foundation.

01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:37.000
What does Garry have to do with anything?

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.200
What's your relationship like with him?

01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:40.800
Do you like chess?

01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:45.040
What are his specific focuses and ideas around the HRF?

01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:47.360
Can you just speak to it in general?

01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:50.040
Yeah, so our chairman at the Human Rights Foundation

01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:53.960
was Vaslav Havel, who of course was like

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:56.200
the famous Czech democracy activist

01:48:57.120 --> 01:48:59.760
who, you know, helped lead the Velvet Revolution

01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:03.680
and then ended up becoming the first democratically elected

01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:07.920
leader of the Czech Republic after the Soviet Union fell.

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:10.400
He passed away in 2011.

01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:14.160
And it was very difficult to find a replacement

01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:16.400
because who can fill Havel's shoes, you know?

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:19.120
But if one could, it would be Garry, right?

01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:21.440
So we like really tried to get Garry to join

01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:22.600
and thankfully he agreed.

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:25.360
And we've had an amazing relationship with Garry

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.200
over the years.

01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:29.080
I mean, he's been relentless in his pursuit of freedom.

01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:31.280
He could have retired and taken his career

01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:32.400
in a different direction.

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.040
And he could be hanging out with Putin

01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:36.440
and have a pleasure yacht and all kinds of stuff.

01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.720
But he decided to risk it.

01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:41.320
And if you actually study like the times

01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:43.720
when he was running for president in Russia,

01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:46.200
Amasha Gessen followed him around in The Man Without a Face.

01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:48.320
It's a great, great book about Putin.

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:51.640
There's a fabulous chapter where she's following around Garry

01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:52.520
when he's campaigning.

01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:54.720
And I mean, he risked a lot.

01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:56.240
I mean, he can't go back to Russia anymore.

01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:58.080
He gave up his country.

01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:01.120
He's given up a huge amount to be able to speak his mind

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:03.880
and to have this dream, this beautiful vision

01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:05.240
of a free and democratic Russia.

01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:06.600
He really believes in it.

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:07.640
It's been a great experience.

01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:09.520
I work very closely with Garry.

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:11.080
We talk a lot.

01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:13.280
We do different things around the world together.

01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:15.480
He's come out to a lot of events

01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:18.040
in different cities around the world.

01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:19.560
And he's been a very active chairman.

01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:20.880
This isn't some figurehead.

01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:23.480
He's very involved and it's really, really great.

01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:26.760
I mean, everything he's involved with is,

01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:28.960
as one journalist who attends our event says,

01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:30.320
when he walks in the room,

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:33.640
the average IQ of the room goes up pretty significantly.

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:36.560
I'm not a big chess person, unfortunately,

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:38.320
so I have not been able to connect with him on that.

01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:40.520
But I think he probably would prefer it that way.

01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:43.440
All he gets is people who wanna talk to him about chess.

01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:46.080
So here we can talk about human rights strategy

01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:50.880
and how to improve our fight against dictators.

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:53.840
But he really has that moral clarity

01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:57.440
that I really appreciate.

01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:00.240
Yeah, so he has a lot of fascinating ideas

01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:02.200
about artificial intelligence as well.

01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:03.040
Absolutely.

01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:05.040
He's opened my eyes a little bit

01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:09.320
to the state of Russia today

01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:13.160
because I've read most books on Putin

01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:15.240
in the English language, in sort of,

01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:16.840
on trying to understand things.

01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:21.720
And I try to look at it from a historical perspective,

01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:24.720
almost like we're living 100 years from now,

01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:28.240
and I look at Putin as a important figure

01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:30.200
in the history of human civilization

01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:31.760
and study it in that way.

01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:34.640
I think the way Gary looks at it,

01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:37.480
he probably doesn't appreciate me looking at the way I do.

01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:40.360
But the way he looks at it is,

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:46.480
we can still change the direction of Russia.

01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:49.120
And we individual human beings and we communities

01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:52.040
and we nations can take actions,

01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:55.200
have policies that can change the direction of Russia.

01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:58.680
To me, I take a sort of going to the library,

01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:01.960
passive view of studying fascinating aspects of Russia.

01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:05.720
To me, Russia means like most of my family suffered

01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:06.920
through the Soviet Union,

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:09.680
and I see beauty in suffering,

01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:12.680
the poetry, the music, the stories.

01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:16.160
And just there's so much love that emerged from the pain

01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:18.680
that I just enjoy the music of that.

01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:23.520
But to Gary and to many activists that I speak to,

01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:28.520
to them, they love not just the Russia of the past.

01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:32.240
They have a vision and a hope for Russia of the future.

01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:35.080
And they criticize me a little bit

01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:38.080
for being a little bit too scholarly about the past

01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:39.120
and ignoring the future.

01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:40.880
And there's something to that.

01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:45.640
So he opens my eyes to look to the future of Russia.

01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:48.960
Gary and a handful of other Russian activists

01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:51.880
that we work closely with, including Vladimir Karamurza,

01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:54.160
who again, I mean, it's just incredibly heroic.

01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:56.600
The man has survived two poisonings by Putin.

01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:01.480
They like to say that Russians will bring democracy

01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:02.920
to Russia on their own terms.

01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:04.160
They don't need our help.

01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:07.040
This is what Vladimir especially says.

01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:08.640
But what he does say is that we should stop

01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:10.000
propping up Putin.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.440
Like that's kind of his stop kind of legitimizing him.

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:15.120
That's kind of his argument.

01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:17.480
He's like, we don't need your foreign interference.

01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:18.440
We don't need your ideas.

01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:19.760
We don't need your help.

01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:20.880
We can do it on our own,

01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:24.360
but please stop like propping up our illegitimate ruler.

01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:26.280
That's kind of like his point of view,

01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:30.360
which I think is interesting and fair.

01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:35.080
Yeah, let me just say on one unrelated comment.

01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:38.840
Some people criticize me and others like Joe Rogan

01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:40.680
for giving people a platform.

01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:43.160
I think in some cases that's applicable,

01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:48.160
but I think in most cases, knowledge is power.

01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:51.040
And there's no such thing as giving a platform.

01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:53.560
The conversation just shines a light

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:55.640
as long as you shine the light well.

01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:59.040
And as long as in shining the light

01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:00.480
and having the conversation,

01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:02.920
you reveal something fundamental

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:05.600
about the state of things, about the people,

01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:08.600
whether that's Putin or some of the other people

01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:09.800
whether that's Putin

01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:11.920
or some of the other controversial figures

01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:16.080
that have come up in possible future conversations.

01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:20.080
So I don't like this kind of platforming idea.

01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:24.240
I think conversations save us, they don't destroy us.

01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:26.560
Yeah, I mean, that's journalism though.

01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:29.400
I mean, that's very different from advocacy

01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:33.000
or strategic thinking about what to do with Russia.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.240
Absolutely, yeah, we should interview everybody

01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:37.920
and everybody should know exactly what they're thinking.

01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:41.120
Journalism to me has become a dirty word

01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:45.680
because it's done so poorly by so many people that,

01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:53.120
I listen to sometimes certain programs like, I don't know,

01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:56.960
like Meet the Press and the Fox Sunday program,

01:54:56.960 --> 01:54:59.080
just certain things just to tune in

01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:02.920
and see what different news medias are paying attention to.

01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:05.440
And the kind of interviews they do

01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:07.560
is like five minutes at most,

01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:09.040
but usually it's like one minute.

01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:13.320
It's these quick clip things and it's very gotcha.

01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:16.400
And they're looking for ways to sort of grab

01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:17.640
almost a misstatement.

01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:19.920
They wanna catch you off guard.

01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:23.880
They wanna ask the quote, like the harsh question,

01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:27.440
but without any of the dance of conversation

01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:29.120
that reveals the truth.

01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:33.680
You can't just get to the truth by asking it.

01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:36.400
You have to sneak up on it.

01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:38.840
And I think that's an art form.

01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:42.480
And I think that art form involves long form conversation.

01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:44.840
Like I'm a huge believer in just,

01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:46.440
I guess that's what's called, I don't know,

01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:48.040
in depth journal or whatever,

01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:51.200
like where you spend months or years on a story.

01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:52.040
Yeah, beautiful.

01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:54.400
In that same way, I think of long form conversation

01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:57.600
is like you spend many hours and you spend months

01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:59.560
and years preparing for those many hours,

01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:04.480
but like it's not this short form trying to get

01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:07.320
the most controversial little tidbit of a story out.

01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:10.760
And unfortunately, the funding mechanisms behind journalism

01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:14.160
are such that they are incentivized clickbait journalism

01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:18.720
versus like in-depth long form digging for the truth.

01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:20.400
I have a conflicted relationship with journalism

01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:23.040
because to me, press freedom is so core

01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:26.480
and independent journalists around the world are so brave,

01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:28.880
especially in countries like Russia or China, et cetera.

01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:32.560
And really good journalism is still something

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.880
absolutely I love and I enjoy.

01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:37.840
Like to say again, this New Yorker piece

01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:38.960
on what's happening to the Uyghurs

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:40.760
is incredibly well reported.

01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:43.080
However, on the other hand,

01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:46.840
you have this sort of clickbaity journalism

01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:48.320
that's all about sensationalism

01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:49.920
and that gets used as a tool.

01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:54.000
I mean, whether it be against things like privacy

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.000
or Bitcoin or whatever,

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.480
you have like people who sensationalize

01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:00.720
and it gets used in the service of the surveillance state,

01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:02.560
the war on terror, whatever.

01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:05.560
It's difficult, but I think journalism

01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:07.160
is essential to a free society,

01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:11.200
but it can sometimes be,

01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:13.560
it can wear my patience thin sometimes.

01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:16.160
It's been, to be honest, it's been a huge burden on me

01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:18.000
personally if I were to just turn this

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.200
into a therapy session for a brief moment.

01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:22.440
When I look at people, when I interact with people,

01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:24.960
I'd like to see the best in them.

01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:28.920
And the burden that weighs heavy on me

01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:33.920
is sometimes people I talk to may not be good people.

01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:36.680
And I don't, I'd love to,

01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:39.080
I believe everybody has good in them

01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:41.320
and I try to focus on that.

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:45.480
The burden that weighs on me is sometimes that

01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:48.720
there may be conversations where that's irresponsible,

01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:53.680
where I have to also call people out.

01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:55.560
I have to do enough of the hard lifting

01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:58.040
and the hard work of knowing exactly

01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:01.600
what are the bad things that that person has done.

01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:05.320
And I also have the responsibility to call them out on it.

01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:08.000
And that's for me personally, just an unpleasant feeling.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.160
That's where speaking to journalism,

01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:12.960
like I think journalists are too much focused

01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:16.920
on the bad things a person has done

01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:21.760
and not enough on the digging into the full complexity

01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:25.320
of the human being behind all the things that have been done.

01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:26.480
But at the same time,

01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:31.880
I can't have a conversation with Hitler and-

01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:33.720
Not ask about the prison camps.

01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:34.640
Yeah. Yeah.

01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:36.240
Yeah, no, so from the human rights perspective,

01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:37.880
one of our programs is we like,

01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:41.960
we try to go after people who do like PR for dictators.

01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:45.280
So like, and a lot of people do,

01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:46.600
like PR firms in Washington

01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:48.200
get hired by all these dictators

01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:51.720
and they make a lot of money to make them look good.

01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:53.840
It's called whitewashing or putting lipstick on a pig

01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:54.680
or whatever you wanna do.

01:58:54.680 --> 01:58:56.160
Astroturfing is like the fake,

01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:57.600
make like fake social media accounts

01:58:57.600 --> 01:58:59.920
to make it seem like you're popular.

01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:01.320
But whitewashing is a huge issue.

01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:05.800
So I think it's completely fair to interview

01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:07.560
like dictators and stuff like that.

01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:09.280
Amanpour does a pretty good job.

01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:10.720
She's really good.

01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:13.960
She makes sure that there's no messing around.

01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:16.560
I mean, her interviews of Museveni recently,

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:18.480
the Ugandan dictator was very good.

01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:19.320
I mean, she's basically like,

01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:22.680
well, why are you rigging another election?

01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:24.040
Please tell us, you know?

01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:26.000
And she's fearless and she's good.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.400
And that can be a helpful thing

01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:30.040
to have on YouTube as a resource.

01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:35.040
But it's quite clear when it descends into a PR session

01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:37.480
and you just have to be like very careful about it.

01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:41.560
Like Asma al-Assad, the wife of the butcher in Syria,

01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:43.520
you know, was like profiled by Vogue.

01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:45.600
And it was this whole rose in the desert things,

01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:49.040
a bunch of nonsense, terrible, terrible, terrible,

01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:50.360
total propaganda.

01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:55.000
But a like honest interview where you're asking

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:58.720
about all the tough questions, very important, you know?

01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:01.080
So I think it's just a matter of like content, right?

02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:03.880
Is there a good resource to study whitewashing?

02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:07.400
Like to know what manipulative PR looks like?

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:09.080
I think you just, you should know,

02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:10.920
if you've researched the topic,

02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:13.560
you should know it inside you because it would be,

02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:15.600
is there anything you're afraid to ask

02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:18.000
that would make sure you're asking all the questions?

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
As long as you're asking all the questions that you have,

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:20.960
you're good.

02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:23.240
But if there's something you're afraid to ask,

02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:25.880
then maybe you're self-censoring, right?

02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:26.720
That's a good way.

02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:29.400
It takes us back to that, like, what is it?

02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:31.760
That litmus test about,

02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:33.760
is your country allowed to have a gay pride parade?

02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:34.600
Yeah.

02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:38.760
So there's like obvious things that might be on your mind

02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:41.960
that you just want to ask and you shouldn't run from them.

02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:43.520
As long as you feel like you're a free person

02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:46.080
when you're interviewing, I think you're good.

02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:47.840
That's beautifully put.

02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:52.440
Are there books, technical fiction, philosophical,

02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:56.400
that had an impact on your life that you recommend?

02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:59.960
Or even resources like blogs, films?

02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:03.160
I have four books I'll briefly mention.

02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:05.720
Number one is The Fear.

02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:07.760
The Fear had a deep impact on me.

02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:09.480
The Fear was written by Peter Godwin.

02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:12.520
It's about the systematic dismantling of Zimbabwe

02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:15.160
under Robert Mugabe, Peter Zimbabwe.

02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:17.440
And it is a riveting book.

02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:18.640
I think everyone should read it

02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:21.520
because it helps you understand what it's like to go through,

02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:24.440
not just authoritarianism, but also hyperinflation.

02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:26.920
And I mean, really, you know, at the end of the day,

02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:30.280
what The Fear describes is how Mugabe took this country

02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:33.680
in the 1980s, and he actually brought it back in time

02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:37.120
to the 1920s in terms of infrastructure, literacy rates,

02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:38.520
health rates, all these things.

02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:40.480
He stole so much from the people.

02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:44.280
And it's a heartbreaking book, but it's a very important book.

02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:49.240
And it's a way to do excellent, excellent journalism.

02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:51.040
So The Fear is a good one.

02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:52.640
Isn't this a personal story?

02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:53.840
Absolutely, yeah.

02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:57.000
Because he was, it's part of his whole family story,

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.360
and he's in there, he's interviewing people personally.

02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:02.280
So I would say that one.

02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:04.480
Is it also connected, sorry to interrupt,

02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:06.360
is it, from the inflation perspective,

02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:09.880
is it a good study of hyperinflation and the effects?

02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:12.760
Does Bitcoin at all come as a...

02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:15.640
No.

02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:18.320
A discussion of money, does that come into the,

02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:20.560
or is it purely the experience of inflation

02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:22.360
as almost a symptom of an authoritarian government?

02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:23.440
A little bit, a little bit.

02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:24.440
I would say it's not deep.

02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:25.720
I have another book on that,

02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:26.760
which I'll recommend in a second,

02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:31.760
but I would just say that it's a very powerfully written book

02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:36.880
about how society can basically deteriorate,

02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:38.480
and how you can lose everything.

02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:41.280
The second book is, I just mentioned it,

02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:43.640
but The Man Without a Face by Masha Gessen.

02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:46.080
Incredible book about modern Russia and Putin.

02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:47.640
Just a masterpiece.

02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:48.480
So that one is-

02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:50.840
Could be one of your favorite books about Putin and Russia?

02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:51.800
That one's the best.

02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:54.040
I mean, she's just so fearless, incredible.

02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:56.760
She interviews Putin in the book at the end.

02:02:56.760 --> 02:02:57.600
It's really good.

02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:02.960
Third one is a fiction book called The Mandibles,

02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:04.800
written by Lionel Shriver.

02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:06.200
This one's good, it's a good gift book.

02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:08.000
It's funny, it's dark, it's witty,

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.040
but it's about the United States losing its status

02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:14.920
as the reserve currency and going into hyperinflation.

02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:17.000
And what's interesting is that the characters in the book

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.200
map where we are today.

02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:20.600
The book itself is about the late,

02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:22.480
I think it's the late 2020s,

02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:24.320
and we have a populist president

02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:26.800
who decides to announce that the United States

02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:28.920
is basically gonna default on its debts,

02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:31.960
and the rest of the world comes up with a new currency,

02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:33.440
and everybody switches to that one,

02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:36.000
and the dollar overnight becomes worthless.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.120
And all these economists are saying,

02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:41.600
no, it's fine, like inflation won't be a problem.

02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:44.680
And there's this one character who's like an economist,

02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:47.200
and he's basically, he gets to the point

02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:50.160
where he's living as a refugee in Prospect Park in Brooklyn,

02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:52.320
and he's still saying everything's fine.

02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:54.120
So it's like, it's dry, it's witty,

02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:57.000
but it's also about the surveillance state.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.320
It's about centralization of power.

02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:00.280
It's really good.

02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:03.680
So The Mandibles, I would highly recommend.

02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:06.640
So those three books, and then on the topic of Bitcoin,

02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:07.800
because we talked about it a lot,

02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:10.000
I would just say that my portal into Bitcoin

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:13.120
was The Internet of Money by Andreas Antonopoulos.

02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:13.960
Oh, wow.

02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:16.360
And I did it by audiobook,

02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:18.800
and I just think this is an important one

02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:20.280
for people to start with,

02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:23.280
because he goes through all the main concepts,

02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:27.200
whether it be proof of work or how the network functions,

02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:30.000
but he does it in a way that's extremely engaging

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:31.520
and really fascinating,

02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:34.480
and it really just kind of sparked my curiosity.

02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:37.160
Is it discussing the technical sides

02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:38.200
or also the philosophical?

02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:39.560
Because a lot of people mentioned sort of

02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:41.480
the Bitcoin standard is the philosophical

02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:43.560
entering into the whole Bitcoin world.

02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:44.880
Very different from the Bitcoin standard.

02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:47.680
It's more for like the average person.

02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:49.160
It's not a history book.

02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:50.400
It's a collection of his talks

02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:52.480
that he gave over like two or three years.

02:04:52.480 --> 02:04:54.120
It's not very technical.

02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:55.680
It's very approachable.

02:04:56.600 --> 02:04:57.880
And some of it might be dated now

02:04:57.880 --> 02:05:01.240
because it's like 2015, 2016, but I mean.

02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:03.400
It's great to hear a shout out for Andreas

02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:06.480
because he seems to be one of the seminal figures

02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:10.320
to sort of make Bitcoin ideas accessible.

02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:11.480
Oh, Andreas is the goat.

02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:12.600
He's the goat.

02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:13.520
Andreas is the goat.

02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:14.360
Andreas is the goat.

02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:15.560
I know a lot of people will have issues

02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:17.000
with some of his like more recent work,

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:18.480
but Andreas is the goat.

02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:19.880
I mean, he's the reason I'm in Bitcoin.

02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:21.120
I mean, he's the reason I'm in Bitcoin, so.

02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:23.040
Yeah, that's fascinating.

02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:27.840
And it's funny to watch the Bitcoin maximalist immune system

02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:30.320
also attacking him,

02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:33.640
and this whole feedback mechanism is working together.

02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:34.480
It's fascinating.

02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:36.480
I probably consider myself a maximalist,

02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:38.600
but I really like Andreas.

02:05:38.600 --> 02:05:40.240
So I think there's room for nuance.

02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:42.160
There's room for nuance in this world.

02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:43.880
I'm glad to hear that.

02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:46.360
If people are fascinated by your work,

02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:51.080
what is the way to get more of Alex?

02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:52.840
So two years ago,

02:05:52.840 --> 02:05:55.440
I came together with seven other people from around the world

02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:57.480
and we wrote a book in a book sprint.

02:05:57.480 --> 02:05:58.520
We lived in a house for four days.

02:05:58.520 --> 02:05:59.880
We wrote a book together.

02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:00.720
It was really cool.

02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:02.840
It was like a design sprint, but we did it in book format.

02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:07.600
And my co-authors are from Nigeria, Venezuela,

02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:10.840
the Philippines, from former Soviet Union, from all over.

02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:12.360
And it's called the Little Bitcoin Book.

02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:14.600
And I'm still proud of it.

02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:15.520
It's a hundred pages.

02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:16.640
It's something you give to somebody

02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:18.520
who knows nothing about the topic.

02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:20.000
And it's not a technical book.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:24.000
It's about the sort of social political aspect of it.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.320
Like, why is it important for you, for your finances,

02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:28.960
for your freedom, for your future?

02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:32.520
And we've translated it into like a lot of languages by now.

02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:35.520
I think English, Spanish and Portuguese are for sale

02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:38.400
and littlebitcoinbook.com, you know, you go buy it.

02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:43.400
But we've made it as a free PDF in Mandarin, Hindi, Punjab,

02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:47.840
Korean, Uighur, which I was really excited about,

02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:49.320
Arabic, Farsi.

02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:50.880
And I mean, it spreads, man.

02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:52.080
It's been really, really cool.

02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:53.240
So I'm proud of that.

02:06:54.520 --> 02:06:58.680
I also made a video that did very well for Reason Magazine

02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:00.560
called Why is Bitcoin Protecting Human Rights

02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:01.600
Around the World?

02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:03.960
It's five minutes and it just, I feel like I tried

02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:07.040
to boil everything that I want to tell you

02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:08.840
into this five minute video.

02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:11.440
So there's that, would recommend that.

02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:14.120
And then if you're interested in the

02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:17.440
why have governments not stopped it,

02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:18.920
which I think is really intriguing.

02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:22.240
I wrote this long essay in Quillette in February called,

02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:26.000
you know, why haven't governments banned Bitcoin?

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.680
And maybe that'll be a helpful guide to some folks.

02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:30.440
Is this speaking to the Trojan horse idea

02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:32.880
that there's something enticing about it?

02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:34.720
Yeah, at the end, it does get into that,

02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:36.280
but it really also just kind of goes through,

02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:38.960
technically, why is it hard to do a 51% attack?

02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:41.520
Like, why, like if a government wanted to,

02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:43.520
could it really get all that equipment?

02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:44.640
There's a semiconductor shortage.

02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:47.000
Like you can't, like there's like certain things

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.120
that stop governments from doing it, right?

02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:51.760
And same thing with like this idea of a 6102,

02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:56.760
which would be based on the idea of the executive order 6102,

02:07:56.880 --> 02:08:00.080
which is from 1933 when FDR made holding gold illegal

02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:01.040
in the United States.

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:03.280
The idea is that like banks would go around now

02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:05.600
with governments and try to like steal everybody's Bitcoin.

02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:08.400
Well, in Bitcoin, we have like a practice

02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:11.240
called proof of keys day every January 3rd,

02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:12.920
you know, which is coinciding with the launch

02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:14.160
of the Bitcoin blockchain,

02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:16.280
where we all like withdraw our keys from exchanges

02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:17.720
and we'd be sovereign users.

02:08:17.720 --> 02:08:20.280
What we are doing is we are preparing for a 6102 attack,

02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:22.240
which will one day probably come, right?

02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:25.720
So the essay just goes through all of the like possible

02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:28.520
attacks and it runs through like the ones that happened,

02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:29.760
like the Chinese and Indian governments,

02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:31.400
the two largest governments in the world,

02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:34.520
both tried to attack Bitcoin by banning their citizens

02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:36.360
from exchanging fiat for Bitcoin.

02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:37.200
It didn't work.

02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:38.440
Interest instead exploded.

02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:40.360
It's like the Barbra Streisand effect,

02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:44.800
where by making something public

02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:46.320
and saying you shouldn't do X,

02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:49.600
it actually increases attention about X a lot more, right?

02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:53.800
So I think there's a lot of interesting game theory there

02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:54.640
that people would enjoy.

02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:58.120
Do you think, are you seriously concerned

02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:01.920
about this kind of thing where the ideas of sovereignty

02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:05.960
that Bitcoin espouses would actually one day be tested?

02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:09.040
Do you have like a legitimate concern?

02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:12.200
Because you said like one day very well might.

02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:14.960
Do you think it might go down?

02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:17.000
Well, first of all, Bitcoin has been attacked,

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.360
again, many times.

02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:20.520
And we talk about the,

02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:23.080
you spoke about this with Nick Carter on your show,

02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:26.800
the sort of protocol wars or conflict or whatever, right?

02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:29.640
And Bitcoin almost died a whole bunch of times during that

02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:30.840
and ended up surviving.

02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:31.680
Oh, wow.

02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:32.800
I didn't know how bad the block side was.

02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:34.640
Oh, it got really bad.

02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:38.080
It was sort of a very existential threat

02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:39.680
and Bitcoin survived.

02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:42.520
And that's why I'm so intrigued by it,

02:09:42.520 --> 02:09:46.480
is that it basically survived an attack

02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:48.240
in an environment several years ago

02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:50.960
when Bitcoin was much more vulnerable than it is today.

02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:53.080
It survived an attack by a conglomeration

02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:56.000
of Chinese billionaires, Silicon Valley corporations

02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:59.400
and a ton of people who owned the majority of the hash rate

02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:00.960
in all of this infrastructure.

02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:03.000
They had 83% of all the hash rate

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.800
and they couldn't get what they wanted.

02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:06.120
And that was so intriguing to me.

02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:08.360
Like, why didn't it get killed?

02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:10.720
So as Nick said, I think you should read

02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:13.000
The Block Size War, which is a book

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.040
that you can get on Amazon by Jonathan Beer.

02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:16.720
Really good, kind of like,

02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:20.760
really important to understand the scaling conflict

02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:22.160
and the visions over,

02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:24.400
the different visions of what Bitcoin should be.

02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:25.960
And, you know, again, people like me believe

02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:26.960
it should be a freedom tool,

02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:29.840
not like a payments technology for retail.

02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:32.320
And I'm just, I'm glad it worked out the way it did

02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:34.160
because it almost didn't.

02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:38.360
Do you think human civilization will destroy itself?

02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:41.520
So if we think about all the threats

02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:44.400
facing human civilization,

02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:48.880
nuclear war, natural or engineer pandemics,

02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:51.960
you know, we talk about human rights violations.

02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:55.360
We talk about authoritarian governments

02:10:56.520 --> 02:10:58.560
taking control of the money supply.

02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:01.160
But do you have grander concerns

02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:03.000
for the future of human civilization?

02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:07.880
Do you have hope for us becoming a multi-planetary species?

02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:09.800
Yeah, I mean, I guess long-term,

02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:11.600
we'd want to decentralize, right?

02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:13.160
We don't want a single point of failure.

02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:14.000
In the physical space.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.560
The earth is a single point of failure.

02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:18.600
But no, I mean, you look at all this kind of like

02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:21.040
space fiction and, I mean,

02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:22.440
who would want to live on Mars, man?

02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:23.720
It's like a freaking desert.

02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:24.920
I mean, the earth is so beautiful.

02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:27.040
I hope we can save it, you know?

02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:28.480
It's just so gorgeous.

02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:30.120
When you look at the earth compared to any other

02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:32.560
like exoplanet or whatever you look at it,

02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:34.360
I mean, the earth is so spectacular

02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:36.200
and wondrous and singular.

02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:39.560
I think we've got to do everything we can to save it here.

02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:40.400
That's funny.

02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:43.680
I mean, I'm sure a lot of people would have said that

02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:48.400
about Europe before the explorers ventured out.

02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:51.480
Columbus and the rest out into the unknown.

02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:54.560
The thing about human nature is that we are explorers too.

02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:55.400
We are, I agree.

02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:58.440
Some small fraction of us are insane enough

02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:01.840
to explore in the most dangerous grounds.

02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:03.800
And I'm pretty sure there's quite a few people

02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:06.800
that would love to take the first step on Mars,

02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:08.600
the first few steps on Mars,

02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:10.400
in the harshest of environments,

02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:14.000
even when the odds of survival are extremely low.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:15.840
And I'm thankful for those people

02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:19.800
because I sit back and drink my vodka back here on earth

02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:21.600
and enjoy good friendships

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:25.640
because I think ultimately that step to Mars

02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:29.920
is going to be a first step into a multi,

02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:33.960
into exploring and colonizing the rest of the galaxy.

02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:36.000
Mars might be a harsh environment,

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:41.000
but maybe space is not like other planets,

02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:44.400
other exoplanets, but also forget planets,

02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:48.240
just creating colonies that flow about in space.

02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:50.720
There's exciting technologies that are yet to be discovered,

02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:52.720
yet to be engineered and built

02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:55.160
that I think require that first painful step.

02:12:56.560 --> 02:12:59.040
Yeah, the journey of a thousand miles starts with one step.

02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:00.720
I think Mars is that first step.

02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:04.320
Yeah, no, I was born the day before the Challenger blew up

02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:07.560
and it was always so tragic for me to look back on that

02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:10.080
because that really altered our arc

02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:11.560
in terms of space exploration.

02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:14.040
If that had not happened, we'd be on a very different arc.

02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:17.520
I do respect and admire people pushing for exploration,

02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:20.360
but at the same time, I just want to recognize

02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:23.120
we know how unique earth is

02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:27.760
and I do think we got to do everything we can to protect it.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.640
But I think you've already answered the question

02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:33.920
if we're going to destroy ourselves.

02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:35.880
Oh, yeah, I guess.

02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:37.520
Are you hopeful?

02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:38.360
Okay, fine.

02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:40.480
If we do not decentralize properly

02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:45.680
out into different physical spaces, probably, I guess, yeah.

02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:49.160
I mean, do you have concerns that are immediately facing you?

02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:53.840
So not in terms of the injustices on the world,

02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:55.160
but nuclear war?

02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:57.160
Yeah, look, I'm a lot more concerned

02:13:57.160 --> 02:13:59.480
about what's happening right now.

02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:01.720
What is destroying ourselves?

02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:04.560
If you were to go and see what's happening in Xinjiang

02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:07.440
or North Korea right now or Eritrea,

02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:10.320
that is destroying ourselves and it's already happened.

02:14:11.080 --> 02:14:13.160
That's why I said yes.

02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:14.800
I mean, if you don't decentralize

02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:18.400
and power is completely under one person,

02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:20.720
life is destroyed as we know it.

02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:24.240
And you don't have to go into science fiction

02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:28.200
to know what a totalitarian hellscape dystopia is.

02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:29.760
There's several that exist already

02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:33.080
and let's try to help those people

02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:36.200
at the same time as we're trying to push out into space

02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:38.080
would be my counter, I guess.

02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:39.200
Yeah, I agree with you.

02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:41.280
In my mind, just sort of destruction

02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:43.160
and suffering are next door neighbors.

02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:46.200
So we don't need to destroy all of human civilization

02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:50.320
if a large fraction of it lives in conditions

02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:51.760
that we would equate to suffering.

02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:54.120
That's not a good world.

02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:58.120
Is there advice that you would give

02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:01.320
to young people today about life, about career,

02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:05.080
about how they can help a world where 53%

02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:09.360
are living under authoritarian governments,

02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:12.320
but in general, a world that's full of injustice,

02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:13.960
but also full of opportunity?

02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:17.040
Just thinking about my own upbringing.

02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:18.560
I went to a public school here

02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:21.440
and we never learned about money.

02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:23.240
It was never part of our curriculum.

02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:27.760
Even personal finances was not part of our curriculum.

02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:29.000
You could take like an optional course

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.880
to learn about like business or something.

02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:34.400
And I think that that would be really valuable

02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:37.120
as a young person or as a teenager

02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:40.680
to start incorporating into your children's lives

02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:43.120
is like a curiosity about what is money.

02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:44.520
I think it would be very healthy

02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:47.360
regardless of what path that takes them down

02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:48.960
because we don't think about it enough

02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:51.400
either from an administrative sort of personal finance thing

02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:55.680
about like responsibility or more fundamentally,

02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:58.800
like what is it and who creates it, where did it come from?

02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:00.200
Both of those things are very important.

02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:02.800
So my advice to a young person would be to get

02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:04.600
to the point where you feel like you can

02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:06.360
answer the question, what is money?

02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:10.040
So you ultimately see money as a kind of power

02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:13.560
and freedom and a mechanism of self-sufficiency.

02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:15.400
It is so core to everything.

02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:17.800
The United States, whether you wanna call it

02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:20.880
the Pax Americana, the empire, the hyper power,

02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:22.840
whatever you wanna call this moment in time

02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:24.240
where the U.S. is dominant around the world,

02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:26.680
it is because of the fact that we have

02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:30.640
this petrodollar system where we are able to force

02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:33.200
the Saudis and other oil producing nations

02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:36.120
to sell their oil in dollars.

02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:39.920
That is really inescapable, inseparable from our power.

02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:42.240
And that's very rarely talked about.

02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:44.040
And it's very important to understand.

02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:46.200
So yeah, if young people could start thinking

02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:48.040
about that stuff, it'd be good.

02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:50.320
I remember being, it sounds silly to say,

02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:52.800
but I remember being really uncomfortable

02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:57.360
that I was dependent on my parents at a young age

02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:58.800
for like financial.

02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:01.440
You need to be 18 to have a bank account or whatever.

02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:03.440
One of the people that we supported at Ahrefs

02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:05.560
through our, we do software development funding

02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:07.800
for people in Bitcoin, open source projects.

02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:10.840
And one of the guys we funded is this very young,

02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:11.840
smart sort of prodigy.

02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:13.280
He's like 17.

02:17:13.280 --> 02:17:14.600
But one of the reasons he got into Bitcoin

02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:16.600
was because he wanted to have control of his money

02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:18.080
when he was like 14.

02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:21.400
I mean, if you think in history, people who invented

02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:24.680
all kinds of incredible contributions to science or math.

02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:27.440
I mean, a lot of them did it before they were 15.

02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:30.480
So think about that maturity that is capable

02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:31.560
and possible in many people.

02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:34.320
Like I've participated in some of the years ago,

02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:36.840
some of the sort of selection processes

02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:38.960
for like the Teal Fellowship, which is like really amazing.

02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:41.280
Like these people who are 14, 15, 16,

02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:42.240
who don't need to go to college.

02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:44.360
They're already like so smart, they can figure it out,

02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:46.320
but they wouldn't be allowed to have a bank account, right?

02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:48.440
So, hey, that's kind of cool.

02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:50.280
Like now you have a permissionless money.

02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:51.400
You can open up yourself

02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:53.200
without permission from your parents.

02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:54.040
That's kind of cool.

02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:55.200
Yeah, that's fascinating to me.

02:17:55.200 --> 02:18:00.200
I feel like I would have loved my parents more.

02:18:01.440 --> 02:18:03.040
If you had a little more separation.

02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:06.200
If I had freedom to fully realize myself

02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:08.840
because I felt like I was a little bit trapped by,

02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:11.560
I don't know, it's not explicit, right?

02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:15.480
It's a little bit, it's like a subtle push

02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:17.480
that you're somehow dependent on them.

02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:19.080
I mean, part of that is like,

02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:22.160
I think it actually very much has to do

02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:23.200
not talking about money.

02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:24.880
Like what does it take to operate?

02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:26.600
It's an individual entity in this world.

02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:28.880
Like knowing that when you're 10 years old,

02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:31.000
knowing that when you're very young,

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:36.000
so that you've, then you see how amazing it is

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:40.120
to have the support of your parents until you're 18.

02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:41.560
Like have that freedom.

02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:47.320
Have the freedom to appreciate the value parents bring.

02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:51.600
And at the same time, the freedom to leave

02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:56.120
in some capacity to carve your own path.

02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:57.640
I mean, like just all of that,

02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:00.160
I think for weirdos like me, especially,

02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:03.000
because I was a very non-traditional path

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:06.160
that I think it would be very empowering

02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:08.000
and certainly it would be empowering in the third world.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:09.120
Not just weirdos like you.

02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:11.800
Yeah, I was gonna mention one of the people I got

02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:14.640
who taught me about Bitcoin, her name is Roya Mapoob.

02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:17.240
She's an Afghan technology CEO.

02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:20.760
And in 2013, she started paying her employees in Bitcoin

02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:23.800
because they were not allowed to open bank accounts.

02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:24.760
The women that worked for her,

02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:27.120
she started the country's first female,

02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:29.240
like all female software company.

02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:31.440
And if they brought cash home,

02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:33.000
their like husbands or uncles or brothers

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:33.840
would steal it from them.

02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:36.880
There's like a power patriarchal dominance thing going on.

02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:40.240
But they had phones and she was able to pay them in Bitcoin

02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:42.680
and no one knew and it gave them that power.

02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:44.320
And that's always stuck in my mind

02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:47.320
as a very interesting effect of this kind of thing,

02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:48.320
of permissionless money,

02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:50.360
like that it can be an empowerment tool.

02:19:50.880 --> 02:19:52.080
So absolutely.

02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:53.840
So in your own personal life,

02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:58.560
where did the deep concern

02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:02.240
for the suffering in the world come from?

02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:03.720
Where was that born?

02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:07.040
I was gonna be an engineer actually.

02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:09.440
And then in 2003, we invaded Iraq

02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:12.640
and I got very interested in why we did that as a nation.

02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:15.240
And I switched to my focus of study

02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:17.000
to like international relations.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.120
And that's how I kind of went down

02:20:19.120 --> 02:20:22.120
the kind of political science, democracy, rabbit hole

02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:24.840
and ended up getting a job at the Human Rights Foundation.

02:20:24.840 --> 02:20:28.520
So I'm a very much a child of like 9-11 and the Iraq war.

02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:32.440
Those are the two really formative events for me personally.

02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:33.720
Can you break that apart a little bit?

02:20:33.720 --> 02:20:37.160
Like what illusion about this world was

02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:43.160
broken apart by the invasion of Iraq?

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:45.080
Well, I think first of all,

02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:48.120
9-11 just shifted the world dynamics completely

02:20:48.120 --> 02:20:50.840
from a focus on big power politics

02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:52.240
between the US, Russia and China

02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:55.000
to this new threat of Islamic terror.

02:20:56.200 --> 02:20:58.320
And a lot of it, we learned later,

02:20:58.320 --> 02:21:00.920
a lot of the things we did were manufactured, choreographed.

02:21:00.920 --> 02:21:03.320
Like there were no WMDs in Iraq.

02:21:03.320 --> 02:21:05.600
Like the reason our rulers said we needed to invade

02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:07.680
and destroy this country was a lie.

02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:10.760
And that I think has really been forgotten.

02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:13.400
Like I think a lot of like the Zoomers like today

02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:15.640
don't really know a lot about that time period.

02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:16.880
I mean, it was pretty crazy.

02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:20.160
Unanimously, I mean, Democrat, Republican,

02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:23.840
like Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and the Republicans,

02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:25.640
everybody wanted to invade this country.

02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:30.000
And it's a confusing time.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.600
There's a really good book by Ian McEwen called Saturday,

02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:35.760
a fiction book that takes place during I think 2003.

02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:39.120
And it's One Day in the Life of the Doctor in London.

02:21:39.120 --> 02:21:41.200
It's really good though to revisit this time

02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:44.760
because he has characters in the book,

02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:46.040
one of whom is very pro-war

02:21:46.040 --> 02:21:47.640
and one of them is very against war.

02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:49.920
Basically he, the father himself is pro-war

02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:51.000
and his son is against it.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.040
And they have all these debates.

02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:53.560
And it's nice to go back to revisit

02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:55.880
but that time was, it's really crazy.

02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:58.520
And it really showed you that like the media

02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:01.720
could be captured into like helping promote this idea

02:22:01.720 --> 02:22:03.760
of like invading another country.

02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:05.920
So I was very curious about why we did it

02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:07.720
and like who was pulling the strings

02:22:07.720 --> 02:22:09.800
and what are the reasons that we went.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.200
And what's really interesting is that like

02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:13.400
I took all these courses on it,

02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:15.760
interviewed all these decision makers,

02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:17.600
whether they were like neocons or whatever,

02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:19.320
different people who were involved.

02:22:19.320 --> 02:22:22.480
And the whole like dollar reserve currency thing

02:22:22.480 --> 02:22:24.400
like really never came up until like,

02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:26.640
I learned about it more recently because of Bitcoin.

02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:28.480
Like, and today when I look back,

02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:31.000
it seems kind of obvious that the reason we invaded Iraq

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:35.080
was because Saddam Hussein wanted to sell oil in euros.

02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:36.640
It seems really obvious when you go back

02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:38.480
and look at the chronology of it.

02:22:38.840 --> 02:22:40.280
And we were like, no, we actually don't want you

02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:41.760
to sell dollars in euros

02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:43.440
because that would threaten the dollar.

02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:45.280
So we're gonna invade you and then you're not gonna do it

02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:47.360
and then no one else is gonna like sell dollars in euros,

02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:49.000
you know, oil in euros, right?

02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:51.680
I guess you could say the same thing about Gaddafi

02:22:51.680 --> 02:22:55.680
but we as a nation have very much protected

02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:57.680
our reserve currency, let's put it that way.

02:22:57.680 --> 02:22:58.840
Yeah, actually one of the things

02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:01.040
that Bitcoin community has motivated me to do

02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:04.640
is to look back to the histories that I have studied myself

02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:07.200
from just even the two world wars,

02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:08.840
the history of the 20th century

02:23:08.840 --> 02:23:13.120
from a perspective of the monetary system of money.

02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:14.560
And it's interesting.

02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:16.320
It's interesting to look at human history

02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:17.440
in the context of money.

02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:19.880
Can't we be patriotic and be pro-America

02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:21.800
but like not want the petrodollar?

02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:23.960
Like I should be proud of my country.

02:23:23.960 --> 02:23:26.080
Why do we need to be propping up the Saudis?

02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:29.520
Why do we need to be threatening to invade other countries

02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:31.600
if they sell their oil for a different currency?

02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:33.760
I think we can be just as powerful as we are today

02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:36.000
if not more powerful in a Bitcoin world.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.200
If you think about the infrastructure Americans are building,

02:23:38.200 --> 02:23:40.520
all the innovations we're building, all the wealth we have,

02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:42.800
I think we'll be fine, better than fine.

02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:45.720
And we won't have these horrible negative externalities.

02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:49.760
It's really an optimistic vision for the future.

02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:51.840
I thought we learned the lesson of 9-11

02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:54.400
and the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan.

02:23:56.440 --> 02:23:57.280
But maybe-

02:23:57.280 --> 02:23:59.520
You know, Biden announced we're leaving Afghanistan

02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:02.360
this year, 20 years, for what?

02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:03.720
Taliban are gonna take over again.

02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:06.120
Well, I mean, that's like at least the good,

02:24:06.120 --> 02:24:08.320
the longest war, right?

02:24:08.320 --> 02:24:09.680
The forever wars.

02:24:09.680 --> 02:24:12.000
I feel like the past 20 years or whatever,

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:15.560
it is 18 years, 19 years,

02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:19.880
we've been very skeptical about invading other countries.

02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:25.600
We've been skeptical about military intervention

02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:26.760
in other nations.

02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:30.320
Well, our leaders certainly haven't.

02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:32.800
We have like seven active wars right now.

02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:34.960
The Russians and the Chinese,

02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:37.920
everybody's starting to invade everybody else.

02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:40.080
I mean, so yes, but I meant to a degree

02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:41.160
that I was worried about,

02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:44.480
like conflicts with, hot conflicts with Iran,

02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:47.760
with North Korea, those kinds of things,

02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:52.280
that there was not as much war mongering

02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:54.520
as I was afraid about.

02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:55.920
But yes, you're absolutely right.

02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:59.440
We're still, there's a big presence by the United States

02:24:59.440 --> 02:25:02.000
and other nations and across the world

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.840
that's military, the military industrial complex

02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:09.840
is a thing that has huge detrimental ripple effects

02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:14.200
throughout the entirety of our governments.

02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:17.040
Yeah, so the big question is how do we prevent the rise

02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:22.040
of this like authoritarian surveillance state in China

02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:24.840
while at the same time kind of diffusing

02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:27.040
the military industrial complex on our side?

02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:29.840
That to me is like the biggest challenge of our time.

02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:32.480
I don't have the answer, but we should keep digging.

02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:36.680
Yeah, I believe there's technological innovations.

02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:38.120
You're suggesting that perhaps

02:25:38.120 --> 02:25:41.080
one of the technological innovations like is Bitcoin.

02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:42.280
Bitcoin's a big part of it, yeah.

02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:44.640
On the money side, I think the information side,

02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:48.360
there's innovations that are open, that's possible.

02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:51.560
And the political side, I'm the most skeptical about.

02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:54.440
I just feel like there's without hot wars

02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:57.400
that we don't seem to make any kind of progress.

02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:01.200
Bureaucracies just grow, corruption and greed grow,

02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:05.800
and human nature does not do well in the political arena.

02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:09.520
So I hope technology can outpace

02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:11.200
the darker sides of human nature.

02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:14.840
So you're busy fighting the demons,

02:26:14.840 --> 02:26:16.200
the darkness that's out there,

02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:19.080
but looking in the mirror, you're a finite being.

02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:22.160
Unfortunately, this ride ends for you pretty soon.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Do you ever ask yourself about the meaning of it all,

02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:32.440
of why the hell us descendants of apes

02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:34.080
are even on this thing,

02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:36.800
striving so hard to make a better world for ourselves?

02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:41.720
I don't often zoom out that much.

02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:44.640
I feel like my day job is pretty interesting.

02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:46.000
It keeps me very engaged

02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:49.600
with all the stuff we've been talking about.

02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:53.840
As far as the meaning of life though,

02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:58.840
it seems quite clear that we do have the possibility

02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:03.320
as a species to create these beautiful communities

02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:06.400
and constructs and to share an exploration

02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:07.760
of the world together.

02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:13.720
That is often marred by cold realities that we've discussed,

02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:19.000
but I do feel like in a way that the meaning of life

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:22.880
is that pursuit of course biologically

02:27:22.880 --> 02:27:25.280
is to spread our species, right?

02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:30.080
But also to pursue knowledge and science and innovation

02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:32.960
and freedom most importantly.

02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:35.280
I mean, I think it freedom has to guide us

02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:37.800
or else we end up with prison camps.

02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:39.360
If we don't let freedom guide us,

02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:40.880
we end up with the prison camps.

02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:43.560
So we need to have scientific innovation and adventurism

02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:45.920
and colonization of the stars,

02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:48.520
but without the slavery and without the prison camps.

02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:50.080
I think that's so key.

02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:53.320
There's something about the creation of beauty

02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:55.120
that seems fundamental to human nature.

02:27:55.120 --> 02:27:59.320
And what seems beautiful is these communities

02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:05.360
that don't have suffering, they don't have injustice.

02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:09.600
And we have some kind of inner sense of what is injustice.

02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:11.120
I don't know, like some of the human rights

02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:12.680
that you've mentioned earlier,

02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:16.760
they're just philosophical constructs,

02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:19.920
but there also seem to be some more deeply in us too.

02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:24.280
We have a sense of what is right and what is wrong.

02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:28.040
It's not just a kind of illusion that we've all agreed on.

02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:31.600
Arbitrary power, torture, executions.

02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:32.800
We know these things are wrong.

02:28:32.800 --> 02:28:34.440
I mean, we know they're wrong.

02:28:34.440 --> 02:28:36.600
We don't have to read a book to know that.

02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:41.880
But you do need to, people can get brainwashed.

02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:44.400
I mean, you talk to people who've grown up in North Korea,

02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:45.880
they don't know any better.

02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:48.600
They don't know what's going on in the outside world.

02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:51.120
So they've never experienced anything differently.

02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:54.960
So that's why, look, technology can play a big role here

02:28:54.960 --> 02:28:56.400
in terms of like the meaning of it all.

02:28:56.400 --> 02:28:59.200
Like it can really help emancipate, liberate people,

02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:01.320
at least so that they can make their own choices

02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:02.480
about what to do,

02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:04.280
at least so that we're on a level playing field.

02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:07.200
So technologies like the internet and Bitcoin,

02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:09.840
they can at least like give you the option

02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:12.560
to do things your own way on your own terms.

02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:15.600
And then from there, we'll see.

02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:19.080
I think it's important that we have design choices

02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:22.920
where we can like have a little more say

02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:26.280
and that not everything be pre-programmed for us.

02:29:26.280 --> 02:29:28.320
That would be very disappointing.

02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:32.200
So, I mean, the open web and encryption in Bitcoin,

02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:35.640
these are things that help prevent social engineering

02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:39.480
and that promote more freedom and more possibilities,

02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:42.360
honestly, and more entrepreneurship and more creativity

02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:43.960
and more scientific inquiry.

02:29:43.960 --> 02:29:44.920
I mean, think about the people

02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:46.720
who tried to shut down scientific inquiry

02:29:46.720 --> 02:29:49.120
500, 600 years ago or whatever,

02:29:49.120 --> 02:29:52.400
that were trying to say the earth

02:29:52.400 --> 02:29:55.320
was the center of everything and they were wrong.

02:29:55.320 --> 02:29:58.280
And then all these conservative religious types

02:29:58.280 --> 02:29:59.640
throughout history have always said

02:29:59.640 --> 02:30:02.880
that there's no value in science

02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:04.440
and there's no value in technology

02:30:04.440 --> 02:30:05.760
and they've been wrong the whole time.

02:30:05.760 --> 02:30:09.480
So let's continue pushing here, let's continue pushing.

02:30:09.760 --> 02:30:11.760
It's kind of scary to me sometimes,

02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:15.200
humbling, beautiful, but also scary to think of,

02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:17.400
you mentioned North Korea,

02:30:17.400 --> 02:30:19.440
people are kind of living in ignorance.

02:30:20.360 --> 02:30:22.840
It's scary to me to think about how much ignorance

02:30:22.840 --> 02:30:23.880
there is in the world today,

02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:26.080
like how little I know personally,

02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:28.720
or us as a human civilization knows

02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:30.040
there's yet to be discovered to that very-

02:30:30.040 --> 02:30:31.240
Well, there's a difference between laziness

02:30:31.240 --> 02:30:32.640
and ignorance, right?

02:30:32.640 --> 02:30:36.520
So I would be lazy if I didn't take advantage

02:30:36.520 --> 02:30:37.880
of the internet, right?

02:30:37.880 --> 02:30:40.640
Someone in North Korea doesn't have the option,

02:30:40.640 --> 02:30:42.920
there's literally no way for them to access the internet.

02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:47.320
So there's kind of like social laziness

02:30:47.320 --> 02:30:49.120
that philosophers have warned about forever,

02:30:49.120 --> 02:30:51.680
that we basically become sheep, okay?

02:30:51.680 --> 02:30:54.760
And then there's actual like brainwashing

02:30:54.760 --> 02:30:56.360
and censorship that's possible,

02:30:56.360 --> 02:30:58.600
like by closing off your population

02:30:58.600 --> 02:31:01.600
and keeping them off like the internet, right?

02:31:01.600 --> 02:31:03.400
So I think these are two very different concepts.

02:31:03.400 --> 02:31:07.280
Absolutely, but I also mean just like not even laziness,

02:31:07.280 --> 02:31:09.200
but cognitive limitations

02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:11.760
and just historical scientific limitations.

02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:16.760
Like, you know, we're a very young species.

02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:18.840
Like all of the exciting stuff we've been talking about

02:31:18.840 --> 02:31:21.640
have happened on the scale of decades, maybe centuries.

02:31:21.640 --> 02:31:23.040
It's very, we're very young

02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:25.200
in all the cool stuff we've come up with.

02:31:25.200 --> 02:31:28.440
And it's just humbling to think about how little we know.

02:31:28.440 --> 02:31:30.720
But you're right that, you know,

02:31:30.720 --> 02:31:33.760
ultimately having the freedom to keep exploring,

02:31:33.760 --> 02:31:35.600
keep venturing out.

02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:38.280
Even if we later discover that a lot of the stuff

02:31:38.280 --> 02:31:43.280
we've been doing now is ethically horrible.

02:31:43.920 --> 02:31:47.440
If you think about animals, or I think about robots a lot,

02:31:47.440 --> 02:31:49.440
the kind of things we might be doing

02:31:50.760 --> 02:31:53.760
to other consciousnesses that are here on earth,

02:31:53.760 --> 02:31:56.960
might be, we might see as atrocities later on.

02:31:56.960 --> 02:31:58.440
But ultimately you have to have the freedom

02:31:58.440 --> 02:32:00.320
to explore those kinds of ideas.

02:32:00.320 --> 02:32:01.680
And without that freedom,

02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:05.400
you don't even get the chance to be lazy.

02:32:06.240 --> 02:32:08.640
Yeah, I mean, look, don't be a sheep, okay?

02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:09.480
It's easy to be a sheep.

02:32:09.480 --> 02:32:10.320
No offense to sheep.

02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:11.920
And there's some practical things, man.

02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:14.400
Get on signal, start encrypting your messages.

02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:16.920
Take control over your privacy.

02:32:18.160 --> 02:32:20.640
The media doesn't want you to, but check out Bitcoin.

02:32:20.640 --> 02:32:22.040
You can be your own bank.

02:32:22.040 --> 02:32:23.680
You can transact with people around the world

02:32:23.680 --> 02:32:25.120
and no one can stop you.

02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:28.720
This can put a stop to a lot of arbitrary power

02:32:28.720 --> 02:32:31.400
and a lot of human rights violations.

02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:33.440
You know, don't use WeChat.

02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:35.040
Question more.

02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:38.080
You know, research what's happening in Xinjiang.

02:32:38.080 --> 02:32:40.480
I mean, learn about what's happening

02:32:40.480 --> 02:32:42.080
in the genocide in that country.

02:32:42.080 --> 02:32:44.600
And let's think about how we can build our societies

02:32:44.600 --> 02:32:45.760
so that we never have that kind

02:32:45.760 --> 02:32:48.280
of power concentration ever again.

02:32:48.280 --> 02:32:50.000
Each of us can make a difference.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:51.920
Alex, it's a huge honor to talk to you.

02:32:51.920 --> 02:32:53.200
I've been a fan of your work.

02:32:53.200 --> 02:32:55.600
A lot of people spoke really highly of you

02:32:55.600 --> 02:32:58.600
as one of the beacons of hope for our human souls.

02:32:58.600 --> 02:33:01.360
So I'm really glad we got a chance to talk.

02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:03.040
Thank you for wasting all this time with me today.

02:33:03.680 --> 02:33:04.520
It's been an honor.

02:33:04.520 --> 02:33:05.360
Thanks, man.

02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:06.200
A lot of fun.

02:33:06.200 --> 02:33:07.720
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:33:07.720 --> 02:33:09.240
with Alex Glastine.

And now let me leave you with some words from Alice Walker.

02:33:18.360 --> 02:33:21.360
The most common way people give up their power

02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:23.720
is by thinking they don't have any.

02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:27.840
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:33.880
Thank you.
