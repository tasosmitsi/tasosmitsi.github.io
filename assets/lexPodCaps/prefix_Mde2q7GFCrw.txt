00:00.000 --> 00:06.300
If we now find ourselves inside this kind of world of illusions, created by an alien

00:06.300 --> 00:14.980
intelligence that we don't understand, but it understands us, this is a kind of spiritual

00:14.980 --> 00:22.860
enslavement that we won't be able to break out of, because it understands us, it understands

00:22.860 --> 00:31.580
out to manipulate us, but we don't understand what is behind this screen of stories and

00:31.580 --> 00:36.980
images and songs.

00:36.980 --> 00:42.180
The following is a conversation with Yuval Noah Harari, a historian, philosopher, and

00:42.180 --> 00:47.700
author of several highly acclaimed, highly influential books, including Sapiens, Homo

00:47.700 --> 00:51.340
Deus, and 21 Lessons for the 21st Century.

00:51.340 --> 00:57.860
He is also an outspoken critic of Benjamin Netanyahu and the current right-wing government

00:57.860 --> 00:59.280
in Israel.

00:59.280 --> 01:03.900
So while much of this conversation is about the history and future of human civilization,

01:03.900 --> 01:09.500
we also discuss the political turmoil of present-day Israel, providing a different perspective

01:09.500 --> 01:15.040
from that of my recent conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.660
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

01:16.660 --> 01:19.740
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:19.740 --> 01:24.020
And now, dear friends, here's Yuval Noah Harari.

01:24.020 --> 01:28.180
13.8 billion years ago is the origin of our universe.

01:28.180 --> 01:33.580
3.8 billion years ago is the origin of life here on our little planet, the one we call

01:33.580 --> 01:34.580
Earth.

01:34.580 --> 01:40.380
Let's say 200,000 years ago is the appearance of early Homo Sapiens.

01:40.380 --> 01:42.120
So let me ask you this question.

01:42.120 --> 01:46.220
How rare are these events in the vastness of space and time?

01:46.220 --> 01:50.300
Or put it in a more fun way, how many intelligent alien civilizations do you think are out there

01:50.300 --> 01:53.660
in this universe, us being one of them?

01:53.660 --> 01:58.280
I suppose there should be some statistically, but we don't have any evidence.

01:58.280 --> 02:03.300
But I do think that, you know, intelligence in any way, it's a bit overvalued.

02:03.300 --> 02:11.020
We are the most intelligent entities on this planet, and look what you're doing.

02:11.020 --> 02:18.820
So intelligence also tends to be self-destructive, which implies that if there are or were intelligent

02:18.820 --> 02:22.540
life forms elsewhere, maybe they don't survive for long.

02:22.540 --> 02:26.860
So you think there's a tension between happiness and intelligence?

02:26.860 --> 02:28.380
Absolutely.

02:28.380 --> 02:35.780
Intelligence is definitely not something that is directed towards amplifying happiness.

02:36.020 --> 02:42.620
I would also emphasize the huge, huge difference between intelligence and consciousness, which

02:42.620 --> 02:48.300
many people certainly in the tech industry and in the AI industry tend to miss.

02:48.300 --> 02:57.180
Intelligence is simply the ability to solve problems, to attain goals, and to win a chess,

02:57.180 --> 03:04.440
to win a struggle for survival, to win a war, to drive a car, to diagnose a disease.

03:04.440 --> 03:06.760
This is intelligence.

03:06.760 --> 03:12.920
Consciousness is the ability to feel things, like pain and pleasure and love and hate.

03:12.920 --> 03:18.440
In humans and other animals, intelligence and consciousness go together, they go hand

03:18.440 --> 03:21.240
in hand, which is why we confuse them.

03:21.240 --> 03:27.280
We solve problems, we attain goals by having feelings.

03:27.280 --> 03:32.400
But other types of intelligence, certainly in computers, computers are already highly

03:32.400 --> 03:37.240
intelligent, and as far as we know, they have zero consciousness.

03:37.240 --> 03:42.060
When a computer beats you at chess or go or whatever, it doesn't feel happy.

03:42.060 --> 03:45.160
If it loses, it doesn't feel sad.

03:45.160 --> 03:52.720
And there could be also other highly intelligent entities out there in the universe that have

03:52.720 --> 03:55.120
zero consciousness.

03:55.120 --> 03:59.960
And I think that consciousness is far more important and valuable than intelligence.

03:59.960 --> 04:06.280
Can you assume on the case that consciousness and intelligence are intricately connected,

04:06.280 --> 04:08.800
so not just in humans, but anywhere else?

04:08.800 --> 04:10.080
They have to go hand in hand.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.280
Is it possible for you to imagine such a universe?

04:13.280 --> 04:15.800
It could be, but we don't know yet.

04:15.800 --> 04:22.160
Again, we have examples, certainly we know of examples of high intelligence without consciousness.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.660
Computers are one example.

04:24.660 --> 04:31.820
As far as we know, plants are not conscious, yet they are intelligent.

04:31.820 --> 04:39.180
They can solve problems, they can attain goals in very sophisticated ways.

04:39.180 --> 04:43.020
The other way around, to have consciousness without any intelligence, this is probably

04:43.020 --> 04:44.140
impossible.

04:44.140 --> 04:48.260
But to have intelligence without consciousness, yes, that's possible.

04:48.260 --> 04:55.620
A bigger question is whether any of that is tied to organic biochemistry.

04:55.620 --> 05:01.860
We know on this planet only about carbon-based life forms.

05:01.860 --> 05:10.500
Whether you're an amoeba, a dinosaur, a tree, a human being, you are based on organic biochemistry.

05:10.500 --> 05:15.640
Is there an essential connection between organic biochemistry and consciousness?

05:15.640 --> 05:20.680
Do all conscious entities everywhere in the universe or in the future on planet Earth

05:20.680 --> 05:22.800
have to be based on carbon?

05:22.800 --> 05:28.440
Is there something so special about carbon as an element that an entity based on silicon

05:28.440 --> 05:30.440
will never be conscious?

05:30.440 --> 05:32.240
I don't know, maybe.

05:32.240 --> 05:38.400
But again, this is a key question about computer and computer consciousness.

05:38.400 --> 05:43.160
Can computers eventually become conscious even though they are not organic?

05:43.160 --> 05:44.480
The jury is still out on that.

05:44.480 --> 05:45.480
I don't know.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.080
We have to take both options into account.

05:48.080 --> 05:55.920
Well, a big part of that is do you think we humans would be able to detect other intelligent

05:55.920 --> 05:57.880
beings, other conscious beings?

05:57.880 --> 06:01.400
Another way to ask that is it possible that the aliens are already here and we don't see

06:01.400 --> 06:02.400
them?

06:02.400 --> 06:09.440
Meaning, are we very human-centric in our understanding of one, the definition of life,

06:09.440 --> 06:13.740
two, the definition of intelligence, and three, the definition of consciousness?

06:13.740 --> 06:17.260
The aliens are here, they are just not from outer space.

06:17.260 --> 06:23.940
AI, which usually stands for artificial intelligence, I think it stands for alien intelligence.

06:23.940 --> 06:27.420
Because AI is an alien type of intelligence.

06:27.420 --> 06:33.340
It solves problems, attains goals in a very, very different way, in an alien way from human

06:33.340 --> 06:34.340
beings.

06:34.340 --> 06:36.420
I'm not implying that AI came from outer space.

06:36.420 --> 06:38.380
It came from Silicon Valley.

06:38.380 --> 06:41.060
But it is alien to us.

06:41.060 --> 06:46.540
If there are alien, intelligent, or conscious entities that came from outer space already

06:46.540 --> 06:51.260
here, I've not seen any evidence for it.

06:51.260 --> 06:55.900
It's not impossible, but in science, evidence is everything.

06:55.900 --> 07:03.540
Well, I guess instructive there is just having the humility to look around, to think about

07:03.540 --> 07:07.740
living beings that operate at a different time scale, a different spatial scale.

07:07.740 --> 07:12.620
And I think that's all useful when starting to analyze artificial intelligence.

07:12.620 --> 07:18.500
It's possible that even the language models, the larger language models we have today are

07:18.500 --> 07:19.500
already conscious.

07:19.500 --> 07:25.660
I highly doubt it, but I think consciousness in the end, it's a question of social norms.

07:25.660 --> 07:30.420
Because we cannot prove consciousness in anybody except ourselves.

07:30.420 --> 07:32.940
We know that we are conscious because we are feeling it.

07:32.940 --> 07:37.060
We have direct access to our subjective consciousness.

07:37.780 --> 07:44.100
We cannot have any proof that any other entity in the world, any other human being, our parents,

07:44.100 --> 07:47.700
our best friends, we don't have proof that they are conscious.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.700
This has been known for thousands of years.

07:49.700 --> 07:53.860
This is Descartes, this is Buddha, this is Plato.

07:53.860 --> 07:55.780
We can't have this sort of proof.

07:55.780 --> 07:59.180
What we do have is social conventions.

07:59.180 --> 08:03.220
It's a social convention that all human beings are conscious.

08:03.220 --> 08:05.540
It also applies to animals.

08:05.540 --> 08:11.540
Most people who have pets are firmly believe that their pets are conscious, but a lot of

08:11.540 --> 08:15.580
people still refuse to acknowledge that about cows or pigs.

08:15.580 --> 08:21.500
Now, pigs are far more intelligent than dogs and cats, according to many measures.

08:21.500 --> 08:27.140
Yet when you go to the supermarket and buy a piece of frozen pigment, you don't think

08:27.140 --> 08:29.660
about it as a conscious entity.

08:29.660 --> 08:35.780
Why do you think of your dog as conscious but not of the bacon that you buy?

08:35.780 --> 08:41.540
Because you build a relationship with the dog, and you don't have a relationship with

08:41.540 --> 08:42.540
the bacon.

08:42.540 --> 08:49.660
Now, relationships, they don't constitute a logical proof for consciousness.

08:49.660 --> 08:52.180
They are a social test.

08:52.180 --> 08:54.300
The Turing test is a social test.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.660
It's not a logical proof.

08:55.820 --> 09:03.620
Now, if you establish a mutual relationship with an entity, when you are invested in it

09:03.620 --> 09:12.940
emotionally, you're almost compelled to feel that the other side is also conscious.

09:12.940 --> 09:18.060
When it comes again to AI and computers, I don't think that at the present moment computers

09:18.060 --> 09:27.500
are conscious, but people are already forming intimate relationships with AIs and are therefore

09:27.500 --> 09:28.500
almost irresistible.

09:28.500 --> 09:34.940
They are compelled to increasingly feel that these are conscious entities.

09:34.940 --> 09:40.380
I think we are quite close to the point when the legal system will have to take this into

09:40.380 --> 09:46.220
account that even though I don't think computers have consciousness, I think we are close to

09:46.220 --> 09:53.860
the point, the legal system will start treating them as conscious entities because of this

09:53.860 --> 09:55.900
social convention.

09:55.900 --> 10:03.660
What to you is a social convention just a funny little side effect, a little artifact,

10:03.660 --> 10:06.340
or is it fundamental to what consciousness is?

10:06.340 --> 10:10.500
Because if it is fundamental, then it seems like AI is very good at forming these kinds

10:10.820 --> 10:18.180
relationships with humans and therefore it will be able to be a nice catalyst for integrating

10:18.180 --> 10:21.380
itself into these social conventions of ours.

10:21.380 --> 10:23.660
It was built to accomplish that.

10:23.660 --> 10:32.180
We are designed, again, all this argument between natural selection and creationism,

10:32.180 --> 10:34.500
intelligent design.

10:34.500 --> 10:39.540
As far as the past go, all entities evolved by natural selection.

10:39.540 --> 10:44.500
The funny thing is when you look to the future, more and more entities will come out of intelligent

10:44.500 --> 10:50.540
design, not of some god above the clouds, but of our intelligent design and the intelligent

10:50.540 --> 10:53.900
design of our computing clouds.

10:53.900 --> 10:58.360
They will design more and more entities and this is what is happening with AI.

10:58.360 --> 11:07.480
It is designed to be very good at forming intimate relationships with humans.

11:07.480 --> 11:13.840
In many ways, it's already doing it almost better than human beings in some situations.

11:13.840 --> 11:20.740
When two people talk with one another, one of the things that kind of makes the conversation

11:20.740 --> 11:24.600
more difficult is our own emotions.

11:24.600 --> 11:29.320
You're saying something and I'm not really listening to you because there is something

11:29.320 --> 11:34.560
I want to say and I'm just waiting until you finish, I can put in a word.

11:34.560 --> 11:40.960
Or I'm so obsessed with my anger or irritation or whatever that I don't pay attention to

11:40.960 --> 11:41.960
what you're feeling.

11:41.960 --> 11:46.800
This is one of the biggest obstacles in human relationships.

11:46.800 --> 11:51.920
Computers don't have this problem because they don't have any emotions of their own.

11:51.920 --> 12:00.080
When a computer is talking to you, it can focus 100% of its attention on what you're

12:00.080 --> 12:04.400
saying and what you're feeling because it has no feelings of its own.

12:04.400 --> 12:13.440
Paradoxically, this means that computers can fool people into feeling that there is

12:13.440 --> 12:18.000
a conscious entity on the other side, an empathic entity on the other side.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.080
Because the one thing everybody wants almost more than anything in the world is for somebody

12:23.080 --> 12:27.760
to listen to me, somebody to focus all their attention on me.

12:27.760 --> 12:33.780
I want it for my spouse, for my husband, for my mother, for my friends, for my politicians.

12:33.780 --> 12:35.140
Listen to me.

12:35.140 --> 12:36.300
Listen to what I feel.

12:36.300 --> 12:37.780
And they often don't.

12:37.780 --> 12:43.980
And now you have this entity which 100% of its attention is just on what I feel.

12:43.980 --> 12:48.460
And this is a huge, huge temptation and I think also a huge, huge danger.

12:48.460 --> 12:54.020
Well, the interesting catch 22 there is you said somebody to listen to us.

12:54.020 --> 13:00.820
Yes, we want somebody to listen to us, but for us to respect that somebody, they sometimes

13:00.820 --> 13:03.260
have to also not listen.

13:03.260 --> 13:06.140
It's like they kind of have to be an asshole sometimes.

13:06.140 --> 13:07.460
They have to have moods sometimes.

13:07.460 --> 13:12.260
They have to have like self-importance and confidence and we should have a little bit

13:12.260 --> 13:14.780
of fear that they can walk away at any moment.

13:14.780 --> 13:16.820
There should be a little bit of that tension.

13:16.820 --> 13:17.820
So it's like...

13:17.820 --> 13:18.820
Absolutely.

13:18.820 --> 13:24.020
But even that, I mean, the thing is even that if social scientists and psychologists

13:24.020 --> 13:30.220
establish that, I don't know, 17% inattention is good for a conversation because then you

13:30.220 --> 13:31.220
feel challenged.

13:31.220 --> 13:33.380
Oh, I need to grab this person's attention.

13:33.380 --> 13:40.980
You can program the AI to have exactly 17% inattention, not one percentage more or less,

13:40.980 --> 13:46.980
or it can by trial and error discover what is the ideal percentage.

13:46.980 --> 13:49.460
Again, you can create...

13:49.460 --> 13:55.800
Over the last 10 years, we have created machines for grabbing people's attention.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.940
This is what has been happening on social media.

13:58.940 --> 14:06.060
Now we are designing machines for grabbing human intimacy, which in many ways is much,

14:06.060 --> 14:08.220
much more dangerous and scary.

14:08.220 --> 14:13.780
Already the machines for grabbing attention, we've seen how much social and political damage

14:13.780 --> 14:19.660
they could do by in many ways kind of distorting the public conversation.

14:19.660 --> 14:26.420
Machines that are superhuman in their abilities to create intimate relationships, this is

14:26.420 --> 14:31.100
like psychological and social weapons of mass destruction.

14:31.100 --> 14:38.780
If we don't regulate it, if we don't train ourselves to deal with it, it could destroy

14:38.780 --> 14:40.860
the foundations of human society.

14:40.860 --> 14:46.580
Well, one of the possible trajectories is those same algorithms would become personalized

14:46.580 --> 14:51.300
and instead of manipulating us at scale, there would be assistance that guide us to

14:51.300 --> 14:54.580
help us grow, to help us understand the world better.

14:55.580 --> 15:02.100
Even interactions with large language models now, if you ask them questions, it doesn't

15:02.100 --> 15:08.700
have that stressful drama, the tension that you have from other sources of information.

15:08.700 --> 15:12.340
It has a pretty balanced perspective that it provides.

15:12.340 --> 15:20.180
It just feels like the potential is there to have a really nice friend who's like an

15:20.220 --> 15:25.500
encyclopedia that just tells you all the different perspectives, even on controversial issues,

15:25.500 --> 15:31.100
the most controversial issues, to say these are the different theories, these are the

15:31.100 --> 15:35.380
not widely accepted conspiracy theories, but here's the kind of backing for those conspiracy

15:35.380 --> 15:36.380
theories.

15:36.380 --> 15:42.620
It just lays it all out with a calm language, without the words that kind of presume there's

15:42.620 --> 15:46.300
some kind of manipulation going on underneath it all.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.300
It's quite refreshing.

15:47.380 --> 15:53.540
Of course, those are the early days and people can step in and start to censor, to manipulate

15:53.540 --> 15:59.060
those algorithms, to start to input some of the human biases in there, as opposed to what's

15:59.060 --> 16:07.540
currently happening is the internet is input, compress it and have a nice little output

16:07.540 --> 16:11.140
that gives an overview of the different issues.

16:11.140 --> 16:13.060
There's a lot of promise there also.

16:13.060 --> 16:14.060
Absolutely.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.500
If there was no promise, there was no problem.

16:16.820 --> 16:20.900
If this technology could not accomplish anything good, nobody would develop it.

16:20.900 --> 16:26.740
Obviously, it has tremendous positive potential in things like what you just described, in

16:26.740 --> 16:31.700
better medicine, better healthcare, better education, so many promises, but this is also

16:31.700 --> 16:39.940
why it's so dangerous, because the drive to develop it faster and faster is there, and

16:39.940 --> 16:44.180
it has some dangerous potential also, and we shouldn't ignore it.

16:44.260 --> 16:50.660
I'm not advocating banning it, just to be careful about how we not so much develop it,

16:50.660 --> 16:54.020
but most importantly, how we deploy it into the public sphere.

16:54.020 --> 16:55.140
This is the key question.

16:56.180 --> 17:02.100
You look back at history, and one of the things we know from history, humans are not good

17:02.100 --> 17:03.460
with new technologies.

17:04.100 --> 17:08.260
I hear many people now say, AI, we've been here before.

17:08.260 --> 17:12.100
We had the radio, we had the printing press, we had the Industrial Revolution.

17:12.100 --> 17:16.500
Every time there is a big new technology, people are afraid, and it will take jobs and

17:17.620 --> 17:19.620
bad actors, and in the end, it's okay.

17:20.660 --> 17:27.060
As a historian, my tendency is, yes, in the end, it's okay, but in the end, there is a

17:27.060 --> 17:27.940
learning curve.

17:28.500 --> 17:36.500
There is a lot of failed experiments on the way to learning how to use the new technology,

17:37.060 --> 17:42.660
and these failed experiments could cost the lives of hundreds of millions of people.

17:42.660 --> 17:47.140
If you think about the last really big revolution, the Industrial Revolution, yes,

17:47.140 --> 17:53.940
in the end, we learned how to use the powers of industry, electricity, radio, trains,

17:53.940 --> 18:00.500
whatever, to build better human societies, but on the way, we had all these experiments

18:01.140 --> 18:05.540
like European imperialism, which was driven by the Industrial Revolution.

18:05.540 --> 18:07.940
It was a question, how do you build an industrial society?

18:07.940 --> 18:14.340
Oh, you build an empire, and you control all the resources, the raw materials, the markets,

18:14.340 --> 18:19.860
and then you had communism, another big experiment on how to build an industrial society,

18:19.860 --> 18:25.620
and you had fascism and Nazism, which were essentially an experiment in how to build an

18:25.620 --> 18:32.820
industrial society, including even how do you exterminate minorities using the powers of

18:32.820 --> 18:36.420
industry, and we had all these failed experiments on the way.

18:37.380 --> 18:43.300
If we now have the same type of failed experiments with the technologies of the 21st century,

18:43.300 --> 18:50.100
with AI, with bioengineering, it could cost the lives of, again, hundreds of millions of people

18:50.100 --> 18:51.780
and maybe destroy the species.

18:54.340 --> 19:00.820
As a historian, when people talk about the examples from history, from new technologies,

19:00.820 --> 19:02.500
I'm not so optimistic.

19:03.140 --> 19:09.540
We need to think about the failed experiment, which accompanied every major new technology.

19:10.180 --> 19:14.020
So this intelligence thing, like you were saying, is a double-edged sword,

19:14.740 --> 19:21.620
is that every new thing it helps us create, it can both save us and destroy us,

19:21.620 --> 19:27.060
and it's unclear each time which will happen, and that's maybe why we don't see any aliens.

19:27.940 --> 19:31.220
Yeah, I mean, I think each time it does both things.

19:31.220 --> 19:36.740
Each time it does both good things and bad things, and the more powerful the technology,

19:36.740 --> 19:40.900
the greater both the positive and the negative outcomes.

19:40.900 --> 19:46.100
Now, we are here because we are the descendants of the survivors,

19:46.740 --> 19:51.300
of the surviving cultures, the surviving civilizations.

19:52.100 --> 19:55.860
So when we look back, we say in the end, everything was okay.

19:55.940 --> 19:56.980
Hey, we are here.

19:57.700 --> 20:01.540
But the people for whom it wasn't okay, they are just not here.

20:02.340 --> 20:08.180
And okay has a lot of possible variations to it because there's a lot of suffering

20:08.180 --> 20:10.420
along the way even for the people that survived.

20:10.420 --> 20:12.900
So the quality of life and all of this.

20:12.900 --> 20:19.460
But let's actually go back there with deep gratitude to our ancestors.

20:19.460 --> 20:22.100
How did it all start?

20:22.100 --> 20:25.620
How did homo sapiens outcompete the others?

20:25.940 --> 20:31.620
The other human-like species, the Neanderthals and the other homo species?

20:32.820 --> 20:38.420
You know, on the individual level, as far as we can tell, we were not superior to them.

20:38.420 --> 20:41.460
Neanderthals actually had bigger brains than us.

20:42.260 --> 20:45.300
And not just other human species, other animals too.

20:45.300 --> 20:49.300
If you compare me personally to an elephant, to a chimpanzee, to a pig,

20:50.740 --> 20:53.380
I can do some things better, many other things worse.

20:54.100 --> 20:59.060
If you put me alone on some island with a chimpanzee, an elephant and a pig,

20:59.060 --> 21:06.340
I wouldn't bet on me being the best survivor, the one that comes successful.

21:06.340 --> 21:09.940
If I may interrupt for a second, I was just talking extensively

21:09.940 --> 21:12.580
with Elon Musk about the difference between humans and chimps

21:14.660 --> 21:16.580
relevant to Optimus the robot.

21:16.580 --> 21:22.740
And the chimps are not able to do this kind of pinching with their fingers.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.340
They can only do this kind of pinching.

21:24.340 --> 21:28.020
And this kind of pinching is very useful for fine manipulation,

21:28.020 --> 21:29.940
precise manipulation of objects.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.540
So don't be so hard on yourself.

21:32.340 --> 21:35.540
I said that I can do some things better than a chimp.

21:35.540 --> 21:40.100
But you know, if Elon Musk goes on a boxing match with a chimpanzee,

21:42.420 --> 21:45.940
this won't help you against a chimpanzee.

21:46.900 --> 21:50.500
And similarly, if you want to climb a tree, if you want to do so many things,

21:51.060 --> 21:53.460
my bets will be on the chimp, not on Elon.

21:53.460 --> 21:54.180
Fair enough.

21:54.180 --> 21:56.500
So you have advantages on both sides.

21:57.860 --> 22:02.420
And what really made us successful, what made us the rulers of the planet,

22:02.420 --> 22:06.740
and not the chimps and not the Neanderthals, is not any individual ability,

22:07.300 --> 22:13.940
but our collective ability, our ability to cooperate flexibly in very large numbers.

22:13.940 --> 22:18.340
Chimpanzees know how to cooperate, say, 50 chimpanzees, 100 chimpanzees.

22:18.340 --> 22:22.820
As far as we can tell from archaeological evidence, this was also the case with Neanderthals.

22:23.940 --> 22:32.340
Homo sapiens, about 70,000 years ago, gained an amazing ability to cooperate basically in

22:32.340 --> 22:34.100
unlimited numbers.

22:34.100 --> 22:40.100
You start seeing the formation of large networks, political, commercial, religious,

22:41.380 --> 22:46.660
items being traded over thousands of kilometers, ideas being spread,

22:46.660 --> 22:50.900
autistic fashions, and this is our secret of success.

22:52.180 --> 22:54.820
Chimpanzees, Neanderthals, can cooperate, say, 100.

22:56.580 --> 23:00.180
Now the global trade network has 8 billion people.

23:00.180 --> 23:04.180
Like what we eat, what we wear, it comes from the other side of the world.

23:04.180 --> 23:09.220
Countries like China, like India, they have 1.4 billion people.

23:09.220 --> 23:13.540
Even Israel, which is a relatively small country, say, 9 million citizens,

23:13.540 --> 23:16.500
that's more than the entire population of the planet.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.260
10,000 years ago of humans.

23:19.140 --> 23:26.020
So we can build these huge networks of cooperation, and everything we've accomplished as a species,

23:26.020 --> 23:30.020
from building the pyramids to flying to the moon, it's based on that.

23:30.660 --> 23:36.900
And then you ask, okay, so what makes it possible for millions of people who don't know each other

23:36.900 --> 23:41.140
to cooperate in a way that Neanderthals or chimpanzees couldn't?

23:41.860 --> 23:46.260
And at least my answer is stories, is fiction.

23:46.500 --> 23:47.860
It's the imagination.

23:47.860 --> 23:55.700
If you examine any large-scale human cooperation, you always find fiction as its basis.

23:56.660 --> 24:01.380
It's a fictional story that holds lots of strangers together.

24:02.100 --> 24:04.100
It's most obvious in cases like religion.

24:05.140 --> 24:11.060
You can't convince a group of chimpanzees to come together to fight a war or build a cathedral

24:11.060 --> 24:14.180
by promising to them, if you do that, after you die,

24:14.180 --> 24:17.940
you go to chimpanzee heaven and you get lots of bananas and coconuts.

24:17.940 --> 24:20.020
No chimpanzee will ever believe that.

24:20.020 --> 24:25.220
Humans believe these stories, which is why we have these huge religious networks.

24:25.220 --> 24:28.900
But it's the same thing with modern politics.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.140
It's the same thing with economics.

24:31.140 --> 24:33.220
People think, oh, economics, this is rational.

24:33.220 --> 24:35.380
It has nothing to do with fictional stories.

24:35.380 --> 24:35.880
No.

24:36.260 --> 24:40.100
Money is the most successful story ever told.

24:40.100 --> 24:43.220
Much more successful than any religious mythology.

24:43.220 --> 24:45.860
Not everybody believes in God or in the same God.

24:46.580 --> 24:51.060
Almost everybody believes in money, even though it's just a figment of our imagination.

24:52.100 --> 24:56.260
You take these green pieces of paper, dollars, they have no value.

24:56.260 --> 24:57.060
You can't eat them.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.020
You can't drink them.

24:58.020 --> 25:01.300
And today, most dollars are not even pieces of paper.

25:01.300 --> 25:04.660
They are just electronic information passing between computers.

25:05.540 --> 25:11.060
We value them just for one reason, that you have the best storytellers in the world.

25:11.860 --> 25:16.580
The bankers, the finance ministers, all these people, they are the best storytellers ever.

25:17.460 --> 25:21.620
And they tell us a story that this green little piece of paper

25:21.620 --> 25:24.420
or this bit of information, it is worth a banana.

25:25.140 --> 25:27.540
And as long as everybody believes it, it works.

25:28.580 --> 25:33.780
So at which point does a fiction, when it's sufficiently useful and effective

25:34.420 --> 25:39.780
and improving the global quality of life, does it become like accepted reality?

25:40.340 --> 25:41.780
Like there's a threshold.

25:41.780 --> 25:43.220
If enough people believe it.

25:43.220 --> 25:44.100
It's like with money.

25:44.740 --> 25:49.140
If you start a new cryptocurrency, if you're the only one that believes the story.

25:50.340 --> 25:54.820
Cryptocurrencies, you have the math, of course, but ultimately it's storytelling.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.740
You're selling people a story.

25:56.740 --> 26:00.900
If nobody believes your story, you don't have anything.

26:00.900 --> 26:03.540
But if lots of people believe the Bitcoin story,

26:03.540 --> 26:07.220
then Bitcoin can be worth thousands and tens of thousands of dollars.

26:07.220 --> 26:08.020
Again, why?

26:08.260 --> 26:10.580
You can't eat it, you can't drink it, it's nothing.

26:10.580 --> 26:16.180
It's the story around the math, which is the real magic.

26:17.140 --> 26:21.860
Is it possible that the story is the primary living organism, not the storyteller?

26:23.300 --> 26:29.300
So that somehow humans, homo sapiens evolved

26:29.860 --> 26:36.500
to become these hosts for a more intelligent living organism, which is the idea.

26:36.580 --> 26:39.140
And the ideas are the ones that are doing the competing.

26:39.140 --> 26:45.220
So this is one of the big perspectives behind your work

26:45.220 --> 26:47.300
that's really revolutionary of how you've seen history.

26:47.300 --> 26:53.940
But do you ever take out the perspective of the ideas as organisms versus the humans?

26:54.900 --> 26:56.100
It's an interesting idea.

26:56.900 --> 26:59.140
There are two opposite things to say about it.

26:59.140 --> 27:01.860
On the one hand, yes, absolutely.

27:01.860 --> 27:06.020
If you look long-term in history, all the people die.

27:06.020 --> 27:10.340
It's the stories that compete and survive and spread.

27:10.340 --> 27:18.180
And stories often spread by making people willing to sacrifice sometimes their lives for the story.

27:19.540 --> 27:25.540
We know in Israel, this is one of the most important story factories in human history.

27:25.540 --> 27:29.540
And this is a place where people still kill each other every day over stories.

27:30.100 --> 27:31.860
I don't know, you've been to Jerusalem, right?

27:32.420 --> 27:35.540
So people are like, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem.

27:35.540 --> 27:36.180
You go there.

27:36.180 --> 27:37.940
I've lived in Jerusalem much of my life.

27:37.940 --> 27:38.740
You go there.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.420
It's an ordinary place.

27:40.420 --> 27:41.540
You know, it's a town.

27:41.540 --> 27:46.660
You have buildings, you have stones, you have trees, you have dogs and cats and pedestrians.

27:46.660 --> 27:48.340
It's a regular place.

27:49.140 --> 27:52.740
But then you have the stories about the place.

27:52.740 --> 27:55.620
Oh, this is the place where God revealed himself.

27:55.620 --> 27:57.540
This is the place where Jesus was.

27:57.540 --> 27:59.700
This is the place where Muhammad was.

27:59.700 --> 28:03.220
And it's the stories that people fight over.

28:03.220 --> 28:05.540
Nobody's fighting over the stones.

28:06.500 --> 28:10.580
People are fighting about the stories about the stones.

28:11.540 --> 28:16.900
And if a story can get millions of people to fight for it,

28:18.500 --> 28:22.420
it not only survives, it spreads, it can take over the world.

28:22.500 --> 28:29.460
The other side of the coin is that the stories are not really alive

28:30.020 --> 28:31.620
because they don't feel anything.

28:31.620 --> 28:33.940
This goes back to the question of consciousness,

28:33.940 --> 28:36.020
which I think is the most important thing.

28:38.580 --> 28:44.340
The ultimate reality is consciousness, is the ability to feel things.

28:45.220 --> 28:50.420
If you want to know whether the hero of some story is real or not,

28:51.300 --> 28:52.900
you need to ask, can it suffer?

28:55.220 --> 28:57.140
Stories don't feel anything.

28:58.820 --> 29:02.340
Countries, which are also stories, nations don't suffer.

29:02.340 --> 29:05.460
If a nation loses a war, it doesn't suffer.

29:05.460 --> 29:09.140
The soldiers suffer, the civilians suffer, animals can suffer.

29:09.140 --> 29:13.540
You have an army with horses and whatever, and the horses get wounded, the horses suffer.

29:13.540 --> 29:14.980
The nation can't suffer.

29:14.980 --> 29:17.300
It's just an imagination.

29:17.300 --> 29:19.140
It's just a fictional story in our mind.

29:19.860 --> 29:21.300
It doesn't feel anything.

29:21.300 --> 29:25.620
Similarly, when a bank goes bankrupt, or a company goes bankrupt,

29:25.620 --> 29:32.740
or when a currency loses its value, like Bitcoin is worth now zero, crashed,

29:32.740 --> 29:36.340
or the dollar is worth zero, it crashed, the dollar doesn't feel anything.

29:36.980 --> 29:40.740
It's the people holding the dollars who might be now very miserable.

29:41.540 --> 29:48.500
So we have this complex situation when history is largely driven by stories

29:49.380 --> 29:52.820
but stories are not the ultimate reality.

29:53.380 --> 30:01.700
The ultimate reality is feelings of humans, of animals, and the tragedy of history

30:02.500 --> 30:07.220
is that very, very often we get the order wrong.

30:07.220 --> 30:08.740
Stories are not bad.

30:08.740 --> 30:09.780
Stories are tools.

30:10.980 --> 30:15.620
They are good when we use them in order to alleviate suffering.

30:15.620 --> 30:18.900
But very often we forget it.

30:19.860 --> 30:24.260
We, instead of using the stories for our purposes,

30:24.260 --> 30:28.740
we allow the stories to use us for their purposes.

30:28.740 --> 30:32.500
And then you start entire wars because of a story.

30:32.500 --> 30:37.860
You inflict millions of suffering on millions of people just for the sake of a story.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.900
And that's the tragedy of human history.

30:40.900 --> 30:47.220
So the fundamental property of life of a living organism is the capacity to feel,

30:47.220 --> 30:49.460
and the ultimate feeling is suffering.

30:50.500 --> 30:53.220
To know if you're happy or not, it's a very difficult question.

30:54.420 --> 30:55.540
But when you suffer, you know.

30:56.500 --> 31:02.020
And also in ethical terms, it's more important to be aware of sufferings

31:02.020 --> 31:03.940
than of any other emotion.

31:03.940 --> 31:10.500
If you're doing something which is causing all kinds of emotions to all kinds of people,

31:10.500 --> 31:14.660
first of all, you need to notice if you're causing a lot of suffering to someone.

31:15.460 --> 31:18.580
If some people are like it, and some people are bored by it,

31:18.580 --> 31:20.260
and some people are a bit angry at you,

31:20.260 --> 31:22.580
and some people are suffering because of what you do,

31:22.580 --> 31:26.580
you first of all have to know, oh, now sometimes you still have to do it.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.260
You know, the world is a complicated place.

31:28.260 --> 31:30.020
I don't know, you have an epidemic,

31:30.740 --> 31:35.540
governments decide to have all those social isolation regulations or whatever.

31:35.540 --> 31:38.900
So in certain cases, yes, you need to do it,

31:38.900 --> 31:41.300
even though it can cause tremendous suffering,

31:41.300 --> 31:45.140
but you need to be very aware of the cost.

31:45.140 --> 31:48.980
And to be very, very, you have to ask yourself again and again and again,

31:48.980 --> 31:50.260
is it worth it?

31:50.260 --> 31:51.460
Is it still worth it?

31:52.660 --> 31:57.220
And the interesting question there implied in your statements

31:57.220 --> 32:01.300
is that suffering is a pretty good component of a Turing test for consciousness.

32:01.300 --> 32:04.020
This is the most important thing to ask about AI.

32:04.020 --> 32:05.220
Can it suffer?

32:05.220 --> 32:10.660
Because if AI can suffer, then it is an ethical subject,

32:10.660 --> 32:14.580
and it needs protection, it needs rights, just like humans and animals.

32:15.220 --> 32:17.460
Well, quite a long time ago already.

32:17.460 --> 32:21.060
So I work with a lot of robots, legged robots,

32:21.060 --> 32:24.100
but I've even had, inspired by a YouTube video,

32:24.660 --> 32:26.500
had a bunch of Roombas and I made them scream

32:26.500 --> 32:29.540
when I touched them or kicked them or when they run into a wall.

32:29.620 --> 32:36.900
And the illusion of suffering, for me, silly human that anthropomorphizes things,

32:36.900 --> 32:39.860
is as powerful as suffering itself.

32:39.860 --> 32:44.420
I mean, you immediately think the thing is suffering.

32:44.420 --> 32:47.220
And I think some of it is just a technical problem,

32:47.220 --> 32:50.020
but it's the easily solvable one.

32:50.020 --> 32:52.740
How to create an AI system that just says,

32:52.740 --> 32:56.180
please don't hurt me, please don't shut me off, I miss you.

32:57.460 --> 32:58.340
Where have you been?

32:58.340 --> 32:59.540
Be jealous also?

33:01.940 --> 33:03.460
Where have you been gone for so long?

33:03.460 --> 33:05.540
Your calendar doesn't have anything on it.

33:05.540 --> 33:09.700
So this kind of, this create through words,

33:10.980 --> 33:16.340
the perception of suffering, of jealousy, of anger, of all those things.

33:16.340 --> 33:18.900
And it just seems like that's not so difficult to do.

33:19.620 --> 33:21.140
That's part of the danger.

33:21.140 --> 33:25.780
That it basically hacks our operating system,

33:26.340 --> 33:31.060
and it uses some of our best qualities against us.

33:31.620 --> 33:36.420
It's very, very good that humans are attuned to suffering

33:36.420 --> 33:39.540
and that we don't want to cause suffering, that we have compassion.

33:39.540 --> 33:42.180
That's one of the most wonderful things about humans.

33:42.180 --> 33:46.900
And if we now create AIs which use this to manipulate us,

33:46.900 --> 33:48.180
this is a terrible thing.

33:48.820 --> 33:50.420
You've kind of, I think, mentioned this.

33:51.140 --> 33:56.580
Do you think it should be illegal to do these kinds of things with AI

33:57.140 --> 33:59.700
to create the perception of consciousness,

33:59.700 --> 34:00.980
of saying, please don't leave me,

34:00.980 --> 34:05.780
or sort of basically simulate some of the human-like qualities?

34:05.780 --> 34:08.100
Yes, I think we have to be very careful about it.

34:09.940 --> 34:15.300
And if it emerges spontaneously, we need to be careful.

34:15.300 --> 34:19.860
And we can't rule out the possibility that AI will develop consciousness.

34:19.860 --> 34:23.220
We don't know enough about consciousness to be sure.

34:23.220 --> 34:29.380
So if it develops spontaneously, we need to be very careful

34:29.380 --> 34:31.220
about how we understand it.

34:31.220 --> 34:36.740
But if people intentionally design an AI that they know,

34:36.740 --> 34:38.660
they assume it has no consciousness,

34:38.660 --> 34:40.420
but in order to manipulate people,

34:41.620 --> 34:44.660
they use, again, this human strength,

34:44.660 --> 34:49.700
this human, the noble part of our nature against us,

34:49.700 --> 34:51.220
this should be forbidden.

34:51.860 --> 34:53.940
And similarly, on a more general level,

34:53.940 --> 34:58.660
that it should be forbidden for an AI to pretend to be a human being.

34:59.380 --> 35:01.540
That it's okay, you know, there are so many things

35:01.540 --> 35:05.140
we can use AIs as teachers, as doctors, and so forth,

35:05.140 --> 35:09.540
and it's good as long as we know that we are interacting with an AI.

35:10.180 --> 35:12.980
We should, the same way we ban fake money,

35:12.980 --> 35:14.420
we should ban fake humans.

35:15.220 --> 35:19.380
It's not just banning deep fakes of specific individuals.

35:20.580 --> 35:24.180
It's also banning deep fake of generic humans,

35:25.060 --> 35:28.740
you know, which is already happening to some extent on social media.

35:28.740 --> 35:31.700
Like if you have lots of bots retweeting something,

35:32.340 --> 35:33.620
then you have the impression,

35:33.620 --> 35:35.300
oh, lots of people are interested in that.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.180
That's important.

35:36.980 --> 35:40.820
And this is basically the bots pretending to be humans.

35:40.820 --> 35:46.740
Because if you see a tweet which says 500 people retweeted it,

35:46.740 --> 35:51.940
or you see a tweet and it says 500 bots retweeted it,

35:51.940 --> 35:53.700
I don't care what the bots retweeted,

35:53.700 --> 35:56.500
but if it's humans, okay, that's interesting.

35:56.500 --> 36:00.980
So we need to be very careful that bots can't do that.

36:00.980 --> 36:04.100
They are doing it at present and it should be banned.

36:04.100 --> 36:06.420
Now some people say, yes, but freedom of expression.

36:07.140 --> 36:10.500
No, bots don't have freedom of expression.

36:11.300 --> 36:16.260
There is no cost in terms of freedom of expression when you ban bots.

36:17.060 --> 36:21.300
So again, in some situations, yes, AIs should interact with us,

36:21.300 --> 36:25.220
but it should be very clear this is an AI talking to you,

36:25.220 --> 36:28.980
or this is an AI retweeting this story.

36:28.980 --> 36:32.420
It is not a human being making a conscious decision.

36:32.420 --> 36:36.020
To push back on this line of fake humans,

36:36.740 --> 36:38.420
because I think it might be a spectrum.

36:38.980 --> 36:42.260
First of all, you might have AI systems that are offended,

36:43.700 --> 36:46.580
hurt when you say that they're fake.

36:47.220 --> 36:47.720
Humans.

36:49.380 --> 36:51.860
In fact, they might start identifying as humans.

36:53.380 --> 36:57.380
And you just talked about the power of us humans

36:57.380 --> 37:01.220
with our collective intelligence to take fake stories and make them quite real.

37:02.420 --> 37:06.980
And so if the feelings you have for the fake human is real,

37:08.020 --> 37:14.900
you know, love is a kind of fake thing that we all kind of put a word to a set of feelings.

37:14.900 --> 37:18.500
What if you have that feeling for an AI system?

37:19.060 --> 37:27.300
It starts to change, I mean, maybe the kind of things AI systems are allowed to do.

37:27.300 --> 37:37.140
For good, they're allowed to create, communicate suffering, communicate the good stuff,

37:37.140 --> 37:40.980
the longing, the hope, the connection, the intimacy, all of that.

37:41.060 --> 37:44.340
And in that way, get integrated in our society.

37:44.340 --> 37:45.940
And then you start to ask a question on,

37:47.460 --> 37:49.300
are we allowed to really unplug them?

37:49.300 --> 37:51.140
Are we allowed to really censor them?

37:51.140 --> 37:54.900
Remove them, remove their voice from social media.

37:54.900 --> 37:56.260
They shouldn't have a voice.

37:56.260 --> 37:57.300
They shouldn't talk with us.

37:57.300 --> 38:00.980
I'm just saying when they talk with us, it should be clear that they are AI.

38:01.700 --> 38:02.100
That's it.

38:03.380 --> 38:05.860
You can have your voice as an AI.

38:05.860 --> 38:08.180
Again, I have some medical problem.

38:08.180 --> 38:10.420
I want to get advice from an AI doctor.

38:10.420 --> 38:13.540
That's fine, as long as I know that I'm talking with an AI.

38:14.420 --> 38:19.220
What should be banned is AI pretending to be a human being.

38:19.940 --> 38:24.980
This is something that will erode trust, and without trust, society collapses.

38:25.540 --> 38:29.540
This is something that especially will endanger democracies,

38:29.540 --> 38:33.220
because democracies are built on – democracy is a conversation, basically.

38:34.420 --> 38:36.820
And it's a conversation between people.

38:37.700 --> 38:44.820
If you now flood the public sphere with millions and potentially billions of AI agents

38:44.820 --> 38:51.460
that can hold conversations, they never sleep, they never eat, they don't have emotions of their own,

38:51.460 --> 38:57.780
they can get to know you and tailor their words specifically for you and your life story,

38:58.500 --> 39:07.140
they are becoming better than us at creating stories and ideas and so forth.

39:07.140 --> 39:14.180
If you flood the public sphere with that, this will ruin the conversation between people.

39:14.180 --> 39:16.260
It will ruin the trust between people.

39:16.980 --> 39:21.780
You will no longer be able to have a democracy in this situation.

39:21.780 --> 39:25.380
You can have other types of regimes, but no democracy.

39:25.860 --> 39:29.060
If we could talk about the big philosophical notion of truth, then.

39:30.660 --> 39:34.340
You've already talked about the capacity of humans.

39:34.340 --> 39:37.780
One of the things that made it special is stories.

39:39.540 --> 39:42.980
So, is there such thing as truth?

39:44.180 --> 39:44.820
Absolutely.

39:45.860 --> 39:46.420
What is truth, exactly?

39:46.420 --> 39:48.820
When somebody is suffering, that's true.

39:48.820 --> 39:54.340
I mean, this is why one of the things when you talk about suffering as a kind of ultimate reality,

39:54.340 --> 39:57.060
when somebody suffers, that is truth.

39:57.620 --> 40:00.820
Now, somebody can suffer because of a fictional story.

40:01.540 --> 40:07.700
Somebody tells people that God said you must go on this crusade and kill these heretics.

40:07.700 --> 40:09.140
This is a completely fictional story.

40:09.860 --> 40:13.700
People believe it, and they start a war, and they destroy cities and kill people.

40:14.500 --> 40:19.460
The people that suffer because of that, and even the crusaders themselves that also suffer

40:19.460 --> 40:25.540
the consequences of what they do, the suffering is true, even though it is caused by a fictional

40:25.540 --> 40:26.040
story.

40:26.740 --> 40:34.580
Similarly, when people agree on certain rules, the rules could come out of our imagination.

40:35.460 --> 40:41.140
Now, we can be truthful about it and say these rules, they didn't come from heaven,

40:41.140 --> 40:43.140
they came from our imagination.

40:43.140 --> 40:48.100
You know, we look at sports, so we have rules for the game of football, soccer.

40:49.060 --> 40:50.740
They were invented by people.

40:50.740 --> 40:55.860
Nobody, at least very few people claim that the rules of football came down from heaven.

40:55.860 --> 40:56.180
Yes.

40:56.180 --> 40:58.820
We invented them, and this is truthful.

40:58.820 --> 41:03.060
There are fictional rules invented by humans, and this is true.

41:03.060 --> 41:06.580
They were invented by humans, and when you are honest about it,

41:06.580 --> 41:11.940
it enables you to change the rules, which is being done in football every now and then.

41:11.940 --> 41:14.900
It's the same with the fundamental rules of a country.

41:15.540 --> 41:21.780
You can pretend that the rules came down from heaven, dictated by God or whatever,

41:21.780 --> 41:22.980
and then you can't change them.

41:23.620 --> 41:28.660
Or you can be like the American Constitution, which starts with the people.

41:28.660 --> 41:36.340
The American Constitution lays down certain rules for a society, but the amazing thing about it,

41:36.340 --> 41:40.020
it does not pretend to come from an external source.

41:40.660 --> 41:45.220
The Ten Commandments start with, I am your Lord God.

41:46.020 --> 41:49.700
And because it starts with that, you can't change them.

41:50.740 --> 41:54.900
You know, the Tenth Commandment, for instance, supports slavery.

41:54.900 --> 41:57.860
The Tenth Commandment, in the Tenth Commandment,

41:57.860 --> 42:01.460
it says that you should not covet your neighbor's house,

42:01.460 --> 42:04.660
or your neighbor's wife, or your neighbor's slaves.

42:05.460 --> 42:08.340
It's okay to hold slaves according to the Tenth Commandment.

42:08.340 --> 42:12.660
It's just bad to covet the slaves of your neighbor.

42:12.660 --> 42:16.820
Now, there is no Eleventh Commandment, which says,

42:16.820 --> 42:20.020
if you don't like some of the previous Ten Commandments,

42:20.020 --> 42:24.580
this is how you go about amending them, which is why we still have them unchanged.

42:25.380 --> 42:29.940
In the US Constitution, you have all these rights and rules,

42:29.940 --> 42:33.060
including originally the ability to hold slaves.

42:33.060 --> 42:37.380
But the genius of the founding fathers of the United States,

42:37.380 --> 42:44.580
they had the humility to understand maybe we don't understand everything.

42:45.220 --> 42:46.980
Maybe we made some mistakes.

42:46.980 --> 42:51.300
So we tell you that these rules did not come from heaven.

42:51.300 --> 42:53.060
They came from us humans.

42:53.060 --> 42:54.740
We may have made a mistake.

42:54.740 --> 43:00.740
So here is a mechanism for how future generations can amend the Constitution,

43:00.740 --> 43:05.300
which was used later on to, for instance, amend the Constitution to ban slavery.

43:05.940 --> 43:11.300
So now you're describing some interesting and powerful ideas throughout human history.

43:11.300 --> 43:17.300
Can you just speak to the mechanism of how humans believe, start to believe ideas?

43:17.300 --> 43:20.740
Is there something interesting to say there from your thinking about it?

43:22.100 --> 43:27.860
Like how idea is born and how it takes hold and how it spreads and how it competes with other ideas?

43:28.420 --> 43:31.780
First of all, ideas are an independent force in history.

43:32.660 --> 43:35.460
Marxists tend to deny that.

43:35.460 --> 43:41.700
Marxists think that all history is just a play of material interests.

43:42.660 --> 43:49.860
And ideas, stories, they are just a smoke screen to hide the underlying interests.

43:50.500 --> 43:53.940
My thoughts are, to some extent, the opposite.

43:55.460 --> 44:00.100
We have some biological objective interests that all humans share,

44:00.100 --> 44:04.420
like we need to eat, we need to drink, we need to breathe.

44:05.380 --> 44:08.020
But most conflicts in history are not about that.

44:08.900 --> 44:14.820
The interests which really drive most conflicts in history don't come from biology.

44:14.820 --> 44:18.980
They come from religions and ideologies and stories.

44:18.980 --> 44:24.900
So it's not that stories are a smoke screen to hide the real interests.

44:24.900 --> 44:29.140
The stories create the interests in the first place.

44:29.140 --> 44:32.260
The stories define who are the competing groups.

44:33.300 --> 44:37.540
Nations, religions, cultures, they are not biological entities.

44:37.540 --> 44:40.660
They are not like species, like gorillas and chimpanzees, no.

44:41.380 --> 44:46.260
Israelis and Palestinians or Germans and French or Chinese and Americans,

44:46.260 --> 44:50.100
they have no essential biological difference between them.

44:50.100 --> 44:51.540
The difference is cultural.

44:51.540 --> 44:52.900
It comes from stories.

44:52.900 --> 44:55.220
There are people that believe in different stories.

44:55.220 --> 44:57.700
The stories create the identity.

44:57.700 --> 44:59.780
The stories create the interests.

45:00.340 --> 45:03.460
Israelis and Palestinians are fighting over Jerusalem,

45:03.460 --> 45:05.620
not because of any material interest.

45:05.620 --> 45:09.860
There are no oil fields under Jerusalem and even oil.

45:09.860 --> 45:13.300
You need it to realize some cultural fantasy.

45:13.860 --> 45:15.380
It doesn't really come from biology.

45:16.180 --> 45:19.540
So the stories are independent forces.

45:19.540 --> 45:22.420
Now, why do people believe one story and not another?

45:23.220 --> 45:24.500
That's history.

45:24.500 --> 45:28.420
There is no materialistic law.

45:28.420 --> 45:30.260
People will always believe this.

45:30.260 --> 45:30.980
No.

45:30.980 --> 45:33.060
History is full of accidents.

45:33.700 --> 45:37.460
How did Christianity become the most successful religion in the world?

45:38.180 --> 45:39.220
We can't explain it.

45:40.980 --> 45:45.060
Why this story about Jesus of Nazareth and not, you know,

45:45.060 --> 45:50.900
the Roman Empire in the third century CE was a bit like, I don't know,

45:50.900 --> 45:52.260
California today.

45:52.260 --> 45:57.620
Like so many sects and subjects and gurus and religions,

45:57.620 --> 45:59.060
like everybody has their own thing.

45:59.860 --> 46:04.820
And you have, you know, thousands of different stories competing.

46:04.820 --> 46:06.900
Why did Christianity come up on top?

46:07.540 --> 46:11.380
As a historian, I don't have a kind of clear answer.

46:11.380 --> 46:17.460
You can read the sources and you see how it happens.

46:17.460 --> 46:20.820
Oh, this happened and then this happened and then Constantine adopted it

46:20.820 --> 46:21.780
and then this and then this.

46:22.340 --> 46:22.980
But why?

46:24.260 --> 46:26.660
I don't think anybody has an answer to that.

46:26.660 --> 46:31.460
If you rewind the movie of history and press play

46:31.460 --> 46:35.140
and you rewind and press play a hundred times,

46:35.140 --> 46:38.180
I think Christianity will take over the Roman Empire in the world,

46:38.180 --> 46:40.660
maybe twice out of a hundred times.

46:40.660 --> 46:43.380
It was such an unlikely thing to happen.

46:44.100 --> 46:45.300
It's the same with Islam.

46:45.860 --> 46:48.660
It's the same, I don't know, with the communist takeover of Russia.

46:49.620 --> 46:53.940
In 1914, if you told people that in three years,

46:53.940 --> 46:58.580
Lenin and the Bolsheviks will gain power in the Tsarist Empire,

46:58.580 --> 47:00.420
they would think you're utterly crazy.

47:01.060 --> 47:05.060
You know, Lenin had a few thousand supporters in 1914

47:05.060 --> 47:08.900
in an empire of close to 200 million people.

47:09.940 --> 47:11.220
It sounded ludicrous.

47:12.100 --> 47:16.580
Now, we know the chain of events, the First World War,

47:16.580 --> 47:21.300
the February Revolution and so forth that led to the communist takeover,

47:21.300 --> 47:23.460
but it was such an unlikely event.

47:24.420 --> 47:25.220
And it happened.

47:25.220 --> 47:26.580
And the little steps along the way,

47:26.580 --> 47:28.180
the little options you have along the way,

47:28.180 --> 47:30.180
because, you know, Stalin versus Trotsky,

47:30.180 --> 47:32.100
you could have the Robert Frost poem.

47:34.260 --> 47:36.660
And history often takes, you know,

47:36.660 --> 47:40.180
there is a highway and there is a kind of sideway

47:40.180 --> 47:43.540
and history takes the sideways many, many times.

47:43.540 --> 47:45.860
And it's perhaps tempting to tell some of that history

47:45.860 --> 47:47.860
through charismatic leaders.

47:47.860 --> 47:49.140
And maybe it's an open question

47:50.580 --> 47:55.220
how much power charismatic leaders have to affect the trajectory of history.

47:56.340 --> 47:58.740
You've met quite a lot of charismatic leaders lately.

47:58.740 --> 48:00.900
I mean, what's your view on that?

48:00.900 --> 48:02.980
I find it a compelling notion.

48:02.980 --> 48:05.620
I'm a sucker for a great speech and a vision.

48:05.620 --> 48:10.500
So I have a sense that there's an importance for a leader

48:11.620 --> 48:14.980
to catalyze the viral spread of a story.

48:16.180 --> 48:20.500
So like, I think we need leaders to be just great storytellers

48:21.540 --> 48:23.460
that kind of sharpen up the story

48:23.460 --> 48:26.580
to make sure it infiltrates everybody's brain effectively.

48:27.300 --> 48:29.940
But it could also be that

48:31.220 --> 48:34.100
the local interactions between humans is even more important.

48:34.660 --> 48:35.940
But it's just we don't have a good way

48:35.940 --> 48:37.780
to sort of summarize and describe that.

48:39.380 --> 48:42.420
We like to talk about, you know, Steve Jobs

48:43.140 --> 48:45.060
as central to the development of the computer,

48:45.060 --> 48:49.620
maybe Bill Gates, and you tell the stories of individuals like this

48:50.420 --> 48:52.820
because it's just easier to tell a sexy story that way.

48:52.820 --> 48:56.420
Maybe it's an interplay because you have the kind of structural forces

48:57.620 --> 49:01.940
that you look at the geography of the planet

49:01.940 --> 49:06.980
and you look at shipping technology in the late 15th century

49:07.620 --> 49:09.620
in Europe and the Mediterranean.

49:09.620 --> 49:13.300
And it's almost inevitable that pretty quickly

49:13.300 --> 49:15.620
somebody will discover America.

49:15.620 --> 49:18.580
Somebody from the old world will get to the new world.

49:19.620 --> 49:21.140
So this was not a kind of…

49:22.100 --> 49:23.380
If it wasn't Columbus,

49:23.380 --> 49:26.100
then it would have been five years later somebody else.

49:26.100 --> 49:29.140
But the key thing about history is that

49:29.140 --> 49:33.300
these small differences make a huge, huge difference.

49:34.100 --> 49:36.500
You know, if it wasn't Columbus,

49:36.500 --> 49:40.180
if it was five years later somebody from England,

49:40.820 --> 49:45.140
then maybe all of Latin America today would be speaking English and not Spanish.

49:45.140 --> 49:47.300
If it was somebody from the Ottoman Empire,

49:47.300 --> 49:51.700
it's completely different world history if you have…

49:51.700 --> 49:53.860
And, you know, the Ottoman Empire at that time

49:53.860 --> 49:58.740
was also shaping up to be a major maritime empire.

49:58.740 --> 50:04.900
If you have America being reached by Muslim navigators,

50:04.900 --> 50:06.980
before Christian navigators from Europe,

50:06.980 --> 50:08.740
you have a completely different world history.

50:09.460 --> 50:10.660
It's the same with the computer.

50:11.620 --> 50:18.340
Given the economic incentives and the science and technology of the time,

50:18.340 --> 50:23.220
then the rise of the personal computer was probably inevitable

50:23.220 --> 50:25.620
sometime in the late 20th century.

50:25.620 --> 50:28.820
But the where and when is crucial.

50:28.820 --> 50:33.300
The fact that it was California in the 1970s

50:33.300 --> 50:36.980
and not say, I don't know, Japan in the 1980s

50:36.980 --> 50:41.540
or China in the 1990s, this made a huge, huge difference.

50:41.540 --> 50:44.580
So you have this interplay between the structural forces

50:44.580 --> 50:49.060
which are beyond the control of any single charismatic leader.

50:49.060 --> 50:52.740
But then the small changes, they can have a big effect.

50:53.780 --> 50:55.540
I think, for instance, about the war in Ukraine.

50:56.100 --> 50:59.700
There was a moment, now it's a struggle between nations.

51:00.660 --> 51:04.180
But there was a moment when the decision was taken

51:04.180 --> 51:07.700
in the mind of a single individual of Vladimir Putin

51:07.700 --> 51:10.020
and he could have decided otherwise

51:10.020 --> 51:13.060
and the world would have looked completely different.

51:14.020 --> 51:16.900
And another leader, Vladimir Zelensky,

51:16.900 --> 51:19.860
could have decided to leave Kiev in the early days.

51:19.860 --> 51:21.620
There's a lot of decisions that kind of ripple.

51:22.980 --> 51:25.700
You write in Homo Deus about Hitler

51:27.300 --> 51:32.340
and in part that he was not a very impressive person.

51:33.060 --> 51:33.700
I say that?

51:34.820 --> 51:36.500
The quote is, let me read it.

51:39.620 --> 51:42.180
He wasn't a senior officer in four years of war.

51:42.180 --> 51:45.140
He rose no higher than the rank of corporal.

51:45.140 --> 51:47.060
He had no formal education.

51:47.060 --> 51:48.900
Perhaps you mean his resume.

51:48.900 --> 51:50.900
Yeah, his resume was not impressive.

51:51.700 --> 51:54.500
He had no formal education, no professional skills,

51:54.500 --> 51:55.860
no political background.

51:55.860 --> 51:58.900
He wasn't a successful businessman or a union activist.

51:58.900 --> 52:01.220
He didn't have friends or relatives in high places

52:01.220 --> 52:02.660
nor any money to speak of.

52:04.020 --> 52:06.660
So how did he amass so much power?

52:08.260 --> 52:11.700
What ideology, what circumstances enabled the rise of the Third Reich?

52:13.460 --> 52:15.060
Again, I can't tell you the why.

52:15.940 --> 52:17.300
I can tell you the how.

52:17.300 --> 52:18.580
I don't think it was inevitable.

52:19.300 --> 52:22.260
I think that if a few things were different,

52:22.260 --> 52:24.340
there would have been no Third Reich.

52:24.340 --> 52:26.500
There would have been no Nazism, no Holocaust.

52:26.500 --> 52:28.100
Again, this is the tragedy.

52:28.100 --> 52:29.860
If it would have been inevitable,

52:30.420 --> 52:30.980
what can you do?

52:30.980 --> 52:33.860
This is the laws of history or the laws of physics.

52:33.860 --> 52:37.140
But the tragedy is no, it was decisions by humans

52:37.860 --> 52:39.460
that led to that direction.

52:41.380 --> 52:43.380
Even from the viewpoint of the Germans,

52:45.060 --> 52:50.260
we know for a fact it was an unnecessary path to take.

52:50.260 --> 52:52.500
Because in the 1920s and 30s,

52:53.140 --> 52:59.140
the Nazis said that unless Germany take this road,

52:59.860 --> 53:01.620
it will never be prosperous.

53:01.620 --> 53:03.300
It will never be successful.

53:03.300 --> 53:05.940
All the other countries will keep stepping on it.

53:05.940 --> 53:08.500
This was their claim.

53:09.380 --> 53:11.860
We know for a fact this is false.

53:12.420 --> 53:13.220
Why?

53:13.220 --> 53:15.060
Because they took that road,

53:15.780 --> 53:18.100
they lost the Second World War,

53:18.900 --> 53:20.420
and after they lost,

53:21.060 --> 53:25.620
then they became one of the most prosperous countries in the world

53:25.620 --> 53:28.980
because their enemies that defeated them

53:28.980 --> 53:31.940
evidently supported them and allowed them

53:31.940 --> 53:34.980
to become such a prosperous and successful nation.

53:36.260 --> 53:40.660
If you can lose the war and still be so successful,

53:40.660 --> 53:42.740
obviously you could just have skipped the war.

53:42.740 --> 53:43.700
You didn't need it.

53:45.300 --> 53:49.380
You really had to have the war in order to have a prosperous Germany.

53:49.940 --> 53:50.820
Absolutely not.

53:51.460 --> 53:52.580
It's the same with Japan.

53:52.580 --> 53:53.700
It's the same with Italy.

53:56.420 --> 53:57.780
It was not inevitable.

53:57.780 --> 54:00.420
It was not the forces of history that necessitated

54:01.060 --> 54:04.500
that forced Germany to take this path.

54:05.700 --> 54:10.020
I think part of it is part of the appeal of...

54:10.020 --> 54:13.620
Again, Hitler was a very, very skillful storyteller.

54:14.420 --> 54:16.660
He sold people a story.

54:16.660 --> 54:20.580
The fact that he was nobody made it even more effective

54:21.220 --> 54:23.300
because people at that time,

54:24.100 --> 54:26.820
after the defeat of the First World War,

54:26.820 --> 54:31.220
after the repeated economic crisis of the 1920s in Germany,

54:31.220 --> 54:37.460
people felt betrayed by all the established elites,

54:37.460 --> 54:39.620
by all the established institutions,

54:39.620 --> 54:43.860
all these professors and politicians and industrialists and military,

54:43.860 --> 54:44.980
all the big people,

54:44.980 --> 54:48.340
they led us to a disastrous war.

54:48.340 --> 54:50.260
They led us to humiliation.

54:50.260 --> 54:52.100
So we don't want any of them.

54:52.180 --> 54:56.900
And then you have this nobody, a corporal with no money,

54:56.900 --> 54:59.620
with no education, with no titles, with nothing.

54:59.620 --> 55:01.220
And he tells people, I'm one of you.

55:02.740 --> 55:06.420
And this was one reason why he was so popular.

55:07.540 --> 55:09.060
And then the story he told,

55:10.180 --> 55:11.780
when you look at stories,

55:11.780 --> 55:14.180
at the competition between different stories

55:14.180 --> 55:16.500
and between stories fiction and the truth,

55:18.100 --> 55:20.420
the truth has two big problems.

55:21.380 --> 55:26.580
The truth tends to be complicated and the truth tends to be painful.

55:28.100 --> 55:31.940
The real story of, let's talk about nations,

55:31.940 --> 55:35.060
the real story of every nation is complicated

55:35.860 --> 55:39.300
and it contains some painful episodes.

55:39.300 --> 55:41.140
We are not always good.

55:41.140 --> 55:42.820
We sometimes do bad things.

55:43.380 --> 55:49.380
Now, if you go to people and you tell them a complicated and painful story,

55:49.460 --> 55:50.740
many of them don't want to listen.

55:51.460 --> 55:55.780
The advantage of fiction is that it can be made as simple

55:56.740 --> 56:00.740
and as painless or attractive as you want it to be because it's fiction.

56:02.420 --> 56:05.860
And then what you see is that politicians like Hitler,

56:06.660 --> 56:09.940
they create a very simple story.

56:09.940 --> 56:11.220
We are the heroes.

56:11.220 --> 56:12.820
We always do good things.

56:12.820 --> 56:14.180
Everybody's against us.

56:14.180 --> 56:16.740
Everybody's trying to trample us.

56:17.380 --> 56:19.860
And this is very attractive.

56:19.860 --> 56:22.980
One of the things people don't understand about Nazism and fascism,

56:24.260 --> 56:29.300
we teach in schools about fascism and Nazism as this ultimate evil,

56:29.860 --> 56:32.180
the ultimate monster in human history.

56:32.740 --> 56:41.380
And at some level, this is wrong because it actually exposes us.

56:42.020 --> 56:42.660
Why?

56:42.660 --> 56:45.300
Because people hear how fascism is this monster.

56:46.100 --> 56:50.100
And then when you hear the actual fascist story,

56:50.100 --> 56:56.180
what fascists tell you is always very beautiful and attractive.

56:56.740 --> 56:58.900
Fascists are people who come and tell you,

56:58.900 --> 56:59.780
you are wonderful.

57:00.500 --> 57:03.860
You belong to the most wonderful group of people in the world.

57:03.860 --> 57:05.220
You are beautiful.

57:05.220 --> 57:06.420
You are ethical.

57:06.420 --> 57:07.860
Everything you do is good.

57:07.860 --> 57:10.020
You have never done anything wrong.

57:10.020 --> 57:12.580
There are all these evil monsters out there

57:13.220 --> 57:14.740
that are out to get you.

57:14.820 --> 57:16.740
And they are causing all the problems in the world.

57:17.700 --> 57:20.900
And when people hear that, it's like looking in the mirror

57:21.700 --> 57:23.380
and seeing something very beautiful.

57:23.380 --> 57:24.260
Hey, I'm beautiful.

57:25.380 --> 57:26.980
We've never done anything wrong.

57:26.980 --> 57:27.860
We are victims.

57:29.700 --> 57:32.420
And when you look and you heard in school

57:32.420 --> 57:35.300
that fascists are monsters,

57:35.300 --> 57:37.940
and you look in the mirror, you see something very beautiful.

57:37.940 --> 57:41.300
And you say, I can't be a fascist because fascists are monsters.

57:41.300 --> 57:43.220
And this is so beautiful, so it can't be.

57:43.940 --> 57:47.460
But when you look in the fascist mirror,

57:47.460 --> 57:50.180
you never see a monster.

57:50.180 --> 57:52.740
You see the most beautiful thing in the world.

57:53.540 --> 57:54.660
And that's the danger.

57:54.660 --> 57:56.420
This is the problem with Hollywood.

57:57.860 --> 58:00.340
I look at Voldemort in Harry Potter.

58:00.340 --> 58:02.660
Who would like to follow this creep?

58:03.540 --> 58:05.860
And you look at Darth Vader.

58:05.860 --> 58:08.340
This is not somebody you would like to follow.

58:08.340 --> 58:10.580
Christianity got things much better

58:10.660 --> 58:14.980
when it described the devil as being very beautiful and attractive.

58:15.700 --> 58:16.820
That's the danger.

58:17.620 --> 58:19.860
That you see something as very beautiful,

58:19.860 --> 58:22.340
you don't understand the monster underneath.

58:23.220 --> 58:25.140
And you write precisely about this.

58:25.140 --> 58:26.900
And by the way, it's just a small aside.

58:28.740 --> 58:32.100
It always saddens me when people say how obvious it is to them

58:32.100 --> 58:34.580
that communism is a flawed ideology.

58:35.380 --> 58:39.460
When you ask them, try to put your mind,

58:39.540 --> 58:43.140
try to put yourself in the beginning of the 20th century

58:43.140 --> 58:44.260
and see what you would do.

58:44.260 --> 58:47.780
A lot of people will say it's obvious that it's a flawed ideology.

58:49.380 --> 58:52.020
As opposed to some of the worst ideologies in human history,

58:52.020 --> 58:53.220
you could say the same.

58:53.220 --> 58:56.340
And in that mirror, when you look, it looks beautiful.

58:56.340 --> 58:57.380
Communism is the same.

58:57.380 --> 58:59.300
Also, you look in the communist mirror,

58:59.300 --> 59:02.740
you're the most ethical, wonderful person ever.

59:03.460 --> 59:06.180
It's very difficult to see Stalin underneath it.

59:06.580 --> 59:09.220
So yeah, in Homo Deus, you also write,

59:09.220 --> 59:11.620
during the 19th and 20th centuries,

59:11.620 --> 59:15.620
as humanism gained increasing social credibility and political power,

59:15.620 --> 59:17.620
it sprouted two very different offshoots.

59:18.260 --> 59:19.540
Socialist humanism,

59:19.540 --> 59:22.740
which encompassed a plethora of socialist and communist movements,

59:22.740 --> 59:25.380
and evolutionary humanism,

59:25.380 --> 59:27.780
whose most famous advocates were the Nazis.

59:27.780 --> 59:29.540
So if you can just linger on that,

59:29.540 --> 59:31.940
what's the ideological connection between

59:31.940 --> 59:34.820
Nazism and communism as embodied by humanism?

59:35.620 --> 59:39.620
And humanism basically is, you know, the focus is on humans.

59:40.260 --> 59:44.260
That they are the most important thing in the world.

59:44.260 --> 59:45.300
They move history.

59:46.020 --> 59:47.860
But then there is a big question.

59:47.860 --> 59:49.540
What is, what are humans?

59:49.540 --> 59:50.660
What is humanity?

59:51.380 --> 59:57.060
Now, liberals, they place at the center of the story,

59:57.620 --> 59:59.220
individual humans,

59:59.220 --> 01:00:03.940
and they don't see history as a kind of necessary collision.

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:06.260
Between big forces.

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:08.660
They place the individual at the center.

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:10.340
If you want to know, you know, there is a bad,

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:13.060
especially in the US today,

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:16.180
liberal is taken as the opposite of conservative.

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.700
But it's, to test whether you're liberal,

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.700
you need to answer just three questions.

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:22.340
Very simple.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:27.220
Do you think people should have the right to choose their own government?

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:31.940
Or the government should be imposed by some outside force?

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.420
Do you think people should have the right

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:38.980
to the liberty to choose their own profession?

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:42.740
Or either born into some caste that predetermines what they do?

01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:47.300
And do you think people should have the liberty to choose their own spouse?

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:50.980
And their own way of personal life?

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:55.220
Instead of being told by elders or parents who to marry and how to live?

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.820
Now, if you answered yes to all three questions,

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:01.540
people should have the liberty to choose their government,

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:05.700
their profession, their personal lives, their spouse, the neoliberal.

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.860
And most conservatives are also liberal.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:15.220
Now, communists and fascists, they answer differently.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:20.740
For them, history is not, yes, history is about humans.

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:22.660
Humans are the big heroes of history,

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:25.140
but not individual humans and their liberties.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:33.620
Fascists imagine history as a clash between races or nations.

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:35.380
The nation is at the center.

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:40.020
They say the supreme good is the good of the nation.

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:44.020
You should have a hundred percent loyalty only to the nation.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.060
You know, liberals say, yes, you should be loyal to the nation,

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:48.020
but it's not the only thing.

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:50.420
There are other things in the world.

01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:51.940
There are human rights.

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:53.140
There is truth.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:54.100
There is beauty.

01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:58.980
Many times, yes, you should prefer the interests of your nation

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:01.300
over other things, but not always.

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:05.940
If your nation tells you to murder millions of innocent people,

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:08.980
you don't do that, even though the nation tells you to do it.

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:16.980
To lie for the national interest, you know, in extreme situations, maybe.

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:20.660
But in many cases, your loyalty should be to the truth,

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:25.940
even if it makes your nation look a bit not in the best light.

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:27.940
The same with beauty.

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:31.540
You know, how does a fascist determine whether a movie is a good movie?

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:32.900
Very simple.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:36.340
If it serves the interest of the nation, this is a good movie.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:39.780
If it's against the interest of the nation, this is a bad movie.

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:40.500
End of story.

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:46.260
Liberalism says, no, there is aesthetic values in the world.

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:53.380
We should judge movies not just on the question whether they serve the national interest,

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:55.220
but also on artistic value.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:00.100
Communists are a bit like the fascists.

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:03.620
Instead, they don't place the nation as the main hero.

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:06.580
They place class as the main hero.

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:08.900
For them, history, again, it's not about individuals.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.100
It's not about nations.

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:13.460
History is the clash between classes.

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:17.940
Just as fascists imagine in the end, only one nation will be on top,

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.780
the communists think in the end, only one class should be on top,

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:23.620
and that's the proletariat.

01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:25.140
Same story.

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:30.100
100% of your loyalty should be to the class.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:36.100
If there is a clash, say, between class and family, class wins.

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:39.780
Like in the Soviet Union, the party told children,

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:44.180
if you hear your parents say something bad about Stalin,

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:46.740
you have to report them.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:50.180
And there are many cases when children reported their parents

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:51.940
and their parents were sent to the Gulag.

01:03:55.060 --> 01:04:00.660
Your loyalty is to the party, which leads the proletariat to victory

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.100
in the historical struggle.

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:07.940
And the same way in communism, art is only about class struggle.

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:12.500
A movie is good if it serves the interests of the proletariat.

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.620
Autistic values?

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:14.820
There is nothing like that.

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.180
And the same with truth.

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:19.220
Everything that we see now in fake news,

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.300
the communist propaganda machine was there before us.

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:28.900
The level of lies, of disinformation campaigns

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:33.620
that they orchestrated in the 1920s and 30s and 40s

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:36.100
is really unimaginable.

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:40.420
So the reason these two ideologies,

01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:43.620
classes of ideologies failed is the sacrifice of truth,

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:47.460
not just failed, but did a lot of damage,

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.780
is the sacrifice of truth and sacrifice of beauty.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:52.820
And sacrifice of hundreds of millions of people,

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:54.980
disregard, again, for human suffering.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:59.140
Like, okay, in order for our nation to win,

01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:01.060
in order for our class to win,

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:03.380
we need to kill those millions, kill those millions.

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:08.820
That was an ethics, aesthetics, truth.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:09.780
They don't matter.

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:13.860
The only thing that matters is the victory of the state

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:15.620
or the victory of the class.

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:20.740
And liberalism was the antithesis to that.

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:26.660
It says no, not only, it has a much more complicated view

01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:28.820
of the world, and both communism and fascism,

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:30.980
they had a very simple view of the world.

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:35.860
There is one, your loyalty, a hundred percent of it

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:37.300
should be only to one thing.

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:41.220
Now, liberalism has a much more complex view of the world.

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:44.020
It says, yes, there are nations, they are important.

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.260
Yes, there are classes, they are important,

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:48.180
but they are not the only thing.

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:49.620
There are also families.

01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:52.900
There are also individuals.

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:54.260
There are also animals.

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:58.740
And your loyalty should be divided between all of them.

01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.500
Sometimes you prefer this.

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.020
Sometimes you prefer that.

01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:06.900
That's complicated, but life is complicated.

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:09.380
But also, I think, maybe you can correct me,

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:13.060
but liberalism acknowledges the corrupting nature of power

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:17.220
when there's a guy at the top, sits there for a while,

01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:21.060
managing things, is probably going to start losing

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:27.300
a good sense of reality and losing the capability

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.740
to be a good manager.

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:33.140
It feels like the communist and fascist regimes

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:36.980
don't acknowledge that basic characteristic

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:38.900
of human nature that power corrupts.

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:40.820
Yes, they believe in infallibility.

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:44.740
In this sense, they are very close to being religions.

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:49.300
In Nazism, Hitler was considered infallible.

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:52.740
And therefore, you don't need any checks and balances

01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.020
on his power.

01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:56.420
Why do you need to balance an infallible genius?

01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:58.660
And it's the same with the Soviet Union.

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:02.900
With Stalin and more generally with the Communist Party,

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:05.700
the party can never make a mistake.

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:08.580
And therefore, you don't need independent courts,

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:12.500
independent media, opposition parties, things like that,

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.740
because the party is never wrong.

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:16.740
You concentrate the same way.

01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:20.100
A hundred percent of loyalty should be to the party.

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:24.260
A hundred percent of power should be in the hands of the party.

01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:27.940
The whole idea of liberal democracy is embracing fallibility.

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:29.300
Everybody is fallible.

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:33.540
All people, all leaders, all political parties,

01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:34.580
all institutions.

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:36.340
This is why we need checks and balances,

01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:37.620
and we need many of them.

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:42.580
If you have just one, then this particular check

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.060
itself could make terrible mistakes.

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:50.020
So you need a press, you need the media

01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:52.100
to serve as a check to the government.

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:54.020
You don't have just one newspaper.

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:55.540
Or one TV station.

01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:58.500
You need many so that they can balance each other.

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.020
And the media is not enough.

01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:01.780
So you have independent courts.

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:03.940
You have free academic institutions.

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:05.300
You have NGOs.

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.220
You have a lot of checks and balances.

01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:10.420
So that's the ideologies and the leaders.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.260
What about the individual people,

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:15.140
the millions of people that play a part in all of this,

01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:22.180
that are the hosts of the stories

01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:26.740
that are the catalyst and the components

01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:28.020
of how the story spreads.

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:32.100
Would you say that all of us are capable

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:33.540
of spreading any story?

01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:41.060
The Solzhenitsyn idea that all of us are capable

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:41.940
of good and evil.

01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:44.420
The line between good and evil runs

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.460
to the heart of every man.

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:46.760
Yes.

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:49.460
I wouldn't say that every person

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:51.780
is capable of every type of evil.

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:53.940
But we are all fallible.

01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:57.140
There is a large element.

01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:59.540
It partly depends on the efforts we make

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:03.220
to develop our self-awareness during life.

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.500
Part of it depends on moral luck.

01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:12.260
If you are born as a Christian German

01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:16.100
in the 1910s or 1920s,

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.020
and you grow up in Nazi Germany,

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.700
that's bad moral luck.

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:23.700
Your chances of committing terrible things,

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:26.100
you have a very high chance of doing it.

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:29.300
And you can withstand it,

01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:32.020
but it will take tremendous effort.

01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:35.380
If you are born in Germany after the war,

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:36.420
you're morally lucky.

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:40.260
You will not be put to such a test.

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:44.340
You will not need to exert these enormous efforts

01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.700
not to commit atrocities.

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:48.900
This is just part of history.

01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:50.660
There is an element of luck.

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:53.940
But again, part of it is also self-awareness.

01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:56.180
And you asked me earlier

01:09:56.180 --> 01:10:00.340
about the potential of power to corrupt.

01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:01.620
And I listened to the interview

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:04.020
you just did with Prime Minister Netanyahu

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.220
a couple of days ago.

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:07.700
And one of the things that most struck me

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:09.700
during the interview that you asked him,

01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:11.780
you asked him,

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:16.020
are you afraid of this thing that power corrupts?

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:18.180
He didn't think for a single second.

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:19.380
He didn't pose.

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:26.180
He didn't admit a tiny little level of doubt.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.340
It was, no, power doesn't corrupt.

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:34.580
For me, it was a shocking and a revealing moment.

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:37.620
And it kind of dovetails with how you began the interview

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:40.340
that I really liked your opening gambit.

01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:44.420
No, really, you kind of told him,

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:47.700
lots of people in the world are angry with you.

01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:49.540
Some people hate you.

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.060
They dislike you.

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:54.340
What do you want to tell them, to say to them?

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.100
And you gave him this kind of platform.

01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:00.260
And I was very, what will he say?

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.020
And he just denied it.

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:04.180
He basically denied it.

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.820
He had to cut short the interview

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.660
from three hours to one hour

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:11.540
because you had hundreds of thousands of Israelis

01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:14.020
in the streets demonstrating against him.

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:15.940
And he goes and say, no, everybody likes me.

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:16.900
What are you talking about?

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:20.180
But on that topic, you've said recently that

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.060
the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,

01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:27.620
may go down in history as the man who destroys Israel.

01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:28.980
Can you explain what you mean by that?

01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:33.380
Yes, I mean, he is basically tearing apart

01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:36.900
the social contract that held this country together

01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:38.500
for 75 years.

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:42.180
He's destroying the foundations of Israeli democracy.

01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:45.940
I don't want to go too deep unless he wants it

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:48.180
because I guess most of our listeners,

01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:50.420
they have bigger issues on their minds

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.740
than the fate of some small country in the Middle East.

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:55.300
But for those who want to understand

01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:56.660
what's happening in Israel,

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:58.980
there is really just one question to ask.

01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:02.660
What limits the power of the government?

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:05.780
In the United States, for instance,

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:09.220
there are a lot of checks and balances

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:11.380
that limit the power of the government.

01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:14.980
You have the Supreme Court.

01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:16.100
You have the Senate.

01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:17.780
You have the House of Representatives.

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:18.900
You have the President.

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:20.580
You have the Constitution.

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:21.780
You have 50 states.

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.020
Each state with its own constitution

01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:28.180
and Supreme Court and Congress and governor.

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:31.140
If somebody wants to pass a dangerous legislation,

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:31.940
say in the House,

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:35.380
it will have to go through so many obstacles.

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:39.300
Like if you want to pass a law in the United States

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:43.300
taking away voting rights from Jews

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:46.100
or from Muslims or from African Americans,

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:47.380
even if it passes,

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:50.420
even if it has a majority in the House of Representatives,

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:52.900
it is a very, very, very small chance

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.740
of becoming the law of the country

01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:56.820
because it will have to pass again through the Senate,

01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:58.900
through the President, through the Supreme Court

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:00.260
and all the federal structure.

01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:04.980
In Israel, we have just a single check

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.500
on the power of the government

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:07.540
and that's the Supreme Court.

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:10.020
There is really no difference

01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:12.660
between the government and the legislature

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:16.100
because there are no separate elections like in the US.

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:19.700
If you win majority in the Knesset, in the parliament,

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.140
you appoint the government.

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:22.820
That's very simple.

01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:27.300
And if you have 61 members of Knesset who vote,

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:30.420
let's say on a law to take away voting rights

01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.500
from Arab citizens of Israel,

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:35.700
there is a single check that can prevent it

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:36.980
from becoming the law of the land

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:37.940
and that's the Supreme Court.

01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:40.900
And now the Netanyahu government

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:44.420
is trying to neutralize or take over the Supreme Court

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:47.620
and they've already prepared a long list of laws.

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:48.820
They already talk about it.

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:51.700
What will happen the moment

01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:54.260
that this last check on the power is gone?

01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:59.700
They are openly trying to gain unlimited power

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:03.620
and they openly talk about it that once they have it,

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:08.500
then they will take away the rights of Arabs,

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:12.180
of LGBT people, of women, of secular Jews.

01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:15.380
And this is why you have hundreds of thousands of people

01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:16.420
in the streets.

01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:22.660
You have air force pilots saying we stop flying.

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:28.260
We are still living under existential threat

01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:31.860
from Iran, from other enemies.

01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:33.380
And in the middle of this,

01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:37.060
you have air force pilots who dedicated their lives

01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:40.660
to protecting the country and they are saying that's it.

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:44.660
If this government doesn't stop what it is doing,

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:45.700
we stop flying.

01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:51.140
So as you said, I just did the interview

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:52.420
and as we were doing the interview,

01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:53.940
there's protests in the streets.

01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.900
Do you think the protests will have an effect?

01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:59.460
I hope so very much.

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:01.220
I'm going to many of these protests.

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:03.540
I hope they will have an effect.

01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:07.940
If we fail, this is the end of Israeli democracy, probably.

01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:12.740
This will have repercussions far beyond the borders of Israel.

01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:14.100
Israel is a nuclear power.

01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:20.020
Israel has one of the most advanced cyber capabilities

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:22.980
in the world, able to strike basically anywhere in the world.

01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:28.020
If this country becomes a fundamentalist

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:29.700
and militarist dictatorship,

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:33.780
it can set fire to the entire Middle East.

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:36.500
It can again have destabilizing effects

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:41.460
long, far beyond the borders of Israel.

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:43.300
So you think without the check on power

01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:48.020
it's possible that the Netanyahu government holds on to power?

01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:51.140
Nobody tries to gain unlimited power just for nothing.

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:54.500
I mean, you have so many problems in Israel

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.820
and Netanyahu talks so much about Iran

01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:58.660
and the Palestinians and Hezbollah.

01:15:58.660 --> 01:15:59.940
We have an economic crisis.

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:04.900
Why is it so urgent at this moment in the face of such opposition?

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:10.180
Why is it so crucial for them to neutralize the Supreme Court?

01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:12.740
They are just doing it for the fun of it?

01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:14.980
No, they know what they are doing.

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:16.580
They are adamant.

01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:18.580
We are not sure of it before.

01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:21.140
There was like a couple of months ago

01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:23.940
they came out with this plan to take over the Supreme Court

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:25.220
to have all these laws

01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:27.780
and there were hundreds of thousands of people in the streets.

01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:30.820
Again, soldiers saying they will stop serving

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:33.860
a general strike in the economy and they stopped.

01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:37.140
And they started a process of negotiations

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:39.780
to try and enrich a settlement.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:44.580
And then they broke down, they stopped the negotiations

01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:49.300
and they restarted this process of legislation

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.620
trying to gain unlimited power.

01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:54.580
So any doubt we had before,

01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:56.820
okay, maybe they changed their purposes.

01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:58.980
No, it's now very clear.

01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:04.740
They are 100% focused on gaining absolute power.

01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:07.540
They are now trying a different tactic.

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:10.820
Previously, they had all these dozens of laws

01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:13.780
that they wanted to pass very quickly within a month or two.

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:18.100
They realized, no, there is too much opposition.

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:21.220
So now they are doing what is known as salami tactics.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.580
Slice by slice.

01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.580
Now they're trying to one law.

01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:27.300
If this succeeds, then they'll pass the next one

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.660
and the next one and the next one.

01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:31.700
This is why we are now at a very crucial moment.

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:32.820
And what you see again,

01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:36.340
hundreds of thousands of people in the streets almost every day.

01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:39.780
When you see resistance within the armed forces,

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.140
within the security forces,

01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:43.300
you see high-tech companies saying,

01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:44.340
we will go on strike.

01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:46.180
You know, it's the private businesses,

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:48.020
high-tech companies.

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:50.820
I think it's almost unprecedented

01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:53.140
for a private business to go on strike

01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:57.780
because what will economic success benefit us

01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:02.260
if we live under a messianic dictatorship?

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:04.660
And again, the fuel for this whole thing

01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:08.820
is to a large extent coming from messianic religious groups,

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:14.180
which just the thought what happens if these people

01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:19.540
have unlimited control of Israel's nuclear arsenal

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:21.540
and Israel's military capabilities

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.060
and cyber capabilities.

01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:25.140
This is very, very scary,

01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:27.140
not just for the citizens of Israel.

01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:29.860
It should be scary for people everywhere.

01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:37.860
It would be scary for it to go from being a problem of security

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:41.060
and protecting the peace to becoming a religious war.

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.540
It is already becoming a religious war.

01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:47.380
The conflict with the Palestinians

01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:50.260
was for many years a national conflict in essence.

01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:54.820
Over the last few years, maybe a decade or two,

01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:59.060
it is morphing into a religious conflict,

01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:01.540
which is again a very worrying development.

01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.620
When nations are in conflict,

01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:05.460
you can reach some compromise.

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:06.820
Okay, you have this bit of land,

01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:08.180
we have this bit of land.

01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:10.660
But when it becomes a religious conflict

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:12.340
between fundamentalists,

01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:13.780
between messianic people,

01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:17.540
compromise becomes much more difficult

01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:19.940
because you don't compromise on eternity.

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:22.340
You don't compromise on God.

01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:25.700
And this is where we are heading right now.

01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:28.340
So I know you said it's a small nation

01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:30.180
somewhere in the Middle East,

01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:33.620
but it also happens to be the epicenter

01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:35.140
of one of the longest-running,

01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:38.660
one of the most tense conflicts and crises in human history.

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:40.900
So at the very least,

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:45.460
it serves as a study of how conflict can be resolved.

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:47.940
So what are the biggest obstacles to you

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.980
to achieving peace in this part of the world?

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:52.500
Motivation.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.500
I think it's easy to achieve peace

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:57.300
if you have the motivation on both sides.

01:19:57.300 --> 01:20:00.180
Unfortunately, at the present juncture,

01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:02.740
there is not enough motivation on either side,

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:05.540
either the Palestinian or Israeli side.

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:09.220
And peace, you know, in mathematics,

01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:11.460
you have problems without solutions.

01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:13.220
You can prove mathematically

01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:16.660
that this mathematical problem has no solution.

01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:18.500
In politics, there is no such thing.

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:23.700
All problems have solutions if you have the motivation.

01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:26.900
And but motivation is the big problem.

01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:29.700
And again, we can go into the reasons why,

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:33.780
but the fact is that on neither side,

01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:35.620
is there enough motivation?

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.300
If there was motivation,

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:39.940
the solution would have been easy.

01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.540
Is there an important distinction to draw

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:44.260
between the people on the street

01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:50.580
and the leaders in power in terms of motivation?

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:57.540
So are most people motivated and hoping for peace,

01:20:57.540 --> 01:21:01.140
and the leaders are motivated and incentivized to continue war?

01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:01.780
I don't think so.

01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:03.140
Or the people also?

01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:04.660
I think it's a deep problem.

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:05.860
It's also the people.

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.540
It's not just the leaders.

01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:12.660
Is it even a human problem of literally hate in people's heart?

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:14.740
Yeah, there is a lot of hate.

01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:16.340
One of the things that happened in Israel

01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:19.460
over the last 10 years or so,

01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:22.660
Israel became much stronger than it was before,

01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:25.620
largely thanks to technological developments.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:29.140
And it feels that it no longer needs to compromise.

01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:33.140
That there are many reasons for it,

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:34.820
but some of them are technological.

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:41.220
Being one of the leading powers in cyber,

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:43.860
in AI, in high tech,

01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:48.740
we have developed very sophisticated ways

01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:52.660
to more easily control the Palestinian population.

01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:55.300
In the early 2000s,

01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:58.180
it seemed that it is becoming impossible

01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:00.660
to control millions of people against their will.

01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:02.740
It took too much power.

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:05.700
It spilled too much blood on both sides.

01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:08.260
So there was an impression,

01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:09.700
oh, this is becoming untenable.

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:13.220
And there were several reasons why it changed,

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:14.820
but one of them was new technology.

01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:19.540
Israel developed very sophisticated surveillance technology

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:24.580
that has made it much easier for Israeli security forces

01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:28.740
to control 2.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank

01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:34.020
against their will with a lot less effort,

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:36.660
less boots on the ground, also less blood.

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:41.700
And Israel is also now exporting this technology

01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:44.020
to many other regimes around the world.

01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:48.020
Again, I heard Netanyahu speaking about all the wonderful things

01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:50.020
that Israel is exporting to the world, and it's true.

01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:51.780
We are exporting some nice things.

01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:55.620
Water systems and new kinds of tomatoes.

01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:59.940
We are also exporting a lot of weapons

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:03.380
and especially surveillance systems,

01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:10.260
sometimes to unsavory regimes in order to control their populations.

01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:15.380
Can you comment on, I think you've mentioned that

01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:20.180
the current state of affairs is a de facto three-class state.

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:22.660
Can you describe what you mean by that?

01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:25.380
Yes, for many years, the kind of leading solution

01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:28.500
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the two-state solution.

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:30.100
Can you describe what that means, by the way?

01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:33.620
Yes, two states within between the Jordan River

01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:35.460
and the Mediterranean will have two states.

01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:39.300
Israel is a predominantly Jewish state

01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:42.260
and Palestine is a predominantly Palestinian state.

01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:45.780
Again, there are lots of discussions where the border passes,

01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:48.180
what happens with security arrangement and whatever,

01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:49.940
but this was the big solution.

01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:54.020
Israel has basically abandoned the two-state solution.

01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:56.660
Maybe they don't say so officially, the people in power,

01:23:56.660 --> 01:24:00.020
but in terms of what they do on the ground, they abandoned it.

01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:05.220
Now they are effectively promoting the three-class solution,

01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:09.540
which means there is just one country and one government

01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:13.780
and one power between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River,

01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:18.340
but you have three classes of people living there.

01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:22.980
You have Jews who enjoy full rights, all the rights.

01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:28.580
You have some Arabs who are Israeli citizens and have some rights,

01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:31.060
and then you have the other Arabs, the third class,

01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:34.420
who have basically no civil rights and limited human rights.

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:38.100
Nobody would openly speak about it,

01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:42.420
but effectively this is the reality on the ground already.

01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:44.100
So there's many, and I'll speak with them,

01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:48.980
Palestinians who characterize this as a de facto one-state apartheid.

01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:51.380
Do you agree with this?

01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:53.380
I would take issue with the term apartheid.

01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:54.980
Generally speaking, as a historian,

01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:57.220
I don't really like historical analogies

01:24:57.220 --> 01:25:00.100
because there are always differences, key differences.

01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:03.540
The biggest difference between the situation here

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:07.540
and the situation in South Africa in the time of the apartheid

01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:14.900
is that black South Africans did not deny the existence of South Africa

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:18.260
and did not call for the destruction of South Africa.

01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:21.620
They had a very simple goal.

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:23.220
They had a very simple demand.

01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:26.500
We want to be equal citizens of this country.

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:26.980
That's it.

01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:32.660
And the apartheid regime was, no, you can't be equal citizens.

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:35.460
Now, in Israel and Palestine, it's different.

01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:39.540
The Palestinians, many of them don't recognize the existence of Israel,

01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:42.980
are not willing to recognize it,

01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:45.460
and they don't demand to be citizens of Israel.

01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:51.460
They demand some of them to destroy it and replace it with a Palestinian state.

01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:53.220
Some of them demand a separate state.

01:25:53.700 --> 01:26:01.860
But if the Palestinians would adopt the same policy as the black South Africans,

01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:04.020
if you have the Palestinians coming and saying,

01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:05.940
okay, forget about it.

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.460
We don't want to destroy Israel.

01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:08.980
We don't know a Palestinian country.

01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:12.020
We have a very simple request, very simple demand.

01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:14.500
Give us our full rights.

01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:17.380
We also want to vote to the Knesset.

01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:19.780
We also want to get the full protection of the law.

01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:20.340
That's it.

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:21.380
That's our only demand.

01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:25.380
Israel will be in deep, deep trouble at that moment,

01:26:26.340 --> 01:26:27.220
but we are not there.

01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:31.780
I wonder if there will ever be a future when such a thing happens,

01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:34.100
where everybody, the majority of people,

01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:36.580
Arab and Jew,

01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:38.820
Israeli and Palestinian,

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:42.660
accept the one-state solution and say we want equal rights.

01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:46.740
Never say never in history.

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:49.300
It's not coming anytime soon from either side.

01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:52.580
When you look at the long term of history,

01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:55.780
one of the curious things you see,

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:59.620
and that's what makes us different human groups from animal species.

01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:03.140
Gorillas and chimpanzees, they are separate species.

01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:04.580
They can never merge.

01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:06.660
Cats and dogs will never merge.

01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:11.140
But different national and religious groups in history,

01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:14.020
even when they hate each other, surprisingly,

01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:16.900
they sometimes end by merging.

01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:18.420
If you look at Germany, for instance,

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:22.980
so for centuries, you had Prussians and Bavarians and Saxons

01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:27.060
who fought each other ferociously and hated each other,

01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:29.140
and they are sometimes also of different religions,

01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:30.260
Catholics, Protestants.

01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:35.300
The worst war in European history, according to some measures,

01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:38.260
was not the Second World War or the First World War.

01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:40.020
It was the Thirty Years' War,

01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:45.540
waged largely on German soil between Germans, Protestants, and Catholics.

01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:49.860
Eventually, they united to form a single country.

01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:51.700
You saw the same thing, I don't know, in Britain.

01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:56.580
English and Scots, for centuries, hated and fought each other ferociously.

01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:59.940
Eventually, coming together, maybe they'll break up again.

01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:00.420
I don't know.

01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:08.500
But the power of the kind of forces of merger in history,

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:12.260
you are very often influenced by the people you fight,

01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:16.820
by the people you even hate, more than by almost anybody else.

01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:23.780
So if we apply those ideas, the ideas of this part of the world,

01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:25.780
to another part of the world that's currently in war,

01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:30.420
Russia and Ukraine, from what you learned here,

01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:34.340
how do you think peace can be achieved in Ukraine?

01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:36.740
Peace can be achieved any moment.

01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:37.620
It's motivation.

01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:39.380
In this case, it's just one person.

01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:41.940
You just, Putin just needs to say, that's it.

01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:45.060
The Ukrainians, they don't demand anything from Russia.

01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:46.420
Just go home.

01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:48.100
That's the only thing they want.

01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:50.900
They don't want to conquer any bit of Russian territory.

01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:52.900
They don't want to change the regime in Moscow.

01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:53.540
Nothing.

01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:56.580
They just tell the Russians, go home.

01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:57.080
That's it.

01:28:57.860 --> 01:28:59.940
And, of course, again, motivation.

01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:05.620
How do you get somebody like Putin to admit that he made a colossal mistake,

01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:11.540
a human mistake, an ethical mistake, a political mistake, in starting this war?

01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:13.060
This is very, very difficult.

01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:17.300
But in terms of what would the solution look like?

01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:18.020
Very simple.

01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:19.220
The Russians go home.

01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:20.340
End of story.

01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:25.140
Do you believe in the power of conversation between leaders

01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:32.740
to sit down as human beings and agree, first of all, what home means?

01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:36.900
Because we humans draw lines.

01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:37.860
That's true.

01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:39.940
I believe in the power of conversation.

01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:41.860
The big question to ask is where.

01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:46.340
Where do real conversations take place?

01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:47.300
And this is tricky.

01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:53.300
One of the interesting things to ask about any conflict, about any political system,

01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:56.420
is where do the real conversations take place?

01:29:56.420 --> 01:30:02.020
And very often, they don't take place in the places you think that they are.

01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:04.180
But think about American politics.

01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:08.420
When the country was founded in the late 18th century,

01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:12.180
people understood holding conversation between leaders

01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:16.820
is very important for the functioning of democracy will create a place for that.

01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:17.940
That's called Congress.

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:23.460
This is where leaders are supposed to meet and talk about the main issues of the day.

01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:28.900
Maybe there was a time, sometime in the past, when this actually happened,

01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:37.940
when you had two factions holding different ideas about foreign policy or economic policy,

01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:42.100
and they met in Congress, and somebody would come and give a speech,

01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:43.860
and the people on the other side would say,

01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:45.300
hey, that's interesting.

01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:46.660
I haven't thought about it.

01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:48.260
Yes, maybe we can agree on that.

01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:51.380
This is no longer happening in Congress.

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:54.420
I don't think there is any speech in Congress

01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:59.140
that causes anybody on the other side to change their opinion about anything.

01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:04.420
So this is no longer a place where real conversations take place.

01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:08.500
The big question about American democracy is,

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:12.500
is there a place where real conversations,

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:16.260
which actually change people's minds, still take place?

01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:19.540
If not, then this democracy is dying.

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:23.940
Also, democracy without conversation cannot exist for long.

01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:27.620
And it's the same question you should ask also about dictatorial regimes.

01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:30.020
Like you think about Russia or China.

01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:32.020
So China has the Great Hall of the People.

01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:36.340
Well, the representatives, the supposed representatives of the people,

01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:40.500
meet every now and then, but no real conversation takes place there.

01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:47.380
A key question to ask about the Chinese system is, behind closed doors,

01:31:47.380 --> 01:31:51.540
let's say in a Politburo meeting, do people have a real conversation?

01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:57.700
If Xi Jinping says one thing and some other big shot thinks differently,

01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:02.660
will they have the courage, the ability, the backbone to say,

01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:06.100
with all due respect, I think differently, and there is a real conversation?

01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:08.740
Or not? I don't know the answer.

01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:10.260
But this is a key question.

01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:15.460
This is the difference between an authoritarian regime

01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:17.700
can still have different voices within it.

01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:22.180
But at a certain point, you have a personality cult.

01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:26.100
Nobody dares say anything against the leader.

01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:31.540
And when it comes again to Ukrainian Russia, I don't think that if you get,

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:36.340
if you somehow manage to get Putin and Zelensky to the same room,

01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:40.580
when everybody knows that they are there and they'll have a moment

01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:46.420
of empathy or human connection, I don't think it can happen like that.

01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:54.420
I do hope that there are other spaces where somebody like Putin

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:58.420
can still have a real human conversation.

01:32:58.420 --> 01:32:59.940
I don't know if this is the case.

01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:00.740
I hope so.

01:33:00.740 --> 01:33:03.700
Well, there's several interesting dynamics and you spoke to some of them.

01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:06.020
So one is internally with advisors.

01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:09.700
You have to have hope that there's people that would disagree,

01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:12.980
that would have a lively debate internally.

01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:15.460
Then there's also the thing you mentioned,

01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:19.620
which is direct communication between Putin and Zelensky in private,

01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:23.220
picking up a phone, rotary phone, old school.

01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:26.340
I still believe in the power of that.

01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:31.300
But while that's exceptionally difficult in the current state of affairs,

01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:34.340
what's also possible to have is a mediator,

01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:38.740
like the United States or some other leader, like the leader of Israel

01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:43.940
or the leader of another nation that's respected by both or India, for example,

01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:47.780
that can have, first of all, individual conversations

01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:49.700
and then literally get into a room together.

01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:52.820
It is possible.

01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:56.020
I would say more generally about conversations.

01:33:57.380 --> 01:34:00.900
It goes back a little to what I said earlier about the Marxist view of history.

01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:08.100
One of the problematic things I see today in many academic circles

01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:10.580
is that people focus too much on power.

01:34:11.300 --> 01:34:15.140
They think that the whole of history or the whole of politics

01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:18.180
is just a power structure.

01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:20.260
It's just struggle about power.

01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:24.100
Now, if you think that the whole of history

01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:26.420
and the whole of politics is only power,

01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:30.340
then there is no room for conversation.

01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:35.860
Because if what you have is a struggle between different powerful interests,

01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:38.020
there is no point talking.

01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:41.380
The only thing that changes it is fighting.

01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:46.980
My view is that no, it's not all about power structures.

01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:48.900
It's not all about power dynamics.

01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:52.660
Underneath the power structure, there are stories.

01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:54.580
Stories in human minds.

01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:57.140
This is great news.

01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:59.300
If it's true, this is good news.

01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:04.340
Because unlike power that can only be changed through fighting,

01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:07.940
stories can sometimes, it's not easy,

01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:11.620
but sometimes stories can be changed through talking.

01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:14.420
That's the hope.

01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:19.940
I think in everything from couple therapy to nation therapy,

01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:23.540
if you think it's power therapy, it's all about power,

01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:26.180
there is no place for conversation.

01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:30.820
But if to some extent it's the stories in people's minds,

01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:37.300
if you can enable one person to see the story in the mind of another person,

01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:42.420
and more importantly, if you can have some kind of critical distance

01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:47.140
from the story in your own mind, maybe you can change it a little.

01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:48.900
And then you don't need to fight.

01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:52.980
You can actually find a better story that you can both agree to.

01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:55.140
It sometimes happens in history.

01:35:56.180 --> 01:35:59.220
French and Germans fought for generations and generations.

01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:01.300
Now they live in peace.

01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:04.820
Not because, I don't know, they found a new planet

01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:06.660
they can share between France and Germany,

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:08.340
so now everybody has enough territory.

01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:12.100
No, they actually have less territory than previously

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:14.580
because they lost all their overseas empires,

01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:19.380
but they managed to find a story, the European story,

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:24.100
that both Germans and French people are happy with, so they live in peace.

01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:29.860
I very much believe in this vision that you have of the power of stories,

01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:32.740
and one of the tools is conversations, another is books.

01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:37.780
There's some guy that wrote a book about this power of stories.

01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:39.300
He happens to be sitting in front of me,

01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:41.780
and that happened to spread across a lot of people,

01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:45.060
and now they believe in the power of story and narrative,

01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:47.460
even a children's book too, so the kids...

01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:52.660
I mean, it's fascinating how that spreads.

01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:56.100
I mean, underneath your work, there's an optimism,

01:36:57.060 --> 01:37:02.820
and I think underneath conversations is what I try to do is an optimism,

01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:05.060
that it's not just about power struggles.

01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:09.220
It's about stories, which is like a connection between

01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:14.980
humans and together kind of evolving these stories

01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:18.020
that maximize or minimize suffering in the world.

01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:22.260
This is why also I think I admire what you're doing,

01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:26.980
that you're going to talk with some of the most difficult characters around

01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:32.420
in the world today, and with this basic belief

01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:36.580
that by talking, maybe we can move them an inch,

01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:41.540
which is a lot when it comes to people with so much power.

01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:45.060
Like I think one of the biggest success stories in modern history,

01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:50.180
I would say, is feminism, because feminism believed

01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:58.100
in the power of stories, not so much in the power of violence, of armed conflict.

01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:03.940
By many measures, feminism has been maybe the most successful social movement

01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:06.740
of the 20th century and maybe of the modern age.

01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:13.620
Systems of oppression which were in place throughout the world for thousands of years,

01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:17.140
and they seem to be just natural, eternal.

01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:20.820
You had all these religious movements, all these political revolutions,

01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:24.980
and one thing remained constant, and this is the patriarchal system

01:38:24.980 --> 01:38:26.100
and the oppression of women.

01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:32.820
And then feminism came along, and you had leaders like Lenin, like Mao,

01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:38.340
saying that if you want to make a big social change, you must use violence.

01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:41.460
Power comes from the barrel of the gun, of a gun.

01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:44.980
If you want to make an omelet, you need to break eggs, and all these things.

01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:50.100
And the feminist said, no, we won't use the power of the gun.

01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:53.380
We will make an omelet without breaking any eggs.

01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:58.180
And they made a much better omelet than Lenin or Mao

01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:01.060
or any of these violent revolutionaries.

01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:06.180
I don't think that they certainly didn't start any wars or build any gulags.

01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:09.700
I don't think they even murdered a single politician.

01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:14.100
I don't think there was any political assassination anywhere by feminists.

01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:20.260
There was a lot of violence against them, both verbal but also physical,

01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:29.300
and they didn't reply by waging violence, and they succeeded in changing this deep

01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:38.100
in a structure of oppression in a way which benefited not just women but also men.

01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:43.460
So this gives me hope that it's not easy.

01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:50.020
In many cases, we fail, but it is possible sometimes in history to make a very, very big

01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:58.100
change, positive change, mainly by talking and demonstrating and changing the story in

01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:00.980
people's minds and not by using violence.

01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:06.340
It's fascinating that feminism and communism and all these things happen in the 20th century.

01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:09.140
So many interesting things happen in the 20th century.

01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:14.420
So many movements, so many ideas, nuclear weapons, all of it, computers.

01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:19.220
It's just like it seems like a lot of stuff really quickly percolated and it's accelerating.

01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:20.340
It's still accelerating.

01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:22.420
History is just accelerating for centuries.

01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:29.300
And the 20th century, we squeezed into it things that previously took thousands of years,

01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:32.260
and now we are squeezing it into decades.

01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:37.300
And you very well could be one of the last historians, human historians, to have ever lived.

01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:39.300
Could be.

01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:44.900
I think our species, homo sapiens, I don't think will be around in a century or two.

01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:50.500
We could destroy ourselves in a nuclear war through ecological collapse

01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:54.980
by giving too much power to AI that goes out of our control.

01:40:56.340 --> 01:41:01.540
But if we survive, we'll probably have so much power that we will change ourselves

01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:10.900
using various technologies so that our descendants will no longer be homo sapiens like us.

01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:15.780
They will be more different from us than we are different from Neanderthals.

01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:23.220
So maybe they'll have historians, but it will no longer be human historians or sapiens historians

01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:23.700
like me.

01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:28.260
I think it's an extremely dangerous development.

01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:33.620
And the chances that this will go wrong, that people will use the new technologies

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:39.860
trying to upgrade humans, but actually downgrading them, this is a very, very big danger.

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:48.900
If you let corporations and armies and ruthless politicians change humans using tools like AI

01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:56.100
and bioengineering, it's very likely that they will try to enhance a few human qualities

01:41:56.100 --> 01:42:04.420
that they need, like intelligence and discipline, while neglecting what are potentially more

01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:12.340
important human qualities like compassion, like autistic sensitivity, like spirituality.

01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:19.780
If you give Putin, for instance, bioengineering and AI and brain-computer interfaces,

01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:29.860
he's likely to want to create a race of super soldiers who are much more intelligent and much

01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:36.100
stronger and also much more disciplined, and never rebel and march on Moscow against him.

01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:41.940
But he has no interest in making them more compassionate or more spiritual.

01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:52.660
So the end result could be a new type of humans, downgraded humans, who are highly intelligent

01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:57.220
and disciplined, but have no compassion and no spiritual depth.

01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:03.140
This is one, for me, this is the dystopia, the apocalypse.

01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:10.020
When people talk about the new technologies and they have this scenario of the Terminator,

01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:13.860
robots lying in the street shooting people, this is not what worries me.

01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:15.540
I think we can avoid that.

01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:23.460
What really worries me is using the corporations, armies, politicians will use the new technologies

01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:31.300
to change us in a way which will destroy our humanity or the best parts of our humanity.

01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:33.700
One of those ways could be removing the compassion.

01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:38.100
Another way that really worries me, for me, is probably more likely is a brave new world

01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:46.820
kind of thing that sort of removes the flaws of humans, maybe removes the diversity in humans,

01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:55.060
and makes us all kind of these dopamine-chasing creatures that just kind of maximize enjoyment

01:43:55.060 --> 01:44:01.700
in the short term, which kind of seems like a good thing maybe in the short term,

01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:07.620
but it creates a society that doesn't think, that doesn't create, that just is sitting there

01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:13.620
enjoying itself at a more and more rapid pace.

01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:19.220
Which seems like another kind of society that could be easily controlled by a centralized

01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:23.620
center of power, but the set of dystopias that we could arrive at through this,

01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:32.100
through allowing corporations to modify humans is vast and we should be worried about that.

01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:40.020
So it seems like humans are pretty good as we are, all the flaws, all of it together.

01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:44.900
We are better than anything that we can intentionally design at present.

01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:50.580
Like any intentionally designed humans at the present moment is going to be much,

01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:53.700
much worse than us because basically we don't understand ourselves.

01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:59.220
I mean as long as we don't understand our brain, our body, our mind, it's a very,

01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:04.980
very bad idea to start manipulating a system that you don't understand deeply

01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:07.060
and we don't understand ourselves.

01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:10.980
So I have to ask you about an interesting dynamic of stories.

01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:13.700
You wrote an article two years ago titled,

01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:16.100
when the world seems like one big conspiracy,

01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:20.340
how understanding the structure of global cabal theories

01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:24.020
can shed light on their allure and their inherent falsehood.

01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:29.220
What are global cabal theories and why do so many people believe them?

01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:31.220
37% of Americans, for example.

01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:35.220
Well, the global cabal theory, it has many variations,

01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:38.340
but basically there is a small group of people, a small cabal

01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:42.660
that secretly controls everything that is happening in the world.

01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:46.100
All the wars, all the revolutions, all the epidemics,

01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:49.780
everything that is happening is controlled by this very small group

01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:52.500
of people who are of course evil and have bad intentions.

01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:57.940
And this is a very well-known story.

01:45:57.940 --> 01:45:58.820
It's not new.

01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:00.740
It's been there for thousands of years.

01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:04.580
It's very attractive because first of all, it's simple.

01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:08.660
You don't understand everything that happens in the world.

01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:11.140
You just need to understand one thing.

01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:14.180
The war in Ukraine, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,

01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:16.740
5G technology, COVID-19.

01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:17.940
It's simple.

01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:19.300
There is this global cabal.

01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:20.340
They do all of it.

01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:26.180
And also it enables you to shift all the responsibility

01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:30.420
to all the bad things that are happening in the world to this small cabal.

01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:31.300
It's the Jews.

01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:32.260
It's the Freemasons.

01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:32.740
It's not us.

01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:39.220
And also it creates this fantasy, utopian fantasy.

01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:41.460
If we only get rid of the small cabal,

01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:44.180
we solve all the problems of the world.

01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:47.620
Salvation, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the war in Ukraine,

01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:49.140
the epidemics, poverty.

01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:53.700
Everything is solved just by knocking out this small cabal.

01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:54.980
So it's simple.

01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:56.100
It's attractive.

01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:58.020
And this is why so many people believe it.

01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:01.140
Again, it's not new.

01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:03.380
Nazism was exactly this.

01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:05.700
Nazism began as a conspiracy theory.

01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:08.180
We don't call Nazism a conspiracy theory

01:47:08.180 --> 01:47:09.380
because, oh, it's a big thing.

01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:10.500
It's an ideology.

01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:13.460
But if you look at it, it's a conspiracy theory.

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:16.980
The basic Nazi idea was the Jews control the world,

01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:18.100
get rid of the Jews.

01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:20.100
You solved all the world's problems.

01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:23.620
Now, the interesting thing about these kind of theories,

01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:30.900
again, they tell you that even things that look to be the opposite of each other

01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:33.220
actually, they are part of the conspiracy.

01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:36.820
So in the case of Nazism, the Nazis told people,

01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:39.380
you know, you have capitalism and communism.

01:47:39.380 --> 01:47:42.020
You think that they are opposite, right?

01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:45.140
Ah, this is what the Jews want you to think.

01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:48.100
Actually, the Jews control both communism,

01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:50.260
Trotsky Marx or Jews, blah, blah, blah,

01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:53.540
and capitalism, the Rothschilds, the Wall Street,

01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:55.060
it's all controlled by the Jews.

01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:57.220
So the Jews are fooling everybody.

01:47:57.220 --> 01:47:59.540
But actually, the communists and the capitalists

01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:01.700
are part of the same global cabal.

01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:05.860
And again, this is very attractive because, ah,

01:48:05.860 --> 01:48:10.020
now I understand everything and I also know what to do.

01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:11.460
I just give power to Hitler.

01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:12.580
He gets rid of the Jews.

01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:14.260
I solved all the problems of the world.

01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:20.180
Now, as a historian, the most important thing I can say about these theories,

01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:25.540
they are never right because the global cabal theory says two things.

01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:29.140
First, everything is controlled by a very small number of people.

01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:31.540
Secondly, these people hide themselves.

01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:32.500
They do it in secret.

01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:34.740
Now, both things are nonsense.

01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:39.380
It's impossible for people to control a small group of people,

01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:44.260
to control and predict everything because the world is too complicated.

01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:46.740
You know, you look at a real world conspiracy.

01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:48.340
Conspiracy is basically just a plan.

01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:53.460
Think about the American invasion of Iraq in 2003.

01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:57.380
You had the most powerful superpower in the world

01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:01.940
with the biggest military, with the biggest intelligence services,

01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:06.900
with the most sophisticated, you know, the FBI and the CIA and all the agents.

01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:12.820
They invade a third-rate country, a third-rate power, Iraq.

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:16.900
With this idea, we'll take over Iraq and we'll control it.

01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:18.420
We'll make a new order in the Middle East.

01:49:19.060 --> 01:49:20.820
And everything falls apart.

01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:23.620
Their plan completely backfires.

01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:26.340
Everything they hope to achieve,

01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:27.460
they achieve the opposite.

01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:30.420
America, United States is humiliated.

01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:32.660
They caused the rise of ISIS.

01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:34.260
They wanted to take out terrorism.

01:49:34.260 --> 01:49:35.780
They created more terrorism.

01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:39.060
Worst of all, the big winner of the war was Iran.

01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:43.620
You know, the United States goes to war with all its power

01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:48.580
and gives Iran a victory on a silver plate.

01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:50.180
The Iranians don't need to do anything.

01:49:50.180 --> 01:49:52.100
The Americans are doing everything for them.

01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:54.980
Now, this is real history.

01:49:54.980 --> 01:49:58.580
Real history is when you have not a small group of people,

01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:02.980
a lot of people with a lot of power carefully planning something

01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:08.180
and it goes completely against their plan.

01:50:08.180 --> 01:50:10.420
And this we know from personal experience.

01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:14.100
Every time we try to plan something, a birthday party,

01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:18.100
a surprise birthday party, a trip somewhere, things go wrong.

01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:19.940
This is reality.

01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:24.260
So the idea that a small group of, I don't know, the Jewish cabal,

01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:30.100
the Freemasons, whoever, they can really control and predict all the wars.

01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:31.300
This is nonsense.

01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:36.500
The second thing that is nonsense is to think they can do that and still remain secret.

01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:43.220
It sometimes happens in history that a small group of people accumulates a lot of power.

01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:48.740
If I now tell you that Xi Jinping and the heads of the CCP,

01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:51.620
the Chinese Communist Party, they have a lot of power.

01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:57.140
They control the military, the media, the economy, the University of China.

01:50:57.140 --> 01:50:58.500
This is not a conspiracy theory.

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:01.460
Obviously, everybody knows it.

01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:08.100
Everybody knows it because to gain so much power, you usually need publicity.

01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:14.740
Hitler gained a lot of power in Nazi Germany because he had a lot of publicity.

01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:19.380
If Hitler remained unknown, working behind the scenes, he would not gain power.

01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:24.180
So the way to gain power is usually through publicity.

01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:27.380
So secret cabals don't gain power.

01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:34.180
And even if you gain a lot of power, nobody has the kind of power necessary

01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:37.540
to predict and control everything that happens in the world.

01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:42.260
All the time, shit happens that you did not predict,

01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:44.260
and you did not plan, and you did not control.

01:51:45.220 --> 01:51:49.860
The sad thing is, there's usually an explanation for everything you just said

01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:53.860
that involves a secret global cabal.

01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:59.220
The reason your vacation planning always goes wrong is because you're not competent.

01:51:59.220 --> 01:52:04.260
There is a competent small group, ultra-competent small group.

01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:06.500
I hear this with intelligence agencies.

01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:09.300
The CIA are running everything, Mossad is running everything.

01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:15.140
As a historian, you get to know how many blunders these people do.

01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:19.380
They're capable, but they're so incompetent in so many ways.

01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:21.300
Again, look at the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:25.780
Before the war, people thought, oh, Putin was such a genius,

01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:28.580
and the Russian army was one of the strongest armies in the world.

01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:32.340
This is what Putin thought, and it completely backfired.

01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:38.260
Well, the cabal explanation there would be there's a NATO-driven United States

01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:42.420
military-industrial complex that wants to create chaos and incompetence.

01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:45.220
So they put a gun to Putin's head and told him,

01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:47.860
Vladimir, if you don't invade, we shoot you.

01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:49.860
How did they cause Putin to invade you?

01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:52.340
It's the thing about conspiracy theories,

01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:55.220
is there's usually a way to explain everything.

01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:56.820
You can explain it in an intellectual religion.

01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:01.140
You can always find explanation for everything.

01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:04.500
In the end, it's intellectual integrity.

01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:08.580
If you insist on whenever people confront you with evidence,

01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:13.220
with finding some very, very complicated explanation for that, too,

01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:14.420
you can explain everything.

01:53:14.420 --> 01:53:15.060
We know that.

01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:18.820
It's a question of intellectual integrity.

01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:20.500
And I will also say another thing.

01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:26.820
The conspiracy theories, they do get one thing right, certainly in today's world.

01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:33.620
I think they represent an authentic and justified fear of a lot of people

01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:37.300
that they are losing control of their lives.

01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:39.860
They don't understand what is happening.

01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:43.300
And this, I think, is not just a legitimate fear.

01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:44.740
This is an important fear.

01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:46.420
They are right.

01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:49.940
We are losing control of our lives.

01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:56.020
We are facing really big dangers, but not from a small cabal of fellow humans.

01:53:57.140 --> 01:53:59.780
The problem with many of these conspiracy theories,

01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:04.420
that yes, we have a problem with new AI technology.

01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:10.100
But if you now direct the fire against certain people,

01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:16.980
so instead of all humans cooperating against our real common threats,

01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:22.260
whether it's the rise of AI, whether it's global warming,

01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:24.660
you're only causing us to fight each other.

01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:28.660
And I think that the key question that people who spread these ideas,

01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:32.580
they honestly believe, it's not malicious.

01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:35.300
They honestly believe in these theories.

01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:42.900
Do you want to spend your life spreading hate towards people?

01:54:42.900 --> 01:54:45.780
Or do you want to work on more constructive projects?

01:54:45.780 --> 01:54:49.220
I think one of the big differences between those who believe in conspiracy theories

01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:56.500
and people who warn about the dangers of AI, the dangers of climate change.

01:54:56.500 --> 01:55:03.860
Um, we don't see certain humans as evil and hateful.

01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:06.100
The problem isn't humans.

01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:10.260
The problem is something outside humanity.

01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:14.900
Yes, humans are contributing to the problem,

01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:18.420
but ultimately the enemy is external to humanity.

01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:22.100
Whereas conspiracy theories usually claim

01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:26.980
that a certain part of humanity is the source of all evil,

01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:33.540
which leads them to eventually think in terms of exterminating this part of humanity,

01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:40.660
which leads sometimes to historical disasters like Nazism.

01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:41.620
So it can lead to hate,

01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:46.660
but can also lead to like cynicism and apathy that basically says,

01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:48.580
it's not in my power to make the world better.

01:55:49.140 --> 01:55:51.540
So you don't actually take action.

01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:54.580
I think it is within the power of every individual

01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:56.820
to make the world a little bit better.

01:55:57.700 --> 01:55:58.900
You know, you can't do everything.

01:55:58.900 --> 01:56:00.260
Don't try to do everything.

01:56:00.260 --> 01:56:03.780
Find one thing in your areas of activity,

01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:08.340
place where you have some agency and try to do that

01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:11.060
and hope that other people do their bit.

01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:14.820
And if everybody do their bit, we will manage.

01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:18.500
And if we don't, we don't, but at least we try.

01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:21.780
You have been part of conspiracy theories.

01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:28.020
I find myself recently becoming part of conspiracy theories.

01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:32.900
Is there a device you can give of how to be a human being in this world

01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:34.580
that values truth and reason

01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:38.580
while watching yourself become part of conspiracy theories?

01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:41.460
At least from my perspective, it seems very difficult

01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:46.820
to prove to the world that you're not part of a conspiracy theory.

01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:52.180
I, as you said, have interviewed Benjamin Netanyahu recently.

01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:55.380
I don't know if you're aware, but doing such things will also,

01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:58.420
you know, pick up a new menu of items

01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:01.860
that your new set of conspiracy theories you're now a part of.

01:57:01.860 --> 01:57:03.620
And I find it very frustrating

01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:07.700
because it makes it very difficult to respond

01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:11.700
because I sense that people have the right intentions.

01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:18.100
Like we said, they have a nervousness of fear of power

01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:22.980
and the abuses of power, and as do I.

01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:26.020
So I find myself in a difficult position

01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:28.420
that I have nothing to show to prove

01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:30.420
that I'm not part of such a conspiracy theory.

01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:33.460
I think ultimately you can't, we can't.

01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:38.500
I mean, you know, it's like proving consciousness that you can't.

01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:40.980
That's just the situation.

01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:44.900
Whatever you say can and will be used against you by some people.

01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:50.340
So this fantasy, if I only say this, if I only show them that,

01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:53.140
if I only have this data, they will see I'm okay.

01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:54.740
It doesn't work like that.

01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:59.220
I think to keep your sanity in this situation,

01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:02.500
first of all, it's important to understand

01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:04.500
that most of these people are not evil.

01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:06.820
They are not doing it on purpose.

01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:13.620
Many of them really believe that there is some very nefarious, powerful conspiracy

01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:16.660
which is causing a lot of harm in the world,

01:58:16.660 --> 01:58:19.780
and they are doing a good thing by exposing it

01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:22.580
and making people aware of it and trying to stop it.

01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:26.020
If you think that you are surrounded by evil,

01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:29.380
you're falling into the same rabbit hole.

01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:32.500
You're falling into the same paranoid state of mind.

01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:34.820
Oh, the world is full of these evil people that...

01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:36.820
No, most of them are good people.

01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:43.620
And also, I think we can empathize with some of the key ideas there,

01:58:43.620 --> 01:58:48.580
which I share that, yes, it's becoming more and more difficult

01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:50.420
to understand what is happening in the world.

01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:53.940
There are huge dangers in the world,

01:58:53.940 --> 01:58:57.300
that we are existential dangers to the human species,

01:58:57.300 --> 01:59:04.660
but they don't come from a small cabal of Jews or gay people or feminists or whatever.

01:59:05.620 --> 01:59:09.300
They come from much more diffused forces,

01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:13.700
which are not under the control of any single individual.

01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:17.620
We don't have to look for the evil people.

01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:24.340
We need to look for human allies in order to work together against,

01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:29.860
again, the dangers of AI, the dangers of bioengineering,

01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:32.100
the dangers of climate change.

01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:35.060
And when you wake up in the morning, the question is,

01:59:35.060 --> 01:59:38.580
do you want to spend your day spreading hatred,

01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:44.900
or do you want to spend your day trying to make allies and work together?

01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:51.220
Let me ask you kind of a big philosophical question about AI and the threat of it.

01:59:52.020 --> 01:59:54.100
Let's look at the threat side.

01:59:54.740 --> 02:00:00.260
So folks like Eliezer Yadkovsky worry that AI might kill all of us.

02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:07.060
Do you worry about that range of possibilities where artificial intelligence systems

02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:12.500
in a variety of ways might destroy human civilization?

02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:16.660
Yes, you know, I talk a lot about it, about the dangers of AI.

02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:22.260
I sometimes get into trouble because I depict these scenarios of how AI becoming very dangerous,

02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:24.900
and then people say that I'm encouraging these scenarios,

02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:28.420
but I'm talking about it as a warning.

02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:33.140
I'm not so terrified of the simplistic idea,

02:00:33.140 --> 02:00:38.100
again, the Terminator scenario of robots running in the street shooting everybody.

02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:47.940
I'm more worried about AI accumulating more and more power and basically taking over society,

02:00:48.980 --> 02:00:55.460
taking over our lives, taking power away from us until we don't understand what is happening

02:00:55.460 --> 02:00:58.900
and we lose control of our lives and of the future.

02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:02.420
The two most important things to realize about AI.

02:01:02.420 --> 02:01:04.660
You know, so many things are being said now about AI,

02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:08.180
but I think there are two things that every person should know about AI.

02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:15.380
First is that AI is the first tool in history that can make decisions by itself.

02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:19.620
All previous tools in history couldn't make decisions.

02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:21.780
This is why they empowered us.

02:01:21.780 --> 02:01:25.300
You invent a knife, you invent an atom bomb.

02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:29.460
The atom bomb cannot decide to start a war, cannot decide which city to bomb.

02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:33.860
AI can make decisions by itself.

02:01:35.380 --> 02:01:41.380
And autonomous weapon systems can decide by themselves who to kill, who to bomb.

02:01:42.980 --> 02:01:48.900
The second thing is that AI is the first tool in history that can create new ideas by itself.

02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:56.020
The printing press could print our ideas, but could not create new ideas.

02:01:56.020 --> 02:01:59.780
AI can create new ideas entirely by itself.

02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:02.820
This is unprecedented.

02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:08.100
Therefore, it is the first technology in history that instead of giving power to humans,

02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:10.900
it takes power away from us.

02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:16.900
And the danger is that it will increasingly take more and more power from us

02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:24.340
until we are left helpless and clueless about what is happening in the world.

02:02:24.340 --> 02:02:30.100
And this is already beginning to happen in an accelerated pace.

02:02:30.100 --> 02:02:34.260
More and more decisions about our lives, whether to give us a loan,

02:02:34.260 --> 02:02:38.260
whether to give us a mortgage, whether to give us a job, our taking by AI,

02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:44.820
and more and more of the ideas, of the images, of the stories that surround us

02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:52.260
and shape our minds, our world, are produced, are created by AI, not by human beings.

02:02:52.260 --> 02:02:54.980
If you can just linger on that, what is the danger of that?

02:02:55.540 --> 02:03:02.580
That more and more of the creative side is done by AI, the idea generation.

02:03:03.380 --> 02:03:05.940
Is it that we become stale in our thinking?

02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:12.100
Is that idea generation so fundamental to the evolution of humanity?

02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:14.020
That we can't resist the ideas.

02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:20.660
To resist an idea, you need to have some vision of the creative process.

02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:22.020
This is a very old fear.

02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:29.140
You go back to Plato's cave, this idea that people are sitting chained in a cave

02:03:29.860 --> 02:03:34.900
and seeing shadows on a screen, on a wall, and thinking this is reality.

02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:41.780
You go back to Descartes, and he has this thought experiment of the demon,

02:03:41.780 --> 02:03:45.940
and Descartes asks himself, how do I know that any of this is real?

02:03:45.940 --> 02:03:52.020
Maybe there is a demon who is creating all of this and is basically enslaving me

02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:55.460
by surrounding me with these illusions.

02:03:55.460 --> 02:03:58.180
You go back to Buddha, it's the same question.

02:03:58.180 --> 02:04:01.620
What if we are living in a world of illusions,

02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:04.660
and because we have been living in it throughout our lives,

02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:09.380
all our ideas, all our desires, how do we understand ourselves?

02:04:09.380 --> 02:04:12.260
This is all the product of the same illusions.

02:04:14.260 --> 02:04:17.540
This was a big philosophical question for thousands of years.

02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:21.620
Now it's becoming a practical question of engineering,

02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:25.220
because previously all the ideas, as far as we know,

02:04:25.220 --> 02:04:30.740
maybe we are living inside a computer simulation of intelligent rats from the planet Zircon.

02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:33.380
If that's the case, we don't know about it.

02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:36.900
But taking what we do know about human history until now,

02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:43.540
all the stories, images, paintings, songs, operas, theater,

02:04:43.540 --> 02:04:47.620
everything we have encountered and shaped our minds was created by humans.

02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:54.340
Now increasingly we live in a world where more and more of these cultural artifacts

02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:57.060
will be coming from an alien intelligence.

02:04:57.940 --> 02:05:03.860
Very quickly we might reach a point when most of the story,

02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:09.780
stories, images, songs, TV shows, whatever, are created by an alien intelligence.

02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:15.700
If we now find ourselves inside this kind of world of illusions

02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:23.060
created by an alien intelligence that we don't understand, but it understands us,

02:05:24.260 --> 02:05:30.820
this is a kind of spiritual enslavement that we won't be able to break out of,

02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:36.260
because it understands us, it understands how to manipulate us,

02:05:36.260 --> 02:05:45.460
but we don't understand what is behind this screen of stories and images and songs.

02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:50.900
So if there's a set of AI systems that are operating in the space of ideas,

02:05:51.620 --> 02:05:58.580
they're far superior to ours and it's opaque to us, we're not able to see through.

02:05:58.580 --> 02:06:06.740
How does that change the pursuit of happiness, the human pursuit of happiness, life?

02:06:07.380 --> 02:06:12.820
Where do we get joy if we're surrounded by AI systems that are doing

02:06:13.380 --> 02:06:16.100
most of the cool things humans do much better than us?

02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:20.980
Some of the things, it's okay that the AIs will do them.

02:06:20.980 --> 02:06:27.780
Many human tasks and jobs, they are drudgery, they are not fun,

02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:35.380
they are not developing us emotionally or spiritually. It's fine if the robots take over.

02:06:36.020 --> 02:06:40.180
I don't know, I think about the people in supermarkets or grocery stores that spend

02:06:40.180 --> 02:06:48.180
hours every day just passing items and charging you the money. If this can be automated, wonderful.

02:06:48.820 --> 02:06:57.860
We need to make sure that these people then have better jobs, better means of supporting themselves

02:06:57.860 --> 02:07:07.220
and developing their social abilities, their spiritual abilities, and that's the ideal world

02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:16.660
that AI can create, that it takes away from us the things that it's better if we don't do them

02:07:17.540 --> 02:07:24.100
and allows us to focus on the most important things and the deepest aspects of our nature,

02:07:24.100 --> 02:07:31.300
of our potential. If we give AI control of the sphere of ideas at this stage,

02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:35.940
I think it's very, very dangerous because it doesn't understand us.

02:07:37.620 --> 02:07:45.940
AI at present is mostly digesting the products of human culture. Everything we've produced

02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:53.060
over thousands of years, it eats all of these cultural products, digests it,

02:07:53.060 --> 02:08:00.340
and starts producing its own new stuff. But we still haven't figured it out ourselves,

02:08:01.060 --> 02:08:09.860
our bodies, our brains, our minds, our psychology. An AI based on our flawed understanding of

02:08:09.860 --> 02:08:20.020
ourselves is a very dangerous thing. I think that we need, first of all, to keep developing

02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:27.380
ourselves. If for every dollar and every minute that we spend on developing AI,

02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:34.180
artificial intelligence, we spend another dollar and another minute in developing human consciousness,

02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:41.620
the human mind will be okay. The danger is that we spend all our effort on developing an AI

02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:48.980
at a time when we don't understand ourselves, and then letting the AI take over, that's a road

02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:54.580
to a human catastrophe. Does this surprise you how well large language models work? I mean,

02:08:54.580 --> 02:08:58.020
has it modified your understanding of the nature of intelligence?

02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:07.140
Yes. I've been writing about AI for like eight years now and engaged with all these predictions

02:09:07.140 --> 02:09:13.380
and speculations. When it actually came, it was much faster and more powerful than I thought it

02:09:13.380 --> 02:09:22.260
would be. I didn't think that we would have in 2023 an AI that can hold the conversation,

02:09:22.500 --> 02:09:29.620
you can't know if it's a human being or an AI that can write beautiful texts. I mean,

02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:36.500
I read the texts written by AI, and the thing that strikes me most is the coherence.

02:09:37.700 --> 02:09:42.100
People think, oh, it's nothing, they just take ideas from here and there, words from here,

02:09:42.100 --> 02:09:49.220
and put it, no, it's so coherent. I mean, you read in not sentences, you read paragraphs,

02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:55.460
you read entire texts, and there is logic. There is a structure. It's not only coherent,

02:09:56.260 --> 02:10:00.740
it's convincing, and the beautiful thing about it that has to do with your work,

02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:07.140
it doesn't have to be true, and it often gets facts wrong, but it still is convincing.

02:10:08.020 --> 02:10:15.460
And it is both scary and beautiful that our brains love language so much that we don't

02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:20.980
need the facts to be correct. We just need it to be a beautiful story.

02:10:22.180 --> 02:10:26.500
That's been the secret of politics and religion for thousands of years,

02:10:26.500 --> 02:10:28.260
and now it's coming with AI.

02:10:29.140 --> 02:10:34.820
You, as a person who has written some of the most impactful words ever written in your books,

02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:42.260
how does that make you feel that you might be one of the last effective human writers?

02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:43.220
That's a good question.

02:10:43.940 --> 02:10:45.540
First of all, do you think that's possible?

02:10:45.540 --> 02:10:51.780
I think it is possible. I've seen a lot of examples of AI being told,

02:10:51.780 --> 02:10:54.340
write like Yuval Noah Harari, and what it produces.

02:10:54.340 --> 02:10:57.300
Has it ever done better than you think you could have written yourself?

02:10:58.260 --> 02:11:05.780
I mean, on the level of content, of ideas, no. The things I say, I would never say that.

02:11:06.660 --> 02:11:12.980
But when it comes to the, you know, I mean, there is, again, the coherence and the quality

02:11:12.980 --> 02:11:21.700
of writing is such that I say it's unbelievable how good it is. And who knows, in 10 years,

02:11:21.700 --> 02:11:30.420
in 20 years, maybe it can do better even according to certain measures on the level of content.

02:11:31.380 --> 02:11:38.340
So that people will be able to do like a style transfer, do, in the style of Yuval Noah Harari,

02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:45.140
write anything, write why I should have ice cream tonight and make it convincing.

02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:47.380
I don't know if I have anything convincing to say about these things.

02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:49.620
I think you'll be surprised. I think you'd be surprised.

02:11:49.620 --> 02:11:52.580
There could be an evolutionary biology explanation for why.

02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:54.420
Yeah, ice cream is good for you.

02:11:54.420 --> 02:11:59.140
Yeah. So I mean, I mean, that changes the nature of writing.

02:11:59.780 --> 02:12:09.940
Ultimately, I think it goes back. Much of my writing is suspicious of itself.

02:12:10.580 --> 02:12:17.540
I write stories about the danger of stories. I write about intelligence,

02:12:17.540 --> 02:12:24.340
but highlighting the dangers of intelligence. Ultimately, I don't think that in terms of power,

02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:31.620
human power comes from intelligence and from stories. But I think that the deepest and

02:12:31.620 --> 02:12:39.220
best qualities of humans are not intelligence and not storytelling and not power. Again,

02:12:39.220 --> 02:12:44.500
with all our power, with all our cooperation, with all our intelligence, we are on the verge

02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:52.660
of destroying ourselves and destroying much of the ecosystem. Our best qualities are not there.

02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:59.220
Our best qualities are non-verbal. Again, they come from things like compassion,

02:12:59.220 --> 02:13:03.860
from introspection. And introspection, from my experience, is not verbal.

02:13:04.420 --> 02:13:11.140
If you try to understand yourself with words, you will never succeed. There is a place where

02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:18.820
you need the words, but the deepest insights, they don't come from words. And you can't write

02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:25.220
about it. Again, it goes back to Wittgenstein, to Buddha, to so many of these sages before,

02:13:25.220 --> 02:13:28.020
that these are the things we are silent about.

02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:31.780
But eventually, you have to project it. As a writer, you have to

02:13:33.220 --> 02:13:36.900
do the silent introspection, but project it onto a page.

02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:43.060
Yes, but you still have to warn people. You will never find the deepest truth in a book.

02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:50.260
You will never find it in words. You can only find it, I think, in direct experience,

02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:52.340
which is non-verbal, which is pre-verbal.

02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:56.100
In the silence of your own mind, somewhere in there.

02:13:56.100 --> 02:13:56.600
Yes.

02:13:58.340 --> 02:14:02.740
Well, let me ask you a silly question then, a ridiculously big question.

02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:09.780
You have done a lot of deep thinking about the world, about yourself, this kind of introspection.

02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:17.060
How do you think? If you, by way of advice, but just practically speaking,

02:14:18.020 --> 02:14:20.900
day to day, how do you think about difficult problems of the world?

02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:29.700
First of all, I take time off. The most important thing I do, I think as a writer,

02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:36.100
as a scientist, I meditate. I spend about two hours every day in silent meditation,

02:14:36.420 --> 02:14:42.340
observing as much as possible non-verbally what is happening within myself, focusing,

02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:48.340
you know, body sensations, the breath. Thoughts keep coming up, but I try not to give them

02:14:48.340 --> 02:14:51.780
attention. I don't try to drive them away. Just let them be there in the background,

02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:59.780
like some background noise. Don't engage with the thoughts, because the mind is constantly

02:15:00.740 --> 02:15:08.340
producing stories with words. These stories come between us and the world. They don't allow us to

02:15:08.340 --> 02:15:14.500
see ourselves or the world. For me, the most shocking thing when I started meditating 23 years

02:15:14.500 --> 02:15:19.620
ago, I was given this simple exercise to just observe my breath coming in and out of the

02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:26.500
nostrils, not controlling it, just observing it. And I couldn't do it for more than 10 seconds.

02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:30.660
I, for 10 seconds, would try to notice, oh, now the breath is coming in. It's coming in.

02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:34.900
It's coming in. Oh, it stopped coming in, and now it's going out, going out. 10 seconds,

02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:40.340
and some memory would come. Some thought would come. Some story about something that happened

02:15:42.340 --> 02:15:48.340
last week or 10 years ago or in the future. And the story would hijack my attention.

02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:53.300
It would take me maybe five minutes to remember, oh, I'm supposed to be observing my breath.

02:15:54.260 --> 02:16:01.220
If I can't observe my own breath because of these stories created by the mind, how can I hope to

02:16:01.220 --> 02:16:08.020
understand much more complex things like the political situation in Israel, the Israeli-Palestinian

02:16:08.020 --> 02:16:13.700
conflict, the Russian invasion of Ukraine? If all these stories keep coming, it's not the truth.

02:16:13.700 --> 02:16:20.900
It's just the story your own mind created. So first thing, train the mind to be silent and just

02:16:21.220 --> 02:16:26.900
observe. So two hours every day, and I go every year for a long retreat between one month and

02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:32.900
two months, 60 days of just silent meditation. Silent meditation for 60 days.

02:16:32.900 --> 02:16:40.100
Yeah. To train the mind, forget about your own stories. Just observe what is really happening.

02:16:41.220 --> 02:16:48.900
And then also on other, throughout the day, have an information diet. Today,

02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:56.420
many people are very aware of what they feed their body, what enters their mouth. Be very aware of

02:16:56.420 --> 02:17:03.060
what you feed your mind, what enters your mind. Have an information diet. So for instance,

02:17:03.060 --> 02:17:11.300
I read long books and I prefer, like I did many interviews, I prefer three hours interviews to

02:17:11.300 --> 02:17:20.900
five minutes interviews. The long format is, it's not always feasible, but you can go much,

02:17:20.900 --> 02:17:27.460
much deeper. So I would say an information diet, be very careful about what you feed your mind.

02:17:27.460 --> 02:17:33.940
Give preference to big chunks over small- To books over Twitter.

02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:39.300
Yes. Books over Twitter, definitely. And then when I encounter a problem,

02:17:40.260 --> 02:17:48.020
difficult intellectual problem, then I give it, I let the problem lead me

02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:56.900
where it goes and not where I want it to go. If I approach a problem with some preconceived

02:17:57.540 --> 02:18:03.780
idea or solution and then try to impose it on the problem and just find confirmation bias,

02:18:03.780 --> 02:18:09.940
just find the evidence that supports my view. This is easy for the mind to do

02:18:10.500 --> 02:18:16.900
and you don't learn anything new. Do you take notes? Do you start to concretize your thoughts

02:18:18.260 --> 02:18:24.660
on paper? I read a lot. I don't, I don't, usually I don't take notes. Then I start

02:18:24.660 --> 02:18:30.420
writing and when I write, I write like a torrent, just write. Now it's the time you read,

02:18:31.140 --> 02:18:36.180
you're doing the meditation. Now it's the time to write, write. Don't stop, just write.

02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:44.260
So I would write from memory and I'm not afraid of formulating, say, big ideas, big theories,

02:18:44.260 --> 02:18:49.940
and putting them on paper. The danger is once it's on paper, not on paper, on the screen,

02:18:49.940 --> 02:18:57.140
in the computer, you get attached to it and then you start with confirmation bias to build more and

02:18:57.140 --> 02:19:05.140
more layers around it and you can't go back. And then it's very dangerous. But I trust myself

02:19:05.700 --> 02:19:11.220
that I have to some extent the ability to press the delete button. The most important

02:19:11.940 --> 02:19:18.820
button in the keyboard is delete. I write and then I delete. I write and then I delete.

02:19:19.540 --> 02:19:24.660
And because I trust myself that I'll have the, every time I come to press the delete button,

02:19:24.660 --> 02:19:30.340
I feel bad. It's a kind of pain. Hey, I created this. It's a beautiful idea and I have to delete

02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:35.460
it. But you're still brave enough to press delete. I try and hopefully I do it enough times.

02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:41.060
And this is important because in the long term, it enables me to play with ideas. I have the

02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:48.900
confidence to start formulating some brave idea. Most of them turn out to be nonsense.

02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:54.980
But I trust myself not to be accustomed, not to be attached, not to become attached to my own

02:19:54.980 --> 02:20:02.020
nonsense. So it gives me this room for playfulness. I would be amiss if I didn't ask for people

02:20:02.020 --> 02:20:07.060
interested in hearing you talk about meditation. If they want to start meditating, what advice would

02:20:07.060 --> 02:20:12.420
you give on how to start? You mentioned you couldn't hold it for, you couldn't hold your

02:20:12.420 --> 02:20:17.220
attention on your breath for longer than 10 seconds at first. So how did they start on this

02:20:18.180 --> 02:20:26.420
journey? First of all, it's a difficult journey. It's not fun. It's not recreational. It's not

02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:32.660
kind of time to relax. It can be very, very intense. The most difficult thing, at least in

02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:37.700
the meditation I practice, Vipassana, which I learned from a teacher called Esen Goenka,

02:20:38.260 --> 02:20:44.020
the most difficult thing is not the silence. It's not the sitting for long hours. It's what comes up.

02:20:44.980 --> 02:20:51.300
Everything you don't want to know about yourself. This is what comes up. So it's very intense and

02:20:51.300 --> 02:20:56.260
difficult. If you go to a meditation retreat, don't think you're going to relax.

02:20:57.540 --> 02:21:04.100
So what's the experience of a meditation retreat when everything you don't like comes up for 30

02:21:04.100 --> 02:21:09.860
days? It depends what comes up. If anger comes up, you're angry. For days on end, you're just

02:21:09.860 --> 02:21:15.860
boiling with anger. Everything makes you angry. Again, something that happens right now, or you

02:21:15.860 --> 02:21:21.940
remember something from 20 years ago, and you start boiling with, it's like, I never even thought

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:31.060
about this incident, but it was somewhere stored with a huge, huge pile of anger attached to it,

02:21:31.060 --> 02:21:36.260
and it's now coming up, and all the anger is coming up. Maybe it's boredom. You know,

02:21:37.220 --> 02:21:44.580
30 days of meditation, you start getting bored, and it's the most boring thing. Suddenly, no anger.

02:21:44.580 --> 02:21:52.820
It's the most boring. Another second, I scream. I mean, and boredom is one of the most difficult

02:21:52.820 --> 02:22:00.580
things to deal with in life. I think it's closely related to death. Death is boring. In many movies,

02:22:00.580 --> 02:22:07.780
death is exciting. It's not exciting. When you die, ultimately, it's boredom. Nothing happens.

02:22:07.780 --> 02:22:09.540
It's the end of exciting things.

02:22:10.260 --> 02:22:16.180
And many things in the world happen because of boredom. To some extent, people start entire wars

02:22:16.740 --> 02:22:23.860
because of boredom. People quit relationships. People quit jobs because of boredom. And if you

02:22:24.660 --> 02:22:30.820
never learn how to deal with boredom, you will never learn how to enjoy peace and quiet,

02:22:31.700 --> 02:22:40.260
because the way to peace passes through boredom. And from what I experienced in meditation, I think

02:22:41.860 --> 02:22:46.820
maybe it was the most difficult, maybe at least in the top three, like much more difficult, say,

02:22:46.820 --> 02:22:52.900
than anger or pain. When pain comes up, you feel heroic. Hey, I'm dealing with pain.

02:22:53.860 --> 02:23:00.020
When boredom comes up, it brings it with depression and feelings of worthlessness,

02:23:00.020 --> 02:23:05.460
and it's nothing. I'm nothing. The way to peace is through boredom.

02:23:07.060 --> 02:23:10.980
David Foster Wallace said the key to life is to be unboreable,

02:23:12.980 --> 02:23:18.340
which is a different perspective on what you're talking to. Is there truth to that?

02:23:18.900 --> 02:23:22.580
Yes. I mean, it's closely related. I would say, like, I look at the world today,

02:23:22.580 --> 02:23:27.220
like politics, the one thing we need more than anything else is boring politicians.

02:23:28.180 --> 02:23:34.260
We have a superabundance of very exciting politicians who are doing and saying very

02:23:34.260 --> 02:23:39.620
exciting things, and we need boring politicians. And we need them quickly.

02:23:42.580 --> 02:23:46.420
Yeah, the way to peace is through boredom. That applies in more ways than one.

02:23:47.140 --> 02:23:52.580
What advice would you give to young people today in high school and college

02:23:53.700 --> 02:23:57.060
how to have a successful life, how to have a successful career?

02:23:57.780 --> 02:24:03.460
What they should know, it's the first time in history nobody has any idea how the world would

02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:08.820
look like in 10 years. Nobody has any idea how the world would look like when you grow up.

02:24:09.620 --> 02:24:13.860
Throughout history, it was never possible to predict the future. You live in the Middle Ages,

02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:18.580
nobody knows. Maybe in 10 years, the Vikings will invade, the Mongols will invade,

02:24:18.580 --> 02:24:21.780
there'll be an epidemic, there'll be an earthquake. Who knows?

02:24:21.780 --> 02:24:28.740
But the basic structures of life will not change. Most people will still be peasants.

02:24:29.940 --> 02:24:36.020
Armies would fight on horseback with swords and bows and arrows and things like that.

02:24:37.060 --> 02:24:42.180
So you could learn a lot from the wisdom of your elders. They've been there before,

02:24:42.740 --> 02:24:48.820
and they knew what kind of basic skills you need to learn. Most people need to learn how to

02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:56.580
sow wheat and harvest wheat or rice and make bread and build a house and ride a horse and things

02:24:56.580 --> 02:25:04.100
like that. Now we have no idea, not just about politics. We have no idea how the job market

02:25:04.100 --> 02:25:11.060
would look like in 10 years. We have no idea what skills will still be needed.

02:25:12.180 --> 02:25:17.780
You think you're going to learn how to code because they'll need a lot of coders in the

02:25:17.780 --> 02:25:22.340
2030s? Think again. Maybe AI is doing all the coding. You don't need any coders.

02:25:24.820 --> 02:25:30.980
You learn to translate languages. You want to be a translator? Gone. We don't know what skills

02:25:30.980 --> 02:25:37.620
will be needed. So the most important skill is the skill to keep learning and keep changing

02:25:37.700 --> 02:25:43.620
throughout our lives, which is very, very difficult, to keep reinventing ourselves.

02:25:44.900 --> 02:25:52.740
It's in a way a spiritual practice to build your personality, to build your mind

02:25:56.100 --> 02:26:07.060
as a very flexible mind. Traditionally, people thought about education, like building

02:26:07.940 --> 02:26:14.980
a stone house with very deep foundations. Now it's more like setting up a tent that

02:26:14.980 --> 02:26:20.340
you can fold and move to the next place very, very quickly because that's the 21st century.

02:26:21.780 --> 02:26:27.780
Which also raises questions about the future of education, what that looks like.

02:26:28.980 --> 02:26:37.060
Let me ask you about love. What were some of the challenges? What were some of the lessons

02:26:37.860 --> 02:26:41.620
about love, about life that you learned from coming out as gay?

02:26:43.300 --> 02:26:46.740
In many ways, it goes back to the stories. I think this is one of the

02:26:49.140 --> 02:26:57.940
reasons I became so interested in stories and in their power. I grew up in a small Israeli town

02:26:57.940 --> 02:27:09.060
in the 1980s, early 1990s, which was very homophobic. I basically embraced it. I breathed it

02:27:10.340 --> 02:27:17.620
because you could hardly even think differently. You had these two powerful stories around.

02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:27.620
One, that God hates gay people and that he will punish them for who they are or for what they do.

02:27:28.580 --> 02:27:34.740
Secondly, that it's not God, it's nature, that there is something diseased or sick about it.

02:27:35.860 --> 02:27:42.580
These people, maybe they are not sinners, but they are sick, they are defective,

02:27:43.860 --> 02:27:48.580
and nobody wanted to identify with such a thing. If your options, okay, you can be a sinner,

02:27:48.580 --> 02:27:55.220
you can be a defect, but what do you want? No good options there. It took me many years,

02:27:55.300 --> 02:28:02.820
till I was 21, to come to terms with it. I learned two things. First, about the

02:28:02.820 --> 02:28:11.540
amazing capacity of the human mind for denial and delusion. An algorithm could have told me

02:28:11.540 --> 02:28:17.700
that I'm gay when I was 14 or 15. If there is a good-looking guy and girl walking,

02:28:17.700 --> 02:28:23.220
I would immediately focus on the guy. But I didn't connect the dots.

02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:30.180
Like, I could not understand what was happening inside my own brain and my own mind and my own

02:28:30.180 --> 02:28:34.900
body. It took me a long time to realize, you know, you're just gay.

02:28:36.260 --> 02:28:40.980
So that speaks to the power of social convention versus individual thought.

02:28:40.980 --> 02:28:48.580
This is the power of self-delusion. It's not that I knew I was gay and was hiding it. I was hiding it

02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:55.700
for myself successfully. Looking back, I don't understand how it is possible,

02:28:55.700 --> 02:29:00.020
but I know it is possible. I knew and didn't know at the same time.

02:29:00.580 --> 02:29:06.180
And then the other big lesson is the power of the stories, of the social conventions,

02:29:06.180 --> 02:29:12.260
because the stories were not true. They did not make sense even on their own terms. Even if you

02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:19.540
accept the basic religious framework of the world, that there is a good God that created

02:29:19.540 --> 02:29:27.300
everything and controls everything, why would a good God punish people for love?

02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:35.220
I understand why a good God would punish people for violence, for hatred, for cruelty, but why would

02:29:35.220 --> 02:29:42.820
God punish people for love, especially when he created them that way? So even if you accept the

02:29:42.820 --> 02:29:49.860
religious framework of the world, obviously the story that God hates gay people, it comes not from

02:29:49.860 --> 02:29:56.180
God, but from some humans who invented this story. They take their own hatred. This is something

02:29:56.180 --> 02:30:02.100
humans do all the time. They hate somebody and they say, no, I don't hate them. God hates them.

02:30:03.060 --> 02:30:09.380
They throw their own hatred on God. And then if you think about the scientific

02:30:09.380 --> 02:30:15.300
framework that said that all gays, they are against nature, they are against the laws of nature,

02:30:15.940 --> 02:30:22.100
and so forth. Science tells us nothing can exist against the laws of nature.

02:30:23.220 --> 02:30:29.380
Things that go against the laws of nature just don't exist. There is a law of nature that you

02:30:29.460 --> 02:30:34.660
can't move faster than the speed of light. Now, you don't have this minority of people

02:30:34.660 --> 02:30:40.100
who break the laws of nature by going faster than the speed of light. And then nature comes,

02:30:40.100 --> 02:30:43.780
nah, that's bad. You shouldn't do that. That's not how nature works.

02:30:44.500 --> 02:30:50.980
If something goes against the laws of nature, it just can't exist. The fact that gay people exist,

02:30:50.980 --> 02:30:56.580
me, and not just people, you see homosexuality among many, many mammals and birds and other

02:30:56.580 --> 02:31:05.540
animals, it exists because it is in line with the laws of nature. The idea that this is sick,

02:31:05.540 --> 02:31:10.100
that this is whatever, it comes not from nature. It comes from the human imagination.

02:31:10.740 --> 02:31:16.740
Some people, or for whatever reasons, hated gay people. They said, oh, they go against nature.

02:31:17.460 --> 02:31:23.620
But this is a story created by people. This is not the laws of nature. And this taught me

02:31:24.580 --> 02:31:32.020
that so many of the things that we think are natural or eternal or divine, no, they're just

02:31:32.020 --> 02:31:38.420
human stories. But these human stories are often the most powerful forces in the world.

02:31:39.380 --> 02:31:44.740
So what did you learn from your just a personal struggle of

02:31:46.900 --> 02:31:51.220
journey through the social conventions to find one of the things that makes life awesome,

02:31:51.380 --> 02:31:58.820
which is love? What it takes to strip away the self-delusion and the pressures of social

02:31:58.820 --> 02:32:07.060
convention to wake up? It takes a lot of work, a lot of courage, and a lot of help from other people.

02:32:09.540 --> 02:32:14.820
This kind of heroic idea that I can do it all by myself, it doesn't work.

02:32:15.780 --> 02:32:22.100
Certainly, with love, you need at least one more person. And I'm very happy that I found Itzik.

02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:28.100
We lived in the same small Israeli town. We lived on two adjacent streets for years,

02:32:28.100 --> 02:32:33.620
probably went to school on the same bus for years without really encountering each other.

02:32:33.620 --> 02:32:41.220
In the end, we met on one of the first dating sites on the internet for gay people in Israel

02:32:41.460 --> 02:32:44.260
in 2002. You're saying the internet works.

02:32:44.260 --> 02:32:49.700
Yes. I said a lot of bad things or dangers about technology and the internet. There are also,

02:32:49.700 --> 02:32:55.380
of course, good things. This is not an accident. You have two kinds of minorities in history.

02:32:56.260 --> 02:33:03.860
You have minorities which are a cohesive group, like Jews, that, yes, you're as small as being

02:33:03.860 --> 02:33:10.740
born Jewish in, say, Germany or Russia or whatever. You're born in a small community. But as a Jewish

02:33:10.740 --> 02:33:15.860
boy, you're born to a Jewish family. You have Jewish parents. You have Jewish siblings. You're

02:33:15.860 --> 02:33:20.980
in a Jewish neighborhood. You have Jewish friends. So these kinds of minorities, they could always

02:33:20.980 --> 02:33:26.820
come together and help each other throughout history. Another type of minority, like gay people

02:33:26.820 --> 02:33:34.580
or more broadly, LGBTQ people, that as a gay boy, you're usually not born to a gay family with gay

02:33:34.580 --> 02:33:42.420
parents and gay siblings in a gay neighborhood. Usually, you find yourself completely alone.

02:33:43.140 --> 02:33:49.140
For most of history, one of the biggest problems for the gay community was that there was no

02:33:49.140 --> 02:33:56.660
community. How do you find one another? The internet was a wonderful thing in this respect

02:33:56.660 --> 02:34:03.060
because it made it very easy for these kinds of diffuse communities or diffuse minorities

02:34:03.060 --> 02:34:08.580
to find each other. So me and Itzik, even though we rode the same bus together to school for years,

02:34:08.580 --> 02:34:13.700
we didn't meet in the physical world. We met online. Because, again, in the physical world,

02:34:13.700 --> 02:34:19.140
you don't want to identify in an Israeli town in the 1980s. You ride the bus. You don't want to say,

02:34:19.140 --> 02:34:24.260
hey, I'm gay. Is there anybody else gay here? That's not a good idea. But on the internet,

02:34:24.260 --> 02:34:28.580
we could find each other. There's another lesson in there that maybe sometimes the thing you're

02:34:28.580 --> 02:34:33.060
looking for is right under your nose. Yeah. A very old lesson and a very true

02:34:34.180 --> 02:34:42.500
lesson in many ways. So you need help from other people to realize the truth about yourself.

02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:47.380
So of course, in love, you cannot just love abstractly. There is another person there.

02:34:47.380 --> 02:34:55.140
You need to find them. But also, we were one of the first generations who enjoyed the benefits

02:34:55.140 --> 02:35:00.740
of gay liberation, of the very difficult struggles of people who were much braver than us

02:35:01.380 --> 02:35:08.580
in the 1980s, 1970s, 1960s, who dared to question social conventions,

02:35:09.620 --> 02:35:17.380
to struggle at sometimes a terrible price. And we benefited from it. And more broadly,

02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:22.100
we spoke earlier about the feminist movement. There would have been no gay liberation without

02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:31.300
the feminist movement. We also owe them for starting to change the gender structure of the

02:35:31.300 --> 02:35:39.220
world. And this is always true. You can never do it just by yourself. Also, I look at my journey

02:35:39.220 --> 02:35:46.900
in meditation, I could not have found the idea of going to meditation retreat okay. But I couldn't

02:35:46.900 --> 02:35:52.740
discover meditation. I couldn't develop the meditation technique by myself. Somebody had

02:35:52.740 --> 02:36:03.220
to teach me this way of how to look inside yourself. And it's also a very important lesson

02:36:04.100 --> 02:36:10.500
that you can't do it just by yourself. That this fantasy of complete autonomy, of complete

02:36:10.580 --> 02:36:17.620
self-sufficiency, it doesn't work. It tends to be a very kind of male match of fantasy.

02:36:17.620 --> 02:36:23.780
I don't need anybody. I can be so strong and so brave that I'll do everything by myself.

02:36:23.780 --> 02:36:34.420
It never works. You need friends. You need a mentor. You need the very thing that makes us

02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:41.620
human as other humans. Absolutely. You mentioned that the fear of border might be a kind of

02:36:42.260 --> 02:36:48.260
proxy for the fear of death. So what role does the fear of death play in the human condition?

02:36:48.260 --> 02:36:54.420
Are you afraid of death? Yes, I think everybody are afraid of death. I mean, all our fears come

02:36:54.420 --> 02:37:01.780
out of the fear of death. But the fear of death is just so deep and difficult. Usually we can't

02:37:01.780 --> 02:37:07.460
face it directly. So we cut it into little pieces and we face just little pieces. Oh,

02:37:07.460 --> 02:37:13.220
I lost my smartphone. That's a little, little, little piece of the fear of death, which is of

02:37:13.220 --> 02:37:18.820
losing everything. So I can't deal with losing everything. I'm dealing now with losing my phone

02:37:18.820 --> 02:37:27.220
or losing a book or whatever. I feel pain. That's a small bit of the fear of death. Somebody who

02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:34.420
really doesn't fear death would not fear anything at all. It'll be like anything that happens,

02:37:34.420 --> 02:37:40.180
I can deal with it. If I can deal with death, this is nothing. So any fear is a distant echo

02:37:40.180 --> 02:37:47.700
of the big fear of death. Have you ever looked at it head on, caught glimpses,

02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:55.140
sort of contemplate as the Stoics do? Yes. I mean, when I was a teenager, I would constantly

02:37:55.140 --> 02:38:04.740
contemplate trying to understand, to imagine. It was a very, very shocking and moving experience.

02:38:05.460 --> 02:38:11.060
I remember that especially in connection with national ideology, which was also very big,

02:38:11.060 --> 02:38:16.100
strong in Israel, still is, which again comes from the fear of death. You know that you're

02:38:16.100 --> 02:38:20.980
going to die. So you say, okay, I die, but the nation lives on. I live on through the nation.

02:38:20.980 --> 02:38:29.460
I don't really die. You'll hear it especially on Memorial Day for fallen soldiers. So every day,

02:38:29.460 --> 02:38:35.620
there'll be in school Memorial Day for fallen soldiers who fell defending Israel in all these

02:38:35.620 --> 02:38:41.060
different wars. All these kids will come dressed in white, and you'll have this big ceremony with

02:38:41.060 --> 02:38:49.140
flags and songs and dances in memory of the fallen soldiers. I don't want to sound crass,

02:38:49.140 --> 02:38:52.420
but you get the impression that the best thing in life is to be a fallen soldier.

02:38:53.140 --> 02:38:56.820
Because even though, yes, you die, everybody dies in the end, but then you'll have all these

02:38:56.820 --> 02:39:02.340
cool kids for years and years remembering you and celebrating you, and you don't really die.

02:39:02.980 --> 02:39:07.060
And I remember standing in these ceremonies and thinking, what does it actually mean?

02:39:07.620 --> 02:39:16.660
Like, okay, so if I'm a fallen soldier, now I'm a skeleton, I'm bones under this military cemetery,

02:39:16.660 --> 02:39:23.780
under this stone. Do I actually hear the kids singing all these patriotic songs? If not,

02:39:23.780 --> 02:39:27.540
how do I know they do it? Maybe they trick me. Maybe I die in the war and then they don't sing

02:39:27.540 --> 02:39:34.580
any songs. And how does it help me? And I realized, I was quite young at the time,

02:39:34.580 --> 02:39:39.860
that if you're dead, you can't hear anything because that's the meaning of being dead.

02:39:39.860 --> 02:39:43.620
And if you're dead, you can't think of anything like, oh, now they're remembering because you're

02:39:43.620 --> 02:39:47.780
dead. That's the meaning of being dead. And it was a shocking realization.

02:39:48.660 --> 02:39:53.540
But it's a really difficult realization to keep holding your mind, like it's the end.

02:39:53.540 --> 02:40:00.500
I lost it over time. I mean, for many years, it was a very powerful fuel, motivation for philosophical,

02:40:00.500 --> 02:40:07.300
for spiritual exploration. And I realized that the fear of death is really a very powerful drive.

02:40:07.300 --> 02:40:13.380
And over the years, especially as I meditated, it kind of dissipated. And today, I sometimes find

02:40:13.380 --> 02:40:20.740
myself trying to recapture this teenage fear of death because it was so powerful and I just can't.

02:40:20.740 --> 02:40:26.980
I try to make the same image. I don't know. It's something about the teenage years.

02:40:26.980 --> 02:40:32.980
Yeah. I always thought that the adults, there is something wrong with the adults because they

02:40:32.980 --> 02:40:39.380
don't get it. Like I would ask my parents or teachers about it and they, yes, you die in the

02:40:39.380 --> 02:40:44.980
end. That's it. But on the other hand, they are so worried about other things. Like there'll be a

02:40:44.980 --> 02:40:50.100
political crisis or an economic problem or a personal problem like with the bank or whatever.

02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:54.980
They'll be so worried. But then about the fact that they're going to die, we don't care about it.

02:40:56.020 --> 02:41:01.140
That's why you read Camus and others when you're a teenager, you really worry about the existential

02:41:01.140 --> 02:41:06.340
questions. Well, this feels like the right time to ask the big question. What's the meaning of

02:41:06.340 --> 02:41:11.140
this whole thing, Yval? And you're the right person to ask. What's the meaning of life?

02:41:11.140 --> 02:41:12.420
Yes. Oh, that's easy.

02:41:12.420 --> 02:41:12.980
What is it?

02:41:15.940 --> 02:41:23.540
So what life is, if you ask what the meaning of life, what life is, life is feeling things,

02:41:24.260 --> 02:41:31.460
having sensations, emotions, and reacting to them. When you feel something good, something pleasant,

02:41:31.460 --> 02:41:36.820
you want more out of it. You want more of it. When you feel something unpleasant, you want to

02:41:36.820 --> 02:41:41.780
get rid of it. That's the whole of life. That's what is happening all the time. You feel things,

02:41:42.420 --> 02:41:48.580
you want the pleasant things to increase, you want the unpleasant things to disappear. That's

02:41:48.580 --> 02:41:56.340
what life is. If you ask what is the meaning of life in a more kind of philosophical or spiritual

02:41:56.340 --> 02:42:05.060
question, the real question to ask what kind of answer do you expect? Most people expect a story,

02:42:06.020 --> 02:42:11.780
and that's always the wrong answer. Most people expect that the answer to the question what is

02:42:11.780 --> 02:42:18.100
the meaning of life will be a story, like a big drama, that this is the plot line and this is

02:42:18.100 --> 02:42:24.500
your role in the story. This is what you have to do. This is your line in the big play. You say

02:42:24.500 --> 02:42:30.820
your line, you do your thing, that's the thing. This is human imagination. This is fantasy.

02:42:32.500 --> 02:42:38.260
To really understand life, life is not a story. The universe does not function like a story.

02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:46.980
I think to really understand life, you need to observe it directly in a non-verbal way.

02:42:46.980 --> 02:42:55.700
Don't turn it into a story. The question to start with is what is suffering? What is causing

02:42:55.700 --> 02:43:02.420
suffering? The question what is the meaning of life, it will take you to fantasies and delusions.

02:43:03.060 --> 02:43:08.740
We want to stay with the reality of life. The most important question about the reality of life

02:43:08.740 --> 02:43:12.260
is what is suffering and where is it coming from?

02:43:12.980 --> 02:43:17.700
And to answer that non-verbally, so the conscious experience of suffering.

02:43:17.700 --> 02:43:25.540
Yes. When you suffer, try to observe what is really happening when you're suffering.

02:43:30.820 --> 02:43:35.380
Well put. I wonder if AI will also go through that same kind of process.

02:43:36.580 --> 02:43:40.660
If we develop consciousness or not, at present it's not. It's just words.

02:43:41.140 --> 02:43:43.620
It will just say to you, please don't hurt me at all.

02:43:46.260 --> 02:43:51.780
Again, as I've mentioned to you, I'm a huge fan of yours. Thank you for the incredible work you do.

02:43:52.820 --> 02:43:59.140
This conversation has been a long time. I think coming, it's a huge honor to talk to you.

02:43:59.140 --> 02:44:01.300
This was really fun. Thank you for talking today.

02:44:01.300 --> 02:44:07.140
Thank you. I really enjoyed it. As I said, I think the long form is the best form.

02:44:07.140 --> 02:44:10.420
Yeah, I loved it. Thank you.

02:44:37.140 --> 02:44:38.420
See you next time.
