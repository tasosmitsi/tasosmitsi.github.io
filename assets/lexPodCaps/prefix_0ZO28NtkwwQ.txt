00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
The following is a conversation with Magnus Carlsen,

00:03.200 --> 00:05.360
the number one ranked chess player in the world

00:05.360 --> 00:07.720
and widely considered to be one of,

00:07.720 --> 00:10.320
if not the greatest chess player of all time.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.480
The camera on Magnus died 20 minutes into the conversation.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.920
Most folks still just listen to the audio

00:16.920 --> 00:18.760
through a podcast player anyway,

00:18.760 --> 00:23.120
but if you're watching this on YouTube or Spotify,

00:23.120 --> 00:25.040
we did our best to still make it interesting

00:25.040 --> 00:27.040
by adding relevant image overlays.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.920
I mess things up sometimes, like in this case,

00:31.920 --> 00:34.320
but I'm always working hard to improve.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.520
I hope you understand.

00:36.520 --> 00:39.680
Thank you for your patience and support along the way.

00:39.680 --> 00:40.520
I love you all.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.840
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.200
in the description.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.640
And now, dear friends, here's Magnus Carlsen.

00:51.720 --> 00:54.480
You're considered by many to be one of the greatest,

00:54.480 --> 00:56.960
if not the greatest chess players of all time.

00:57.840 --> 01:00.000
But you're also one of the best fantasy football,

01:00.000 --> 01:02.880
AKA soccer, competitors in the world,

01:02.880 --> 01:04.320
plus recently picking up poker

01:04.320 --> 01:06.960
and competing at a world-class level.

01:06.960 --> 01:10.320
So before chess, let's talk football and greatness.

01:11.360 --> 01:13.520
You're a Real Madrid fan,

01:13.520 --> 01:15.680
so let me ask you the ridiculous big question.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.080
Who do you think is the greatest football,

01:18.080 --> 01:20.320
AKA soccer player of all time?

01:20.320 --> 01:22.800
Can you make the case for Messi?

01:22.800 --> 01:25.760
Can you make the case for Cristiano Ronaldo,

01:25.760 --> 01:28.080
Maradona, does anybody jump to mind?

01:28.800 --> 01:32.560
I think it's pretty hard to make a case for anybody else

01:33.760 --> 01:36.800
than Messi for his all-around game.

01:38.960 --> 01:47.360
Frankly, my Real Madrid fandom predates the Ronaldo era,

01:47.360 --> 01:50.240
the second Ronaldo, not the first one.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.760
So I always liked Ronaldo,

01:51.760 --> 01:56.000
but I always kind of thought that Messi was better.

01:57.280 --> 02:00.080
I went to quite a number of Madrid games

02:00.080 --> 02:03.680
and they've always been super helpful to me down there.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.240
The only thing is that they asked me,

02:06.800 --> 02:08.480
they were going to do an interview

02:08.480 --> 02:10.800
and they were going to ask me who my favorite player was.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.760
I said somebody else, I think I said Isco at that point,

02:15.760 --> 02:18.640
and I was like, okay, take two, now you say Ronaldo.

02:19.360 --> 02:22.400
So for them, it was very important,

02:22.400 --> 02:26.400
but it wasn't that huge to me.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.240
So Messi over Maradona.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.320
Yeah, but I think just like with chess,

02:32.320 --> 02:33.840
it's hard to compare eras.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.640
Obviously, the improvements in football have been

02:37.120 --> 02:40.880
like in technique and such have been even greater

02:40.880 --> 02:43.040
than they have been in chess,

02:43.040 --> 02:48.880
but it's always a weird discussion to have.

02:48.880 --> 02:54.240
But just as a fan, what do you think is beautiful about the game?

02:54.240 --> 02:55.520
What defines greatness?

02:56.720 --> 02:59.360
With Messi, one, he's really good at finishing,

02:59.920 --> 03:01.360
two, very good at assist,

03:02.080 --> 03:03.440
like three, there's just magic,

03:03.440 --> 03:05.280
it's just beautiful to see the play.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.720
So it's not just about the finishing.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.600
It's like Maradona's hand of God.

03:09.600 --> 03:13.360
There's some creativity on the pitch.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.680
Is that important or is it very important

03:15.680 --> 03:18.000
to get the World Cups and the big championships

03:18.000 --> 03:19.040
and that kind of stuff?

03:19.040 --> 03:22.000
I think the World Cup is pretty overrated

03:22.000 --> 03:26.480
seeing as it's such a small sample size.

03:26.480 --> 03:35.120
So it sort of annoys me always when titles are always appreciated so much,

03:35.840 --> 03:41.840
even though that particular title can be a lot of luck

03:41.840 --> 03:44.720
or at least some luck.

03:46.720 --> 03:50.720
So I do appreciate the statistics a bit

03:50.720 --> 03:55.680
and all the statistics say that Messi is the best finisher of all time,

03:55.680 --> 03:57.600
which I think helps a lot.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.280
And then there's the intangibles as well.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.760
The flip side of that is the small sample size.

04:04.560 --> 04:08.960
It's what really creates the magic.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.520
It's just like the Olympics.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.800
You basically train your whole life for this.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.040
You live your whole life for this and it's a rare moment.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.440
One mistake and it's all over.

04:20.160 --> 04:25.040
That's, for some reason, a lot of people either break under that pressure

04:25.040 --> 04:26.480
or rise up under that pressure.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.320
You don't admire the magic of that.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.520
No, I do.

04:29.760 --> 04:36.080
I just think that rising under pressure and breaking under the pressure

04:36.080 --> 04:43.360
is often a really oversimplified take on what's happening.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.840
Yeah, we do romanticize the game.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.800
Well, let me ask you another ridiculous question.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.160
You're also a fan of basketball.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.240
Let me ask the goat question.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.560
I'm biased because I went to high school in Chicago

04:59.920 --> 05:02.160
Chicago Bulls during the Michael Jordan era.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.800
Let me ask the Jordan versus LeBron James question.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.440
Let's continue on this thread of greatness.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.000
Which one do you pick or somebody else?

05:13.680 --> 05:15.440
I'll give you a completely different answer.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.280
Depending on my mood and depending on whom I talk to,

05:21.280 --> 05:24.400
I pick one of the two and then I try to argue for that.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.520
The quantum mechanical thing.

05:25.520 --> 05:32.240
Well, again, what would if you were to argue for either one?

05:35.200 --> 05:38.560
Statistically, I think LeBron James is going to surpass Jordan.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.360
Yeah, no doubt.

05:41.200 --> 05:44.160
Again, there's a debate between...

05:44.800 --> 05:46.240
Unquantifiable greatness.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.040
That's the whole debate.

05:50.080 --> 05:50.560
Yes.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.840
So it's quantifiable versus unquantifiable.

05:53.840 --> 05:54.160
Yeah.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.040
What's more important?

05:55.680 --> 05:57.920
You're depending on mood all over the place.

05:59.760 --> 06:03.360
What do you lean in general with these folks, with soccer,

06:03.360 --> 06:07.680
with anything in life towards the unquantifiable more?

06:07.680 --> 06:10.400
No, definitely towards the quantifiable.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.720
So when you're unsure, lean towards the numbers.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.560
But see like it's later generations.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.080
There's something that's what people say about Maradona is

06:18.800 --> 06:24.560
he took arguably somewhat mediocre team to a World Cup.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.560
So there's that also uplifting nature of the player

06:28.560 --> 06:29.840
to be able to rise up the hold.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.120
It is a team sport.

06:31.120 --> 06:39.920
So are you going to punish Messi for taking a mediocre Argentine squad

06:39.920 --> 06:46.560
to the final in 2014 and punish him because they lost to a great team

06:46.560 --> 06:48.560
very narrowly after they missed?

06:49.520 --> 06:54.480
He set up like a great chance for Iguain in the first half,

06:56.320 --> 06:59.440
which he fluffed and then, yeah, eventually they lost the game.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.480
Yeah, they do criticize Cristiano Ronaldo,

07:02.480 --> 07:07.120
Messi for being on really strong squads in terms of the club teams

07:07.120 --> 07:09.840
and saying, yeah, okay, it's easy when you have

07:09.840 --> 07:12.720
like Ronaldinho or whoever on your team.

07:13.280 --> 07:18.320
It would be very interesting just if the league could make a decision.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.360
Yeah, just random, random allocation.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.320
And just every single game, just keep reallocating.

07:28.320 --> 07:32.800
Or maybe once a season or every season you get random.

07:32.800 --> 07:41.520
Let's say every player, if let's say they sign a five-year contract for a team,

07:41.520 --> 07:44.000
like one of them you're going to get randomly allocated to,

07:44.960 --> 07:46.640
to let's say a bottom half team.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.640
I bet you there's going to be so much corruption around that.

07:50.640 --> 07:54.800
No, obviously it wouldn't ever happen or work,

07:54.800 --> 07:57.600
but I think it's interesting to think about.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.720
So on chess, let's zoom out.

08:01.440 --> 08:05.680
If you break down your approach to chess, when you're at your best,

08:10.720 --> 08:12.400
what do you think contributes to that approach?

08:12.400 --> 08:15.200
Is it memory recall, specific lines and positions?

08:15.200 --> 08:16.400
Is it intuition?

08:16.400 --> 08:18.000
How much of it is intuition?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.160
How much of it is pure calculation?

08:20.160 --> 08:23.200
How much of it is messing with the strategy of the opponent?

08:23.200 --> 08:26.880
So the game theory aspect in terms of what contributes

08:26.880 --> 08:29.920
to the highest level of play that you do.

08:30.720 --> 08:38.400
I think the answer differs a little bit now from what it did eight years ago.

08:39.040 --> 08:45.200
For instance, I feel like I've had two peaks in my career in 2014.

08:46.080 --> 08:50.560
Well, 2013, 2014, and also in 2019.

08:50.560 --> 08:59.280
And in those years, I was very different in terms of my strength.

09:00.960 --> 09:06.240
Specifically in 2019, I benefited a lot from opening preparation.

09:07.680 --> 09:14.960
While in 2013, 2014, I mostly tried to avoid my opponent's preparation,

09:14.960 --> 09:18.400
rather than that being a strength.

09:19.120 --> 09:26.240
So I'm mentioning that also because it's something you didn't mention.

09:26.240 --> 09:31.920
I think my intuitive understanding of chess has, over those years,

09:32.960 --> 09:39.520
always been a little bit better than the others, even though it has evolved as well.

09:39.680 --> 09:45.280
Well, certainly there are things that I understand now that I didn't understand

09:46.240 --> 09:48.000
back then, but that's not only for me.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.640
That's for others as well.

09:51.840 --> 09:54.880
I was younger back then, so I played with more energy,

09:54.880 --> 09:59.680
which meant that I could play better in long drawn out games,

10:01.600 --> 10:08.000
which was also a necessity for me because I couldn't beat people in the openings.

10:08.960 --> 10:15.520
But in terms of calculation, that's always been a weird issue for me.

10:16.160 --> 10:22.000
I've always been really, really bad at solving exercises in chess.

10:24.160 --> 10:28.560
That's been a blind spot for me.

10:28.640 --> 10:38.720
First of all, I found it hard to concentrate on them and to look deep enough.

10:38.720 --> 10:42.400
So this is like a puzzle, a position, mate in X.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.360
I mean, one thing is mate, but find the best move.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.120
That's generally the exercise.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.120
Find the best move, find the best line.

10:50.720 --> 10:51.920
You just don't connect with it.

10:51.920 --> 10:58.320
Usually you have to look deep, and then when I get these lines during the game,

10:58.320 --> 11:04.560
I very often find the right solution, even though

11:09.120 --> 11:16.800
it's not still the best part of my game to calculate very, very deeply.

11:16.800 --> 11:20.320
But it doesn't feel like calculation, you're saying, in terms of...

11:20.320 --> 11:27.360
No, it does sometimes, but for me, it's more like I'm at the board trying to find the solution,

11:27.360 --> 11:33.360
and I understand the training at home is trying a little bit to replicate that.

11:33.360 --> 11:37.120
You give somebody half an hour in a position.

11:37.600 --> 11:41.680
In this instance, you might have thought for half an hour if you play the game,

11:42.240 --> 11:44.800
but I just cannot do it.

11:44.800 --> 11:51.280
One thing I know that I am good at, though, is calculating short lines,

11:52.080 --> 11:54.960
because I calculate them well.

11:54.960 --> 12:04.560
I'm good at seeing little details, and I'm also much better than most at evaluating,

12:05.440 --> 12:11.680
which I think is something that sets me apart from others.

12:11.680 --> 12:18.880
So evaluating specific position, if I make this move and the position changes in this way,

12:19.040 --> 12:22.720
is this a step in the right direction in a big picture way?

12:22.720 --> 12:30.400
Yeah, you calculate a few moves ahead, and then you evaluate, because a lot of the times you cannot...

12:31.440 --> 12:34.480
The branches become so big that you cannot calculate everything.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.520
Like a fog.

12:35.520 --> 12:44.480
Yeah, so you have to make evaluations based mostly on knowledge and intuition,

12:44.720 --> 12:49.760
and somehow I seem to do that pretty well.

12:49.760 --> 12:53.200
When you say you're good at short lines, what's short?

12:53.760 --> 12:58.960
That's usually lines of two to four moves each.

12:58.960 --> 13:03.920
Okay, so that's directly applicable to even faster games like Blitz, Chess, and so on?

13:03.920 --> 13:08.640
Yeah, Blitz is a lot about calculating force lines.

13:09.280 --> 13:17.200
So you can see pretty clearly that the players who struggle at Blitz who are great at classical

13:17.200 --> 13:21.440
are those who rely on deep calculating ability,

13:21.440 --> 13:24.320
because you simply don't have time for that in Blitz.

13:24.320 --> 13:28.560
You have to calculate quickly and rely a lot on intuition.

13:29.760 --> 13:30.640
I know it's really difficult.

13:30.640 --> 13:35.600
Can you try to talk through what's actually being visualized in your head?

13:36.160 --> 13:39.040
Is there a visual component?

13:39.040 --> 13:41.040
Yeah, no, I just visualized the board.

13:41.040 --> 13:44.640
I mean, the board is in my head.

13:44.640 --> 13:45.760
Two-dimensional?

13:45.760 --> 13:49.760
My interpretation is that it is two-dimensional.

13:49.760 --> 13:50.960
Like what colors?

13:50.960 --> 13:52.560
Is it brown tinted?

13:52.560 --> 13:53.360
Is it black?

13:54.960 --> 13:55.920
What's the theme?

13:55.920 --> 13:57.520
Is it a big board, small board?

13:59.280 --> 14:00.480
What do the pawns look like?

14:01.760 --> 14:03.520
Or is it more in the space of concepts?

14:04.080 --> 14:07.520
Like, yeah, there aren't a lot of colors.

14:10.560 --> 14:11.040
What is it?

14:11.040 --> 14:12.480
Queen's Gambit on a ceiling?

14:12.480 --> 14:15.920
I'm trying right now to imagine it.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.440
What about when you do the branching?

14:17.440 --> 14:19.920
When you have multiple boards and so on, how does that look?

14:20.480 --> 14:21.680
It's only one at a time.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.120
One position at a time, so then I go back.

14:26.160 --> 14:30.560
And that's what when people play, or at least that's what I do,

14:30.560 --> 14:33.280
when I play blindfold chess against several people,

14:33.280 --> 14:35.760
then it's just always one board at a time.

14:35.760 --> 14:39.040
And the rest are stored away somewhere.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.320
But how do you store them away?

14:40.320 --> 14:44.400
So like you went down one branch, you're like, all right, that's I got that.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.360
I understand that there's some good there.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.560
There's some bad there.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.240
Now let me go down another branch.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.480
Like, how do you store away the information?

14:52.480 --> 14:53.760
Just put on a shelf kind of?

14:54.400 --> 14:56.000
I try and store it away.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.960
Sometimes I have to sort of repeat it because I forget.

14:59.760 --> 15:06.000
And it does happen frequently in games that you're thinking for,

15:06.800 --> 15:09.840
especially if you're thinking for long, let's say half an hour,

15:09.840 --> 15:12.800
or even more than that, that you play a move,

15:12.800 --> 15:15.600
and then your opponent plays a move, then you play a move,

15:15.600 --> 15:17.760
and they play a move again, and you realize,

15:17.760 --> 15:20.000
oh, I actually calculated that.

15:20.000 --> 15:20.960
I just forgot about it.

15:22.240 --> 15:25.360
So that's obviously what happens when you store the information

15:25.360 --> 15:26.480
and you cannot retrieve it.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.800
When you think about a move for 20, 30 minutes,

15:30.320 --> 15:31.280
how do you break that down?

15:32.240 --> 15:38.000
Can you describe what's the algorithm here that takes 30 minutes to run?

15:38.640 --> 15:42.640
30 minutes is, at least for me, it's usually a waste.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.720
30 minutes usually means that I don't know what to do.

15:47.840 --> 15:48.400
And I'm trying-

15:48.400 --> 15:49.760
You're just running into the wall over and over.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.000
Yeah, I'm trying to find something that isn't there.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.040
I think 10 to 15 minutes things in complicated positions

15:57.040 --> 15:59.920
can be really, really helpful.

15:59.920 --> 16:04.560
Then you can spend your time pretty efficiently.

16:05.360 --> 16:10.240
Just means that the branches are getting wide.

16:10.240 --> 16:17.200
There's a lot to run through, both in terms of calculation

16:17.200 --> 16:19.920
and lots you have to evaluate as well.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.960
And then based on that 10 to 15 minute thing,

16:24.960 --> 16:29.200
you have a pretty good idea what to do.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.480
I mean, it's very rare that I would think for half an hour

16:32.480 --> 16:35.840
and I would have a eureka moment during the game.

16:35.840 --> 16:39.680
If I haven't seen it in 10 minutes, I'm probably not going to see it at all.

16:39.680 --> 16:40.960
You're going through different branches.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.440
And after 15 minutes, it's like-

16:44.160 --> 16:47.120
Mainly to the middle game, because when you get to the end game,

16:47.120 --> 16:52.880
it's usually brute force calculation that makes you spend so much time.

16:52.880 --> 16:59.440
So middle game is normally a complicated mix of brute force calculation

17:01.520 --> 17:05.760
and creativity and evaluation.

17:05.760 --> 17:09.440
So end game, it's easier in that sense.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.240
Well, you're good at every aspect of chess,

17:14.240 --> 17:16.480
but also your end game is legendary.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.680
It baffles experts.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.240
So can you linger on that then?

17:20.240 --> 17:22.400
Try to explain what the heck is going on there.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.360
If you look at game six of the previous world championship,

17:26.400 --> 17:30.240
the longest game ever played in chess,

17:31.280 --> 17:38.240
it was, I think, his queen versus your rook knight in two pawns.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.240
There's so many options there.

17:40.240 --> 17:42.480
It's such an interesting little dance,

17:42.480 --> 17:45.120
and it's kind of not obvious that it wouldn't be a draw.

17:45.120 --> 17:48.720
So how do you escape it not being a draw and you win that match?

17:49.600 --> 17:55.760
No, I knew that for most of the time it was a theoretical draw

17:55.760 --> 18:01.280
since chess with seven or less pieces on the board is solved.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.200
People watching online, they can just check it.

18:05.200 --> 18:09.360
They can check a so-called tabled base,

18:09.360 --> 18:14.960
and it's just going to spit out win for white, win for black, or a draw.

18:14.960 --> 18:18.080
So and also I knew that.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.200
I knew that, didn't know that position specifically,

18:21.200 --> 18:23.760
but I knew that it had to be a draw.

18:23.760 --> 18:28.960
So for me, it was about staying alert,

18:29.600 --> 18:34.960
first of all, trying to look for the best way to put my pieces.

18:36.480 --> 18:40.400
But yeah, those end games are a bit, they're a bit unusual.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.960
They don't happen too often.

18:42.960 --> 18:47.280
So what I'm usually good at is I'm using my strengths

18:47.280 --> 18:53.040
that I also use in middle games is that I evaluate well

18:53.040 --> 18:54.880
and I calculate short variations.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.320
Even for the end game, short variations matter?

18:58.320 --> 19:01.200
Yes, it does matter in some simpler end games.

19:02.160 --> 19:08.160
But also there are these theoretical end games with very few pieces

19:08.160 --> 19:12.080
like Rook Knights and DuPonts versus Queens,

19:12.080 --> 19:16.080
but a lot of end games are simply defined by the Queens being exchanged,

19:16.720 --> 19:18.640
and there are a lot of other pieces left.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.600
And then it's usually not brute force.

19:21.600 --> 19:26.000
It's usually more of understanding and evaluation,

19:26.000 --> 19:30.080
and then I can use my strengths very well.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.480
Why are you so damn good at the end game?

19:32.480 --> 19:36.320
Isn't there a lot of moves from when the end game starts

19:36.320 --> 19:38.480
to when the end game finishes and you have a few pieces

19:38.480 --> 19:41.680
and you have to figure out it's like a sequence of little games

19:42.080 --> 19:43.360
that happens, right?

19:43.360 --> 19:44.720
Like little pattern.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.840
Like how does it being able to evaluate a single position

19:47.840 --> 19:51.760
lead you to evaluate a long sequence of positions

19:51.760 --> 19:53.680
that eventually lead to a checkmate?

19:53.680 --> 19:57.600
Well, I think if you evaluate well at the start,

19:57.600 --> 19:59.520
you know what plans to go for.

19:59.520 --> 20:03.760
And then usually the play from there is often pretty simple.

20:04.720 --> 20:11.280
Let's say you understand how to arrange your pieces

20:11.280 --> 20:15.840
and often also how to arrange your pawns early in the end game,

20:16.560 --> 20:21.360
then that makes all the difference.

20:21.360 --> 20:27.600
And after that is like what we call technique very often.

20:29.360 --> 20:34.000
Technique basically just means that the moves are simple

20:34.000 --> 20:39.280
and these are moves that a lot of players could make,

20:39.280 --> 20:41.920
not only the very strongest ones.

20:41.920 --> 20:45.200
These are moves that are kind of understood and known.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.640
So with the evaluation, you're just constantly improving

20:48.640 --> 20:51.680
a little bit and that just leads to suffocating the position

20:51.680 --> 20:52.960
and then eventually to the win.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.560
As long as you're doing the evaluation well, one step at a time.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.280
To some extent.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.040
Also, yeah, as I said, if you evaluate it better

21:01.040 --> 21:05.280
and thus accumulated some small advantages,

21:05.360 --> 21:10.480
then you can often make your life pretty easy

21:10.480 --> 21:12.080
towards the end of the end game.

21:12.080 --> 21:15.440
So you said in 2019, sort of the second phase

21:16.240 --> 21:20.400
of why you're so damn good, you did a lot of opening preparation.

21:20.960 --> 21:26.640
What's the goal for you of the opening game of chess?

21:26.640 --> 21:30.160
Is it to throw the opponent off from any prepared lines?

21:30.880 --> 21:32.960
Is there something you could put into words

21:32.960 --> 21:35.120
about why you're so damn good at the openings?

21:35.920 --> 21:39.280
Again, these things have changed a lot over time.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.000
Back in Kasparov's days, for instance,

21:43.120 --> 21:49.280
he very often got huge advantages from the opening as white.

21:49.280 --> 21:50.080
Can you explain why?

21:51.040 --> 21:54.400
There were several reasons for that.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.480
First of all, he worked harder.

21:56.480 --> 21:59.200
He was more creative in finding ideas.

21:59.200 --> 22:02.160
He was able to look places others didn't.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.520
Also, he had a very strong team of people

22:05.520 --> 22:10.960
who had specific strengths in openings that he could use.

22:11.600 --> 22:12.880
So they would come up with ideas

22:12.880 --> 22:15.680
and he would integrate those ideas into...

22:15.680 --> 22:19.840
Yeah, and he would also very often come up with them himself.

22:19.840 --> 22:26.880
Also, at the start, he had some of the first computer engines

22:27.520 --> 22:32.160
to work for him to find his ideas, to look deeper,

22:32.160 --> 22:34.240
to verify his ideas.

22:34.240 --> 22:38.640
He was better at using them than a lot of others.

22:39.200 --> 22:44.160
Now, I feel like the playing field is a lot more level.

22:44.160 --> 22:48.880
There are both computer engines, neural networks,

22:48.880 --> 22:53.760
and hybrid engines available to practically anybody.

22:54.320 --> 22:58.880
It's much harder to find ideas now

22:58.880 --> 23:05.120
that actually give you an advantage with the white pieces.

23:05.120 --> 23:08.320
I mean, people don't expect to find those ideas anymore.

23:08.320 --> 23:15.760
Now, it's all about finding ideas that are missed by the engines.

23:15.760 --> 23:20.640
Either they're missed entirely or they're missed at low depth.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.840
And using them to gain some advantage

23:25.840 --> 23:28.320
in the sense that you have more knowledge.

23:28.320 --> 23:35.840
And it's also good to know that usually these are not complete bluffs.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.480
These are semi-bluffs so that you know that

23:38.480 --> 23:40.480
even if your opponent makes all the right moves,

23:40.480 --> 23:42.480
you can still make a draw.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.160
And also, at the start of 2019,

23:46.800 --> 23:50.560
neural networks had just started to be a thing in chess.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.800
And I'm not entirely sure,

23:52.800 --> 23:57.840
but there were at least some players even in the top events

23:57.840 --> 24:02.240
who you could see did not use them or did not use them in the right way.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.800
And then you could gain a huge advantage

24:04.800 --> 24:09.360
because a lot of positions, they were being evaluated differently

24:09.360 --> 24:12.080
by the neural networks than traditional chess engines

24:12.960 --> 24:18.640
because they simply think about chess in a very, very different way.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.680
So the short answer is these days,

24:21.680 --> 24:25.200
it's all about surprising your opponent

24:25.200 --> 24:29.280
and taking it into positions where you have more knowledge.

24:29.280 --> 24:32.960
So is there some sense in which it's okay to make suboptimal,

24:32.960 --> 24:34.720
quote unquote, moves?

24:34.720 --> 24:35.520
No, but you have to.

24:36.160 --> 24:42.480
I mean, you have to because the best moves have been analyzed to death mostly.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.560
So that's a kind of, when you say semi-bluff,

24:44.560 --> 24:45.920
that's a kind of sacrifice.

24:46.880 --> 24:51.040
You're sacrificing the optimal move, the optimal position

24:52.080 --> 24:53.840
so that you can take the opponent.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.760
I mean, that's a game theoretic sense.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.960
You take the opponent to something they didn't prepare well.

24:58.960 --> 25:04.800
Yeah, but you could also look at it another way that regardless,

25:04.800 --> 25:08.080
like if you turn on whatever engine you turn on,

25:08.080 --> 25:11.360
like if you try to analyze either from the starting position

25:11.360 --> 25:14.320
or the starting position of some popular opening,

25:14.960 --> 25:18.720
like if you analyze long enough, it's always going to end up in a draw.

25:19.360 --> 25:24.320
So in that sense, you may not be going for like the objective,

25:25.280 --> 25:29.120
the tries that are objectively the most difficult to draw against,

25:29.680 --> 25:34.560
but you are trying to look at least at the less obvious paths.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.520
How much do you use engines?

25:37.520 --> 25:41.840
Do you use Leela, Stockfish in your preparations?

25:41.840 --> 25:42.640
My team does.

25:43.520 --> 25:48.880
Personally, I try not to use them too much on my own

25:49.440 --> 25:51.840
because I know that when I play,

25:51.840 --> 25:54.800
you obviously cannot have help from engines.

25:56.160 --> 26:02.960
I feel like often having knowledge about a position

26:03.600 --> 26:08.480
or some engine knowledge can be a lot worse than having no knowledge.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.720
So I try to look at engines as little as possible.

26:14.160 --> 26:17.520
Your team uses them for research for a generation of ideas,

26:17.520 --> 26:22.480
but you are relying primarily on your human resources.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.640
You can evaluate well, you don't lean.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.880
Yeah, I can evaluate as a human.

26:28.880 --> 26:33.120
I can know what they find unpleasant and so on.

26:34.080 --> 26:38.320
It's very often the case, for me to some extent,

26:39.200 --> 26:41.840
a lot for others that you arrive in a position

26:43.200 --> 26:45.840
and your opponent plays a move that you didn't expect.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.120
If you didn't expect it, you know that it's probably not a great move

26:51.760 --> 26:54.400
since it hasn't been expected by the engine.

26:54.400 --> 26:59.840
But if it's not obvious why it's not a good move,

27:00.560 --> 27:02.800
it's usually very, very hard to figure it out.

27:04.320 --> 27:08.240
So then looking at the engines doesn't necessarily help

27:08.240 --> 27:10.800
because at that point, like you're facing a human,

27:10.800 --> 27:13.920
you have to sort of think as a human.

27:13.920 --> 27:17.360
I was chatting with Demis Asaba CEO of DeepMind a couple of days ago

27:17.360 --> 27:20.480
and he asked me to ask you about what you first felt

27:21.600 --> 27:24.800
when you saw the play of AlphaZero.

27:24.800 --> 27:27.600
Like interesting ideas, any creativity.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.960
Did you feel fear that the machine is taking over?

27:31.360 --> 27:32.400
Were you inspired?

27:34.720 --> 27:36.560
What was going on in your mind and heart?

27:37.120 --> 27:43.920
Funny thing about Demis is he doesn't play chess at all like an AI.

27:45.040 --> 27:48.480
He plays in a very, very human way.

27:48.480 --> 27:52.880
No, I was hugely inspired when I saw the games at first.

27:54.720 --> 27:57.600
In terms of man versus machine,

27:58.320 --> 28:04.080
that battle was kind of lost for humans even before I

28:04.480 --> 28:09.200
entered top-level chess, so that's never been an issue for me.

28:09.200 --> 28:14.640
I never liked playing against computers much anyway, so that's completely fine.

28:14.640 --> 28:20.080
But it was amazing to see how they, quote-unquote, thought about chess

28:20.080 --> 28:25.520
in such a different way and in a way that you could mistake for creativity.

28:26.240 --> 28:28.080
Mistake for creativity, strong words.

28:29.040 --> 28:32.000
Is it wild to you how many sacrifices it's willing to make

28:32.960 --> 28:37.120
to sacrifice pieces and then wait for prolonged periods of time

28:37.120 --> 28:38.800
before doing anything with that?

28:38.800 --> 28:42.320
Is that weird to you that that's part of chess?

28:42.320 --> 28:47.600
No, it's one of the things that's hardest to replicate as a human as well,

28:47.600 --> 28:50.240
or at least for my playing style.

28:51.760 --> 28:58.320
Usually when I sacrifice, I don't do it unless I feel like I'm getting

28:58.320 --> 29:01.920
something tangible in return.

29:03.280 --> 29:04.800
Like a few moves down the line?

29:04.800 --> 29:08.640
A few moves down the line, you can see that you can either retrieve the material

29:08.640 --> 29:14.240
or you can put your opponent's king under pressure or have some very concrete

29:15.360 --> 29:19.760
positional advantage that compensates for it.

29:20.400 --> 29:25.200
For instance, in chess, bishops and knights are fairly equivalent.

29:25.440 --> 29:28.960
We both give them three points, but bishops are a little bit better.

29:28.960 --> 29:34.480
And especially a bishop pair is a lot better than a bishop and a knight.

29:35.680 --> 29:37.440
Or especially two knights.

29:37.440 --> 29:42.480
It depends on the position, but on average they are.

29:42.480 --> 29:50.720
So sacrificing a pawn in order to get a bishop pair, that's one of the most common sacrifices in chess.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.080
Oh, you're okay making that sacrifice?

29:52.080 --> 29:54.000
Yeah, I mean, it depends on the situation.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.600
But generally that's fine.

29:55.600 --> 29:58.160
And there are a lot of openings that are based on that.

29:58.160 --> 30:04.560
That you sacrifice a pawn for the bishop pair, and then eventually it's some sort of positional equality.

30:05.440 --> 30:06.640
So that's fine.

30:06.640 --> 30:15.600
But the way AlphaZero would sacrifice a knight or sometimes two pawns, three pawns.

30:16.560 --> 30:22.640
And you could see that it's looking for some sort of positional domination, but it's hard to understand.

30:23.040 --> 30:27.440
It's hard to understand, and it was really fascinating to see.

30:28.560 --> 30:36.480
Yeah, in 2019, I was sacrificing a lot of pawns especially, and it was a great joy.

30:36.480 --> 30:39.840
Unfortunately, it's not so easy to continue to do that.

30:39.840 --> 30:48.080
People have found more solid opening lines since that don't allow me to do that as often.

30:48.560 --> 30:55.920
I'm still trying both to get those positions and still trying to learn the art of sacrificing pieces.

30:57.440 --> 31:03.040
Demis also made a comment that was interesting to my new chess brain,

31:03.040 --> 31:06.480
which is one of the reasons that chess is fun is because of the, quote,

31:06.480 --> 31:09.200
creative tension between the bishop and the knight.

31:09.200 --> 31:14.160
So you're talking about this interesting difference between the two pieces.

31:16.320 --> 31:17.440
How would you convert that?

31:17.440 --> 31:19.680
I mean, that's like a poetic statement about chess.

31:20.240 --> 31:23.840
I think he said that why has chess been played for such a long time?

31:23.840 --> 31:26.240
Why is it so fun to play at every level?

31:26.880 --> 31:31.120
If you can reduce it to one thing, is it the bishop and the knight?

31:31.120 --> 31:34.160
Some kind of weird dynamics that they create in chess.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.280
Is there any truth to that?

31:36.320 --> 31:38.080
It sounds very good.

31:38.080 --> 31:42.640
I haven't tried a lot of other games, but I tried to play a little bit of Shogi.

31:43.280 --> 31:48.000
And for my new Shogi brain, comparing it to chess,

31:48.000 --> 31:52.080
what annoyed me about that game is how much the pieces suck.

31:52.800 --> 31:56.640
Basically, you have one rook and you have one bishop that move like in chess,

31:56.640 --> 32:01.600
and the rest of the pieces are really not very powerful.

32:01.600 --> 32:09.120
So I think that's one of the attractions of chess, like how powerful especially the queen is.

32:10.240 --> 32:11.120
Interesting.

32:11.120 --> 32:14.320
I kind of think makes it makes a lot of fun.

32:14.960 --> 32:19.600
You think power is more fun than like variety?

32:20.240 --> 32:22.880
No, there is variety in chess as well, though.

32:23.520 --> 32:28.640
But not much more so than like, like, no, no, no, no, that's for.

32:29.440 --> 32:32.400
So like knight, I mean, they all move in different ways.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.200
They're all like weird.

32:33.920 --> 32:37.280
There's just all these weird patterns and positions that can emerge.

32:37.280 --> 32:40.240
The difference in the pieces create all kinds of interesting dynamics.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.600
I guess is what I'm trying to say.

32:41.600 --> 32:42.240
Yeah.

32:42.240 --> 32:47.680
And I guess it is quite fascinating that all those years ago, they created

32:48.560 --> 32:52.720
the knight and the bishop without probably realizing that they would be

32:53.600 --> 32:57.520
almost equally equally strong with such different qualities.

32:57.520 --> 33:01.120
That's crazy that this, you know, like when you design computer games,

33:01.920 --> 33:03.280
it's like an art form.

33:03.280 --> 33:06.000
It's science and an art to balance it.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.080
You know, you talk about Starcraft and all those games.

33:09.040 --> 33:12.880
They so that you can have competitive play at the highest level

33:13.520 --> 33:14.960
with all those different units.

33:14.960 --> 33:18.480
And in the case of chess, it's different pieces.

33:19.040 --> 33:22.480
And they somehow designed a game that was super competitive.

33:22.480 --> 33:24.880
But there's probably some kind of natural selection that the chess

33:24.880 --> 33:27.440
just wouldn't last if it was designed poorly.

33:27.440 --> 33:27.920
Yeah.

33:27.920 --> 33:33.920
And I think the rules have changed over time a little, little bit.

33:33.920 --> 33:37.520
But I would be, I mean, speaking of games and all that,

33:37.600 --> 33:44.400
I'm also interested to play other other games like just 960 or Fisher

33:44.400 --> 33:49.520
random as they call it, like that you have 960 maps instead of one.

33:50.400 --> 33:50.560
Yeah.

33:50.560 --> 33:54.560
So for people who don't know a Fisher random chess, just 960s.

33:54.560 --> 33:57.680
Yeah, that basically just means that the pawns are in the same way.

33:57.680 --> 34:04.400
And the major pieces are distributed randomly on the on the last rank,

34:04.400 --> 34:07.680
only that there have to be obviously bishops of opposite color.

34:07.680 --> 34:12.240
And the king has to be in between the rooks so that you can castle both ways.

34:12.240 --> 34:16.320
Oh, you can still castle and you can still castle, but it makes it interesting.

34:16.320 --> 34:20.400
So you still have it still castles in the same way.

34:20.400 --> 34:24.000
So let's say the king is like, yeah, what happens in that case?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.160
Yeah, let's say the king is in the corner.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.920
So to castle this side, you have you have to clear a whole lot of pieces.

34:31.920 --> 34:35.200
What would castling look like though?

34:35.200 --> 34:37.920
No, the king would go here and the rook would go there.

34:37.920 --> 34:38.560
Oh, OK.

34:39.280 --> 34:41.520
And that's happened in my games as well.

34:41.520 --> 34:46.720
Like I forgot about castling and I've been like attacking a king over here.

34:46.720 --> 34:50.400
And then all of a sudden it escapes to the other side.

34:50.400 --> 35:01.200
I think I think Fisher chess is good that it's the maps will generally be worse

35:02.000 --> 35:03.120
than regular chess.

35:03.120 --> 35:10.080
Like I think the starting position is as close to ideal for creating a competitive game

35:10.800 --> 35:13.680
as possible, but they will still be like interesting and

35:13.680 --> 35:18.320
diverse enough that you can play very, very interesting games.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.880
So when you say maps, there's 960 different options.

35:20.880 --> 35:25.520
And like what fraction of that creates interesting games at the highest level?

35:26.400 --> 35:28.800
This is something that a lot of people are curious about because

35:29.440 --> 35:33.200
when you challenge a great chess player like yourself to

35:35.840 --> 35:40.400
look at a random starting position, that feels like it pushes you to play

35:40.400 --> 35:42.240
pure chess versus memorizing lines.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.040
Yeah, for sure.

35:43.040 --> 35:43.680
Or for sure.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.120
But that's that's the whole idea.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.560
Yeah, that's what you want.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.000
And how hard is it to play?

35:48.000 --> 35:51.440
I mean, can you talk about what it feels like to you to play

35:51.440 --> 35:52.880
with a random starting position?

35:52.880 --> 35:55.360
Is there some intuition you've been building up?

35:55.360 --> 35:57.120
It's very, very different.

35:57.120 --> 36:03.680
And I mean, understandably, engines have an even greater advantage

36:03.680 --> 36:07.520
in 960 than they have in classical chess.

36:08.320 --> 36:10.080
No, it's super interesting.

36:10.080 --> 36:17.680
And that's why also I really wish that we played more classical chess,

36:17.680 --> 36:21.520
like long games, four to seven hours.

36:21.600 --> 36:27.120
And in fish random chess, just 960, because then you really need

36:28.480 --> 36:30.720
that time, even on the first moves.

36:31.680 --> 36:34.880
What usually happens is that you get 15 minutes before the game,

36:34.880 --> 36:37.680
you're getting told the position 15 minutes before the game.

36:37.680 --> 36:41.440
And then you can think about it a little bit, even, you know,

36:41.440 --> 36:42.640
check the computer.

36:42.640 --> 36:45.040
But that's all the time you have.

36:45.040 --> 36:46.720
But then you really need to figure it out.

36:47.680 --> 36:53.200
Like, some of the positions obviously are a lot more interesting than the others.

36:53.200 --> 36:56.880
In some of them, it appears that, like, if you don't play symmetrically

36:57.520 --> 37:03.600
at the start, then you're probably going to be in a pretty bad position.

37:03.600 --> 37:04.720
What do you mean with the pawns?

37:04.720 --> 37:05.680
With the pawns, yeah.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.160
Why does that make sense?

37:08.160 --> 37:09.840
That's the thing about chess, though.

37:09.840 --> 37:16.400
So let's say white opens with e4, which has always been the most played move.

37:17.280 --> 37:18.720
There are many ways to meet that.

37:18.720 --> 37:22.960
But the most solid ways of playing has always been the symmetrical response

37:23.840 --> 37:24.560
with e5.

37:24.560 --> 37:30.560
And then there's the Rilopes, there's the Petroff opening, and so on.

37:30.560 --> 37:34.720
And if you just ban symmetry on the first move in chess,

37:35.520 --> 37:37.600
you would get more interesting games.

37:37.600 --> 37:38.880
Oh, interesting.

37:38.880 --> 37:43.440
Or you'd get more decisive games.

37:43.440 --> 37:47.200
So that's the good thing about chess is that we've played it so long that

37:47.200 --> 37:51.760
we've actually devised non-symmetrical openings that are also fairly equal.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.200
But symmetry is a good default.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.880
But yeah, symmetry is a good default.

37:56.880 --> 38:03.520
And it's a problem that by playing symmetrical, armed with good preparation in regular chess,

38:03.520 --> 38:05.840
it's just a little bit too easy.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.160
It's a little bit too dry.

38:08.320 --> 38:20.880
And I guess if you analyzed a lot in chess 960, then a lot of the position would end up being

38:22.160 --> 38:23.360
pretty dry as well.

38:24.720 --> 38:28.000
Because the random starting point is so shitty, you're forced to...

38:28.000 --> 38:30.560
You're actually forced to play symmetrically.

38:30.560 --> 38:36.240
You cannot actually try and play in a more interesting manner.

38:37.200 --> 38:40.560
Is there any other kind of variations that are interesting to you?

38:41.200 --> 38:42.720
Oh yeah, there are several.

38:43.520 --> 38:51.440
So no castling chess has been promoted by former world champion Vladimir Kramnik.

38:52.000 --> 38:58.320
There have been a few tournaments with that, not any that I've participated in though.

38:59.120 --> 39:00.560
I kind of like it.

39:00.640 --> 39:08.640
Also, my coach uses non-castling engines quite a bit to analyze regular positions

39:08.640 --> 39:12.560
just to get a different perspective.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.040
So castling is like a defensive thing.

39:15.040 --> 39:18.080
So if you remove castling, it forces you to be more offensive.

39:18.080 --> 39:18.640
Is that why?

39:19.360 --> 39:22.000
Yeah, for sure.

39:23.040 --> 39:24.800
It seems like a tiny little difference.

39:24.960 --> 39:31.760
No castling probably forces you to be a little bit more defensive at the start,

39:31.760 --> 39:32.960
or I would guess so.

39:33.760 --> 39:37.520
Because you cannot suddenly escape with the kings.

39:37.520 --> 39:39.920
It's going to make the game a bit slower at the start.

39:39.920 --> 39:51.200
But I feel like eventually it's going to make the games less dry for sure.

39:51.200 --> 40:01.360
Then you have some weirder variants like where the pawns can move both diagonally and forward.

40:02.560 --> 40:06.320
And also you have self-capture chess, which is quite interesting.

40:06.320 --> 40:10.160
So the pawns can commit suicide?

40:11.360 --> 40:13.840
Why would that be a good move?

40:13.840 --> 40:17.120
No, sometimes one of your pieces occupies a square.

40:19.120 --> 40:20.800
Let me just set up a position.

40:20.880 --> 40:24.400
Let's put it like this.

40:25.120 --> 40:26.400
For instance, like here.

40:26.400 --> 40:29.440
I mean, there are a lot of ways to checkmate for white.

40:29.440 --> 40:30.400
Like this, for instance.

40:30.400 --> 40:31.520
Or there are several ways.

40:32.480 --> 40:36.480
But like this would be a checkmate.

40:36.480 --> 40:36.980
Oh, cool.

40:38.000 --> 40:44.240
For people who are just listening, basically you bring in a knight close to the king, the queen,

40:44.240 --> 40:44.960
and so on.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.720
And you replace the knight with a queen.

40:46.720 --> 40:47.680
Yeah, that's interesting.

40:47.680 --> 40:54.160
So you can have like a front of pieces and then you just replace them with the second.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.480
Yeah, I mean, that could be interesting.

40:56.480 --> 41:00.800
I think also maybe sometimes it's just clearance, basically.

41:00.800 --> 41:04.720
It adds an extra element of clearance.

41:04.720 --> 41:09.520
So I think there are many different variants.

41:09.520 --> 41:16.960
I don't think any of them are better than the one that has been played for at least a thousand years.

41:16.960 --> 41:21.520
But it's certainly interesting to see.

41:22.160 --> 41:26.720
So one of your goals is to reach the Fidea Elo chess rating of 2900.

41:27.760 --> 41:32.400
Maybe you can comment on how is this rating calculated and what does it take to get there?

41:33.440 --> 41:36.000
Is it possible for a human being to get there?

41:36.000 --> 41:41.920
Basically, you play with a factor of 10, which means that if I were to play against

41:42.880 --> 41:50.480
an opponent who's rated the same as me, I would be expected to score 50%, obviously.

41:50.480 --> 41:55.520
And that means that I would win five points with a win, lose five points with a draw,

41:55.520 --> 41:57.680
and then equal if I draw.

41:57.680 --> 42:04.880
If your opponent is 200 points lower rated, you're expected to score 75% and so on.

42:05.520 --> 42:09.440
And you establish that rating by playing a lot of people and then it slowly converges

42:09.520 --> 42:13.120
towards an estimate of how likely you are to win or lose against different people.

42:14.720 --> 42:19.280
My rating is obviously carried through thousands of games.

42:20.720 --> 42:25.920
Right now, my rating is 2861, which is decent.

42:25.920 --> 42:32.480
I think that pretty much corresponds to the level I have at the moment,

42:32.480 --> 42:39.920
which means in order to reach 2900, I would have to either get better at chess,

42:39.920 --> 42:47.120
which I think is fairly hard to do, at least considerably better.

42:47.120 --> 42:54.720
So what I would need to do is try and optimize even more in terms of the matchups,

42:54.720 --> 42:59.520
the preparations, everything, but not necessarily like selecting tournaments and so on,

42:59.520 --> 43:08.160
but just optimizing in terms of preparation, making sure I never have any bad days.

43:08.720 --> 43:10.480
So you basically can't lose.

43:10.480 --> 43:17.360
Yeah, I basically can't fuck up ever if I want to reach that goal.

43:17.360 --> 43:21.840
And so I think reaching 2900 is pretty unlikely.

43:22.560 --> 43:27.520
The reason I've set the goal is to have something to play for,

43:27.520 --> 43:36.880
to have a motivation to actually try and be at my best when I play, because otherwise,

43:37.760 --> 43:45.280
I'm playing to some extent mostly for fun these days in that I love to play,

43:45.280 --> 43:52.160
I love to try and win, but I don't have a lot to prove or anything.

43:52.240 --> 43:58.800
But that gives me at least the motivation to try and be at my best all the time,

43:58.800 --> 44:02.160
which I think is something to aim for.

44:02.160 --> 44:11.920
So at the moment, I'm quite enjoying that process of trying to optimize.

44:11.920 --> 44:17.120
What would you say motivates you in this now and in the years leading up to now?

44:18.000 --> 44:20.720
The love of winning or the fear of losing?

44:22.880 --> 44:28.560
So for the World Championship, it's been fear of losing for sure.

44:29.200 --> 44:34.320
Other tournaments, love of winning is a great, great factor.

44:35.040 --> 44:39.920
And that's why I also get more joy from winning most tournaments than I do for

44:39.920 --> 44:44.320
winning the World Championship, because then it's mostly been a relief.

44:44.320 --> 44:50.880
I also think I enjoy winning more now than I did before, because I feel like I'm a little

44:50.880 --> 44:57.040
bit more relaxed now. And I also know that it's not going to last forever.

44:57.040 --> 45:02.800
So every little win, I appreciate a lot more now.

45:02.800 --> 45:08.720
And in terms of fear for losing, that's a huge reason why I'm not going to play the

45:08.720 --> 45:14.560
World Championship, because it really didn't give me a lot of joy.

45:14.560 --> 45:16.640
It really was all about avoiding losing.

45:17.280 --> 45:20.320
Why is it that the World Championship really makes you feel this way?

45:20.960 --> 45:24.240
The anxiety. And when you say losing, do you mean

45:25.120 --> 45:30.560
not just the match, but every single position, like the fear of a blunder?

45:31.440 --> 45:36.480
No, the blunder is okay. When I sit down at the board, then it's mostly been fine,

45:36.480 --> 45:42.640
because then I'm focused on the game. And then I know that I can play the game.

45:42.640 --> 45:48.560
It's a time in between, knowing that I feel like losing is not an option,

45:49.200 --> 45:52.480
because it's the World Championship. And because in a World Championship,

45:52.480 --> 45:56.240
there are two players. There's a winner and a loser.

45:56.240 --> 46:01.520
If I don't win a random tournament that I play, then I'm usually...

46:02.640 --> 46:05.600
It depends on the tournament. I might be disappointed, for sure.

46:06.480 --> 46:11.920
Might even be pretty pissed. But ultimately, you go on to the next one.

46:11.920 --> 46:14.960
With the World Championship, you don't go on to the next one.

46:15.040 --> 46:25.600
It's years. And it's been a core part of my identity for a while now, that I am World Champion.

46:26.560 --> 46:31.360
And so, there's not an option of losing that.

46:33.520 --> 46:38.960
You're going to have to, at least for a couple of years, carry the weight of having lost.

46:39.520 --> 46:45.520
You're the former World Champion now, if you lose, versus the current World Champion.

46:46.080 --> 46:52.400
There are certain sports that create that anxiety, and others that don't.

46:52.400 --> 46:56.880
For example, I think UFC makes martial arts a little better with losing.

46:57.600 --> 47:00.640
It's understood. Everybody loses. But they're...

47:00.640 --> 47:01.840
Not everybody, though.

47:01.840 --> 47:04.320
Not everybody. Not everybody. Not everybody.

47:04.480 --> 47:06.880
Yes. Could be bent to the chat.

47:08.880 --> 47:12.960
But in boxing, there is that extra pressure of maintaining the championship.

47:13.840 --> 47:17.280
Maybe you could say the same thing about the UFC as well.

47:17.280 --> 47:21.360
So for you personally, for a person who loves chess,

47:22.080 --> 47:27.200
the first time you won the World Championship, that was the thing that was fun.

47:28.000 --> 47:28.560
Yeah.

47:28.560 --> 47:32.000
And then everything after is stressful.

47:32.000 --> 47:37.760
Yeah, essentially. There was certainly stress involved the first time as well.

47:39.360 --> 47:43.840
But it was nothing compared to the others.

47:44.560 --> 47:48.000
So the only World Championship after that that I really enjoyed

47:48.000 --> 47:51.600
was the one in 2018 against the American Fabiano Caruana.

47:51.600 --> 47:58.560
And what made that different is that I'd been slumping for a bit, and he'd been on the rise.

47:58.560 --> 48:01.120
So our ratings were very, very similar.

48:01.600 --> 48:07.280
They were so close that if at any point during the match I'd lost the game,

48:09.840 --> 48:12.480
he would have been ranked as number one in the world.

48:12.480 --> 48:15.600
Our ratings were so close that for each draw, they didn't move.

48:17.200 --> 48:18.640
And the game itself was close.

48:18.640 --> 48:21.360
Yeah, the games themselves were very close.

48:22.480 --> 48:28.720
I had a winning position in the first game that I couldn't really get anywhere for a lot of games.

48:28.720 --> 48:32.960
Then he had a couple of games where he could potentially have won.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.240
Then in the last game, I was a little bit better.

48:36.880 --> 48:40.320
And eventually, they were all drawn.

48:40.320 --> 48:45.760
But I felt all the way that this is an interesting match against an opponent who is

48:45.760 --> 48:49.040
at this position at this point equal to me.

48:49.600 --> 48:52.800
And so losing that would not have been a disaster.

48:53.520 --> 48:58.560
Because in all the other matches, I would know that I've lost against somebody

48:59.120 --> 49:02.160
who I know I'm much better than.

49:02.160 --> 49:07.200
And that would be a lot harder for me to take.

49:07.200 --> 49:10.960
Well, that's fascinating and beautiful that the stress isn't from losing.

49:12.320 --> 49:13.440
Because you have fun.

49:14.320 --> 49:18.560
You enjoy playing against somebody who's as good as you, maybe better than you.

49:18.560 --> 49:19.680
That's exciting to you.

49:21.680 --> 49:28.560
It's losing at this high stakes thing that only happens rarely to a person who's not as good as you.

49:28.960 --> 49:32.400
And that's why it's also been incredibly frustrating in other matches.

49:34.400 --> 49:39.440
When we play draw after draw, I know that I'm better.

49:39.440 --> 49:43.200
I can sense during the game that I understand it better than them.

49:43.200 --> 49:45.520
But I cannot get over the hump.

49:46.160 --> 49:50.480
So you are the best chess player in the world.

49:51.040 --> 49:58.000
And you not playing the World Championship really makes the World Championship not seem important.

49:58.480 --> 50:00.080
There's an argument to be made for that.

50:01.360 --> 50:05.360
Is there anything you would like to see for a change about the World Championship

50:05.360 --> 50:07.040
that would make it more fun for you?

50:07.040 --> 50:10.560
And better for the game of chess period for everybody involved?

50:10.560 --> 50:16.080
So I think 12 games or now 14 games that there is for the World Championship

50:16.080 --> 50:20.080
is a fairly low sample size.

50:20.080 --> 50:23.040
If you want to determine who the best player is,

50:23.040 --> 50:26.400
or at least the best player in that particular matchup,

50:26.400 --> 50:27.600
you need more games.

50:27.600 --> 50:29.600
And I think to some extent,

50:31.680 --> 50:35.280
if you're going to have a world champion and call them the best players,

50:35.920 --> 50:37.920
best player, you got to make sure that the format

50:38.640 --> 50:41.840
increases the chance of finding the best players.

50:41.840 --> 50:43.200
So I think having more games.

50:43.840 --> 50:45.680
And if you're going to have a lot more games,

50:47.280 --> 50:49.600
then you need to decrease the time control a bit,

50:50.240 --> 50:54.400
which in turn I think is also a good thing because

50:54.480 --> 50:58.640
in very long time controls with deep preparation,

50:58.640 --> 51:04.640
you can sort of mask a lot of your deficiencies as a chess player

51:05.520 --> 51:09.520
because you have a lot of time to think and to defend.

51:09.520 --> 51:12.720
And also, yeah, you have deep preparation.

51:12.720 --> 51:16.320
So I think those would be for me to play.

51:16.320 --> 51:23.520
Those would be the main things, more games and less time.

51:24.480 --> 51:29.520
So you want to see more games and rules that emphasize pure chess?

51:30.080 --> 51:35.600
Yeah, but already less time emphasizes pure chess

51:35.600 --> 51:42.400
because defensive techniques are much harder to execute with a little time.

51:42.400 --> 51:42.880
What do you think?

51:42.880 --> 51:46.000
Is there a sweet spot in terms of, are we talking about Blitz?

51:46.000 --> 51:48.160
I think Blitz is a bit too fast.

51:49.360 --> 51:52.800
To their credit, this was suggested by Fita as well.

51:54.160 --> 51:57.200
For a start, you have two games per day.

51:57.200 --> 52:04.240
And let's say you have 45 minutes a game plus 15 or 30 seconds per move.

52:04.240 --> 52:06.720
That means that each session will probably be about

52:07.360 --> 52:09.200
or a little less than two hours.

52:10.080 --> 52:11.840
That would be a start.

52:11.840 --> 52:17.440
Also, what we're playing in the tournament that I'm playing here in Miami,

52:17.440 --> 52:23.440
which is four games a day with 15 minutes plus 10 seconds per move.

52:24.720 --> 52:29.600
Those would be more interesting than the one there is now.

52:29.600 --> 52:32.640
And I understand that there are a lot of traditions.

52:32.640 --> 52:34.960
People don't want to change the world championship.

52:34.960 --> 52:36.160
That's all fine.

52:36.160 --> 52:41.680
I just think that the world championship should do a better job

52:41.680 --> 52:44.720
of trying to reflect who's the best overall chess player.

52:44.960 --> 52:48.880
So would you say like, if it's faster games,

52:48.880 --> 52:54.080
you'd probably be able to get a sample size of like over 20 games, 20, 30, 40.

52:54.080 --> 52:56.960
Do you think there's a number that's good over a long period of time?

52:56.960 --> 52:58.960
Well, I would prefer as many as possible.

52:58.960 --> 52:59.760
So like a hundred?

53:01.040 --> 53:06.080
Yeah, but let's say you play 12 days to games a day.

53:06.080 --> 53:07.760
You know, that's 24.

53:07.760 --> 53:10.080
I feel like that's already quite a bit better.

53:10.080 --> 53:12.960
You play like one black game, one white game.

53:12.960 --> 53:15.280
One white game each day.

53:15.280 --> 53:17.200
Endurance wise, that's okay.

53:17.200 --> 53:18.080
Yeah, I think that's fine.

53:18.080 --> 53:19.600
Like you will have free days as well.

53:19.600 --> 53:22.000
So I don't think that will be a problem.

53:23.360 --> 53:27.200
And also you have to prepare two sets of openings for each day,

53:27.200 --> 53:31.520
which makes it more difficult for the teams preparing, which I think is also good.

53:32.400 --> 53:33.680
Let me ask you a fun question.

53:34.400 --> 53:41.360
If Hikaru Nakamura was one of the two people, I guess, I apologize.

53:41.440 --> 53:43.680
Yeah, he could have finished second.

53:43.680 --> 53:45.680
So he lost the last round of the candidates.

53:45.680 --> 53:48.400
Yeah, and maybe you can explain to me,

53:48.400 --> 53:51.280
internet speed copium is something you tweeted.

53:52.960 --> 54:01.040
But if he got second, would you just despite him still play the world championship?

54:01.040 --> 54:02.560
That's internet question.

54:02.560 --> 54:05.600
And when the internet asks, I must abide the due divides.

54:06.400 --> 54:07.520
Yeah, sure.

54:07.520 --> 54:08.320
Thank you, internet.

54:09.200 --> 54:09.700
Okay.

54:10.880 --> 54:14.720
So after the last match, I did an interview

54:17.120 --> 54:22.480
right after where I talked about the fact that I was unlikely to play the next one.

54:22.480 --> 54:29.040
I'd spoken privately to both family, friends, and of course, also my chess team,

54:29.040 --> 54:33.440
that this was likely going to be the last match.

54:33.760 --> 54:39.120
What happened was that right before the world championship match,

54:39.120 --> 54:42.160
there was this young player, Alireza Firouza.

54:42.160 --> 54:43.360
He had a dramatic rise.

54:43.360 --> 54:45.920
He rose to second in the world rankings.

54:45.920 --> 54:48.720
He was 18 then, he's 19 now.

54:48.720 --> 54:50.720
He qualified for the candidates.

54:50.720 --> 54:54.640
And it felt like there was at least a half realistic possibility

54:55.360 --> 55:00.480
that he could be the challenger for the next world championship.

55:01.360 --> 55:03.360
And that sort of lit a fire under me.

55:04.320 --> 55:05.360
Do you like that idea?

55:05.360 --> 55:07.280
I like that a lot.

55:07.280 --> 55:11.600
I love the idea of playing him in the next world championship.

55:11.600 --> 55:16.480
And originally, I was sure that I wanted to announce

55:16.480 --> 55:20.000
right after the match that this was it.

55:20.000 --> 55:20.560
I'm done.

55:20.560 --> 55:21.680
I'm not playing the next one.

55:22.400 --> 55:24.000
But this lit a fire under me.

55:24.000 --> 55:29.600
So that made me think, you know, this actually motivates me.

55:29.840 --> 55:32.960
I just wanted to get it out there for several reasons,

55:32.960 --> 55:35.600
to create more hype about the candidates,

55:36.560 --> 55:41.280
to sort of motivate myself a little bit, maybe motivate him.

55:42.160 --> 55:45.760
Also, obviously, I wanted to give people a heads up

55:45.760 --> 55:53.200
for the candidates that you might be playing for more than first place.

55:53.200 --> 55:56.080
Normally, the candidates is first place or bust.

55:56.080 --> 55:57.280
It's like the world championship.

55:58.000 --> 55:58.960
Yeah.

55:58.960 --> 56:03.200
And then, so Nakamura was one of many people who just didn't believe me.

56:04.080 --> 56:11.280
Which is fair, because I've talked before about not necessarily wanting to defend again.

56:12.000 --> 56:16.720
But I never talked as concretely or was as serious as this time.

56:16.720 --> 56:18.080
So he simply didn't believe me.

56:18.720 --> 56:21.120
And he was very vocal about that.

56:21.120 --> 56:24.240
And he said, nobody believed me, no other players,

56:24.240 --> 56:26.160
which may or may not have been true.

56:27.040 --> 56:30.960
And then, yeah, he lost the last game and he didn't qualify.

56:31.600 --> 56:37.520
But to answer the question, no, I'd already at that point decided that I wouldn't play.

56:38.080 --> 56:43.840
I would have liked it less if he had not lost the last round.

56:43.840 --> 56:45.120
But the decision was made.

56:45.120 --> 56:47.920
But the decision was already made.

56:49.120 --> 56:54.400
Does it break your heart a little bit that you're walking away from it

56:54.400 --> 56:57.120
in all the ways that you mentioned that it's just not fun?

56:57.120 --> 57:01.040
There's a bunch of ways that doesn't seem to bring out the best kind of chess.

57:01.920 --> 57:05.520
It doesn't bring out the best out of you and the particular opponents involved.

57:05.520 --> 57:10.720
Does it just break your heart a little bit like you're walking away from something

57:10.720 --> 57:13.440
or maybe the entire chess community is walking away from

57:14.400 --> 57:19.440
a kind of a historic event that was so important in the 20th century at least?

57:20.880 --> 57:23.120
So I won the championship in 2013.

57:23.680 --> 57:28.400
I said no to the candidates in 2011.

57:28.400 --> 57:30.560
I didn't particularly like the format.

57:32.320 --> 57:33.920
I was just not in the mood.

57:33.920 --> 57:40.000
I didn't want the pressure that was connected with the world championship.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.800
And I was perfectly content at the time to play the tournaments that I did play.

57:46.240 --> 57:48.720
Also to be ranked number one in the world,

57:48.720 --> 57:52.720
I was comfortable with the fact that I knew that I was the best.

57:53.120 --> 57:56.320
I didn't need a title to show others.

57:57.600 --> 58:00.720
What happened later is I suddenly decided to play.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.120
In 2013, they changed the format.

58:05.120 --> 58:06.160
I liked it better.

58:08.080 --> 58:11.040
I just decided it could be interesting.

58:11.040 --> 58:11.920
Let's try and get this.

58:13.600 --> 58:17.200
There really wasn't more than that to it.

58:17.200 --> 58:21.680
It wasn't like fulfilling lifelong dream or anything.

58:21.680 --> 58:24.160
I just thought, you know, let's play.

58:25.040 --> 58:26.480
So it's just a cool tournament?

58:26.480 --> 58:28.160
Yeah, it's a cool tournament.

58:28.160 --> 58:29.280
It's a good challenge.

58:29.280 --> 58:31.120
You know, why not?

58:31.120 --> 58:34.960
It's something that could be a motivation.

58:34.960 --> 58:40.400
It motivated me to get in the best shape of my life that had been until then.

58:40.400 --> 58:41.600
So it was a good thing.

58:42.240 --> 58:46.480
And 2013 match brought me a lot of joy as well.

58:46.480 --> 58:49.200
So I'm very, very happy that I did that.

58:49.200 --> 58:54.160
But I never had any thoughts that I'm going to keep the title for a long time.

58:54.160 --> 58:57.680
Immediately after the match in 2013,

58:58.720 --> 59:04.080
also before the match, I'd spoken against the fact that the champion is seeded into the final,

59:04.080 --> 59:05.520
which I thought was unfair.

59:07.280 --> 59:12.080
After the match, I made a proposal that we have a different system

59:12.080 --> 59:14.720
where the champion doesn't have these privileges.

59:15.680 --> 59:20.800
People's reaction, both players and chess community was generally like,

59:20.800 --> 59:22.000
okay, we're good.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.920
We don't want that.

59:23.920 --> 59:25.440
You keep your privileges.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.840
I was like, okay, whatever.

59:27.840 --> 59:29.360
So you want to fight for it every time?

59:30.080 --> 59:31.840
Yeah, I want that.

59:34.480 --> 59:36.640
Have to ask, just in case you have an opinion,

59:37.280 --> 59:41.520
if you can maybe from a fantasy chess perspective analyze

59:42.320 --> 59:44.640
Ding versus Nepo, who wins?

59:45.440 --> 59:49.840
The current, the two people that would play if you're not playing.

59:50.480 --> 59:56.240
Generally, I would consider that Ding has a slightly better overall chess strength.

59:57.040 --> 01:00:01.360
What are the strengths and weaknesses of each, if you can kind of summarize it?

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:09.520
So Nepo is even better at calculating short lines than I am.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:14.960
But he can sometimes like a little bit of depth.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:19.840
Like in short lines, he's an absolute calculation monster.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:25.040
He's extremely quick, but he can sometimes like a bit of depth.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:28.640
Also recently, he's improved his openings quite a bit.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:36.000
So now he has a lot of good ideas and he's very, very solid.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:44.240
Ding is not quite as well prepared, but he has an excellent understanding of dynamics

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:48.720
and imbalances in chess, I would say.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:50.240
What do you mean by imbalances?

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.680
Imbalances like bishops against knights and material imbalances.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:56.960
He can take advantage of those.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:04.240
Yes, I would say he's very, very good at that and understanding the dynamic factors,

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:09.280
as we call them, like material versus time, especially.

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.800
I think Nepo got the better of him and the candidates.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:16.960
So what's your sense why Ding has an edge in the championship?

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:24.000
I feel like individual past results hasn't necessarily been a great indicator of world

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.120
championship results.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:31.280
I feel like overall chess strength is more important.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.800
To be fair, I only think Ding has a very small edge.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.640
Difference is not big at all.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:42.640
But our individual head-to-head record was probably the main reason that a lot of people

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:45.600
thought Nepo had a good chance against me as well.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:51.520
It was like four to one in his favor before the match.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:56.560
But that was just another example of why that may not necessarily mean anything.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:00.000
Also in our case, it was a very, very low sample size.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:09.040
About the size of the match in total, 14 games, and that generally doesn't mean much.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:13.120
How close were those games, would you say, in your mind for the previous championship?

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.040
That game six was a turning point where you won.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:23.440
Was there any doubt in your mind that if you do a much larger sample size,

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.280
that you'll get the better of Nepo?

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.920
No, larger sample size is always good for me.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:35.040
So World Championship is a great parallel to football because it's a low-scoring game.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:43.440
And if the better player or the better team scores, they win most of the time.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:47.120
That's generally for championships or in general?

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.800
Yeah, for championships.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:57.120
They generally win because the other slightly weaker team, they're good enough to defend to

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:59.760
make it very, very difficult for the others.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:04.000
But when they actually have to create the chances, then they have no chance.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.880
And then it very often ends with a blowout as it did in our match.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:13.120
If I hadn't won game six, it probably would have been very, very close.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.640
He might have edged it.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.160
There's obviously a bigger chance that I would have edged it.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:24.000
But this is just what happens a lot in chess, but also in football that matches are close.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.920
And then somebody scores and then things change.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.160
And this gives people the illusion that the matchup was very close.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:43.680
While actually it just means that the nature of the game makes the matches close very often,

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:50.320
but it's always much more likely that one of the teams or one of the players is going to break away

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.440
than the others.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:58.240
In other matches as well, even though a lot of people before the match in 2016 against

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.840
Karjakin, there were people who thought before the match that I was massively overrated as

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:15.680
a favorite and that essentially the match was pretty close, like whatever, 60-40.

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.880
Or some people even said like 55-45.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:25.040
What I felt was that the match went very, very wrong for me and I still won.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.080
Some people saw that as an indication that the pre-match probabilities were probably

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.520
a bit closer than people thought.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:37.520
Well, I would look at it in the way that everything went wrong and I still won,

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:40.960
which probably means that I was a pretty big favorite to begin with.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.640
I do have a question too about that match.

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:48.160
But first, Sergey Karjakin was originally a qualifier for the Candidate Tournament,

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:54.240
but was disqualified for breaching the Fedia Code of Ethics after publicly expressing approval for

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:57.680
the 2022 Russian invasion in Ukraine.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.320
When you look at the Cold War and some of the US versus Russian games of the past,

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:09.200
does some of this geopolitics ever creep its way into the game?

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:13.440
Do you feel the pressure, the immensity of that, as it does sometimes for the Olympics,

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.960
these big nations playing each other, competing against each other?

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:22.640
Almost like fighting out in a friendly way the battles,

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.120
the tensions that they have in the space of geopolitics.

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:26.880
I think it still does.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:34.000
The president of the World Trust Federation, who was just re-elected, is a Russian.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.120
I like him personally, for sure, but he is quite connected to the Kremlin.

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:46.480
It's quite clear that the Kremlin considers it at least a semi-important goal to bring the

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:52.640
chess crown home to Russia, so it's still definitely a factor.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:56.480
I can answer in the Karjakin case.

01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:03.680
I don't have a strong opinion on whether he should have been banned or not.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:07.440
Obviously, I don't agree with anything that he says.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:16.880
But in principle, I think that you should ban either no Russians or all Russians.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:22.560
I'm generally not particularly against either.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:32.640
But I don't love banning wrong opinions, even if they are as reprehensible as his have been.

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:37.200
There's something about the World Chess Championships or the Olympics

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:42.320
where it feels like banning is counterproductive to alleviating some of the conflicts.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.680
We don't know.

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.120
This is the thing, though.

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:49.120
We really don't know about the long-term conflicts.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:54.640
A lot of people try to do the right thing in this sense, which I don't really blame at all.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.440
It's just that we don't know.

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:03.280
I guess sometimes there are other ways you want to try and help as well.

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:10.000
Within the competition, within some of those battles of US versus Russia or so on of the past,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.200
there's also between the individuals, maybe you'll disagree with this,

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:18.000
but from a spectator perspective, there's still a camaraderie.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.080
At the end of the day, there's a thing that unites you,

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:26.960
which is this appreciation of the fight over the chessboard.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.480
It's even if you hate each other.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.600
Yeah, for sure.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:38.560
I think for every match that's been, you would briefly discuss the game with your opponent

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.760
after the game, no matter how much you hate each other.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.920
And I think that's lovely.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:48.800
And Kasparov, I mean, he was quoted like when somebody in his team asked him,

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:52.160
why are you talking to Karpov after the game?

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:54.160
You hate that guy.

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.200
Yeah, sure.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.520
But he's the only one who understands.

01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.280
Yeah, the only one who understands.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:01.600
So I think that's really lovely.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:06.080
And I would love to see that in other areas as well.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.920
Regardless of what happens, you can have a good chat about the game.

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:18.080
And you can just talk about the ideas with people who understand what you understand.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.640
So if you're not playing the World Championships, there's a lot of people

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.960
who are saying that perhaps the World Championships don't matter anymore.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.000
Do you think there's some truth to that?

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.680
I said that back a long time ago as well, that for me, I don't know if it never happened,

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.960
so I don't know what would have happened, but I was thinking like the moment

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.400
that I realized that I'm not the best player in the world,

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:48.880
like I felt like morally I have to renounce the World Championship title, you know,

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.640
because it doesn't mean anything as long as you're not the best player.

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:58.800
So the ratings really tell a bigger, a clearer story?

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:01.520
I think so, at least over time.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:06.640
I'm a lot more proud of my streak of being rated number one in the world,

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:11.760
which is now since I think the summer of 2011.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:16.880
I'm a lot more proud of that than the World Championships.

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:24.240
How much anxiety or even fear do you have before making a difficult decision on the chessboard?

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:28.640
So when it's a high stakes game, how nervous do you get?

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.880
How much anxiety do you have in all that calculations?

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:34.880
You're sitting there for 10, 15 minutes because you're in a fog.

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.920
There's always a possibility of a blunder, of a mistake.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.000
Are you anxious about it? Are you afraid of it?

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:41.520
Really depends.

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.800
I have been at times.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:53.680
I think the most nervous I've ever been was game 10 of the World Championships in 2018.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.280
That was just a thrilling game.

01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:59.040
I was black.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:04.320
I basically abandoned the queen side at some point to attack him on the king side.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:09.920
And I knew that my attack, if it doesn't work, I'm going to lose.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.200
But I had so much adrenaline, so that was fine.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.160
I thought I was going to win.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.360
Then at some point I realized that it's not so clear.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.840
And then my time was ticking and I was just getting so nervous.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:25.200
I still remember what happened.

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:30.560
We played this time trouble phase where he had very little time, but I had even less.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:36.800
And I just remember, I kind of remember much of it, just that when it was over, I was just so

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.240
relieved.

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:43.440
Because then it was clear that the position was probably going to peter out in a draw.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:47.200
Otherwise, I'm often nervous before games.

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:50.560
But when I get there, it's all business.

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:57.200
And especially when I'm playing well, I'm never afraid of losing when I play.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:03.280
Because I trust my instincts, I trust my skills.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:07.360
How much psychological intimidation is there from you to the other person,

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:08.640
from the other person to you?

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:14.960
I think people would play a lot better if they played against an anonymous me.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:23.760
I would love to have a tournament online where, let's say, you play 10 of the best

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:28.400
players in the world and for each round you don't know who you're playing.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.280
That's an interesting question.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:36.640
There's these videos where people eat McDonald's or Burger King or Diet Coke versus

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:38.400
Diet Pepsi.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:44.000
Would people be able to tell they're playing you from the style of play?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:44.880
Do you think?

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.240
Or from the strength of play?

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.320
If there was a decent sample size, sure.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:51.680
And what about you?

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.240
Would you be able to tell others?

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.200
In just one game?

01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.280
Very unlikely.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.000
What sample size would you need to tell accurately?

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.120
I feel like this is science.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.560
I think 20 games would help a lot.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.440
Per person?

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:07.940
Yeah.

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:15.120
But I know that they've already developed AI bots that are pretty good at recognizing

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:20.000
somebody's style, which is quite fascinating.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.920
And it'd be fascinating if those bots were able to summarize the style somehow.

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:28.240
Maybe great attacking chess.

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:31.600
Some of the same characteristics you've been describing, like great at short

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.160
line calculations, all that kind of stuff.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.600
Or to just talk shit.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:42.080
No, but really all the best chess players, there are basically just two camps.

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:48.480
People who are good at longer lines or shorter lines, it's the hare and the tortoise, basically.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:57.440
And sometimes I feel like I'm the closest you can get to a hybrid of those.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.600
Because you're good in every position in the middle game and end game.

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:08.880
Yeah, and also I can think to some extent both rapidly and deeply.

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:11.840
Which a lot of people, they can't do both.

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:18.000
But to answer your question from before, I sometimes can get a little bit intimidated

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.360
by my opponent, but it's mostly if there's something unknown.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:28.240
It's mostly if it's something that I don't understand fully.

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:33.600
And I do think, especially when I'm playing, well, people, they just play more timidly

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:39.520
against me than they do against each other, sometimes without even realizing it.

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:42.800
And I certainly use that to my advantage.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:49.680
If I sense that my opponent is apprehensive, if I sense that they are not going to necessarily

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:53.280
take all their chances, it just means that I can take more risk.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:58.240
And I always try and find that balance.

01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.440
To shake them up a little bit.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:04.160
What's been the toughest loss of your career that you remember?

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:08.080
Would that be the World Championship match?

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.040
Oh yeah, for sure.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.240
Game eight in 2016.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.360
And who was it against?

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:16.240
Against Karyakin in New York.

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.480
Can you take it through the story of that game?

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:24.160
Where were you before that game in terms of game one through seven?

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:28.480
Yeah, so game one and two, not much happened.

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:32.640
Game three and four, I was winning in both of them.

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:37.040
And normally I should definitely have converted both.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:38.800
I couldn't.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:47.360
Partly due to good defense on his part, but mostly because I just messed up.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:56.240
And then after that, games five, six, and seven, not much happened.

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:59.520
I was getting impatient at that point.

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:08.000
So for game eight, I was probably ready to take a little bit more risks than I had before,

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:15.600
which I guess was insane because I knew that he couldn't beat me unless I beat myself.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.600
Like he wasn't strong enough to outplay me.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:23.600
And that was leading to impatience somehow and impatience.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.360
No, because I knew that I was better.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.040
I knew that I was better.

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:30.320
I knew that I just needed to win one game and then the match is over.

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.720
That's what happened in 2021 as well.

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:35.920
Like when I won the first game against Nebo, I knew that the match was over.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:41.440
Unless I like fuck up royally, then he's not going to be able to beat me.

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:47.200
So what happened was that I played a kind of an innocuous opening as white,

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.520
just trying to get a game, trying to get him out of book as soon as possible.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:53.680
Can you elaborate?

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.440
Innocuous, get him out of the book.

01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:00.080
Basically, I set up pretty defensively as white.

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:04.400
I wasn't really crossing into his half at the start at all.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:09.920
I was just, I played more like a system more than like a concrete opening.

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:12.560
It was like, I'm going to set up my pieces this way.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.960
You can set them up however you want.

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.840
And then later where sort of the armies are going to meet.

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.640
I'm not going to try and bother you at the start.

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.080
And that means you can have with as many pieces as possible,

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:28.560
kind of pure chess in the middle game without any of the lines,

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:31.200
the standard lines in the opening.

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:31.700
Exactly.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.800
And so there was at some point a couple of exchanges,

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.320
then some maneuvering a little bit better.

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:42.400
Then he was sort of equalizing and then I started to take too many risks.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.760
And I was still sort of fine.

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:50.720
But then at some point I realized that I'd gone a bit too far

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.320
and I had to be really careful.

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.200
Then I just froze.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I just completely froze.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.000
Mentally?

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:58.960
Yeah, mentally.

01:16:58.960 --> 01:16:59.840
What happened?

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:05.360
I realized that, I mean, all the thoughts of I might lose this.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.160
What have I done?

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.640
Why did I take so many risks?

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.880
I knew that I could have drawn at any moment.

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:11.920
Just be patient.

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:14.800
Don't give him these opportunities.

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.800
What triggered that phase transition in your mind?

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.320
No, it was just a position on the board.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.680
There was one particular move he played that I missed.

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:32.240
And then I realized this could potentially not go my way.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:35.280
So then I made another couple of mistakes.

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:39.120
And to his credit, once he realized he had the chance,

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.040
he knew that this was his one chance.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.240
He had to take it.

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:45.520
And so he did.

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:53.840
And yeah, that's the worst I've ever felt after a chess game.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:57.520
I realized that I'm probably going to lose my title

01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.400
against somebody who's not even close to my level.

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:06.640
And I've done it because of my own stupidity, most of all.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:14.960
And that was really, really, at the time, I was all in my own head.

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.200
That was hard to deal with.

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:23.120
And I felt like I didn't really recover too much for the next game.

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.760
So what I did, there was a free day after the eighth game.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:31.360
So I did something that I never did at any other world championship.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:37.040
Like after game eight, I got drunk with my team.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.640
That's not a standard procedure?

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:43.760
No, no, that's the only time that's happened

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.240
in the world championship during the match.

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.120
So yeah, I just tried to forget.

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:53.920
But still, before game nine, I was a little bit more relaxed.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.200
But I was still a bit nervous.

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.600
Then game nine, I was almost lost as well.

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:03.040
Then only game 10, game 10, I was still, I wasn't in a great mood.

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.480
I was really, really tense.

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.040
The opening was good.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.200
I had some advantage.

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.400
I was getting optimistic.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.080
Then I made one mistake.

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.600
He could have forced a draw.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.400
And then the old, old negativity came back.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.840
Like I was thinking during the game, like how I'm going to play for win

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.440
with black in the next game.

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:25.280
What am I doing?

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:29.600
And then eventually it ended well.

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.840
It didn't find the right line.

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:33.760
I ground him down.

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:36.960
Actually, I played at some point pretty well in the end game.

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:42.160
And after that game, there was such a weight.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:49.200
No, after that, there was no thought of losing the match whatsoever.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:55.600
I knew that, okay, I'd basically gotten away with, not with murder,

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:58.160
but gotten away with something.

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.920
What can you say about the after game eight?

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:05.520
Where are the places you've gone in your mind?

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:07.280
Do you go to some dark places?

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:08.960
We're talking about like depression.

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.800
Do you think about quitting at that point?

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:16.000
No, I mean, I think about quitting every time I lose the class.

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.400
Or at least I used to.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.720
Especially if it's in a stupid way.

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:25.120
I'm thinking like, okay, if I'm going to play like this,

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:29.520
if I'm going to do things that I know are wrong, then I might as well quit.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:33.920
No, that's happened a bunch of times.

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:38.800
I've definitely gotten a bit more carefree about losing these days,

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:41.360
which it's not necessarily a good thing.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:46.880
My hatred of losing led to me not losing a lot.

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:51.440
And it also lit the fire under me that I think my performance

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:57.440
after losses in classical chess over the last 10 years is like over 2,900.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:03.280
I really play well after a loss, even though it's really, really unpleasant.

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:09.840
So apparently, I don't think the way that I dealt with them is particularly healthy,

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:10.800
but it's worked.

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:12.640
It's worked so far.

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:16.640
But then you've discovered now love for winning to where ultimately

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:20.320
longevity wise creates more fun.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:20.880
Yeah, for sure.

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:27.680
What's the perfect day in the life of Magnus Carlsen on a day of a big chess match?

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.320
It doesn't have to be World Championship.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:35.040
But if it's a chess match you care about, what time do you wake up?

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.480
What do you eat?

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:38.880
It depends on when the game is.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:41.440
Let's say the game is at three.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:48.800
I'll probably wake up pretty late at about 11.

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:56.720
Then I'll go for a walk, might listen to some podcasts.

01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:03.360
Maybe I'll spend a little bit of time looking at some NBA game from last night or whatever.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.440
To not chess related stuff?

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:06.160
No, no, no, no.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:09.280
Then I'll get back.

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:14.480
I'll have a big lunch, usually like a big omelet with a bunch of salad and stuff.

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:20.160
Then go to the game, win a very nice clean game.

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:22.080
This is the perfect day.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:24.080
Just go back after, relax.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:30.800
The things that make me the happiest at tournaments is just having a good routine

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:32.720
and feeling well.

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.760
I don't like it when too much is happening.

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:43.280
The tournament that I came from now was the Chess Olympiad, which is the team event.

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.160
We're a team, Norway.

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:47.280
We did horribly.

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:52.000
I did okay, but the team in general did horribly.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.200
Who won that, Italy?

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:58.240
No, Italy beat us, but Uzbekistan won in the end.

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.880
They were this amazing team of young players.

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:02.880
It was really impressive.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:05.360
The thing is, we had a good camaraderie in the team.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.120
We had our meals together.

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.360
We played a bit of football, went swimming.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.320
I couldn't understand why things went wrong, and I still don't understand.

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:19.200
The thing is, for me, it was all very nice, but now I'm so happy to be on my own at a

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:23.280
tournament, just to have my own routines, not see too many people.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.920
Otherwise, just have a very small team of people that I see.

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.400
You are a kind of celebrity now.

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:37.440
So people within the chess tournament and outside recognize you, want to socialize,

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:40.720
want to tell you about how much you mean to them, how much you inspire them, all that

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.680
kind of stuff.

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:46.320
Does that get in the way for you when you're trying to really focus on the match?

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:53.280
Are you able to enjoy those little interactions and still keep your focus?

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:57.520
Yeah, most of the time that's fine, as long as it's not too much.

01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:08.800
But I have to admit, when I'm at home in Norway, I rarely go out without big headphones.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:11.120
Oh, like a disguise?

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.800
No, not a disguise, just to block out the world.

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:18.480
Don't make eye contact.

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.960
People in general are nice.

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:29.280
People, they wish me well and they don't bother me.

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:34.960
Also, when I have the headphones on, I don't notice as much people turning around and all

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:38.160
of that, so I can be more in my own world.

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:40.480
So I like that.

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:45.040
What about in this perfect day after the game?

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:47.360
Do you try to analyze what happened?

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:51.360
Do you try to think through systematically or do you just kind of loosely think about?

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.760
No, I just loosely think about it.

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:56.480
I've never been very structured in that sense.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:04.400
I know that it was always recommended that you analyze your own games, but I generally felt

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.360
that I mostly had a good idea about that.

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:15.280
Nowadays, I will loosely see what the engine says at a certain point if I'm curious about that.

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:18.160
Otherwise, I usually move on to the next.

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.080
What about diet?

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.840
You said omelet and salad and so on.

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:28.640
I heard in your conversation with the other Magnus, Magnus number two, about you had this

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:29.680
bet about meat.

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:33.360
One of you are going to go vegan if you lose, I forget which-

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.480
Vegetarian, though.

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:35.760
Oh, vegetarian, sorry.

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:38.480
And you both have an admiration for meat.

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:45.520
Is there some aspect about optimal performance that you look for in food?

01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:53.920
Like maybe eating only once or twice a day or a particular kind of food like meat-heavy diet.

01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:56.880
Is there anything like that or you just try to have fun with the food?

01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:04.480
I think whenever I'm at tournaments, it's very natural to eat, at least for me,

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:06.000
to eat only twice a day.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.080
So usually I do that when I'm at home as well.

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.880
You do eat before the tournament, though.

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.800
You don't play fasted.

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:13.440
No, no, no.

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:22.400
But I try not to eat too heavy before the game or in general to avoid sugary stuff,

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:28.880
to have a pretty stable blood sugar level because that's the easiest way to make mistake

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:33.440
that your energy levels just suddenly drop.

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:38.400
And they don't necessarily need to be too high as long as they're pretty stable.

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:39.120
Yeah.

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:41.120
Have you ever tried playing fasted?

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:46.720
Intermittent fasting, so playing without having eaten.

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:52.000
I mean, the reason I ask, especially when you do a low carb diet,

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.680
when I have done a person a low carb diet, I'm able to fast for a long time,

01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:58.400
like eat once a day, maybe twice a day.

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:05.680
But the mind is most focused on really difficult thinking tasks when it's fasted.

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.400
It's an interesting and a lot of people kind of talk about that.

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:11.360
You're able to kind of like zoom in.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:15.280
And if you're doing a low carb diet, you don't have the energy stable.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:16.800
No, that is true.

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:18.640
Maybe that will be interesting to try.

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:23.440
So what's happened for me is I played a few tournaments where I've had food poisoning

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:30.240
and then that generally means that you're both sleep deprived and you have no energy.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:37.840
And what I've found is that it makes me very calm, of course,

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:42.080
because I don't have the energy and it makes me super creative.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:46.160
Being sleep deprived I think in general makes you creative.

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:50.960
The first thing that goes away is the ability to do the simple things.

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.800
That's what it affects you the most.

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:55.920
You cannot be precise.

01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:05.680
That's the only thing I'm worried about if I'm fasted that I won't be precise when I play.

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:07.520
But you might be more creative.

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:09.680
It's an interesting task that.

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:11.840
Yeah, potentially.

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:15.760
What about you have been known to on a rare occasion play drunk?

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:22.080
Is there a mathematical formula for sort of on the x-axis how many drinks you had

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:26.640
and on the y-axis your performance slash creativity?

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:30.320
Is there like an optimal for like one of the would you suggest for

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:33.920
the FIDE world championship that people would be required to drink?

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:36.240
Would that change things in interesting ways?

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.040
Yeah, not at all.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:41.760
Maybe for rapid, but for blitz, I think if you're playing blitz,

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:47.280
you're mostly playing on short calculation and intuition.

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:53.440
And I think those are probably enhanced if you've had a little bit of a little bit to drink.

01:28:54.080 --> 01:29:00.960
Can you explain the physiology of why that's why it's enhanced or the?

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.120
You're just you're thinking less.

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.000
You're more confident.

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:05.120
Oh, yeah.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.680
I think it's just confidence.

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:14.560
I think also like a lot of people feel like they're better at speaking languages,

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:16.880
for instance, if they've drunk a little bit.

01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:19.200
It's just like removing these barriers.

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:24.400
I think that it's a little bit of the same in chess.

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:32.880
In 2012, I played the world blitz championship and then I was doing horribly for a long time.

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:34.720
I also had food poisoning there.

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:37.440
I couldn't play at all for three days.

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:43.840
So before the last break, I was like in the middle of the pack, like in, I don't know,

01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:46.800
20th place or something.

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:52.720
And so I decided like, as the last last gasp, I'm going to go to the mini bar

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.000
and just have a few drinks.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:59.840
And what happened is that I came back and I was suddenly relaxed

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:03.360
and I was playing fast and I was playing confidence.

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:04.640
And I thought I was playing so well.

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:10.000
I wasn't playing nearly as well as I thought, but it still helped me.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.760
Like I won my remaining eight games.

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:15.920
And if there had been one more round, I probably would have won the whole thing.

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:18.080
But finally, I was second.

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:20.160
So generally, I wouldn't recommend that.

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:25.760
But maybe as the last research sometimes, like if you feel that you have the ability,

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:30.320
like obviously none of this is remotely relevant if you don't feel like you have

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.600
the ability to begin with.

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:35.840
But if you feel like you have the ability, there are just factors that

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:41.920
make it impossible for you to show it.

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:45.040
Like numbing your mind a bit can probably be a good thing.

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:47.760
Yeah, well, it's interesting, especially during training.

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:52.240
You have all kinds of sports that have interacted with a lot of athletes

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.360
and grappling sports.

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.960
It's different when you train under extreme exhaustion.

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:01.360
For example, you start becoming, you start to discover interesting things.

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:02.800
You start being more creative.

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:08.560
A lot of people, at least in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, they'll smoke weed.

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:15.920
It creates this kind of anxiety and relaxation that kind of enables that creative aspect.

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:17.280
It's interesting for training.

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:20.240
Of course, you can't rely on any one of those things too much.

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:25.520
But it's cool to throw in like a few drinks every once in a while to, yeah, one,

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:27.520
first of all, to relax and have fun.

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:32.320
And two, to kind of try things differently, to unlock a different part of your brain.

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:32.880
Yeah, for sure.

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:34.880
What about supplements?

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.240
You a coffee guy?

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:38.740
Oh, no.

01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.240
I quite like the taste of coffee.

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:45.920
The thing is, I've never had a job.

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:50.560
So I've never needed to wake up early.

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:55.600
So my thought is basically that if I'm tired, I'm tired.

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.080
That's fine.

01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:01.360
Then I'll work it out.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:08.720
So I don't want to ever make my brain get used to coffee.

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:17.280
Like if you see me drinking coffee, that probably means that I'm massively hungover.

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:24.240
And I just want to try anything to make my brain work.

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:24.960
Yeah, that's interesting.

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:27.120
But for a lot of people, like you said, taste the coffee.

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:31.040
For a lot of people, coffee is part of a certain kind of ritual.

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:31.520
Yeah, for sure.

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:32.800
They enjoy, you know.

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:34.720
So hopefully you can have rituals without that.

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:36.160
I know that I would enjoy it a lot.

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:36.800
Yeah.

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.880
Just so you don't want to rely on that.

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:39.380
Yeah.

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.880
I also like the taste, so there's no problem there.

01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:46.160
What about exercise?

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.280
So how does that...

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:58.880
A lot of people talk about the extreme stress that chess puts in your body,

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.160
physically and mentally.

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:02.800
How do you prepare for that to be physically and mentally?

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:06.480
Is it just through playing chess or do you do cardio and that kind of stuff?

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:08.880
This is kind of a bit up and down.

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:15.360
Like as I said in 2013, I was in great shape.

01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:20.080
I mean, generally I was exercising, doing sports every day,

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:26.720
either playing football or tennis or even other sports.

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:33.120
Otherwise, if I couldn't do that, I would try and take my bike for a ride.

01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:38.480
I had a few training camps and I played tennis against one of my seconds.

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:43.600
He's not a super fit guy, but he's always been very good at tennis.

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:46.480
I never played in any organized way.

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:54.320
And that was the perfect exercise because I was running around enough

01:33:54.320 --> 01:34:01.680
to make the games pretty competitive and it meant that he had to run a bit less as well.

01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:12.320
But he said he was shocked that if we played for two hours, I wouldn't flinch at all.

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:13.760
Interesting.

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:21.600
So like a combination of fun and the differential between skill result in good cardio?

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:21.760
Yeah.

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:28.960
So in those days, I was pretty fit in that sense.

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:35.200
I've always liked doing sports, but at times, I think in winter especially,

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.600
I never had a schedule.

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:40.800
So at times, I let myself go a little bit.

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:48.320
And I've always kind of done it more for fun than for a concrete benefit.

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:52.800
But now, at least after the pandemic, I was not in great shape.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:35:00.000
So now I'm trying to get back, get better habits and so on.

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:11.680
But I feel like I've always been the poster boy for making being fit a big thing in chess.

01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:18.000
And I always felt that it was not really deserved because I never liked doing weights much at all.

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:23.840
I run a bit at times, but I never liked it too much.

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.040
You just love playing sports.

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:26.400
I just love playing sports.

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:31.120
So I think people confuse that because I'm not like massively athletic,

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:39.360
but I am decent at sports and that sort of helped build that perception.

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:44.880
Even though others who are top-level chess players, they're more fit.

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:51.360
Like Karana, for instance, his body is really, really strong.

01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:52.320
It's just that he doesn't...

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:53.680
He goes to the gym and...

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:57.280
Yeah, if he doesn't play sports, that's the difference.

01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:02.640
And the thing about sports is also it's an escape.

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:06.960
It helps you forget for a brief moment about the obsessions,

01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:10.000
the pursuits of the main thing, which is chess.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.240
Yeah, for sure.

01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:20.080
And I think it also helps your main pursuit to feel that you're even not mastering,

01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:24.080
but doing well in something else.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:30.080
I found that if I just juggle a ball, that makes me feel better before a game.

01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:34.560
So a skilled activity.

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:35.680
Juggle a football, yeah.

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:39.280
Yeah, skilled activity that you can improve on over time.

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.760
It flexes the same kind of muscle, but on the thing that you're much worse at,

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:46.640
it focuses you, relaxes you.

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:47.360
That's really interesting.

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:52.880
What's the perfect day in the life of Magnus Carlsen when he's training?

01:36:53.760 --> 01:37:00.720
So what's a good training regimen in terms of daily training that you have to put in across

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:06.080
many days, months, and years to just keep yourself sharp in terms of chess?

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:11.440
I would say when I'm at home, I do very little deliberate practice.

01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:13.760
I've never been that guy at all.

01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:18.720
I could never force myself to just sit down and work.

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:22.320
So deliberate practice, just so maybe you can educate me.

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:25.440
For some grandmasters, what would that look like?

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:27.520
Just doing puzzles kind of thing?

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:30.400
Yeah, doing puzzles and opening analysis.

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:31.760
That would be the main things.

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:33.840
Studying games?

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.680
Just studying games, yeah, a little bit.

01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:41.520
But I feel like that's something that I do.

01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:42.560
But it's not deliberate.

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:46.080
It's like reading our article or reading a book.

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:46.640
Got it.

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:47.760
Like I love chess books.

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:52.240
I'll read just anything and I'll find something interesting.

01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:57.520
So chess books that are like on openings and stuff like that, or chess books that go over

01:37:57.520 --> 01:37:58.560
different games?

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:03.600
Yeah, books on, so there are three main categories.

01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:07.120
There are books on openings and there are books on strategy and there are books on chess

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:07.600
history.

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:12.560
And I find all of them very, very interesting.

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:16.960
Like what fraction of the day would you say you have a chessboard floating somewhere in

01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:17.360
your head?

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:20.160
Meaning like you're thinking about it.

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:25.600
Probably be a better question to ask how many hours a day I don't have a chessboard.

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:31.440
I mean, it could be just floating there and nothing is happening.

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:35.680
But like, I often do it parallel to some other activity though.

01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:36.960
And what does that look like?

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:41.760
Are you daydreaming like different, is it actual positions you're just fucking around

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:44.720
with, like fumbling with different pieces in your head?

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:51.120
Often I've looked at a random game on my phone, for instance, or in a book.

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:55.520
And then my brain just keeps going at the same position, analyzing it.

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:58.400
And often it goes all the way to the end game.

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:01.440
And those are actual games or you conjure up like fake games?

01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:04.320
No, they're often based on real games.

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:08.800
And then I'm thinking like, oh, but it wouldn't be more interesting if

01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:10.400
the pieces were a little bit different.

01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:12.160
And then often I play it out from there.

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:20.640
So you don't sit behind a computer or a chessboard and you lay out the pieces?

01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:24.880
No, I'm not at all a poster board for deliberate practice.

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:27.520
I could never work that way.

01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:33.520
My first coach, he gave me some exercises at home.

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:38.880
Sometimes, but he realized at some point that wasn't going to work.

01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:43.600
Because I wouldn't do it really or enjoy it.

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:49.920
So what he would do instead is that at the school where I had the trainings with him,

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:54.080
there was this massive chess library.

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:56.640
So he was just like, yeah, pick out books.

01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:59.280
You can have anything you want.

01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:03.280
Just pick out books you like, and then you give it back the next time.

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.120
So that's what I did instead.

01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:06.720
Yeah, I just absolutely rated.

01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:12.400
Then my next tournament, I will try out one of the openings from that book,

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:13.920
if it was an opening book and so on.

01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:16.720
So does it feel like a struggle, like challenging,

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:20.800
like to be thinking those positions or is it fun and relaxing?

01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:22.240
No, it's completely fine.

01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:22.720
I don't.

01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:27.520
Like if it's a difficult position to figure out, you know, like to calculate.

01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:28.720
Then I go on to something else.

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:29.540
Okay.

01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:33.680
Like if I can't figure it out, then, you know, I go on.

01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:37.520
Change it so that it's easier to figure out.

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:41.280
There is a point in your life where Kasparov was interested in being your coach

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:43.440
or at least training with you.

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.360
Why did you choose not to go with him?

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.400
That's a pretty bold move.

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:49.040
Was there a good reason for this?

01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:56.640
No, the first homework exercise he gave me was to analyze.

01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:00.080
He picked out, I think, three or four of my worst losses

01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:05.280
and he wanted me to analyze them and give him my thoughts.

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:10.400
And it wasn't that there were painful losses or anything, that was a problem.

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:13.200
I just didn't really enjoy that.

01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:19.840
Also, I felt that this whole structured approach and everything,

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:23.520
I just felt like from the start it was a hassle.

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:27.360
I loved the idea of being able to pick his brain,

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:35.680
but everything else, I just couldn't see myself enjoying.

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:42.000
At the end of the day, I did then and always have played for fun.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.560
That's always been the main reason.

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:46.800
It's great that you had the confidence to sort of

01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:52.560
basically turn down the approach of one of the greatest chess players of all time

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:54.960
at that time, probably the greatest chess player of all time.

01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:57.280
I don't think I thought of it that way.

01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.920
I just thought this is not for me.

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:01.440
I wouldn't try another way.

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:03.760
I don't think I was particularly thinking that

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:06.000
this is my one opportunity or anything.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.080
It was just, yeah, I don't enjoy this.

01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:09.360
Let's try something else.

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:14.000
When you were 13, you faced Kasparov and he wasn't able to beat you.

01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:16.800
Can you go through that match?

01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:17.680
What did that feel like?

01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:18.640
How important was that?

01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:20.240
How epic was that?

01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:21.920
We played three games.

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:24.720
I lost two and I drew one.

01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:26.960
Right, but one draw.

01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:27.840
No, the one draw.

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:32.640
Didn't you say that you kind of had a better position in that?

01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:34.800
Yeah, I remember that day very well.

01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:36.240
There was a blitz game.

01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:37.600
This was a rapid tournament.

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.560
There was a blitz tournament the day before,

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:45.840
which determined the pairings for the rapids.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:49.200
For people who don't know, super short games are called bullet.

01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:50.720
Kind of short games are called blitz.

01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:54.400
Semi-short games are called rapid.

01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:58.720
And classic chess, I guess, is like very super long.

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:03.120
Yeah, basically bullet is never played over the board.

01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:06.480
So in terms of over the board chess, blitz is the shortest.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:11.120
Rapid is like a hybrid between classical and blitz.

01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:14.160
You need to have the skills for both and then classical is.

01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:17.760
It's like the blitz tournament, which didn't go so well.

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:23.920
I got a couple of wins, but I was beaten badly in a lot of games, including by Gary.

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:28.560
And so there was the pairing that I had to play him, which is pretty exciting.

01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:31.760
So I remember I was so tired after the blitz tournament.

01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:34.240
I slept for 12 hours or something.

01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:37.360
Then I woke up like, okay, I'll turn on my computer.

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:42.480
I'll search chess space for Kasparov and we'll go from there.

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:48.960
So before that, I hadn't spent a lot of time specifically studying his games.

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:53.360
It was super intimidating because a lot of these openings I knew.

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:56.720
I was like, oh, he was the first one to play that.

01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:57.760
Oh, that was his idea.

01:43:57.760 --> 01:43:58.880
I actually didn't know that.

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:02.400
So I was a bit intimidated before we played.

01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:08.560
Then, of course, the first game he arrived a bit late because they changed the time

01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.880
from the first day to the other, which was a bit strange.

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:13.440
But everybody else had noticed it but him.

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:17.920
Then he tried to surprise me in the opening.

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:21.680
I think psychologically, the situation was not so easy for him.

01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:25.600
Clearly, it would be embarrassing for him if he didn't win both games against me.

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:32.080
Then I was spending way too much time on my moves because I was playing Kasparov.

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:33.920
I was double checking everything too much.

01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:36.560
Normally, I would be playing pretty fast in those days.

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:42.080
And then at some point, I calculated better than him.

01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:45.440
He missed a crucial detail and had a much better position.

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:47.840
I couldn't convert it though.

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:52.800
I knew what line I had to go for in order to have a chance to win.

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:55.600
But I thought I'll play a bit more carefully.

01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:56.640
Maybe I can win still.

01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:57.200
I couldn't.

01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:04.240
And then I lost the second game pretty badly, which it wasn't majorly upsetting.

01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:09.600
But I felt that I had two black games against Kasparov, both in the Blitz and the Rapid.

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:12.640
And I lost both of them without any fight whatsoever.

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:14.480
I wasn't happy about that at all.

01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:19.040
That was less than I thought I could be able to do.

01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:22.960
So to me, yeah, I was proud of that.

01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:24.160
But it was a gimmick.

01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:29.520
I was a very strong IAM but had GM strength.

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:37.280
I was like, it can happen that a player of that strength makes a draw against Gary once in a while.

01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:44.880
I understand that I'm 13, but still I felt a bit more gimmicky than anything.

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:48.000
I guess it's a good thing that made me notice.

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:50.720
But apart from that, it wasn't.

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:56.080
And for people who don't know, IAM is international master and GM is grand master.

01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:01.200
You were just on the verge of becoming the youngest grand master ever.

01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:04.080
I was the second youngest ever.

01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:06.000
I think I'm like the seventh youngest now.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.680
I mean, these kids these days.

01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:15.840
But I was the youngest grand master at the time in the world.

01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:24.720
You say it's gimmicky, but there's a romantic notion, especially as things have turned out.

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:27.360
No, for sure.

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:30.400
And have you talked to Gary since then about that?

01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:31.360
No, not really.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.200
I think he's embarrassed.

01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:35.120
He's still bitter, you think?

01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:36.880
No, I don't think he's bitter.

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:40.720
But I think the game in itself was a bit embarrassing for him.

01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:43.600
Even he can't see past...

01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:47.600
I think he's completely fine with that.

01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:50.960
I think in retrospect, it's a good story.

01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:53.200
He appreciates that.

01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:54.320
I don't think that's the problem.

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:57.280
But it never made sense for me to broach the subject with him.

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:04.800
It's funny just having interacted with Gary, now having talked to you.

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:11.040
There is a little thing you still hate losing, no matter how beautiful that moment is.

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:16.640
Because in a way, it's a passing of the baton from one great champion to another.

01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:22.400
But you still just don't like the fact that you didn't play a good game from Gary's perspective.

01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:26.880
He still is just annoyed, probably, that he could have played better.

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:32.400
We did work together in 2009, quite a lot.

01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:38.640
And that corporation ended early 2010.

01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:44.800
But we did play a lot of training games in 2009, which was interesting because

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:46.240
he was still very, very strong.

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:49.920
And at that time, it was fairly equal.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.720
He was playing me quite a bit, but I was fighting well.

01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:56.400
So it was pretty even then.

01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:03.120
I appreciate those games a lot more than some random game from when I was 13.

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:07.120
Maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about.

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:12.400
But I've always found that, at least based on that game,

01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:16.720
you couldn't tell that I was going to take his spot.

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:28.160
I made a horrible blunder and lost to an Uzbek kid in the World Rapid Championship in 2018.

01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:32.800
Granted, he was part of the team that now won gold in the Chess Olympiad,

01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:34.080
but he wasn't the crucial part.

01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:35.760
He barely played any games.

01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:39.680
It wasn't like I would think that he would become world champion because he beat me.

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:43.760
I'm always skeptical of those who said that they knew that I was going to be

01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:48.240
world champion after that game or at all at that time.

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:51.840
I mean, it was easy to see that I would become a very, very strong player.

01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:56.960
Everybody could see that, but to be the best in the world or one of the best ever.

01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:03.120
It is hard to say, but I do remember seeing Messi when he was 16 and 17.

01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:07.600
But hasn't that happened with other players, though?

01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:10.800
Yeah, but I just had a personal experience.

01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:11.840
He did look different.

01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:14.160
There's like magic there.

01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:19.840
Maybe you can't tell he would be one of the greatest ever, but there's still magic.

01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:20.320
But you're right.

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.720
Most of the time we're trying to project.

01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:25.200
We see a young kid being an older person.

01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:28.160
You start to think, okay, this could be the next great person.

01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:30.160
Then we forget when they don't become that.

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:30.960
Yeah, exactly.

01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:32.320
That's I think what happens.

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:36.560
But when it does, maybe some people are just

01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:40.000
so good at seeing these patterns that they can actually see.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.400
Aren't you supposed to do that kind of thing with fantasy football?

01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:45.920
Like, see the long shot and bet on them and then they turn out to be good?

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:51.280
You make a lot of long shot bets and then some of them come good.

01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:54.320
And then people call you a genius for making the bet.

01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:58.320
Well, let me ask you the GOAT question again from fantasy perspective.

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:03.280
Can you make the case for the greatest chess player of all time?

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:08.480
For each yourself, Magnus Carlsen, for Garry Kasparov,

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:15.680
I don't know who else, Bobby Fischer, Mikhail Tal, anyone else for Hikaru Nakamura?

01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:17.040
Just kidding.

01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:23.520
Yeah, I think I can make a case for myself, for Garry and for Fischer.

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:24.960
So I'll start with Fischer.

01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:28.480
For him, it's very, very simple.

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:33.520
He was ahead of his time, but that's like intangible.

01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:35.680
You can say that about a lot of people.

01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:44.320
But he had a peak from 1970 to 72 when he was so much better than the others.

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:46.720
He won 20 games in a row.

01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:52.160
Also, the way that he played was so powerful and with so few mistakes

01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:54.720
that he just had no position there.

01:50:54.720 --> 01:51:00.000
So he had just a peak that's been better than anybody.

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:06.640
The gap between him and others was greater than it's ever been

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:09.360
in history and the other time.

01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:12.160
And that would be the argument for him.

01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:21.360
For Garry, he's played in a very competitive era and he's beaten several generations.

01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:22.240
He was the best.

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:29.440
Well, he was the consensus best player, I would say, for almost 20 years,

01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:35.600
which nobody else has done, at least in recent time.

01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:37.280
So the longevity.

01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:39.600
The longevity, for sure.

01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:46.960
Also, at his peak, he was not quite the level of Fischer in terms of the gap,

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:52.720
but it was similar to or I think even a little bit better than mine.

01:51:52.720 --> 01:52:00.000
As for me, I'm, of course, unbeaten as a world champion in five tries.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:07.520
I've been world number one for 11 years straight in an even more competitive era than Garry.

01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:09.840
I have the highest chess rating of all time.

01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:14.240
I have the longest streak ever without losing a game.

01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:19.280
I think for me, the main argument would be about the era where

01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:28.560
the engines have leveled the playing field so much that it's harder to dominate.

01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:34.880
And still, I haven't always been a clear number one, but I've been number one for 11 years.

01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:38.640
And for a lot of the time, the gap has been pretty big.

01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:42.240
So I think there are decent arguments for all of them.

01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:47.920
I've said before, and I haven't changed my mind, that Garry generally edges it

01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:51.520
because of the longevity in the competitive era.

01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:54.800
But there are arguments.

01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:58.080
But people also talk about you in terms of the style of play.

01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:00.320
So it's not just about dominance or the height.

01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:04.400
It's just the creative genius of it.

01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:06.240
Yeah, but I'm not interested in that.

01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:15.440
In terms of greatest of all time, I'm not interested in questions of style.

01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:20.960
So for Messi, you don't give credit for the style, for the stylistic?

01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:23.600
No, I like watching it.

01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:26.400
But you're not going to give points for the...

01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:29.680
So Messi gets best ever because of the finishing.

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:34.240
No, it's not because of the finishing.

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:37.360
It's because of his overall impact on the game.

01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:38.720
It's higher than anybody else's.

01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:39.440
Okay.

01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:42.160
He contributes.

01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:46.080
He just contributes more to winning than anybody else does.

01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:53.600
You're somebody who was advocated for and has done quite a bit of study of classic games.

01:53:53.600 --> 01:54:02.000
What would you say is maybe the number one or maybe top three games of chess ever played?

01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:04.720
Doesn't interest me at all.

01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:05.840
You don't think of those?

01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:06.800
No, I don't think of it.

01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:09.280
I mean, I find the games interesting.

01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:10.560
I try to learn from them.

01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:13.440
But trying to rank them has never interested me.

01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:16.800
What games pop out to you as super interesting then?

01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:27.360
Is there things like old school games where there's interesting ideas that you go back...

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:31.840
Or you find surprising and pretty cool that those ideas were developed back then?

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:35.360
Is there something that jumps to mind?

01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:42.240
There are several games of young Kasparov before he became world champion.

01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:47.680
If you're going to ask for my favorite player or favorite style, that's probably...

01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:48.400
Young Kasparov.

01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:56.240
Can you describe stylistically or in any other way what young Kasparov was like that you like?

01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:59.200
It was just an overflow energy in his play.

01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:01.600
So aggressive attacking chess?

01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:03.520
Extremely aggressive dynamic chess.

01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:11.040
It probably appeals to me a lot because these are the things that I cannot do as well.

01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:15.600
That it just feels very special to me.

01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:21.440
But yeah, in terms of games, I never thought about that too much.

01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:27.920
Is there memories, big or small, weird, surprising?

01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:33.360
Just any kind of beautiful anecdote from your chess career?

01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:36.880
Stuff that pops out that people might not know about?

01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:38.800
Just stuff when you look back, it just makes you smile?

01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:46.320
No, so I'll tell you about the most satisfying tournament victory of my career.

01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:51.520
So that was the Norwegian Championship under 11 in 2000.

01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:59.120
Before that tournament, I was super anxious because I started kind of late at chess.

01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:04.000
I played my first tournament when I was eight and a half, and a lot of my competitors

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.440
had already played for a couple of years or even three, four years at that point.

01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:15.120
So I played the under 11 championship in 99.

01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:18.080
I was a little over the middle of the pack.

01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:21.200
I'd never played against any of them before, so I didn't know what to expect at all.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:26.560
And then over the next year, I was edging a little bit closer.

01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:29.280
In each tournament, I felt like I was getting a little bit better.

01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:34.400
And when we had the championship, I knew that I was ready.

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:38.640
That I was now at the same level of the best players.

01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:41.120
I was so anxious to show it.

01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:47.120
I remember the feeling of excitement and nervousness before the tournament was incredible.

01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:53.680
The tournament was weird because I started out, I gave away a draw to a weaker player

01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:57.760
whom I shouldn't have drawn to.

01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:04.560
And then I drew against the other guy who was clearly the best or second best.

01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:11.840
At that point, I thought it was over because I thought he wouldn't give away points to others.

01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:15.200
And then the very next day, he lost to somebody.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:21.280
So the rest of the tournament, I was always playing my game and watching his.

01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:26.560
And we both won the rest of our games, but it meant that I was half a point ahead.

01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:34.160
The feeling when I realized that I was going to win, that was just so amazing.

01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:39.120
It was the first time that I was the best at my age.

01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:49.440
And at that point, I realized I could actually be very good at this.

01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:53.520
So you kind of saw, where did you think your ceiling would be?

01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:57.200
Did you see that one day you could be the number one?

01:57:57.200 --> 01:57:59.440
No, I didn't think that was possible at all.

01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:06.640
I thought I could be the best in Norway at that point.

01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:09.760
Because I started relatively late.

01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:16.880
I knew that I studied a lot more than the others.

01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:19.760
I knew that I had a passion that they didn't have.

01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:26.560
They saw chess as something like, it was a hobby.

01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:27.760
It was like an activity.

01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:33.920
It was like going to football practice or any other sports.

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:39.360
You practice once or twice a week, and then you play a tournament at the weekend.

01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:41.040
That's what you did.

01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:42.080
For me, it wasn't like that.

01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:47.440
I would go with my books and my board every day after school.

01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:55.520
And I would just constantly be trying to learn new things.

01:58:55.520 --> 01:59:00.640
I had like two hours of internet time on the computer each week.

01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:03.920
And I would always spend them on chess.

01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:18.000
I think before I was 13 or 14, I'd never opened a browser for any other reason than to play chess.

01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:23.680
Would you describe that as love or as obsession or something in between?

01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:25.440
It's everything?

01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:26.240
Yeah, everything.

01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:36.320
It wasn't hard for me to tell at that point that I had something that the other kids didn't.

01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:41.760
Because I was never the one to grasp something very, very quickly.

01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:45.200
But once I started, I always got hooked, and then I never stopped learning.

01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:51.760
You've talked about the middle game as a place where you can play pure chess.

01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:54.640
What do you think is beautiful to you about chess?

01:59:56.240 --> 01:59:57.840
Like the thing when you were 11?

01:59:58.560 --> 02:00:04.160
What is beautiful to me is when your opponent can predict every single one of your moves

02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:05.040
and they still lose.

02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:07.040
How does that happen?

02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:13.440
No, it means that at some point early, your planning, your evaluation has been better.

02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:17.120
So that you play just very simply, very clearly.

02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:21.680
It looks like you did nothing special and your opponent lost without a chance.

02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:25.200
How do you think about that, by the way?

02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:28.400
Are you basically narrowing down this gigantic tree of options

02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:33.920
to where your opponent has less and less and less options to win, to escape,

02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:35.280
and then they're trapped?

02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:36.640
Yeah, essentially.

02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:47.120
Is there some aspect to the patterns themselves, to the positions, to the elegance of the dynamics

02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:52.480
of the game that you just find beautiful that you forget about the opponent?

02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:58.320
In general, I try and create harmony on the board.

02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:05.440
What I would usually find harmonious is that the pieces work together,

02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:12.880
that they protect each other, and that there are no pieces that are suboptimally placed.

02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:18.560
If they are suboptimally placed, they can be improved pretty easily.

02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:24.880
I hate when I have one piece that I know is badly placed and I can't improve it.

02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:29.280
Yeah, when you're thinking about the harmony of the pieces,

02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:31.680
when you're looking at the position, you're evaluating it.

02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:41.200
Are you looking at the whole board or is it like a bunch of groupings of pieces overlapping

02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:44.320
and like dancing together kind of thing?

02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:49.440
I would say it's more of the latter that would be more precise.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:57.840
I look mostly closer to the middle, but then I would focus on one.

02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:04.400
There are usually one grouping of pieces on one side and then some more closer to the other side,

02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:07.920
so I would think of it a little bit that way.

02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:10.880
Everything is kind of gravitating to the middle.

02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:13.120
If it's going well, then yes.

02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:15.120
And in harmony.

02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:16.480
Yeah, in harmony.

02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:22.960
If you can control the middle, you can more easily attack on both sides.

02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:25.760
That applies to pretty much any game.

02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:27.520
It's as simple as that.

02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:37.200
Attacking on one side without control of the middle would feel very non-harmonious for me.

02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:43.840
I talked about the 10th game in the World Championship.

02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:45.760
That's the time I was the most nervous.

02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:51.280
Because it was the kind of attack that I hate where you just have to,

02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:56.480
you're abandoned one side and the attack has to work.

02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:01.440
There was one side and part of the middle as well, which I didn't control at all.

02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:05.360
That's like the opposite of harmony for me.

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:13.520
What advice would you give to chess players of different levels on how to improve in chess?

02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:17.920
Very beginner, complete beginner, I mean, at every level.

02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:19.760
Is there something you can say?

02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:27.040
It's very hard for me to say because, I mean, the easiest way is like love chess, be obsessed.

02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:29.120
Well, that's a really important statement.

02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:31.520
But that doesn't work for everybody.

02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:34.560
Sometimes it can feel like a grind.

02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:37.840
So you're saying the less it can feel like a grind, the better.

02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:39.440
Yeah, for sure.

02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:40.080
At least for you.

02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:41.200
That's for sure.

02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:47.200
But I'm also very, very skeptical about giving advice because I think,

02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:56.160
again, my way only works if you have some combination of talent and obsession.

02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:59.680
So I'm not sure that I'd generally recommend it.

02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:05.440
What I've done doesn't go with what most coaches suggest for their kids.

02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:10.400
I've been lucky that I've had coaches from early on that have been very,

02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:14.320
very hands-off and just allowed me to do my thing, basically.

02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:20.160
Well, there's a lot to be said about cultivating the obsession.

02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:26.400
Really letting that flourish to where you spend a lot of hours,

02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:30.480
like with the chessboard in your head and it doesn't feel like a struggle.

02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:36.080
No. So just letting me do my thing, if you give me a bunch of work,

02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:41.200
it will probably feel like a sure and if you don't give me, I will spend all of that time

02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:47.760
on my own without thinking that it's work or without thought that I'm doing this to improve my chess.

02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:54.400
Well, in terms of learning stuff like books, there's one thing that's relatively novel

02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:59.680
from your perspective. People are starting now. There's YouTube. There's a lot of good YouTubers.

02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:03.680
You're a part-time YouTuber. You have stuff on YouTube, I guess.

02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:10.880
Yeah, but if you've seen my YouTube, it's mostly live. It's definitely not higher for content.

02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:18.560
Yeah. But do you like any particular YouTubers? I could just recommend stuff I've seen. So

02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:27.280
Agadmatter, Gotham Chess, Botez Live. I really like St. Louis Chess Club,

02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:33.840
Daniel Naradzki and John Bartholomew. Those are good channels, but is there something you can

02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:43.120
recommend? No, all of them are good. The best recommendation I could give is Agadmatter.

02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:47.040
How much did he pay you to say that?

02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:54.720
No, so the thing about that is that I can tell you I've never watched any of his

02:05:54.720 --> 02:06:02.080
videos from start to finish. I'm not the target audience, obviously. But I think the only chess

02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:11.360
YouTube video that my dad has ever watched from start to finish is Agadmatter. He said I watched

02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:16.800
one of his videos. I wanted to know what it was all about because I think Agadmatter is

02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:23.280
the same strength as my father or maybe just a little bit weaker, like 1900 or something. My

02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:29.440
father is probably about 2000. And my father has played chess his whole life. He absolutely loves

02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:34.800
the game. That's the only time he's actually sat through one of those videos. And he said,

02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:40.720
yeah, I get it. I enjoy it. So that's the best recommendation I could give. That's the only

02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:46.880
channel that my father actually enjoys. This is hilarious. I talked to him before this to

02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:51.600
ask him if he has any questions for you. And he said, no, just do your thing.

02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:56.640
No, he's so careful. He wouldn't do that. He did mention jokingly about

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:03.120
Evans Gambit, I think. Is that a thing? Evans Gambit? It's some weird thing he made up. It

02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:08.320
might be an inside joke. I don't know. But he asked me to. Well, anyway. Yeah, I didn't even get...

02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:15.200
It's something he made up. I didn't even realize that he plays the Evans Gambit. He plays a lot of

02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:20.240
gambits that are... Wait, Evans Gambit is a thing? Yeah, yeah, that's a thing. That's an old opening

02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:25.840
from the 1800s. Captain Evans apparently invented it. Why would he mention that particular one?

02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:30.960
Is there something hilarious about that one? I don't know. I don't think I've ever faced the

02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:36.000
Evans Gambit in a game. I feel like both of you are trolling me right now.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:43.600
He's played a lot of other gambits. Maybe this is the one he wanted to mention. Maybe this is

02:07:43.600 --> 02:07:50.240
called the Evans Gambit as well. But I just know it as the 2G4 Gambit. Maybe this is the one.

02:07:50.240 --> 02:08:00.960
This one he has played a bunch. And he's been telling me a lot about his games in this line.

02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:04.640
He's been telling me a lot about his games in this line. He's like,

02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:10.640
oh, it's not so bad. And I'm like, yeah, but you're a pawn down. But I can sort of see it.

02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:17.360
I can sort of understand it. And he's proud of the fact that nobody told him to play this line or

02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:24.400
anything. He came up with it himself. I'll tell you another story about my father. So there's

02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:35.520
this line that I call the Henry Carlson line. So at some point, he never knew a lot of openings

02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:45.680
in chess, but I taught him a couple of openings as black. It's the Sveshnikov Sicilian that I've

02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:53.360
played a lot myself also during the World Championship in 2018. I won a bunch of games

02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:58.400
in 2019 as well. So that's one opening. And I also taught him as black to play the Rogozin defense.

02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:08.640
So the Rogozin defense goes like this. It's characterized by this bishop move.

02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:17.040
And so he would play those openings pretty exclusively as black in the tournaments that

02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:23.840
he did play. And also the Sveshnikov Sicilian is like, that's the only two of my sisters have

02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:28.880
played a bunch of chess tournaments as well. And that's the only opening they know as well.

02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:36.240
So my family's portrait is very narrow. So this is the system. Black goes here,

02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:42.480
and then we have white takes the pawn and black takes the pawn. So at some point, I was watching

02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:52.960
one of my father's online blitz games. And as white, he played this. So this is called

02:09:52.960 --> 02:10:00.000
the Karakhan defense. He took the pawn, was taken back, then he went with the knight.

02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:08.080
His opponent went here, and then he played a bishop here. So I'd never seen this opening before.

02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:14.720
And I was like, wow, how on earth did he come up with that? And he said, no, I just played the

02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:19.440
Rogozin with different colors, because if the knight was here, it would be the same position.

02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:28.800
I was like, how am I one of the best 20 players in the world? And I've never thought about that.

02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:37.520
So I actually started playing this line as white with pretty decent results. And it actually became

02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:43.600
kind of popular. And everybody who asked about the line is like, I would always tell them,

02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:48.160
yeah, that's the Henry Carlson. I wouldn't necessarily explain why it was called that.

02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:55.920
I would just always call it that. So I really hope at some point, this line will find its rightful

02:10:55.920 --> 02:11:02.960
name. Yeah, it finds its way into the history books. What did you learn about life from your

02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:11.120
dad? What role has your dad played in your life? He's taught me a lot of things. But most of all,

02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:15.760
as long as you win a chess, then everything else is fine.

02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:26.000
I think my, especially my father, but my parents in general, they always wanted me to

02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:34.640
get a good education and find a job and so on. Even though my father loves chess and he wanted

02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:42.240
me to play chess, I don't think he had any plans for me to be professional. I think things changed

02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:50.800
at some point, like I was less and less interested in school. And for a long time, we were kind of

02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:56.640
going back and forth fighting about that, especially my father, but also my mother a little

02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:01.760
bit. It was at times a little bit difficult. They wanted you to go to school. Yeah, they

02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:08.160
sort of wanted me to do more school, to have more options. And then I think at some point,

02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:16.800
they just gave up. But I think that sort of coincided when I was actually starting to make

02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:24.480
real money off tournaments. And after that, everything's been sort of easy. In terms of the

02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:32.160
family, they've never put any pressure on me or they've never put any demands on me.

02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:43.120
Minos has to focus on chess. That's it. I think they taught me in general to be curious about

02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:52.560
the world and to get a decent general education. Not necessarily from school, but just knowing

02:12:54.240 --> 02:13:01.600
about the world around you and knowing history and being interested in society. I think

02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:08.000
in that sense, they've done well. And he's been with you throughout your chess career.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:14.320
There's something to be said about just family support and love that you have.

02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:23.440
This world is a lonely place. It's good to have people around you that got your back.

02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:31.840
It's a cliche, but I think to some extent, all the people you surround yourself with,

02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:39.520
they can help you a lot. It's only family that only has their own interests at heart. And so for

02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:47.680
that reason, my father's the only one that's been constantly in the team and that he's always been

02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:52.160
around. And it's for that reason that I know he has my back no matter what.

02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:58.800
Now, there's a cliche question here. But let's try to actually get to some deeper

02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:05.520
truth, perhaps. But people who don't know much about chess seem to like to use chess as a metaphor

02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:12.160
for everything in life. But there is some aspect to the decision-making, to the kind of reasoning

02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:19.280
involved in chess that's transferable to other things. Can you speak to that in your own life

02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:26.720
and in general? The kind of reasoning involved with chess, how much of that does it take to

02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:35.920
transfer to life out there? It just helps you make decisions of all kinds.

02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:41.920
Yeah, that would be my main takeaway, that you learn to make informed guesses in a limited amount

02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:49.360
of time. I mean, does it frustrate you when you have geopolitical thinkers and leaders?

02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:56.560
Henry Kissinger will often talk about geopolitics as a game of chess or 3D chess. Is that a tool

02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:02.640
oversimplified of a projection? Or do you think that the kind of deliberations you have on the

02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:07.600
world stage is similar to the kind of decision-making you have on the chessboard?

02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:12.720
Well, I'm never trying to get re-elected when I play a game of chess.

02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:16.720
There's no special interest you have to get happy.

02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:24.800
Yeah, that kind of helps. No, I can understand that. Obviously, for every action, there's a

02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:33.520
reaction and you have to calculate. Far ahead, it probably would be a good thing if more big

02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:40.080
players on the international scene thought a little bit more like a chess player in that sense,

02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:47.440
like trying to make a good decision based on a limited amount of data rather than

02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:52.240
thinking about other factors. But it's so tough. But it does annoy me when

02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:57.440
when people make moves that they know are wrong for different reasons.

02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:00.640
And they should know if they did some calculation, they should know they're wrong.

02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:07.520
Yeah, exactly. That they should know that are wrong. And so much politics is like,

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:16.480
you're often asked to do something when it would be much better to do nothing.

02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:25.760
No, but that happens in chess all the time. You have a choice. I often tell people that

02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:31.120
in certain situations, you should not try and win. You should just let your opponent lose.

02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:42.080
And that happens in politics all the time. Just let your opponents continue whatever they're

02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:46.000
doing and then you'll win. Don't try to do something just to do something. Often,

02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:53.520
they say in chess that having a bad plan is better than having no plan. It's absolute nonsense.

02:16:54.960 --> 02:17:00.400
I forget what General said it, but it was like, don't interrupt your enemy when they're making

02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:10.640
a mistake. Also, Petrosian, the former world champion said, when your opponent wants to

02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:15.920
play the Dutch defense, don't stop them. I mean, chess players will know that it's the same thing.

02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:24.800
Actually, this reminds me. Is there something you found really impressive about Queen's Gambit,

02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:30.080
the TV show? That's one of the things that really captivated the public imagination about chess.

02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:34.960
People who don't play chess became very curious about the game, about the beauty of the game,

02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:39.840
the drama of the game, all that kind of stuff. Is there, in terms of accuracy, in terms of the

02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:47.120
actual games played that you found impressive? First of all, they did the chess well. They did

02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:53.040
it accurately. Also, they found actual games and positions that I'd never seen before.

02:17:53.760 --> 02:18:00.080
It really captivated me. I would not follow the story at times. I was just trying to,

02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:05.200
wow, where the hell did I find that game? I was trying to solve the positions.

02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:12.160
So, Beth Harmon, the main character, were you impressed by the play she was doing?

02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:16.880
Was there a particular style that they developed consistently?

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:24.880
At the end, she was just totally universal. At the start, she was probably a bit too aggressive,

02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:30.960
but no, she was absolutely universal. Wait, what adjective are you using?

02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:34.560
Universal in the sense that she could play in any style.

02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:41.280
Oh, interesting. And was dominant in that way. Wow, so there's a development in the style too

02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:44.480
throughout the show. Yeah, for sure. It's really interesting they did that.

02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:50.720
Yeah. And it actually happened with me a bit as well. I started out really aggressive.

02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:58.240
Then I became probably too technical at some point, taking a little bit too few risks and

02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:02.640
not playing dynamic enough. And then I started to get a little bit better at

02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:09.520
dynamic so that now I would say definitely the most universal player in terms of style.

02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:13.600
Are there any skills in chess that are transferable to poker?

02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:19.520
So as you're playing around poker a little bit now, how fundamentally different of a game is it?

02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:30.640
What I find the most transferable probably is not letting past decisions dictate future thinking.

02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:35.520
Yeah. But in terms of the patterns in the betting strategies and all that kind of stuff,

02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:39.360
what about bluffing? I bluff way too much.

02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:45.680
It does seem you enjoy bluffing and Daniel Negrano was saying you're quite good at it.

02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:49.440
But yeah, it has very little material to go by.

02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:50.640
Sample size is small.

02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:56.640
Yeah. No, I mean, I enjoy bluffing for the more of the gambling aspects, the thrill of.

02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:00.800
So not the technical aspect of the bluffing like you would on the chessboard.

02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:09.600
Not bluffing in the same sense, but there is some element. But I do enjoy it on the chessboard. If

02:20:09.600 --> 02:20:15.120
I know that I successfully scared away my opponent from making the best move, that's of course

02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:21.520
satisfying. In that same way, it might be satisfying in poker, right? That you represent

02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:26.320
something, you scare away your opponent in the same kind of way. And also like you tell a story,

02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:32.880
you try and tell a story and then they believe it. Yeah. Tell a story with your betting, with your

02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:41.040
all the different other cues. Do you like the money aspect, the betting strategies? So it's

02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:48.400
almost like another layer on top of it, right? Like it's the uncertainty in the cards,

02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:52.240
but the betting, there's so much freedom to the betting.

02:20:53.440 --> 02:21:00.320
I'm not very good at that, so I cannot say that I understand it completely. You know, when it comes

02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:07.280
to different sizing and all that, I just haven't studied it enough. How much of luck is part of

02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:13.600
poker, would you say, from what you've seen versus skill? I mean, it's so different in the

02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:18.400
sense that you can be one of the best players in the world and lose two, three years in a row

02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:26.800
without that being like a massive outlier. Okay. The thing that more than one person told me

02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:33.520
that you're very good at is trash talking. I don't think I am. A lot of people who

02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:40.480
make those observations about me, I think they just expect very, very little. So they expect

02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:48.240
from the best chess player in the world, that just anything that's non-robotic is interesting.

02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:53.760
Also, when it comes to trash talking, like I have the biggest advantage in the world that I'm the

02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:58.480
best at what I'm doing. So trash talking becomes very, very easy because I can back it up.

02:21:58.640 --> 02:22:06.000
A lot of people that are extremely good at stuff don't trash talk and they're not good at it.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:09.760
I don't think I'm very good at it. It's just that I can back it up,

02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:13.680
which makes it seem that I'm better. You're even doing it now.

02:22:14.640 --> 02:22:18.880
Also, being non-robotic or not completely robotic helps.

02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:25.680
You're not trash talking. You're just stating facts. That's right. Have you ever considered that

02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:30.640
that there will be trash talking over the chessboard in some of the big tournaments,

02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:37.600
like adding that kind of component or even talking? Would that completely distract from

02:22:37.600 --> 02:22:45.200
the game of chess? No, I think it could be funny. When people play offhand games, when they

02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:48.960
play blitz games, people trash talk all the time. It's a normal part of the game.

02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:56.320
So you emphasize fun a lot. Do you think we're living inside of a simulation that is trying to

02:22:56.320 --> 02:23:05.280
maximize fun? But that's only happened for the last 100 years or so. Fun has always been increasing,

02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:09.760
I think. Yeah. Okay. It's always been increasing, but I feel like it's been increasing exponentially.

02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:25.440
Or at least the importance of fun. But I guess it depends on the society as well. In the West,

02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:35.120
we've had such a Christian influence. Christianity hasn't exactly embraced the concept of fun over

02:23:36.080 --> 02:23:41.120
time. Well, actually, to push back, I think forbidding certain things kind of makes them

02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:47.120
more fun. So sometimes I think you need to say, you're not allowed to do this. And then a lot of

02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:54.080
people start doing it and then they have fun doing that because it's doing a thing in the face of the

02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:58.400
resistance of the thing. So whenever there's resistance, that does somehow make it more fun.

02:23:59.040 --> 02:24:08.560
Oppressive regimes have always been kind of good for comedy. Supposedly in the Soviet Union,

02:24:08.560 --> 02:24:14.080
I don't know about fun, but supposedly comedy, at least underground, it thrived.

02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:20.240
Yeah. Well, no, it permeates the entire culture. There's a dark humor that sort of the cruelty,

02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:26.560
the absurdity of life really brings out the humor amongst the populace, plus vodka on top of that.

02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:34.160
But this idea that, for example, Elon Musk has that the most entertaining outcome is the most

02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:40.720
likely. That it seems like the most absurd, silly, funny thing seems to be the thing.

02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:47.520
So it happens more often than it should. And it somehow becomes viral in our modern

02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:55.520
connected world. And so the fun stuff, the memes spread, and then we start to optimize for the fun

02:24:55.520 --> 02:25:03.280
meme that seems to be a fundamental property of the reality we live in. And so emerges the

02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:11.200
fun maximizer in all walks of life, like in chess, in poker and everything.

02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:14.560
I think you're skeptical.

02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:23.680
No, I'm not skeptical. I'm just taking it all in. But I find it interesting and not at all impossible.

02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:25.840
Do you ever get lonely?

02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:32.320
Oh, yeah, for sure. Like a chess player's life is, by definition, pretty lonely.

02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:39.520
Because you have nobody else to blame but yourself when you lose, or you don't achieve the results

02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:40.320
that you want to achieve.

02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:46.240
It's difficult for you to find comfort elsewhere. It's in your own mind.

02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:46.720
Yeah.

02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:48.480
It's you versus yourself, really.

02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:58.880
Yeah, really. But it's part of the profession. But I think any sport or activity where it's

02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:04.560
just you and your own mind is just, by definition, lonely.

02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:06.160
Are you worried that it destroys you?

02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:13.200
Oh, not at all. As long as I'm aware of it, then it's fine. And I don't think

02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:21.440
that the inherent loneliness of my profession really affects the rest of my life in a major way.

02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:30.400
What role does love play in the human condition in your lonely life of calculation?

02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:41.440
You know, I'm like everybody else, trying to find love.

02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:46.560
No, not necessarily like trying to find love. Sometimes I am, sometimes I'm not.

02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:55.520
I'm just trying to find my way. And my love for the game, obviously, it comes and goes

02:26:55.520 --> 02:27:01.840
a little bit. But there's always at least some level of love. So that doesn't go away.

02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:10.320
But I think in other parts of life, I think it's just about doing things that make you happy.

02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:17.840
That give you joy. That also makes you more receptive to love in general. So that has been

02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:25.600
my approach to love now for quite a while. That I'm just trying to live my best life. And then

02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:35.760
the love will come when it comes. And in terms of romantic love, it has come and gone in my life.

02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:45.440
It's not there now. But I'm not worried about that. I'm more worried about not worried,

02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:52.400
but more like trying to just be a good version of myself. I cannot always be the best version

02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:58.080
of myself, but at least try to be good. Yeah. And keep your heart open. What is this Daniel

02:27:58.160 --> 02:28:04.720
Johnston song? True love will find you in the end. It may or may not. But it will only find you

02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:14.320
if you're looking. So you have to be open to it. Yeah. It may or may not. Yeah. And no matter what,

02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:20.080
you're going to lose it in the end because it all ends. The whole thing ends. Yeah. So I don't think

02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:27.920
stressing over that like, obviously, it's so human that you can't help it to some degree.

02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:34.960
But I feel like stressing over love, that's the blueprint for whether you're looking or

02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:42.720
you're not looking or you're in a relationship or marriage or anything like stressing over it is

02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:48.240
like the blueprint for being unhappy. Just to clarify confusion, I have

02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:58.560
just a quick question. How does the night move? So the night moves in an L. And unlike in Shogi,

02:28:58.560 --> 02:29:07.920
it can move both forwards and backwards. It is quite a nimble piece. It can jump over everything,

02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:13.680
but it's less happy and open position where it has to move from side to side quickly.

02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:23.280
I am generally more of a bishop's guy myself for the old debate. I just prefer quality over the

02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:30.720
intangibles. But I can appreciate a good night once in a while. Last simple question. What's

02:29:30.720 --> 02:29:36.720
the meaning of life, Magnus Carlsen? There is obviously no meaning to life. Is that obvious?

02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:42.560
I think we're here by accident. There's no meaning. It ends at some point. But it's still

02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:48.080
a great thing. You can still have fun even if there's no meaning. Yeah, you can still have fun.

02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:55.200
You can try and pursue your goals, whatever they may be. But I'm pretty sure there's no special

02:29:55.200 --> 02:30:03.360
meaning and trying to find it also doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. For me, life is both

02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:10.320
meaningless and meaningful for just being here, trying to make not necessarily the most of it,

02:30:10.320 --> 02:30:14.960
but the things that make you happy both short term and also long term.

02:30:15.600 --> 02:30:19.200
Yeah, it seems to be full of cool stuff to enjoy. It certainly does.

02:30:20.320 --> 02:30:25.600
And one of those is having a conversation with you, Magnus. It's a huge honor to talk to you.

02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:29.840
Thank you so much for spending this time with me. I can't wait to see what you do in this world.

02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:34.080
Thank you for creating so much elegance and beauty on the chessboard and beyond.

02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:36.000
So thanks for talking today, brother.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:42.480
Thank you so much. Thanks for having me. I wanted to say this at the start,

02:30:42.480 --> 02:30:46.640
but I never really got the chance. I was always a bit apprehensive about

02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:53.600
doing this podcast because you are a very smart guy and your audience is very smart.

02:30:54.240 --> 02:31:03.360
And I always had a bit of imposter syndrome. So I'll tell you this now after the podcast.

02:31:03.360 --> 02:31:07.520
So please do judge me, but I hope you've enjoyed it.

02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:12.560
I loved it. You're a brilliant man. And I love the fact they have imposter syndrome

02:31:12.560 --> 02:31:17.360
because a lot of us do. And so that's beautiful to see even at the very top,

02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:21.680
you still feel like an imposter. Thank you, brother. Thanks for talking today.

02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:26.720
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Magnus Carlsen. To support this podcast,

02:31:26.720 --> 02:31:31.680
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:39.120
Bobby Fisher. Chess is a war over the board. The object is to crush the opponent's mind.

02:31:40.480 --> 02:31:43.200
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

02:31:51.680 --> 02:31:51.840
Bye.
