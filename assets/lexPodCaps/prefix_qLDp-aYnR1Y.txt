00:00.000 --> 00:02.420
How are these interacting with our fighters if they are?

00:02.420 --> 00:03.780
How are they interacting with the weather

00:03.780 --> 00:04.980
and their environment?

00:04.980 --> 00:06.540
How are they interacting with each other?

00:06.540 --> 00:08.620
So can we look at these and how they're interacting

00:08.620 --> 00:11.520
perhaps as a swarm, especially off the East Coast

00:11.520 --> 00:14.520
where this is happening all the time with multiple objects.

00:16.700 --> 00:18.180
The following is a conversation

00:18.180 --> 00:22.020
with Lieutenant Ryan Graves, former Navy fighter pilot,

00:22.020 --> 00:25.760
including roles as a combat lead, landing signals officer

00:25.760 --> 00:28.500
and rescue mission commander.

00:28.520 --> 00:31.800
He and people in his squadron detected UFOs

00:31.800 --> 00:33.400
on multiple occasions.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.240
And he has been one of the few people willing

00:36.240 --> 00:38.720
to speak publicly about these experiences

00:38.720 --> 00:42.320
and about the importance of investigating these sightings,

00:42.320 --> 00:45.560
especially for national security reasons.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.640
Ryan has a degree in mechanical

00:47.640 --> 00:50.360
and aerospace engineering from WPI

00:50.360 --> 00:52.600
and an interest in career roles

00:52.600 --> 00:54.480
in advanced technology development,

00:54.480 --> 00:57.600
including multi-agent collaborative autonomy,

00:57.620 --> 01:00.220
machine learning assisted air to air combat,

01:00.220 --> 01:03.300
manned and unmanned teaming technologies

01:03.300 --> 01:05.900
and most recently development of materials

01:05.900 --> 01:08.260
through quantum simulation.

01:08.260 --> 01:10.300
This is a Lex Freeman podcast.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.500
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:12.500 --> 01:13.860
in the description.

01:13.860 --> 01:17.220
And now dear friends, here's Ryan Graves.

01:18.260 --> 01:20.500
What did you think of the new Top Gun movie?

01:20.500 --> 01:21.780
How accurate was it?

01:21.780 --> 01:22.980
Let's start there.

01:22.980 --> 01:25.700
I thought the flying was really accurate.

01:25.700 --> 01:28.280
I thought the type of flying they did

01:28.280 --> 01:30.380
and how they approached the actual mission,

01:31.380 --> 01:33.400
of course had a lot of liberties,

01:33.400 --> 01:35.520
but one thing that seems to be hard to capture

01:35.520 --> 01:37.560
on these types of things are the chess game

01:37.560 --> 01:40.440
that's going on while that type of flying is happening.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.960
The chess game between like in a dogfight

01:42.960 --> 01:45.560
between the pilots and the enemy

01:45.560 --> 01:47.480
or between the different pilots.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.560
I'll even speak to just that particular mission

01:49.560 --> 01:50.400
they flew there.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.240
And for that particular mission,

01:52.240 --> 01:55.000
it's kind of a chess game with yourself

01:55.280 --> 01:56.480
to get everything in place.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.040
So what kind of flight they flew

01:59.040 --> 02:00.840
was called a high threat scenario,

02:00.840 --> 02:02.920
which means they have to ingress low

02:02.920 --> 02:05.100
due to the surface to air threats,

02:05.100 --> 02:08.040
the integrated air defense systems that are nearby.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.720
And they have to ingress low and pop up

02:09.720 --> 02:11.320
like we see in the movie.

02:11.320 --> 02:13.920
And in that particular movie, that was a pre-planned strike.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.640
They knew exactly where they were going.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.640
But there's a scenario where we have to operate

02:17.640 --> 02:18.640
in that type of environment

02:18.640 --> 02:20.720
and we don't know exactly where we're gonna strike

02:20.720 --> 02:23.400
or we're gonna be adapting to real time targets.

02:23.440 --> 02:24.680
And so in that scenario,

02:24.680 --> 02:26.920
you would have one of those fighters down low like that

02:26.920 --> 02:28.800
operating as a mission commander,

02:28.800 --> 02:30.360
as a forward air controller.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.200
And he's out there calling shots,

02:32.200 --> 02:33.600
joining on those other players

02:33.600 --> 02:35.720
in order to ensure they're pointed at the right target.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.800
So that's a bit of the chess game that he'll be playing.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.200
Can you actually describe for people

02:40.200 --> 02:43.480
who haven't seen the movie what the mission actually is?

02:43.480 --> 02:44.320
Yeah.

02:44.320 --> 02:45.160
What's involved in the mission?

02:45.160 --> 02:47.320
So in this particular mission,

02:47.320 --> 02:49.560
it's kind of what we would call a pre-planned strike.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.040
So there's a known location

02:51.040 --> 02:53.400
that's in a heavily defended area.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.520
And the air crew, in this case,

02:55.520 --> 02:59.560
I believe it was four F-18s on the initial package.

02:59.560 --> 03:02.560
Their job was to ingress very low down a canyon

03:02.560 --> 03:04.320
to stay out of the radar window

03:04.320 --> 03:06.240
of the surface to air threats.

03:06.240 --> 03:07.760
What does ingress mean?

03:07.760 --> 03:09.760
Ingress means that they're going to be pushing

03:09.760 --> 03:13.040
from a start location towards the target or the objective.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.080
So there's an ingress portion of the mission

03:15.080 --> 03:16.480
and an egress portion of the mission.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.880
Oh, okay.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.200
Like the entrance and the exit type of thing.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.040
Got it.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.560
But it changes our mindset tactically quite a bit, right?

03:24.560 --> 03:26.040
Because when we're entering someplace,

03:26.040 --> 03:27.920
we have the option to enter.

03:27.920 --> 03:31.360
But when we go drop a bomb on a location, we're exiting.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.840
We don't have that luxury.

03:32.840 --> 03:33.800
We don't have that option.

03:33.800 --> 03:37.480
So it actually changes our tactics and our aggression level.

03:37.480 --> 03:38.300
Got it.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.400
And so they were flying low to the ground

03:40.400 --> 03:43.880
and then there's a surface to air missiles

03:43.880 --> 03:47.160
that force them to have to fly low.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.640
Is that a realistic thing?

03:49.400 --> 03:50.240
It is realistic.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.880
So driving those aircraft in the clutter,

03:51.880 --> 03:54.920
all radar systems or most I should say

03:54.920 --> 03:57.240
are essentially line of sight.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.160
And so they're going to be limited by the horizon

03:59.160 --> 04:00.640
or any clutter out there.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.520
And even a number of radars,

04:02.520 --> 04:04.880
if they are located up high and looking down

04:04.880 --> 04:07.400
towards that aircraft, the clutter,

04:07.400 --> 04:11.480
all the objects such as trees and canyons

04:11.480 --> 04:13.520
can have effect on radar systems.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.280
And so it can be a type of camouflage.

04:16.280 --> 04:17.840
So that's a camouflage for the radar,

04:17.840 --> 04:21.160
but what about the surface to air missile?

04:21.160 --> 04:24.480
Is that a legitimate way to avoid missiles

04:24.480 --> 04:29.480
fly so low, like fly I guess below their level?

04:31.020 --> 04:34.460
As far as I know, you can fly under any radar right now.

04:34.460 --> 04:36.160
We don't have necessarily radars

04:36.160 --> 04:37.900
that can look through anything.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.800
So there is always going to be the ability

04:39.800 --> 04:43.400
to mask yourself, but with a larger number of assets

04:43.400 --> 04:45.680
and distributed communication networks,

04:45.680 --> 04:47.520
where those radars are looking

04:47.560 --> 04:48.500
makes all the difference.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.040
And I said they're ingressing pass an IAS

04:51.040 --> 04:52.980
and that's an integrated air defense system.

04:52.980 --> 04:55.600
And that linking of air defense systems

04:55.600 --> 04:58.960
is what makes it so hard, so complicated

04:58.960 --> 05:00.600
is that the sensors and the weapons

05:00.600 --> 05:02.420
are disassociated from each other.

05:02.420 --> 05:04.840
So that if you took out the target

05:04.840 --> 05:07.160
that was shooting at you, it still has the ability

05:07.160 --> 05:11.480
to intercept you from another radar location.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.960
So it's distributed and it's stronger that way.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.680
You mean the surface to air missiles,

05:17.680 --> 05:22.680
like it's a distributed system in that if you take out one

05:22.680 --> 05:26.040
they're still able to sort of integrate information

05:26.040 --> 05:28.280
about your location and strike at you?

05:28.280 --> 05:30.160
Correct, and there's a lot of complication

05:30.160 --> 05:31.880
that can go, you know, once we start thinking

05:31.880 --> 05:33.460
about distributed systems like that

05:33.460 --> 05:35.520
and the ability to self heal and repair

05:35.520 --> 05:39.900
and adapt to losses, it's an interesting area.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.880
Are you responsible for thinking about that

05:41.880 --> 05:43.480
when you're flying an airplane?

05:43.480 --> 05:47.040
To some degree, when we ingress to an area like that,

05:47.040 --> 05:50.080
we're presented with information about targets,

05:50.080 --> 05:52.280
air to air or air to surface,

05:52.280 --> 05:54.040
or surface to air, I should say.

05:54.040 --> 05:57.680
And we can essentially see where essentially

05:57.680 --> 06:00.420
the danger zone, if you will, is located.

06:00.420 --> 06:02.320
And so essentially we would stay out of that.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.880
And so having a full picture of the environment

06:05.880 --> 06:07.920
is extremely important because, you know,

06:07.920 --> 06:09.300
at the end of the day, if we go in that circle,

06:09.300 --> 06:10.480
we can die pretty quickly.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.720
So it's absolutely crucial.

06:12.760 --> 06:16.320
So there's regions that have higher and lower danger

06:16.320 --> 06:17.920
based on your understanding of the actual,

06:17.920 --> 06:22.080
whatever the surface to air missiles systems are,

06:22.080 --> 06:24.240
so you can kind of know.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.120
That's interesting.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.920
I wonder how automated that could be too,

06:26.920 --> 06:29.400
especially when you don't know.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.280
It seems like in the movie,

06:30.280 --> 06:32.120
they knew the location of everything.

06:33.080 --> 06:37.480
I imagine that's less known in most cases.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.760
And also a lot of those systems

06:39.760 --> 06:41.840
might be a little bit more ghetto,

06:41.840 --> 06:43.600
if I can use that technical term.

06:43.600 --> 06:48.600
Like I've gotten ad hoc maybe is the, I don't know.

06:49.320 --> 06:52.360
But, you know, having just recently visited Ukraine

06:52.360 --> 06:55.360
and seen a lot of aspects of the way that war is fought,

06:55.360 --> 06:58.080
there's a lot of improvised type of systems.

06:58.080 --> 07:01.880
So you take high tech, like advanced technology,

07:01.880 --> 07:04.240
but the way you deploy it and the way you organize it

07:04.240 --> 07:08.640
is very improvised and ad hoc and is responding

07:08.640 --> 07:11.240
to the uncertainty in the dynamic environment.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.880
And so from an enemy perspective

07:13.880 --> 07:16.760
or whoever's trying to deal with that kind of system,

07:16.760 --> 07:19.280
it's hard to figure it out because it's like me,

07:20.160 --> 07:22.080
I played tennis for a long time

07:22.080 --> 07:24.080
and it's always easier to play,

07:24.080 --> 07:25.840
this is true for all sports,

07:25.840 --> 07:27.400
play tennis against a good tennis player

07:27.400 --> 07:29.240
versus a crappy tennis player.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.520
Because the crappy tennis player is full of uncertainty

07:32.520 --> 07:34.360
and that's really difficult to deal with.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.440
It seemed like in the movie,

07:35.440 --> 07:38.080
the systems were really well organized

07:39.000 --> 07:40.920
and so you could plan.

07:40.920 --> 07:41.960
And there was a very nice verveen

07:41.960 --> 07:43.400
that went right down the middle of them.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.880
That's how movies work, isn't it?

07:44.880 --> 07:47.360
Yeah, but no, I absolutely agree.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.600
So, you know, what you say is a very good point.

07:50.600 --> 07:54.560
And as, you know, if we were to take a chunk of airspace

07:54.560 --> 07:56.400
and break it up into little bits, you know,

07:56.400 --> 07:58.080
there'd be places that are better to fly

07:58.080 --> 08:00.280
or less good to fly.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.680
And, you know, we are seeing that now

08:02.680 --> 08:05.320
with what they call manned on manned teaming.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.280
We see tactical aircraft or, you know,

08:07.280 --> 08:09.200
some type of aircraft or platform

08:09.200 --> 08:11.200
that's being automated.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.600
And it's not being automated in traditional sense

08:13.600 --> 08:15.560
where people think aircrew are flying around

08:15.560 --> 08:18.360
to conduct missions, but it's very high level,

08:18.360 --> 08:20.920
objective orientated mission planning

08:20.920 --> 08:25.680
that allows the aircrew to act more as a mission planner,

08:25.680 --> 08:28.600
mission commander versus having to just pick the right assets

08:28.600 --> 08:33.600
or fly them around or manipulate them somewhat physically.

08:34.040 --> 08:36.040
So actually going back to the chess thing,

08:36.040 --> 08:37.880
can you elaborate on what you mean

08:37.880 --> 08:40.280
by playing a game of chess with yourself?

08:40.280 --> 08:42.360
What's, when you're flying that mission,

08:42.360 --> 08:43.760
what exactly do you mean by that?

08:43.760 --> 08:46.120
Well, there's a few people you're usually fighting against

08:46.120 --> 08:48.200
in the air, you know, there's the bad guys

08:48.200 --> 08:52.320
and then there's physics and mother nature, right?

08:52.320 --> 08:56.480
So when we're down at about a hundred feet,

08:56.480 --> 08:58.640
it's a chess game to stay alive for the pilot.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.240
And it's a chess game for the whizzo

09:00.240 --> 09:02.640
to process the information he needs

09:02.640 --> 09:04.880
and then communicate it to all those other aircraft

09:04.880 --> 09:06.440
that we're flying around to ensure

09:06.440 --> 09:08.400
that they're putting their weapons on the right target.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.560
What's the whizzo?

09:09.560 --> 09:11.360
Whizzo is a weapon systems officer.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.600
He's a backseater who is not a pilot,

09:13.600 --> 09:16.040
but they're responsible for radar manipulation

09:16.040 --> 09:19.120
and communications and weapons deployments

09:19.120 --> 09:19.960
of certain natures.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.200
So the chess game is against physics, against the enemy.

09:24.520 --> 09:25.760
Time.

09:25.760 --> 09:26.680
Time.

09:26.680 --> 09:31.160
What about your own psychology, fear, uncertainty?

09:31.160 --> 09:32.000
No.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.360
No, there's no time for that type of self reflection

09:35.360 --> 09:36.240
while we're flying.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.560
I want to get to that,

09:39.560 --> 09:42.000
but I don't want to forget the point that you made

09:42.000 --> 09:45.520
about increased randomness being a tactical advantage.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.960
You know, as we, as you mentioned, you know,

09:47.960 --> 09:49.800
you can introduce autonomy into there.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.960
And when you bring autonomy in there,

09:51.960 --> 09:55.200
and my expectation would be as we bring different abilities

09:55.200 --> 09:57.560
and machine learning, as we gather more data,

09:57.560 --> 10:00.720
we're going to be able to bring the tactical environment

10:00.720 --> 10:03.120
around that jet, the war space that it goes into

10:03.120 --> 10:05.000
will almost be at a stochastic level

10:05.000 --> 10:06.200
from the enemy's perspective,

10:06.200 --> 10:09.320
where it'll almost seem like every tactical environment

10:09.320 --> 10:11.760
that go in will be random and yet very deadly

10:11.760 --> 10:16.760
because the system is providing a new tactical solution,

10:17.160 --> 10:19.040
essentially for that particular scenario,

10:19.040 --> 10:21.960
instead of just training to particular tactics

10:21.960 --> 10:24.920
that have to be repeatable and trainable and lethal, right?

10:24.920 --> 10:26.320
But not necessarily the most lethal

10:26.320 --> 10:28.280
because they have to be trainable.

10:28.280 --> 10:29.960
But if we can introduce AI into that

10:29.960 --> 10:32.840
and to have a level of randomness

10:32.840 --> 10:34.120
or at least the appearance of randomness

10:34.120 --> 10:36.160
due to the complexity, you know,

10:36.160 --> 10:39.200
I would consider it like a stochastic tactical advantage

10:39.200 --> 10:40.640
because even our own blue fighters

10:40.640 --> 10:42.000
wouldn't be able to engage in that fight

10:42.000 --> 10:45.720
because it would be unsafe essentially for anything else.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.600
And I think that's where we have to drive to

10:47.600 --> 10:49.880
because otherwise it's always this chicken and mouse cat game

10:49.880 --> 10:51.960
about who's tactics and who knows what.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.720
But if knowledge is no longer a factor,

10:54.720 --> 10:56.520
it's going to make things a lot different.

10:56.520 --> 10:57.360
That's really interesting.

10:57.360 --> 11:00.040
So out of the many things

11:01.000 --> 11:04.720
that are part of your expertise, your journey,

11:04.720 --> 11:08.320
you're also working on autonomous and semi-autonomous systems,

11:08.320 --> 11:09.680
the use of AI and machine learning

11:09.680 --> 11:12.200
and man-to-man teaming, all that kind of stuff.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.000
We'll talk about it.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.880
But you're saying sort of when people think

11:16.880 --> 11:20.560
about the use of AI in war, in military systems,

11:20.560 --> 11:24.000
they think about like computer vision for perception

11:24.000 --> 11:26.720
or processing of sensor information

11:26.720 --> 11:28.760
in order to extract from it

11:28.800 --> 11:30.560
actionable knowledge kind of thing.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.320
But you're saying you could also use it

11:32.320 --> 11:37.320
to generate randomness that's difficult to work with

11:37.760 --> 11:39.920
in like a game theoretic way.

11:39.920 --> 11:43.560
Like it's difficult for human operators to respond to.

11:43.560 --> 11:44.480
Exactly.

11:44.480 --> 11:45.520
That's really interesting.

11:45.520 --> 11:48.760
Okay, so back to Tom Cruise and Tom Gunn.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.480
What about the dog fighting?

11:51.480 --> 11:53.680
What aspects of that were accurate?

11:53.680 --> 11:58.200
So dog fighting is kind of an interesting conversation

11:58.200 --> 12:01.080
because it's not the most tactically relevant skill set

12:01.080 --> 12:03.720
nowadays by traditional standards

12:03.720 --> 12:06.120
because the ranges with which we engage

12:06.120 --> 12:09.280
and play weapons are very significant.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.880
And so if we're in a scenario

12:10.880 --> 12:12.720
where we're in a dog fight like that,

12:14.040 --> 12:15.600
a lot of things have probably gone wrong.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.920
And that's kind of how this mission was set up.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.880
It was a no-win type scenario most likely.

12:21.720 --> 12:24.080
And so for a dog fight, the aircraft size

12:24.080 --> 12:25.680
and the ranges and the turn radiuses

12:25.680 --> 12:28.040
make it so it's not very theatrical.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.000
The aircraft looks small.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.280
And while it's intense with the systems I have

12:32.280 --> 12:35.160
and the sensors and what I'm feeling and all that,

12:35.160 --> 12:37.240
if I, you know, we've done it and we've done it, right?

12:37.240 --> 12:39.480
We take video of that and it's just like a blue sky

12:39.480 --> 12:40.560
and you see a little dot out there.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.400
So not very interesting.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.680
And so anytime it really looks interesting

12:43.680 --> 12:47.320
in dog fight arena, that's most likely a fiction

12:47.320 --> 12:49.840
because we really only get close for a millisecond

12:49.840 --> 12:51.640
as we're dipping past each other at the merge.

12:51.640 --> 12:52.720
You're breaking my heart, right?

12:52.720 --> 12:53.560
I know.

12:53.560 --> 12:54.400
Breaking my heart.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.240
I'm sorry.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.080
No, I understand.

12:56.080 --> 12:58.360
It's fun, but you know, in a dog fight specifically.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.720
Maybe that was more common in the earlier wars,

13:00.720 --> 13:02.760
the World War II and before that.

13:02.760 --> 13:06.680
Where the, is it due to the sort of the range

13:06.680 --> 13:09.280
and the effectiveness of the weapon systems involved?

13:09.280 --> 13:10.120
Correct.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.720
And the accuracy of the targeting systems at range.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.320
But there's also a train of thought

13:15.320 --> 13:17.000
that hasn't actually been tested out yet,

13:17.000 --> 13:21.640
which is with the advent of advanced electronic warfare,

13:22.360 --> 13:26.560
and, or unmanned assets, the battle space may get

13:26.560 --> 13:30.560
so complex and missiles may essentially just get dropped

13:30.560 --> 13:33.800
out of the sky or wasted such that you're gonna be

13:33.800 --> 13:36.480
in close with either IR missiles or guns.

13:36.480 --> 13:40.880
If it's a no kidding, you know, must defend type scenario.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.840
First of all, what's electronic warfare?

13:42.840 --> 13:44.480
You know, it's basically trying to get control

13:44.480 --> 13:47.560
of electromagnetic spectrum for the interest

13:47.560 --> 13:49.920
of whatever operation is going on.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.480
So in the tactical environment,

13:51.480 --> 13:53.600
a lot of that is trying to deceive the radar

13:53.600 --> 13:55.920
or can we deceive the missile or just, you know,

13:55.920 --> 13:58.840
stop their guidance, things of that nature.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.800
Man, it's a battle in the space of information,

14:01.800 --> 14:03.920
of digital information.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.920
Yeah, well F-22 and F-35, right?

14:05.920 --> 14:07.680
F-22 is a big expensive aircraft

14:07.680 --> 14:10.120
and it was made to be a great fighter.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.360
But the F-35 is not as great of a fighter,

14:12.360 --> 14:14.880
but it's an electronic warfare

14:14.880 --> 14:18.840
and mission commander platform of the future

14:18.840 --> 14:20.840
where information is what's gonna win the war

14:20.840 --> 14:22.200
instead of the best dogfighter.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.080
And so it's interesting dichotomy there.

14:24.080 --> 14:27.440
What's the best airplane ever made, fighter jet ever made?

14:27.440 --> 14:29.520
I know the aviators in the audience

14:29.520 --> 14:32.080
are gonna hate my answer because they're gonna want

14:32.080 --> 14:36.320
that sexy, you know, muscly F-14 Tomcat type fighter

14:36.320 --> 14:39.120
or maybe P-51 type aircraft,

14:39.120 --> 14:43.600
but the F-35 is maybe not the best dogfighter,

14:43.600 --> 14:45.960
but it doesn't have to get in a dogfight, right?

14:45.960 --> 14:47.560
It's like how you'd be the best knife fighters,

14:47.600 --> 14:49.360
not getting a knife fight sometimes.

14:49.360 --> 14:53.920
Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, looks pretty sexy.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.720
There's two real strengths you can have as a fighter.

14:55.720 --> 14:59.280
You can have the ability to kind of out-muscle your fighter,

14:59.280 --> 15:02.520
your opponent and beat them on Gs and power

15:02.520 --> 15:03.880
and raid around on them.

15:03.880 --> 15:05.720
And then there's the other side of that,

15:05.720 --> 15:09.280
which is you can be overly maneuverable.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.080
You can bleed energy quickly.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.160
And that's what the F-18 was good at

15:13.160 --> 15:15.880
because it had to be heavier to land on the aircraft carrier.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.800
You had to give it extra bulk,

15:17.800 --> 15:20.280
but it also needed special mechanisms to slow down

15:20.280 --> 15:21.520
enough to land on aircraft carrier.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.080
And so it made it very maneuverable.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.680
And what that leads to a lot of times,

15:24.680 --> 15:28.520
the ability to get maybe the first shot in a fight,

15:28.520 --> 15:30.680
which is very good, but if you do make that sharp turn,

15:30.680 --> 15:32.240
you're gonna bleed a lot of your energy away

15:32.240 --> 15:34.240
and be more susceptible for follow-on shots

15:34.240 --> 15:35.680
if that one's less susceptible.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.360
And so there's this kind of aggression,

15:37.360 --> 15:38.760
non-aggression game you can play

15:38.760 --> 15:40.920
depending on the type of aircraft you're fighting.

15:40.920 --> 15:43.600
Where does the F-35 land on that spectrum?

15:43.640 --> 15:46.680
The F-35 lands somewhere behind the F-22s.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.560
So there'll probably be a row of F-22s or F-18s,

15:49.560 --> 15:50.960
and F-35 will be out back,

15:50.960 --> 15:52.640
but it'll be enabling a lot of the warfare

15:52.640 --> 15:53.480
that's happening in front of it.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.720
Is it one of the more expensive planes

15:55.720 --> 15:57.320
because of all the stuff on it?

15:57.320 --> 15:58.560
It certainly is, yeah.

16:00.160 --> 16:03.840
In the movie, they have Tom Cruise fly over Mach 10.

16:03.840 --> 16:06.560
So maybe, can you say,

16:06.560 --> 16:09.280
what are the different speeds accelerations feel like?

16:09.280 --> 16:12.360
Mach one, two, three, or hypersonic?

16:12.360 --> 16:14.440
Have you ever flown hypersonic?

16:14.440 --> 16:15.280
No.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.200
How tough does he get?

16:18.200 --> 16:21.120
I'm just gonna call out the BS of ejecting at Mach 10,

16:21.120 --> 16:23.480
just for the record, because in the movie,

16:23.480 --> 16:25.800
there's been, I think, at least one ejection

16:25.800 --> 16:27.520
that was supersonic.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.360
And I'll just say, it was not pretty, but he survived.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.600
So there might have to be some interesting mechanisms

16:32.600 --> 16:34.360
to eject successfully at Mach 10,

16:34.360 --> 16:36.120
but I'll digress on that for the moment.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.520
Yeah, that seemed very strange.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.000
And he just walked away from it.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.240
Anyway, so.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.400
He seemed disheveled.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.560
Okay, it's Tom Cruise.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.800
It's like Chuck Norris or something.

16:47.800 --> 16:48.640
Indestructible, yeah.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.480
Indestructible.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.320
That's what I was an age.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.160
Yeah.

16:51.160 --> 16:54.880
But anyway, so what's interesting to say

16:54.880 --> 16:58.360
about the experience as you go up?

16:58.360 --> 17:00.520
Does it get more and more difficult?

17:00.520 --> 17:02.200
In the end of the day, crossing the sound barrier

17:02.200 --> 17:04.440
is much like crossing the speed limit on the highway.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.160
You don't really notice anything.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.920
To cross that, at least in F-18,

17:08.920 --> 17:11.040
because we have a lot more weight than most fighters,

17:11.080 --> 17:13.120
typically we'll do that in a descent,

17:13.120 --> 17:15.400
and we'll do that full afterburner,

17:15.400 --> 17:17.080
just dumping gas into the engine.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.840
And so that'll get us over the fastest

17:19.840 --> 17:22.280
I think I've gone with, about 1.28.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.600
But what's interesting, people realize,

17:23.600 --> 17:25.600
is that if I take that throttle,

17:25.600 --> 17:28.120
and I'm an afterburner, and I just bring it back,

17:28.120 --> 17:30.080
just bring it back to mil, which is full power,

17:30.080 --> 17:31.680
just not afterburner,

17:31.680 --> 17:34.720
the deceleration is so strong due to the air friction

17:34.720 --> 17:36.680
that it'll throw you forward in your straps.

17:36.680 --> 17:40.280
Almost, I would say, maybe like 70% as strong

17:40.280 --> 17:43.640
almost as trapping on the boat, it's pretty strong.

17:43.640 --> 17:44.960
So it's almost like a reverse car crash

17:44.960 --> 17:45.960
just for the deceleration.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.440
So the acceleration is usually kind of slow,

17:48.440 --> 17:49.600
and you don't feel anything, of course,

17:49.600 --> 17:50.840
when you're crossing through it,

17:50.840 --> 17:53.000
but the deceleration is pretty violent.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.360
The deceleration is violent, huh?

17:55.360 --> 17:56.800
Okay.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.480
But is there a fundamental difference

17:59.480 --> 18:03.440
between Mach 1 and hypersonic Mach 5 and so on?

18:03.440 --> 18:06.000
Does it require super special training?

18:06.000 --> 18:09.760
And is that something that's used often in warfare?

18:10.720 --> 18:13.960
No, so hypersonic human flight, if it exists,

18:13.960 --> 18:16.280
it's not something that's employed tactically

18:16.280 --> 18:19.040
in any sense right now that I'm aware of.

18:19.040 --> 18:23.280
So when I think of hypersonic technology,

18:23.280 --> 18:26.920
I think of missiles and weapon systems and delivery platform.

18:26.920 --> 18:30.080
I don't think of fighter aircraft necessarily.

18:30.080 --> 18:33.720
I can think of bomber or reconnaissance aircraft, perhaps,

18:33.720 --> 18:37.040
but those would be more efficient, very long range.

18:37.040 --> 18:40.360
So I imagine acceleration would be kind of gentle, honestly.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.400
The thing you experience is the acceleration,

18:42.400 --> 18:43.680
not the actual speed.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.560
There's been just a small tangent,

18:46.560 --> 18:49.520
a lot of discussion about hypersonic nuclear weapons,

18:49.520 --> 18:54.360
like missiles from Russia bragging about that.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.760
Is this something that's a significant concern,

18:56.760 --> 18:57.960
or is it just a way to flex

18:57.960 --> 19:00.760
about different kinds of weapon systems?

19:00.760 --> 19:03.560
Hypersonics, I do think, pose a challenge

19:03.560 --> 19:05.520
for our detection systems,

19:05.520 --> 19:10.240
because there are design considerations

19:10.240 --> 19:12.280
in these sensor systems, as always.

19:12.280 --> 19:14.560
When you build them and the technology progresses

19:14.560 --> 19:16.120
to a point where maybe it's not feasible

19:16.120 --> 19:18.080
to use that technology, there's a problem.

19:18.080 --> 19:22.320
But with the all-domain and kind of cross-domain

19:22.320 --> 19:24.280
data-linking capabilities we have,

19:27.520 --> 19:30.240
it's more of an integrated picture, I'll say.

19:30.240 --> 19:34.360
And so the hypersonics are really,

19:35.160 --> 19:36.960
how fast can we detect and destroy a problem?

19:36.960 --> 19:39.080
And you're just shortening the time available to do that.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.440
We call something like that the kill chain.

19:41.440 --> 19:45.000
It's from locating a target and identifying it,

19:45.000 --> 19:48.240
and essentially authorizing its destruction

19:48.240 --> 19:50.480
by whatever means, employing,

19:50.480 --> 19:52.360
and then actually following up to ensure

19:52.360 --> 19:54.320
that you did what you said you were going to do

19:54.320 --> 19:55.160
in some sense, right?

19:55.160 --> 19:57.360
Does it need another re-attack, something of that nature?

19:57.360 --> 20:00.400
And so there's an old dogfighting framework

20:00.400 --> 20:01.240
you could call it.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.920
It's called the OODA loop that kind of made its way

20:02.920 --> 20:04.480
in the engineering of business now,

20:04.480 --> 20:06.800
but the old observe, orientate, decide act

20:06.800 --> 20:09.360
was initially a fighter mechanism

20:09.360 --> 20:11.400
in order to get inside that kill chain

20:11.400 --> 20:12.840
of your opponent and break it up

20:12.840 --> 20:17.240
so that he can't process his kill chain on you.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.800
And so hypersonics are a way of shortening those windows

20:19.800 --> 20:23.280
of opportunity to react to that.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.920
I wondered how much do you have to shorten it

20:25.920 --> 20:29.280
in order for the defense systems not to work anymore?

20:29.280 --> 20:31.680
It seems like it's very, you know,

20:31.680 --> 20:36.680
I'm both often horrified by the thought of nuclear war,

20:37.160 --> 20:41.880
but at the same time wonder what that looks like.

20:42.800 --> 20:46.120
When I dream of extreme competence in defense systems,

20:46.120 --> 20:49.120
I imagine that not a single nuclear weapon

20:49.120 --> 20:51.600
can reach the United States by missile,

20:51.600 --> 20:54.760
with the defense systems, defense systems.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.960
But then again, I also understand that

20:56.960 --> 20:59.000
these are extremely complicated systems.

20:59.840 --> 21:02.080
I mean, you know, there's a lot of different ways

21:02.080 --> 21:04.480
to do this, but I don't think there's any

21:04.480 --> 21:06.480
of the amount of integration required.

21:06.480 --> 21:09.280
And because you're not using them,

21:09.280 --> 21:12.800
I mean, there could be, you know,

21:12.800 --> 21:14.600
there's like an intern somewhere

21:14.600 --> 21:17.520
that like forgot to update the code,

21:17.520 --> 21:20.720
the Fortran code that like is going to make the different,

21:20.720 --> 21:22.360
because you don't have the opportunity

21:22.360 --> 21:27.360
to really thoroughly test, which is really scary.

21:27.360 --> 21:32.360
I mean, I guess in an actual attack, I wonder.

21:32.880 --> 21:35.120
I guess one assumption there would be

21:35.120 --> 21:37.800
that these hypersonic missiles would only be launched

21:37.800 --> 21:39.920
and the case would attack.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.960
It'd be interesting if there were other hypersonic objects

21:41.960 --> 21:44.840
that we could use to flex those systems.

21:44.840 --> 21:46.320
Another thing that actually happened,

21:46.320 --> 21:48.240
I just have a million questions I want to ask you,

21:48.240 --> 21:51.600
it's fascinating to me, is there's a bird strike

21:51.600 --> 21:53.720
on the plane, does that happen often?

21:53.720 --> 21:54.560
Yeah, it's a serious issue.

21:54.560 --> 21:56.800
They damaged the engine and they made it seem

21:56.800 --> 21:59.240
like it's a serious, exactly a serious issue.

21:59.240 --> 22:03.200
I've hit birds, I know someone that took a turkey vulture

22:03.200 --> 22:05.880
to the face through the cockpit, right?

22:05.880 --> 22:08.600
Shattered the cockpit, knocked them out.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.680
I think that it actually, I don't know personally

22:10.680 --> 22:12.960
about the story, I know from the command I was at

22:12.960 --> 22:15.560
and I believe the back seater had to punch out

22:15.560 --> 22:17.520
and punch them both out because he was unconscious,

22:17.520 --> 22:20.080
you know, in the front seat from the bird.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.280
It can kill you from hitting you.

22:21.280 --> 22:24.280
It's like a bowling ball going 250 miles an hour.

22:24.600 --> 22:29.600
It can take out an engine very easily.

22:30.440 --> 22:32.880
Every airport I've flown at in the Navy,

22:32.880 --> 22:36.080
I've had to check the bird condition, if you will,

22:36.080 --> 22:38.520
to see how many birds, we've had to cancel flights

22:38.520 --> 22:40.800
because there's too many of them around the airport.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.200
Some airports even have bird radars, military airports.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.920
Is there systems that monitor the bird condition?

22:45.920 --> 22:46.880
There is, yeah.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.160
There's actual radar systems and you can go

22:49.160 --> 22:51.600
in the certain bases, you have to call up

22:51.600 --> 22:52.920
and they'll tell you what it is for the day

22:52.920 --> 22:54.560
or for that hour and other ones have it

22:54.560 --> 22:58.800
in like their weather report that goes out over the radio.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.920
What are some technological solutions to this?

23:00.920 --> 23:05.920
Or is this just because it's a low probability event,

23:06.080 --> 23:07.920
there's no real solution for it?

23:07.920 --> 23:10.040
I would say it's not a low probability event.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.360
I mean, this is happening a lot.

23:11.360 --> 23:13.160
I mean, although the hits themselves

23:13.160 --> 23:15.360
aren't necessarily that common, or I'll say

23:15.360 --> 23:18.800
a catastrophic hit, either a near miss or a hit

23:18.800 --> 23:21.880
or the pilot having to actively maneuver to avoid it

23:21.880 --> 23:23.040
is pretty common.

23:23.040 --> 23:23.880
And in fact-

23:23.880 --> 23:24.720
It seems stressful.

23:24.720 --> 23:26.480
It is, it's so common in fact that we know

23:26.480 --> 23:28.240
that you never wanna try to go over,

23:28.240 --> 23:29.720
or you never wanna go under a bird

23:29.720 --> 23:31.120
if you see it in front of you.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.240
You always wanna try to go over it

23:32.240 --> 23:34.160
because what they'll do immediately if they see you

23:34.160 --> 23:36.680
is and you startle them, they'll bring their wings in

23:36.680 --> 23:39.040
and just drop straight down to try to get out of the path.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.600
It's interesting, I didn't know they did that.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.280
But so if you immediately, if you try to go under them,

23:43.280 --> 23:44.240
they're gonna be dropping into you.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.840
So you typically wanna try to go above them.

23:45.840 --> 23:48.000
Is this something you can train for or no?

23:49.080 --> 23:50.960
Is this one of those things you have to really experience?

23:50.960 --> 23:55.160
It's a skillset that you somewhat train for

23:55.160 --> 23:57.560
in the duties of being a fighter pilot in a sense, right?

23:57.560 --> 23:59.560
Being able to react to your environment very quickly

23:59.560 --> 24:01.680
and make decisions quickly, so.

24:01.680 --> 24:04.440
Is that one of the more absurd things,

24:04.440 --> 24:06.720
challenges you have to deal with in flying?

24:06.720 --> 24:10.720
Is there other things, sort of maybe weather conditions,

24:10.720 --> 24:11.880
like harsh weather conditions,

24:11.880 --> 24:14.640
is there something that we maybe don't often think about

24:14.640 --> 24:17.200
in terms of the challenges of flying?

24:17.200 --> 24:20.480
Birds, in a way, aren't a ridiculous threat for us.

24:20.760 --> 24:24.080
It's a safety threat that,

24:24.080 --> 24:26.040
anything physical in the air is something

24:26.040 --> 24:27.400
that we really have to be careful about,

24:27.400 --> 24:29.480
whether we're flying formation off of the aircraft

24:29.480 --> 24:32.240
right next to us, or whether it's a turkey vulture

24:32.240 --> 24:35.480
at 2,000 feet or a flock of 5,000 birds

24:35.480 --> 24:37.600
at the runway and we have to wave off.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.720
And although they're low probability,

24:39.720 --> 24:41.120
a lot of bases will have

24:41.120 --> 24:44.160
actual environmental protecting agency employees

24:44.160 --> 24:47.680
that are responsible for safely removing migratory birds

24:47.680 --> 24:51.480
or different animals that may be in the runways

24:51.480 --> 24:53.240
or flying about.

24:53.240 --> 24:55.200
Wow, I didn't know what a turkey vulture is

24:55.200 --> 24:57.000
and it really does look like a mix

24:57.000 --> 24:58.560
between a vulture and a turkey.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.080
Yeah, they're huge.

25:00.080 --> 25:03.160
And look kind of dumb, no offense to turkey vultures.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.320
In that movie, who was the enemy nation?

25:10.320 --> 25:15.000
Was it, I mean, I guess they were implying it's Iran,

25:15.000 --> 25:16.960
or was it Russia?

25:17.040 --> 25:18.120
I didn't think they were implying

25:18.120 --> 25:19.960
any particular nation state, frankly.

25:19.960 --> 25:22.000
I think they did a somewhat decent job

25:22.000 --> 25:26.200
of having some ambiguous fifth generation fighters,

25:27.720 --> 25:30.360
the location and the stockpile.

25:30.360 --> 25:31.880
Like I get like how the story

25:31.880 --> 25:33.240
kind of insinuates certain things,

25:33.240 --> 25:34.280
but they seemed to do a good job

25:34.280 --> 25:36.800
of not having anything directly pointing to another nation,

25:36.800 --> 25:38.880
which I thought was the good move.

25:38.880 --> 25:42.080
I enjoy these type of movies as an aviator

25:42.080 --> 25:44.320
and as an American, right?

25:44.320 --> 25:45.520
Because it's a feel good movie,

25:45.520 --> 25:49.000
but we shouldn't be celebrating going to war

25:49.000 --> 25:50.840
with any particular country,

25:50.840 --> 25:52.800
China, Russia, whoever may have these weapons.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.000
It's fun to watch,

25:54.000 --> 25:55.640
but it would be an incredibly serious event

25:55.640 --> 25:57.880
to be employing these weapons.

25:57.880 --> 26:01.080
Yeah, and we'll talk about war in general,

26:01.080 --> 26:04.760
because yeah, the movie is kind of celebrating

26:04.760 --> 26:07.040
the human side of things

26:07.040 --> 26:08.960
and also the incredible technology involved,

26:08.960 --> 26:12.440
but there's also the cost of war

26:12.560 --> 26:13.880
and the seriousness of war

26:13.880 --> 26:16.080
and the suffering involved with war,

26:16.080 --> 26:17.160
not just in the fighting,

26:17.160 --> 26:18.680
but in the death of civilians

26:18.680 --> 26:20.240
and all those kinds of things.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.880
Well, you were a Navy pilot.

26:23.880 --> 26:26.840
Let's talk a little bit more seriously about this.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.840
And you were twice deployed in the Middle East,

26:28.840 --> 26:32.080
flying the FAA-18F Super Hornet.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.520
Can you briefly tell the story

26:33.520 --> 26:35.480
of your career as a Navy pilot?

26:35.480 --> 26:36.320
Sure.

26:36.320 --> 26:40.040
So I joined the Navy in 2009, right after college.

26:40.040 --> 26:41.920
I went to officer,

26:41.920 --> 26:42.960
essentially the officer boot camp,

26:42.960 --> 26:44.280
officer Canada school.

26:44.280 --> 26:47.280
I applied as a pilot and I got in as a pilot.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.880
That was the advantage of going that way

26:48.880 --> 26:50.680
is that I could essentially choose what I wanted.

26:50.680 --> 26:51.760
And if I got in, great.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.520
If not, I didn't get stuck doing something else.

26:54.520 --> 26:55.960
So you knew you wanted to be a pilot.

26:55.960 --> 26:57.360
I did.

26:57.360 --> 26:59.320
I joined, I went through my initial training.

26:59.320 --> 27:01.120
I went through primary flight training

27:01.120 --> 27:02.920
that all aviators go through.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.480
And I did well enough that,

27:06.000 --> 27:08.880
one of the first lessons I teach you in the Navy is that,

27:09.040 --> 27:10.280
you can have a great career in the Navy

27:10.280 --> 27:13.040
and you can see the world and do what you want.

27:13.040 --> 27:13.880
But at the end of the day,

27:13.880 --> 27:15.600
it's all about the needs of the Navy and what they need.

27:15.600 --> 27:18.120
So, they may not have the platform you like,

27:18.120 --> 27:19.400
or you may not necessarily get

27:19.400 --> 27:21.640
to choose your own adventure here.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.880
But I was lucky enough that there was one jet slot

27:24.880 --> 27:27.400
in my class and I was lucky enough, fortunate enough

27:27.400 --> 27:28.240
to get it.

27:28.240 --> 27:29.600
It was a jet slot.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.160
So yeah, what that means is that I was assigned

27:32.160 --> 27:33.720
actually a tail hook at that point,

27:33.720 --> 27:36.440
which meant I would go trained to fly aircraft

27:36.440 --> 27:38.520
that land on aircraft carriers.

27:39.160 --> 27:41.800
And there's essentially three aircraft that do that

27:41.800 --> 27:46.800
at the time is the F-18 and the E-2 and the C-2.

27:48.760 --> 27:51.000
C-2 is kind of like the mail truck for the boat.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.160
E-2 is one of the big radar addition on top.

27:54.160 --> 27:55.640
And then there's all the F-18s.

27:55.640 --> 27:59.440
So E-2's comms is C-2 mail truck?

27:59.440 --> 28:00.280
Yeah.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.120
What's that?

28:01.120 --> 28:02.520
C-2 basically brings all the mail.

28:02.520 --> 28:05.000
They pack on the shore and they're the ones

28:05.000 --> 28:07.400
that bring supplies to the ship via air and people.

28:07.400 --> 28:08.360
Sorry if I missed it.

28:08.360 --> 28:09.960
Is it a plane or is it a helicopter?

28:09.960 --> 28:10.800
It's a plane.

28:10.800 --> 28:11.920
Okay.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.840
All right, and the F-18 is a fighter jet.

28:13.840 --> 28:14.680
Correct.

28:14.680 --> 28:15.500
Okay.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.600
So I select a tail hook, which meant I could get

28:17.600 --> 28:20.120
one of those other ones, but 80% of them or so are jets.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.840
So I was in a good spot at that point.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.520
And that's when I went to Merdy, Mississippi

28:23.520 --> 28:28.120
to fly my first jet, which was the T-45 Goss Hawk.

28:28.120 --> 28:28.960
Cool.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.200
So what kind of plane is that?

28:30.200 --> 28:33.200
Is that what you were doing your training on?

28:33.200 --> 28:34.840
That's the jet aircraft you get in

28:34.840 --> 28:36.920
before you actually go to the F-18.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.560
It is carrier capable.

28:39.560 --> 28:42.600
So go to the boat for the first time in it during the day,

28:42.600 --> 28:45.680
drop fake bombs, do dog fighting,

28:47.280 --> 28:50.520
low levels, formation flying day and night.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.320
Well, it's a pretty plane.

28:52.320 --> 28:54.720
Yeah, and it looks like a cone so that no one hits it.

28:54.720 --> 28:58.400
Okay, so it's usually not used for fighting.

28:58.400 --> 28:59.440
It's used for training?

28:59.440 --> 29:01.000
It's used for training how to fight.

29:01.000 --> 29:01.920
Got it.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.120
So what was that like?

29:03.120 --> 29:04.860
Was that the first time you were sort of

29:04.860 --> 29:06.240
really getting into it?

29:06.240 --> 29:07.320
Yeah, that was really interesting

29:08.240 --> 29:10.360
because before that it was a 600 horsepower prop plane.

29:10.360 --> 29:13.600
Going from that to the T-45 is one of the biggest jumps

29:13.600 --> 29:17.560
in power and like Navy machine operation.

29:17.560 --> 29:21.120
How much horsepower does the T-45 have approximately?

29:21.120 --> 29:23.040
Yeah, like 15,000 or so.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.280
So it's a huge jump from 600, you said,

29:25.280 --> 29:26.720
horsepower about, cool.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.520
So it's a big, big leap.

29:28.520 --> 29:31.240
But it's a jet, so it performs differently.

29:31.240 --> 29:32.360
It's faster.

29:32.360 --> 29:34.280
What that means, not just because it's faster,

29:34.280 --> 29:35.440
your whole mind needs to be faster.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.280
Everything happens faster in the air now.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.040
Those comms happen faster.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.360
Your landing gear has to come up faster.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.920
Everything just happens faster in a jet.

29:42.920 --> 29:44.560
And so it's a big jump.

29:44.560 --> 29:47.480
And I'll never forget going on my first flight

29:47.480 --> 29:48.620
in that aircraft.

29:49.820 --> 29:52.400
It was a formation flight for someone else

29:52.400 --> 29:54.080
and I was just in the back watching

29:54.080 --> 29:55.720
and there was an instructor in the flight.

29:55.720 --> 29:57.880
And so what that means is the instructor

29:57.880 --> 29:58.920
is in a single aircraft

29:58.920 --> 30:00.720
and then there's three or four other aircraft

30:00.720 --> 30:02.480
and they're learning how to do joins

30:02.480 --> 30:04.560
and they're learning how to fly in formation.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.680
And as a new student in the back, it's amazing, right?

30:07.280 --> 30:08.920
Photo op time and all this.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.720
I'm seeing aircraft up close for the first time.

30:10.720 --> 30:11.560
It's awesome.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.720
And on the way back,

30:15.760 --> 30:19.280
we couldn't get our landing gear down, ironically.

30:19.280 --> 30:22.200
So to make a long story short,

30:22.200 --> 30:24.040
because it's overall not that exciting,

30:24.040 --> 30:25.040
we couldn't get the gear down.

30:25.040 --> 30:28.000
We actually went to go do a control ejection

30:28.000 --> 30:29.920
to the target area where that is,

30:29.920 --> 30:32.880
about 15, 20 miles to the north of the base.

30:32.880 --> 30:35.560
Wait, did you just say that's not that exciting?

30:36.440 --> 30:38.240
Because that to me is pretty exciting.

30:40.080 --> 30:44.040
First of all, that must be terrifying

30:44.040 --> 30:45.680
early on in your careers.

30:45.680 --> 30:47.080
I haven't seen those things.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.040
How often does that kind of thing happen?

30:53.280 --> 30:54.480
More than you would think.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.320
More than you would think.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.080
So there was no significant panic?

30:57.080 --> 30:58.640
This is like misunderstood?

30:58.640 --> 31:00.560
This is what has to be done in this case?

31:00.560 --> 31:02.400
I think I was probably just too dumb

31:02.400 --> 31:03.880
to realize the significance of it

31:03.920 --> 31:05.440
because as a new student,

31:05.440 --> 31:08.160
not really appreciating just what is ahead of me

31:08.160 --> 31:09.200
if we are ejecting.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.120
But at the time, it was just like rote, right?

31:12.120 --> 31:12.960
Because I was back there

31:12.960 --> 31:14.600
and then I went from an observer mode

31:14.600 --> 31:17.520
to a I'm gonna provide you the help that I can provide you

31:17.520 --> 31:19.640
as a member of this crew mode.

31:19.640 --> 31:23.480
And so it was less about on this 20 mile trip

31:23.480 --> 31:26.880
and thinking about how vulnerable I am.

31:26.880 --> 31:27.840
We're going through checklists,

31:27.840 --> 31:29.480
we're talking to people, we're getting ready.

31:29.480 --> 31:32.160
So no, it wasn't fearful.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.760
And the whole time we were doing one of these,

31:34.600 --> 31:36.080
we were trying to get the gear down.

31:36.080 --> 31:38.320
So we're unloading the jet and then loading it back

31:38.320 --> 31:41.080
to try to get the gear out with the stick.

31:41.080 --> 31:43.480
And it came down.

31:43.480 --> 31:47.360
It came down halfway there, just on its own.

31:47.360 --> 31:50.320
So it came back around and we did like a safety trap

31:50.320 --> 31:52.240
in case there was a problem with the gear.

31:52.240 --> 31:53.840
And that was my first flight.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.040
A little bit of serendipity,

31:56.040 --> 31:57.800
but I'm gonna fast forward a bit.

31:57.800 --> 32:00.320
And I went back to the squadron as an instructor

32:00.320 --> 32:02.280
about five or six years later.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.760
And I was an aviation safety officer at this point,

32:04.760 --> 32:08.360
which meant I was responsible for investigating mishaps.

32:08.360 --> 32:13.200
And a student went in and he went in the backseat

32:13.200 --> 32:17.000
of a form flight, just like the one I went on.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.200
And he went out and he ended up ejecting on that flight.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.920
Zach, same type of flight.

32:21.920 --> 32:25.040
They went out and they had a runaway trim scenario.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.280
And it caused the aircraft essentially just inverted itself

32:27.280 --> 32:31.520
almost 180 degrees at about 600 feet over the ground.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.720
And they punched out just slightly outside

32:33.720 --> 32:36.320
the ejection window at about 300 or 400 feet or so,

32:36.320 --> 32:38.160
but they were completely fine.

32:40.360 --> 32:43.320
And then about two months later, we had another ejection.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.280
About three months after that, we had another ejection.

32:45.280 --> 32:50.040
So unfortunately, it can be more common than people think.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.440
What does it feel like to get ejected?

32:52.440 --> 32:53.720
Thankfully, I don't know.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.200
I can describe it to you.

32:55.200 --> 32:58.000
I can tell you what it's like from what I've heard,

32:58.000 --> 32:59.560
but I truly think it's one of those things

32:59.600 --> 33:02.480
that you just don't understand until it happens.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.280
It's like instantaneous about 250 Gs,

33:05.280 --> 33:08.000
which is only possible because of inertia in our blood.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.160
So you can actually get like 250, 300 Gs

33:10.160 --> 33:11.520
for like a few milliseconds.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.200
And then it backs off to like 40 or 50 Gs

33:14.200 --> 33:16.480
to get you away from the vehicle itself.

33:16.480 --> 33:20.320
And so, you may lose consciousness.

33:20.320 --> 33:23.520
If you do, who knows where you wake up?

33:24.440 --> 33:26.800
You could be in a tree, you could still be falling.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.160
You can be in the water.

33:28.160 --> 33:31.880
The physics of that is fascinating, how to eject safely.

33:31.880 --> 33:34.920
Do you know the story about how that was tested at all?

33:34.920 --> 33:36.880
I don't know the full story, but there was an airport-

33:36.880 --> 33:39.080
I'm guessing nobody knows the full story.

33:39.080 --> 33:41.520
It's probably a lot of shady stuff going on.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.440
But anyway, you mean like in the early, early days or-

33:44.440 --> 33:46.840
They took a flight dock up to a rocket sled

33:46.840 --> 33:49.200
and just see how much their body could take it.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.520
And he turned a lot of his body into mush

33:51.520 --> 33:53.600
in the process of getting that science done,

33:53.600 --> 33:55.760
but he saved a lot of lives.

33:55.760 --> 33:59.000
People used to be tougher back in the day.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.800
That's how science used to be done.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.880
So how did your training continue?

34:05.880 --> 34:08.760
So take me farther through your career

34:10.280 --> 34:13.360
as you worked towards graduating towards the F-18s.

34:13.360 --> 34:16.880
So in VT9, where I was a student, there's two phases.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.560
There's an intermediate and an advanced.

34:19.560 --> 34:22.240
Intermediate is getting very comfortable with the aircraft.

34:22.240 --> 34:23.920
And at that point, you truly hear,

34:23.920 --> 34:25.440
all right, you're going jets now,

34:26.120 --> 34:28.040
or you're going to go one of the other aircraft

34:28.040 --> 34:30.240
that land on the aircraft carrier.

34:30.240 --> 34:33.040
I was told I was going jets at that point.

34:33.040 --> 34:36.240
And then we go into same squadron, same aircraft,

34:36.240 --> 34:38.000
same instructors, but it's called advanced now.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.320
And now we're learning how to dogfight for the first time.

34:41.320 --> 34:44.360
We're doing what we call tactical formation,

34:44.360 --> 34:46.960
which is just like aggressive position-keeping.

34:48.200 --> 34:52.280
We are doing dogfighting in low levels

34:52.280 --> 34:53.360
and all sorts of great stuff.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.080
So it's really that first introduction

34:55.720 --> 34:56.560
to that tactical environment

34:56.560 --> 34:58.440
and really putting Gs on the jet

34:58.440 --> 35:00.280
and on your body and maneuvering.

35:00.280 --> 35:02.120
Is there like tactical formation,

35:02.120 --> 35:05.080
is collaborating with other fighter jets a part of that?

35:05.080 --> 35:05.920
It is.

35:05.920 --> 35:08.440
So flying, that's what you mean by formation.

35:08.440 --> 35:11.120
So literally having an awareness.

35:11.120 --> 35:13.600
Is this done for you or are you as a human

35:13.600 --> 35:18.280
supposed to understand like where you are in the formation,

35:18.280 --> 35:20.560
how to maintain formation, all that kind of stuff?

35:20.560 --> 35:21.400
Yeah, this is-

35:21.400 --> 35:23.080
Is it done autonomously or manually?

35:23.080 --> 35:24.520
There's a great autonomy point

35:24.520 --> 35:26.040
on the end of this I've thought about.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.400
But what we do, it's all manual.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.240
So I'm looking at his wing

35:29.240 --> 35:33.120
and I'm looking at different visual checkpoints

35:33.120 --> 35:34.680
that form like a triangle,

35:34.680 --> 35:36.360
like an equal-level triangle essentially.

35:36.360 --> 35:39.680
And then as that triangle is no longer equal,

35:39.680 --> 35:42.440
I can tell my relative position against that aircraft.

35:42.440 --> 35:43.440
That's really cool.

35:43.440 --> 35:44.800
And so that's what I'm staring at

35:44.800 --> 35:47.880
for sometimes hours on end, several feet away,

35:47.880 --> 35:50.640
doing one of these if I'm in the weather, that's all it is.

35:50.640 --> 35:52.960
So you get, it's almost like, is it peripheral vision

35:53.800 --> 35:54.640
or is it your focal range?

35:54.640 --> 35:55.480
No, we're staring directly at it.

35:55.480 --> 35:56.320
The peripheral is going on my-

35:56.320 --> 35:58.680
That's interesting.

35:58.680 --> 35:59.520
Stuff, right?

35:59.520 --> 36:01.200
My sensors and all my instruments.

36:01.200 --> 36:04.240
And so he is my gyroscope at that point, right?

36:04.240 --> 36:06.680
While you're flying, not looking straight.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.640
Correct, I'm flying like this for hours.

36:08.640 --> 36:09.720
It can hurt your neck.

36:09.720 --> 36:11.320
We don't like doing this as much.

36:11.320 --> 36:13.040
And I don't think it's just me, right?

36:13.040 --> 36:14.840
It's a weird thing where when you're like this,

36:14.840 --> 36:18.480
it's actually harder to fly formation slightly than here

36:18.480 --> 36:21.720
because being in line of your hand movements

36:21.720 --> 36:24.640
and of the aircraft somehow has an effect

36:24.640 --> 36:27.000
on our ability to be more precise and comfortable.

36:27.000 --> 36:27.840
It's strange.

36:28.840 --> 36:32.400
So there's a symmetry to the formation usually.

36:32.400 --> 36:34.440
So one of the people on the other side

36:34.440 --> 36:37.000
really don't like being on that side.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.480
Is it, who gets like the short straw?

36:40.480 --> 36:43.160
How do you decide which side of the formation you are?

36:43.160 --> 36:44.000
It's a good question too

36:44.000 --> 36:46.240
because there's kind of rank in some sense.

36:46.240 --> 36:49.400
So if it's a four person formation, right?

36:49.400 --> 36:51.160
You have the division lead who's qualified

36:51.160 --> 36:53.200
to lead a whole division, but maybe the other ones aren't.

36:53.200 --> 36:56.600
And he has a dash two and that's his wingman essentially.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.640
And then in a division, there's two other aircraft.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.640
And then you have another senior flight leader.

37:00.640 --> 37:02.360
That's the dash three position.

37:02.360 --> 37:05.120
And then you have dash four, the last one.

37:05.120 --> 37:06.880
And if you were all lined up on one side,

37:06.880 --> 37:08.880
like fingertip one, two, three, four,

37:08.880 --> 37:10.880
that dash four guy is gonna be at the end of that whip.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.520
So if you're flying formation,

37:12.520 --> 37:15.440
each one's making movements relative to the lead,

37:15.440 --> 37:19.240
dash four is kind of at the end of that error.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.120
So his movements are kind of like a whip.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.280
It's very difficult to fly in that position in close.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.040
Can you elaborate, is it because of the error,

37:25.040 --> 37:25.880
the error dynamics?

37:25.880 --> 37:26.840
So what's a whip?

37:26.840 --> 37:28.920
If this is a flight lead and this is dash two,

37:28.920 --> 37:30.920
flight lead is rock steady and just doing his thing.

37:30.920 --> 37:32.760
And flight two is gonna be working that triangle,

37:32.760 --> 37:33.920
moving a little bit, right?

37:33.920 --> 37:35.800
And he has this small error bubble

37:35.800 --> 37:37.360
that he's doing his best to stay.

37:37.360 --> 37:39.200
And then, but dash three is flying off dash two.

37:39.200 --> 37:42.840
And so his error bubble is dash two plus his own.

37:42.840 --> 37:43.680
And dash four.

37:43.680 --> 37:44.720
So it gets more and more stressful

37:44.720 --> 37:46.800
as you get further out.

37:46.800 --> 37:49.560
Okay, what's the experience of that

37:49.560 --> 37:52.160
staring for long periods of time

37:52.160 --> 37:54.800
and trying to maintain formation?

37:54.800 --> 37:56.280
How stressful is that?

37:56.280 --> 37:59.800
Because like, you know, we're doing that when we drive,

37:59.800 --> 38:01.640
staying in lane.

38:01.640 --> 38:05.040
And that becomes, after you get pretty good at it,

38:05.040 --> 38:07.720
it becomes somewhat, it's still stressful.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.720
Which actually is surprisingly stressful.

38:10.720 --> 38:13.120
When you look at like lane keeping systems,

38:13.120 --> 38:15.240
they actually relieve that stress somehow

38:15.280 --> 38:18.520
and it's actually creates a much more pleasant experience

38:18.520 --> 38:20.880
while you're still able to maintain situational awareness

38:20.880 --> 38:24.000
and like stay awake, which is really interesting.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.320
Like, I don't think people realize how stressful it is

38:26.320 --> 38:29.040
to lane keep when they drive.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.080
So this is even more stressful.

38:31.080 --> 38:34.880
So are you, do you think about that?

38:34.880 --> 38:37.360
Or is this, yeah, I guess how stressful is it

38:37.360 --> 38:39.280
from a psychology perspective?

38:39.280 --> 38:40.840
It's very stressful.

38:40.840 --> 38:43.640
When, so I taught students how to do this as well.

38:43.640 --> 38:46.120
And so at our feet, we have two rudders.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.920
And if I'm flying off of a flight lead over here,

38:48.920 --> 38:51.560
what you'll find a lot of times is you'll be flying,

38:51.560 --> 38:53.480
like if I'm the instructor and the student's flying,

38:53.480 --> 38:55.160
I'll start to notice that he's having a harder

38:55.160 --> 38:57.000
and harder time keeping position.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.880
What I'll notice typically is he's locked out his leg.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.800
They'll lock out the leg that's closest

39:01.800 --> 39:03.800
to the aircraft they're flying against

39:03.800 --> 39:06.080
and push on the rudder subconsciously

39:06.080 --> 39:07.240
because their whole body is trying to get away

39:07.240 --> 39:08.760
from the aircraft because they're so uncomfortable

39:08.760 --> 39:09.960
being close to it.

39:09.960 --> 39:12.280
And so I'll tell them, I can fix their form

39:12.280 --> 39:13.160
with just a couple of words.

39:13.640 --> 39:14.920
And they'll say, wiggle your toes.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.520
And they'll wiggle their toes and they'll real,

39:16.520 --> 39:18.160
and they'll loosen all the muscles in their legs

39:18.160 --> 39:19.840
because they realize they've been locked up

39:19.840 --> 39:22.440
and their formation flying will get a lot better.

39:22.440 --> 39:25.960
And so, there's a lot of stress associated with that.

39:25.960 --> 39:30.960
There's some interesting psychological or visual issues

39:32.240 --> 39:35.320
such as vertigo as you're flying.

39:35.320 --> 39:36.840
So if you're flying with him

39:36.840 --> 39:38.760
and then you fly right into a cloud, right?

39:38.760 --> 39:40.120
That's when it's very stressful because you have

39:40.120 --> 39:42.120
to be very close in order to maintain visual

39:42.120 --> 39:44.440
and you might be on a thunderstorm, right?

39:44.440 --> 39:45.640
And so you have to be very tight.

39:45.640 --> 39:48.480
You might start raining and then he's turning

39:48.480 --> 39:50.480
but you might not even know that.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.400
You might not even be able to see that turn.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.160
And so all of a sudden you might look

39:54.160 --> 39:56.120
while you're in a turn thinking you were straight and level

39:56.120 --> 39:58.800
and you look just maybe back at your instruments very quick

39:58.800 --> 40:01.040
and you realize you're like in a 30 degree turn

40:01.040 --> 40:03.960
and your whole concept of where you are in the world

40:03.960 --> 40:05.320
starts getting very confused.

40:05.320 --> 40:09.760
And you immediately get this sense of, it's weird.

40:09.760 --> 40:12.000
Like I look at the HUD and it feels,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.200
all my sense are telling me it's spinning, but it's not.

40:14.200 --> 40:15.800
And so I have to trust my instruments

40:15.800 --> 40:17.040
even though it feels like it's spinning.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.760
And the same thing can happen

40:18.760 --> 40:20.440
when you're flying formation off of someone

40:20.440 --> 40:25.040
and it can be very dangerous and disorientating.

40:25.040 --> 40:29.000
But the point is to try to regain awareness

40:29.000 --> 40:30.240
by trusting the instruments.

40:30.240 --> 40:33.840
Like distrust all your human senses

40:33.840 --> 40:35.040
and just use the instruments

40:35.040 --> 40:37.560
to rebuild situational awareness.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.040
Not in this particular case

40:39.040 --> 40:41.640
because our situational awareness is based,

40:41.640 --> 40:43.280
it's predicated off of our flight lead.

40:43.280 --> 40:45.520
So in a sense, I'm just trusting his movements.

40:45.520 --> 40:47.520
And so he's my gyroscope, but you're absolutely right.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.760
And if I was by myself, I would trust my instruments

40:49.760 --> 40:52.160
but I can't just stop flying form and trust my instruments

40:52.160 --> 40:53.000
because now I'm gonna hit him.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.440
Oh yeah, you have to pay attention to him.

40:54.440 --> 40:56.080
So he's my reference.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.680
So the instruments are not helping you significantly

40:58.680 --> 41:00.600
with his positioning.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.560
It's all completely manual.

41:02.560 --> 41:06.160
So is there a future where some of that is autonomous?

41:06.160 --> 41:10.240
Yeah, and I've thought about automating that flight regime.

41:10.240 --> 41:12.000
But when I started thinking about it,

41:12.000 --> 41:16.440
I realized that all the formation keeping that we do

41:16.440 --> 41:20.600
is designed to enhance the aviators

41:22.200 --> 41:23.800
ability to maintain sight, right?

41:23.800 --> 41:26.360
So we fly very tight formation so that we can go in weather

41:26.360 --> 41:30.480
and to reduce groups of traffic coming into the boat.

41:30.480 --> 41:33.160
We fly in one particular position

41:33.160 --> 41:36.920
so that all of the flight crew can look down the line

41:36.920 --> 41:38.160
and see the flight lead.

41:38.160 --> 41:43.040
So everything has to do with the two air crew

41:43.040 --> 41:45.040
visually maintaining sight of each other

41:45.040 --> 41:47.040
and defending each other, right?

41:47.040 --> 41:49.680
In a combat spread, I might be looking,

41:49.680 --> 41:51.000
I might be three miles away from him

41:51.000 --> 41:53.040
flying formation directly beam

41:53.040 --> 41:55.200
and looking around him to make sure nothing's there.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.400
So as I was looking into automating this process,

41:57.400 --> 42:01.880
I thought, well, sure, it's easy to get a bunch of aircraft

42:01.880 --> 42:03.560
flying formation off each other, right?

42:03.560 --> 42:05.480
It's trivial, but why?

42:05.480 --> 42:06.720
What is the best formation?

42:06.720 --> 42:07.640
Why are they doing that?

42:07.640 --> 42:10.120
And that opened up a much more interesting regime

42:10.120 --> 42:12.480
of operations and flight mechanics.

42:12.480 --> 42:14.480
And that's when we get back to that kind of stochastic

42:14.480 --> 42:16.840
mindset where we can bring in aircraft close

42:16.840 --> 42:18.360
to do some type of normal flying

42:18.360 --> 42:21.120
or reduce congestion around airports.

42:21.120 --> 42:24.520
But when we consider formation in a tactical environment,

42:24.520 --> 42:25.840
we can be much more effective

42:25.840 --> 42:27.840
with non-traditional formation keeping

42:27.840 --> 42:30.280
or perhaps no formation keeping perhaps.

42:30.280 --> 42:32.680
So autonomy used for formation keeping,

42:32.680 --> 42:35.120
not for convenience, but for the introduction

42:35.120 --> 42:36.960
of randomness that's hard to-

42:36.960 --> 42:39.040
Like to a real-time mission planner, yeah.

42:39.040 --> 42:42.560
And then that's where you also have some human modifications.

42:42.560 --> 42:47.280
So it's like manned, unmanned teaming enters that picture.

42:47.280 --> 42:51.440
So you use some of the human intuition

42:51.440 --> 42:53.880
and adjustment of this formation.

42:53.880 --> 42:56.120
The formation itself has some uncertainty.

42:56.120 --> 42:57.920
I mean, it's such an interesting dance.

42:57.920 --> 43:02.920
I think that is the most fascinating application

43:03.000 --> 43:05.720
of artificial intelligence is when it's human AI

43:05.720 --> 43:09.320
collaboration, that semi-autonomous dance

43:09.320 --> 43:12.400
that you see in these semi-autonomous vehicle systems

43:12.400 --> 43:14.440
in terms of cars being driving,

43:14.440 --> 43:18.080
but also in the safety critical situation

43:18.080 --> 43:20.680
of a airplane, of a fighter jet,

43:20.680 --> 43:23.000
especially when you're flying fast.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.080
I mean, in a split second,

43:25.080 --> 43:26.640
you have to make all these kinds of decisions.

43:27.200 --> 43:30.520
It feels like an AI system can do as much harm

43:30.520 --> 43:31.360
as it can help.

43:31.360 --> 43:35.600
And so to get that right is a really fascinating challenge.

43:35.600 --> 43:38.000
One of the challenges too isn't just the algorithms

43:38.000 --> 43:41.680
of the autonomy itself, but how it senses the environment.

43:41.680 --> 43:44.320
That of course is gonna be what all these decisions

43:44.320 --> 43:45.160
are based off of.

43:45.160 --> 43:48.040
And that's a challenge in this type of environment.

43:48.040 --> 43:48.960
Well, I gotta ask.

43:48.960 --> 43:53.960
So F-18, what's it like to fly a fighter jet as best?

43:54.040 --> 43:58.680
I mean, what to you is beautiful, powerful?

43:58.680 --> 44:01.320
What do you love about the experience of flying?

44:02.120 --> 44:04.760
For me, and I think I'm an outlier a bit,

44:04.760 --> 44:08.560
it wasn't necessarily the flying itself, right?

44:08.560 --> 44:12.200
It wasn't necessarily the soaring over the clouds

44:12.200 --> 44:16.240
and looking down at the earth from upside down.

44:16.240 --> 44:18.920
I came to love that, but it wasn't necessarily

44:18.920 --> 44:19.960
the passion that drove me there.

44:19.960 --> 44:21.960
I just had no exposure to that.

44:22.000 --> 44:26.080
The only exposure I had was reading and going in the woods

44:26.080 --> 44:28.640
and science fiction and all that.

44:28.640 --> 44:31.920
And so what seemed to kind of drive me towards that

44:31.920 --> 44:35.120
was just a desire to really be operating as close

44:35.120 --> 44:38.720
to what I thought was the edge of technology or science.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.280
And that's the path that I chose

44:40.280 --> 44:41.880
to try to get close to that.

44:41.880 --> 44:43.960
I thought that being in a fighter jet

44:44.840 --> 44:49.840
and all the tools and the technology and the knowledge

44:50.120 --> 44:53.520
and the challenges and the failures and victories

44:53.520 --> 44:55.960
that would come with that just seemed like something

44:55.960 --> 44:59.080
that I wanted to be a part of.

44:59.080 --> 45:00.680
And it wasn't necessarily about the flying,

45:00.680 --> 45:01.920
but it was about the challenge.

45:01.920 --> 45:06.280
And like I said, as a person from a small town,

45:06.280 --> 45:09.160
small high school, being able to get my hands,

45:09.160 --> 45:12.800
or even just near something of such technological significance

45:12.800 --> 45:15.480
was kind of empowering for me.

45:15.480 --> 45:18.320
And that's kind of what bore the love of flight from there,

45:18.400 --> 45:21.840
becoming, having some level of mastery in that aircraft,

45:21.840 --> 45:24.000
it really feels like an extension of your body.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.440
And once I got there,

45:25.440 --> 45:28.840
then the kind of the love of flying kind of followed.

45:28.840 --> 45:33.000
So you sort of, one is the man mastery over the machine.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.480
And second is the machine is like the greatest thing

45:35.480 --> 45:38.120
that humans have ever created arguably.

45:38.120 --> 45:41.880
The things that Lockheed Martin and others have built.

45:41.880 --> 45:43.680
I mean, the engineering in that.

45:43.680 --> 45:44.520
Yeah.

45:46.520 --> 45:48.920
However you feel about war,

45:48.920 --> 45:51.400
which is one of the sad things about human civilization

45:51.400 --> 45:56.400
is war inspires the engineering of tools

45:56.960 --> 45:59.440
that are incredible.

45:59.440 --> 46:02.440
And it's like, maybe without war,

46:02.440 --> 46:03.680
if we look at human history,

46:03.680 --> 46:06.640
we would not build some of the incredible things we built.

46:06.640 --> 46:09.640
So in order to win wars, to stop wars,

46:09.640 --> 46:12.320
we build these incredible systems

46:12.320 --> 46:15.000
that perhaps propagate war.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.400
And that's another discussion I'll ask you about,

46:17.400 --> 46:20.080
but do you, this is like,

46:21.120 --> 46:24.480
this is a chance to experience the greatest engineering

46:24.480 --> 46:26.600
humans have ever been able to do.

46:28.160 --> 46:31.160
Like similar, I suppose that astronauts feel like

46:31.160 --> 46:32.000
when they're flying.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
And I wanted to be an astronaut.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.880
I wanted to take that route.

46:34.880 --> 46:37.120
I was gonna apply to test pilot school.

46:38.360 --> 46:40.240
It just didn't work out for me.

46:40.240 --> 46:42.400
I ended up having a broken foot during my window.

46:42.400 --> 46:43.760
But long story short,

46:43.760 --> 46:46.720
I ended up after my time in my fleet squadron,

46:46.720 --> 46:48.480
and we can get back to the rest of the timeline if you want,

46:48.480 --> 46:53.480
but I went to be an instructor pilot instead, right?

46:54.160 --> 46:56.760
And then, I was talking about this

46:56.760 --> 46:58.800
with a squadron mate earlier today,

46:58.800 --> 47:01.960
about how I certainly wouldn't be talking with Lex today

47:01.960 --> 47:04.520
if I ended up going to test pilot school.

47:04.520 --> 47:05.360
What is that?

47:05.360 --> 47:07.660
I never would have had the,

47:08.340 --> 47:12.180
I wouldn't, maybe recklessness, I don't know,

47:12.180 --> 47:15.900
but the willingness to have a conversation about UAP

47:15.900 --> 47:17.860
while I was, you know,

47:17.860 --> 47:20.700
that led me to the decision to get out once I went there.

47:20.700 --> 47:25.700
And it kind of enabled me to talk about UAP more publicly.

47:26.580 --> 47:27.980
And if I stayed in the Navy,

47:27.980 --> 47:29.540
then I don't think that would have happened.

47:29.540 --> 47:33.260
I wouldn't have been able to if I went that route.

47:33.260 --> 47:35.180
Well, as a small tangent,

47:35.180 --> 47:37.180
do you hope to travel to Mars one day?

47:37.180 --> 47:39.540
Do you think you'll step foot on Mars one day?

47:40.540 --> 47:42.020
If you asked me that five years ago,

47:42.020 --> 47:44.620
I would have said, yes, I want to.

47:44.620 --> 47:46.380
In fact, I would like to die on Mars.

47:48.420 --> 47:49.300
Not today.

47:49.300 --> 47:50.980
Now I have some hesitations,

47:50.980 --> 47:52.140
and I have some hesitations

47:52.140 --> 47:54.860
because I'm hopeful and optimistic.

47:54.860 --> 47:56.580
And I think that, you know,

47:56.580 --> 47:59.060
I think that we are truly like on the brink

47:59.060 --> 48:01.980
of a very wide technological revolution

48:01.980 --> 48:03.740
that's going to kind of move us

48:03.780 --> 48:07.300
how we used to move information and data

48:07.300 --> 48:09.260
in this last century.

48:09.260 --> 48:11.340
We're going to be manipulating and managing matter

48:11.340 --> 48:12.180
in that next century.

48:12.180 --> 48:13.700
And so I think that,

48:13.700 --> 48:16.860
I think our reach as humans are going to get a lot wider,

48:16.860 --> 48:19.900
a lot faster than people may realize, or at least.

48:19.900 --> 48:22.700
Wait, are you getting like super ambitious beyond Mars?

48:22.700 --> 48:23.620
Is that what you're saying?

48:23.620 --> 48:24.820
Well, I mean.

48:24.820 --> 48:26.300
Like Mars seems kind of boring.

48:26.300 --> 48:27.500
I want to go beyond that.

48:27.500 --> 48:31.460
Is that what, do you mean the reach of humanity

48:31.460 --> 48:32.860
across all kinds of technologies

48:32.860 --> 48:34.420
or do you mean literally across space?

48:34.420 --> 48:35.740
Across space, you know.

48:35.740 --> 48:37.420
So, you know, we're going to be,

48:37.420 --> 48:39.500
I think that as artificial intelligence

48:39.500 --> 48:41.340
and machine learning starts broaching further

48:41.340 --> 48:43.820
into the topic of science or the area of science,

48:43.820 --> 48:45.820
and we start working through new physics,

48:45.820 --> 48:47.260
we start working through,

48:47.260 --> 48:50.340
or I should say past the Einsteinian frameworks

48:50.340 --> 48:51.660
as we kind of get a better idea

48:51.660 --> 48:54.060
of what space time is or isn't.

48:55.020 --> 48:56.940
We may have, we may find, you know,

48:56.940 --> 48:58.900
answers that we didn't know that we were looking for,

48:58.900 --> 49:00.580
and we may have more opportunity.

49:00.620 --> 49:02.220
I'm not saying this is something

49:02.220 --> 49:04.100
I'm betting the farm on, of course,

49:04.100 --> 49:07.620
but maybe that's a road I want to explore on Earth

49:07.620 --> 49:09.580
instead of on Mars.

49:09.580 --> 49:12.380
Maybe there's technology that can be brought to bear

49:12.380 --> 49:14.540
with new science and harder engineering

49:14.540 --> 49:16.660
that is a road that doesn't go past Mars

49:16.660 --> 49:18.260
to get outside the solar system.

49:19.300 --> 49:22.300
So there are different ways to explore the universe

49:22.300 --> 49:24.660
than the traditional rocket systems.

49:26.260 --> 49:29.660
If we can continue sort of your journey,

49:31.100 --> 49:33.740
you said that you were attracted

49:33.740 --> 49:36.380
to the incredibly advanced technologies

49:36.380 --> 49:40.620
of the F-18s and just the fighter jets in general.

49:42.620 --> 49:44.780
Let me ask another question,

49:44.780 --> 49:47.180
which seems incredibly difficult to do,

49:47.180 --> 49:50.060
which is landing on a carrier,

49:50.060 --> 49:52.220
or taking off from a carrier and landing on a carrier.

49:52.220 --> 49:54.500
So what's that like?

49:54.500 --> 49:56.300
What are the challenges of that?

49:56.300 --> 49:57.860
Taking off is pretty easy.

49:57.860 --> 50:00.380
It's procedurally somewhat complex,

50:01.180 --> 50:03.180
where there's a lot of moving parts almost like a clock.

50:03.180 --> 50:04.580
You're almost in a pocket watch,

50:04.580 --> 50:06.860
so then you're a part of the machinery,

50:06.860 --> 50:08.620
and so long as you press the right buttons

50:08.620 --> 50:09.460
and do the right things,

50:09.460 --> 50:11.020
then you're gonna go shooting off the front.

50:11.020 --> 50:12.420
So there's like a checklist to follow,

50:12.420 --> 50:14.420
and there's several people involved in that checklist,

50:14.420 --> 50:16.460
and you just gotta follow the checklist correctly.

50:16.460 --> 50:17.620
Essentially, yep.

50:17.620 --> 50:18.700
Lots of ways to screw it up,

50:18.700 --> 50:20.900
but you'll know how to screw it up.

50:20.900 --> 50:22.420
But landing on the back of the boat

50:22.420 --> 50:24.060
is a whole different animal.

50:24.900 --> 50:26.820
There's a lot more variables.

50:26.820 --> 50:29.340
There's essentially one or two people responsible

50:29.340 --> 50:31.620
for the success of that.

50:31.620 --> 50:33.580
The landing signal officer,

50:33.580 --> 50:35.540
who actually represents a team

50:35.540 --> 50:37.540
of specially trained aviators

50:37.540 --> 50:39.660
who are responsible for helping that aviator

50:39.660 --> 50:40.660
land on the boat,

50:41.780 --> 50:44.260
and the pilot himself.

50:44.260 --> 50:49.260
And it is a hard task to actually fly precisely enough

50:49.380 --> 50:50.340
to be good at it.

50:50.340 --> 50:53.620
So to fly, quote unquote, the perfect pass,

50:53.620 --> 50:54.820
you essentially have to fly your head

50:54.820 --> 50:57.060
through a one foot by one foot box.

50:57.060 --> 51:00.060
That's essentially the target you're shooting for.

51:00.060 --> 51:02.660
Plus or minus probably about five knots on airspeed,

51:02.660 --> 51:04.620
although we don't really judge it by airspeed.

51:04.620 --> 51:06.540
It's something called angle of attack,

51:06.540 --> 51:09.500
but generally pretty tight parameters there.

51:09.500 --> 51:11.940
And you can do everything perfect and still fail.

51:11.940 --> 51:13.340
So when we go to touchdown,

51:13.340 --> 51:14.860
we immediately bring the power up

51:14.860 --> 51:19.860
and we rotate as if we were bouncing off the deck.

51:19.860 --> 51:23.580
And if we catch it, then we slow down.

51:23.580 --> 51:25.140
And then someone tells us to bring the power back,

51:25.140 --> 51:27.420
which we do, we don't do it on our own

51:27.420 --> 51:29.780
because it's such a violent experience.

51:29.780 --> 51:31.740
You can think you're trapped or not,

51:31.740 --> 51:34.220
or something breaks and you bring your throttle back.

51:34.220 --> 51:35.700
And that's a very serious thing.

51:35.700 --> 51:37.220
It happened to the best of us.

51:37.220 --> 51:38.340
I've done it once.

51:38.340 --> 51:40.780
When I first got to the squadron,

51:40.780 --> 51:42.660
it's called ease guns of land.

51:42.660 --> 51:45.660
And so I came in the boat and I brought the power,

51:45.660 --> 51:47.020
I cracked the power back a little bit

51:47.020 --> 51:48.780
before I've been told to her

51:48.780 --> 51:51.500
that my aircraft had finished settling in.

51:51.500 --> 51:52.820
And that was a big faux pas, right?

51:52.820 --> 51:53.940
So especially as a new guy.

51:54.020 --> 51:57.540
So it's a very serious business.

51:57.540 --> 51:58.500
There's a lot of eyes on you

51:58.500 --> 52:00.140
and there's a lot of ways to screw it up.

52:00.140 --> 52:03.420
But the physical rush of having a great pass

52:03.420 --> 52:07.340
and then just the crash into the boat and all that,

52:07.340 --> 52:09.180
the physical sensation from it,

52:09.180 --> 52:10.740
when everything's going great,

52:10.740 --> 52:12.660
top of the world, it's a great feeling.

52:12.660 --> 52:13.620
How much of it is feel?

52:13.620 --> 52:16.660
How much of it is instruments?

52:16.660 --> 52:18.660
How much is other people just doing the work for you,

52:18.660 --> 52:20.740
catching you, as long as you do everything right?

52:20.740 --> 52:21.900
There's a few systems we use.

52:21.900 --> 52:23.220
One is called the ball.

52:23.220 --> 52:26.060
And that ball is external to our aircraft.

52:26.060 --> 52:26.900
And it's-

52:26.900 --> 52:27.740
B-A-L-L?

52:27.740 --> 52:28.560
Correct.

52:28.560 --> 52:29.400
Ball, thank you, ball, okay.

52:29.400 --> 52:31.500
It's an IFLOS landing system,

52:31.500 --> 52:33.420
which stands for something very long convoluted.

52:33.420 --> 52:35.580
But essentially it's a mirror with lights on it.

52:35.580 --> 52:40.580
And you see the light at a different cell

52:40.580 --> 52:44.580
based on your position relative to an ideal glide slope.

52:44.580 --> 52:46.260
So if you're right on it, you're right in the middle.

52:46.260 --> 52:48.100
And if you're below, you're low.

52:48.100 --> 52:51.260
And as I add power and maneuver the aircraft,

52:51.260 --> 52:55.220
that ball, I see that ball rise, I see that ball low.

52:55.220 --> 52:57.140
It's a lagging indicator though, right?

52:57.140 --> 53:00.220
And your jet is a lagging engine too, right?

53:00.220 --> 53:01.420
It takes time to spool up the engine.

53:01.420 --> 53:03.180
So that adds to the complexity.

53:03.180 --> 53:04.620
You have to think ahead of it.

53:05.900 --> 53:07.980
So you don't want to,

53:07.980 --> 53:10.540
you can't just bring the power up and leave it there.

53:10.540 --> 53:13.100
You have to bring the power up, touch it, bring it back.

53:13.100 --> 53:15.380
And oh, by the way, your landing area is moving,

53:15.380 --> 53:17.940
not just away from you, but also on an angle, right?

53:17.940 --> 53:19.020
Cause we have an angled deck.

53:19.020 --> 53:21.540
And so you're constantly doing one of these

53:21.540 --> 53:23.580
to correct yourself as you go.

53:23.580 --> 53:24.460
So stressful.

53:24.460 --> 53:26.380
And every time you do one of those,

53:26.380 --> 53:28.500
maybe it's a 30 degree angle bank, right?

53:28.500 --> 53:30.300
I'm losing lift, right?

53:30.300 --> 53:33.060
And so I have to compensate with power each time I do that.

53:33.060 --> 53:33.900
So I'm doing another one.

53:33.900 --> 53:36.980
Cause you have to maintain the same level

53:36.980 --> 53:38.420
you're always lowering.

53:38.420 --> 53:40.340
It's a constant rate of descent that's increasing

53:40.340 --> 53:43.180
from about 200 feet per minute to about 650.

53:43.180 --> 53:45.780
And every time you do this, that's messing with that.

53:45.780 --> 53:46.660
Okay.

53:46.660 --> 53:47.500
So you have to compensate.

53:47.500 --> 53:48.620
And you're doing that manually.

53:49.260 --> 53:50.100
All right.

53:50.100 --> 53:52.940
And then of course, as you come down that glide slope,

53:52.940 --> 53:54.300
it becomes more and more narrow.

53:54.300 --> 53:59.300
And you have to, of course, modulate your inputs

53:59.500 --> 54:00.780
such that they're smaller and smaller

54:00.780 --> 54:01.940
cause they have a bigger and bigger effect

54:01.940 --> 54:03.020
as you get closer in.

54:04.420 --> 54:06.060
And what happens too when you get in close

54:06.060 --> 54:08.220
is that right before you cross over,

54:08.220 --> 54:10.180
if this is the boat right here, your table,

54:10.180 --> 54:12.060
right before you kind of get your wings

54:12.060 --> 54:15.140
over the boat itself, this big wind

54:15.140 --> 54:18.420
from the main tower of the boat is where it dips down.

54:19.220 --> 54:20.540
So the wind actually goes down and it's called the burble.

54:20.540 --> 54:21.820
And it'll actually pull the aircraft down,

54:21.820 --> 54:23.340
increase your rate of descent.

54:23.340 --> 54:25.940
But at that particular point, you need to increase

54:25.940 --> 54:27.660
your power and try to compensate against that.

54:27.660 --> 54:28.940
And so that's kind of a third variable

54:28.940 --> 54:31.900
that's trying to screw you up on your way down.

54:31.900 --> 54:34.100
What's the most difficult conditions

54:34.100 --> 54:35.620
in which you had to land or you've seen

54:35.620 --> 54:36.740
somebody had to land?

54:36.740 --> 54:40.700
Because I think you were also a signal officer as well.

54:40.700 --> 54:41.540
I was, yeah.

54:41.540 --> 54:44.100
I was the head landing signal officer for my squadron.

54:44.100 --> 54:46.940
So you've probably seen some tough landings.

54:46.940 --> 54:47.780
I have.

54:47.980 --> 54:50.900
I've seen a ramp strike, which is when a part

54:50.900 --> 54:54.900
of the aircraft hits before the landing area,

54:54.900 --> 54:57.460
which is basically the roundout of the boat

54:57.460 --> 54:58.580
that is before the landing area.

54:58.580 --> 55:01.460
So they basically struck the back of the boat coming in.

55:01.460 --> 55:02.460
It was just their hook.

55:02.460 --> 55:05.580
So it wasn't the aircraft and they were fine.

55:05.580 --> 55:07.220
That one was kind of ugly.

55:07.220 --> 55:09.540
But it like rips that part of the aircraft.

55:09.540 --> 55:10.380
Absolutely.

55:10.380 --> 55:12.500
And then you land on your bellies, that kind of thing.

55:12.500 --> 55:15.660
In this particular case, it hit and then it gave

55:15.700 --> 55:18.740
and essentially dragged the hook on the surface after that.

55:18.740 --> 55:21.060
And so he was able to grab a wire at that point.

55:21.060 --> 55:22.180
When does that kind of thing happen?

55:22.180 --> 55:24.020
Just a miscalculation by the pilot

55:24.020 --> 55:27.060
or is it weather conditions?

55:27.060 --> 55:28.780
I wouldn't even call it a miscalculation.

55:28.780 --> 55:30.380
I mean, I'm going to put the blame on the pilot

55:30.380 --> 55:31.620
because he's the only one in the cockpit.

55:31.620 --> 55:34.220
But then the day he's reacting to the situations

55:34.220 --> 55:35.060
he's dealing with.

55:35.060 --> 55:37.700
And so it may be errors or he may be doing the best

55:37.700 --> 55:40.500
with the conditions that he's been given.

55:40.500 --> 55:42.100
On that particular one,

55:42.100 --> 55:43.460
you just got too high a rate of sand.

55:43.460 --> 55:44.300
It's very common.

55:44.300 --> 55:45.540
And that's what you see it with new pilots.

55:46.380 --> 55:47.300
And you see it with older pilots, right?

55:47.300 --> 55:49.340
New ones and complacent ones.

55:49.340 --> 55:52.260
What you see is they'll try to make the ball

55:52.260 --> 55:53.980
go right where they want it in close.

55:53.980 --> 55:56.140
They think they can beat the game a little bit.

55:56.140 --> 55:58.340
And they try to, and so we have sayings.

55:58.340 --> 56:01.500
We teach pilots, as a landing signal officer,

56:01.500 --> 56:04.060
we tell them like, don't recenter the high ball in close.

56:04.060 --> 56:05.820
It's one of the rules to live by.

56:05.820 --> 56:07.460
And so when the ball's up high,

56:07.460 --> 56:09.260
don't try to bring it back in close

56:09.260 --> 56:11.820
to like the center point when you're in close.

56:11.820 --> 56:12.940
Because what you're doing is you bring the power off

56:12.940 --> 56:14.460
and you're going to crash right down.

56:14.460 --> 56:15.660
And that's what happens, right?

56:15.660 --> 56:17.980
Cause you got the burble pulling you down.

56:17.980 --> 56:21.100
You might be correcting, which is decreasing your lift.

56:21.100 --> 56:23.460
And then you have that type of maneuver.

56:23.460 --> 56:24.940
How are you supposed to do all of this

56:24.940 --> 56:26.980
in harsh weather conditions?

56:26.980 --> 56:28.420
So that's the one I wanted to tell you about.

56:28.420 --> 56:29.420
That's the hardest one.

56:29.420 --> 56:33.340
And what you hear is if you hear 99 taxi lights on,

56:33.340 --> 56:34.820
that's a really shitty day.

56:34.820 --> 56:36.940
99 taxi lights on.

56:36.940 --> 56:37.900
What's that mean?

56:37.900 --> 56:39.860
Everyone put your taxi lights on

56:39.860 --> 56:43.100
because you're about to land on the boat.

56:43.100 --> 56:43.980
And you don't see the boat?

56:44.500 --> 56:46.660
The weather is so bad that the landing civil officer

56:46.660 --> 56:48.700
on the boat can't see you either.

56:48.700 --> 56:49.660
And you can't see the boat.

56:49.660 --> 56:52.540
And you won't be able to see it when you touch down.

56:52.540 --> 56:55.140
So we call that a zero zero landing.

56:55.140 --> 56:57.940
And you turn on the taxi lights so that the LSO,

56:57.940 --> 57:00.260
who has a radio in his hand that looks like a phone

57:00.260 --> 57:04.740
from 1980, is talking directly to the pilot.

57:04.740 --> 57:07.020
And he's looking at that little light in the rain.

57:07.020 --> 57:10.580
And he's telling them you're high, you're low, power,

57:10.580 --> 57:11.420
things like that.

57:11.420 --> 57:13.260
Come right, back to left.

57:13.300 --> 57:14.700
And literally talking him down

57:14.700 --> 57:16.020
to land on the boat right there.

57:16.020 --> 57:18.020
And the pilot, usually it comes as a surprise

57:18.020 --> 57:18.860
to the pilot, the landing,

57:18.860 --> 57:20.100
because he's just listening to the voice,

57:20.100 --> 57:21.820
can't see the ball, can't see the boat.

57:21.820 --> 57:23.420
And all of a sudden you just hit the boat.

57:23.420 --> 57:24.260
You crash.

57:24.260 --> 57:25.100
I mean, you crash.

57:25.100 --> 57:27.900
We're going about 1,600 feet per minute descent

57:27.900 --> 57:28.740
at that point.

57:28.740 --> 57:30.980
So you're going super fast.

57:30.980 --> 57:32.660
So all this is happening fast.

57:32.660 --> 57:37.660
You don't know the moment it's gonna hit.

57:37.660 --> 57:40.060
So you're just going into the darkness

57:40.060 --> 57:41.860
and just waiting for it to hit.

57:41.860 --> 57:42.700
Maybe not dark though.

57:42.700 --> 57:43.860
A lot of times it's white.

57:43.860 --> 57:44.700
Into the light.

57:44.700 --> 57:46.700
You're going into the light.

57:46.700 --> 57:50.140
It's almost like there's a voice from an 80s phone.

57:50.140 --> 57:50.980
I got it.

57:50.980 --> 57:52.100
This is terrible.

57:53.940 --> 57:57.620
But so that you still have to,

57:57.620 --> 57:59.060
so this kind of thing happens.

57:59.060 --> 58:00.340
You still have to land.

58:00.340 --> 58:02.580
Sometimes you just don't have a place to divert.

58:02.580 --> 58:04.260
But in a sense we're trained for that

58:04.260 --> 58:06.260
because we do the night landings as well.

58:06.260 --> 58:07.940
And I think you'll find this interesting,

58:07.940 --> 58:10.300
but I always found that the night landings

58:10.300 --> 58:12.660
where in these particular cases,

58:12.660 --> 58:14.820
you're usually lined up behind the boat,

58:14.820 --> 58:16.060
maybe 10, 15 miles.

58:16.060 --> 58:17.060
Whereas the other ones,

58:17.060 --> 58:18.980
it's like a tight circle, the landing pattern.

58:18.980 --> 58:21.580
And so we can potentially see the boat way out there

58:23.500 --> 58:25.180
if the lights were on, which they're not.

58:25.180 --> 58:27.020
But we can maybe see like the string of aircraft

58:27.020 --> 58:28.140
in front of us.

58:28.140 --> 58:31.220
But what's interesting is that it can take a while.

58:31.220 --> 58:32.420
You might be 15 miles out

58:32.420 --> 58:36.060
and your lights are turned down as dim as possible.

58:36.060 --> 58:38.820
You have a cloud deck maybe at six or 7,000 feet.

58:38.820 --> 58:40.980
So the starlight, there's no moon,

58:40.980 --> 58:42.940
but let's say the starlight's blocked out.

58:42.940 --> 58:45.260
Because just the starlight alone, no moon,

58:45.260 --> 58:47.140
you can see the boat, you can see the water.

58:47.140 --> 58:50.540
But when that goes away, it's like closing your eyes.

58:50.540 --> 58:52.060
You can't tell anything.

58:52.060 --> 58:55.620
It could be upside down, it could be in any position.

58:55.620 --> 58:58.500
And for me, it was almost a meditative process

58:58.500 --> 59:00.580
that I had to snap myself back out of

59:00.580 --> 59:02.900
when I was on like a long straightaway.

59:02.900 --> 59:05.100
And then I would see that light pop up

59:05.100 --> 59:06.660
in the sea of darkness.

59:06.660 --> 59:07.620
No lights anywhere.

59:07.620 --> 59:09.140
I can't even see the horizon.

59:09.140 --> 59:10.780
And I just see a light out there.

59:10.780 --> 59:11.860
My instruments are telling me,

59:11.860 --> 59:13.420
and they're turned down as far as they can go, right?

59:13.420 --> 59:14.500
So I can barely see them.

59:14.500 --> 59:16.140
So my eyes can adjust.

59:16.140 --> 59:18.580
And I'm just staring at this light in the distance.

59:18.580 --> 59:21.660
And it's just very meditative and it's the hum behind you.

59:21.660 --> 59:25.220
And then at like four miles, you know,

59:25.220 --> 59:26.820
almost like, oh, the light is a little bit bigger.

59:26.820 --> 59:28.340
And you almost kind of have to snap back to it

59:28.340 --> 59:30.180
and be like, oh, I need to like kind of like

59:30.180 --> 59:32.220
look around a little bit and engage my brain

59:32.220 --> 59:35.180
and link it back to my body and like do this thing.

59:35.180 --> 59:36.820
You're gonna have to actually land.

59:36.820 --> 59:40.260
Well, is there just, you said you don't necessarily

59:40.260 --> 59:42.180
feel the romantic notion of the whole thing,

59:42.180 --> 59:45.820
but is there some aspects of flying where you look up

59:45.820 --> 59:50.540
and maybe you see the stars or yeah,

59:50.540 --> 59:53.100
that kind of thing that you just like, holy crap,

59:53.100 --> 59:55.460
how did humans accomplish all of this?

59:55.460 --> 59:58.340
Like, am I actually flying right now?

59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.500
I used to have those moments on the boat

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:01.980
when I was catching planes land.

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:05.140
I would, they would trap and it'd be nighttime

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:07.220
and it's just all this chaos in the middle of the ocean

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.060
and nothing.

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:09.380
And I would have these moments where I'd be like,

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:11.220
how the hell did I end up here?

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.780
You know, there's one moment in time next to an aircraft

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.420
landing on a boat in the middle of the ocean, you know,

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:17.900
where did my life, you know,

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.100
how did my life go to end up here?

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.500
How interesting.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:24.220
But what I did start to enjoy was the night vision goggles

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:26.820
and putting those on and looking up at the stars

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.780
flying around, especially over the ocean.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:30.620
What do they look like?

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:33.300
And there's just so many, there's just so many stars

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.900
that, you know, you normally can't see,

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.620
they're shooting stars all the time.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.420
Almost every flight you'd see them with the goggles on.

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:42.140
So it was a great pleasure to take advantage

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.540
of the lack of light pollution in some cases,

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.540
especially on deployment,

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:47.500
to go grab some goggles at night,

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:51.020
go out some quiet spot in the ship that no one can see me

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.940
and just kind of look around, you know.

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:53.980
Yeah, it's humbling.

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:57.220
Quick break, bathroom break?

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.900
Yeah, I wouldn't mind a quick stretch of leg.

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:00.980
You got a few cool patches.

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:01.820
I do.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:05.900
This is a VFA 11 Red Ripper's patch,

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:08.220
typically going actually on our arm.

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:12.740
So this is actually what we call the boar's head or Arnold.

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:15.620
So this is actually the boar's head

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:17.100
from the Gordon's gin bottle.

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:22.100
In 1918, we were in London or the UK somewhere

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:25.180
and we apparently partied with the owner

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:27.220
and founder of Gordon's gin.

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.020
We had a great time and there's a signed letter

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:30.980
in our ready room that says we can use the logo

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.220
in perpetuity.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:33.060
Oh, nice.

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:36.460
Yeah, so I'd like to give you that patch.

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:39.580
I drank quite a bit of good, so this is good.

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:43.820
And I'd like to give you that coin from our squadron.

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:46.940
The Red Rippers, that's a badass name.

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:49.620
Thank you, brother.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:50.460
You're welcome.

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:51.700
So let's jump around a little bit,

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:56.660
but let me ask you about this one set of experiences

01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:59.060
that you had and people in your squadron had.

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.780
So you and a few people in the squadron

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.380
either detected UFOs on your instruments

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:05.140
or saw them directly.

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:07.980
Tell me the full story of these UFO sightings

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:10.700
and to the smallest technical details,

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:12.460
because I love those.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:13.820
I'll do my best.

01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:17.100
So we returned from, and when I say we,

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:21.260
I mean, not my squadron, but VFA 11, the Red Rippers.

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:24.460
I was a somewhat junior pilot at the time.

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.700
I joined them on deployment in 2012

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.380
where they had been already out there

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:30.820
for about six months or so

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:35.180
operating in the vicinity of Afghanistan.

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:37.340
I joined them and then we flew back

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:39.060
and still as a relatively new guy,

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:41.100
we came back and we entered what's considered

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.260
a maintenance phase where we slow down

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.780
the tactical flying a bit, kind of recuperate,

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:48.300
do some maintenance on the aircraft.

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:51.820
And our particular model of the F-18, the lot,

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:56.820
the lot number, was plumbed for the particular things

01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.460
that were needed to upgrade the radar

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:04.300
from what's known as the ABG 73 to the ABG 79.

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:08.980
And the ABG 73 is a mechanically scanned array radar.

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.740
It's a perfectly fine radar,

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:16.260
but the AESA radar is kind of a magnitude jump

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:20.180
in capability, kind of an analog digital kind of mindset.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:23.100
So it's a leap to digital.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.740
ABG 73, 79, are these things on a carrier?

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:27.940
Like what are we talking about here?

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:29.940
How big is the radar?

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.740
So this is actually the radar, it's in the F-18 itself.

01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:34.980
Okay, so when you say they were chosen,

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:39.980
this is to test the upgrade to the new, the 79, ABG 79.

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:42.020
Less of a test and more of just,

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.420
hey, it's your turn to get the upgrade.

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.060
Like we're all going to these better radars.

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:49.460
They were building ones off the line with the new radar,

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.540
but we were this weird transitionary squadron

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.580
in the middle that transitioned from the older ones

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.100
to the new ones.

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.700
But it's not particularly rare to fly

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:57.780
with different types of radar,

01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:01.300
because in the, we call the fleet replacement squadron,

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.740
essentially the training ground for the F-18,

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.180
you have all sorts of F-18s with different radars.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:09.500
So you are used to having multiple ones,

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:14.500
but in the actual deployable combat squadron, we upgraded.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.740
And when we upgraded, we saw that there were objects

01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:19.780
on the radar that we were seeing the next day

01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:23.780
with this new radar that weren't there with the old radar.

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:25.460
And these were sometimes the same day.

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.020
You might go on two flights.

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.100
The one in the morning might be with the older radar,

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:31.580
the one evening with the new radar.

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.580
And you'd see the objects with the new radar.

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:37.380
And that's not overly surprising in some sense.

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.140
They are more sensitive.

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:40.900
Perhaps they're not filtering out

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:42.020
everything they should be yet,

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:45.540
or perhaps there's some other type of error.

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:47.920
Maybe it needs to be calibrated, whatever.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.160
It was relatively new.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:52.320
And we were somewhat used to there being software problems

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.760
with these types of things occasionally,

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.280
just like anything else.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:58.960
And so, okay, maybe this is a radar software malfunction.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.360
We're getting some false tracks, as we call them.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.320
What were you seeing?

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.520
And so what we would see are representations of the object.

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.680
So this is off of our radar.

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.080
We're not seeing a visual image here.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.440
This is kind of like what's being displayed to us,

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.120
almost like in a gaming fashion, right?

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.440
Like the icon, right?

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.520
So the icon is showing us, hey, something is there.

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.600
And here's the parameters I can understand about it.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.520
So this is in the cockpit.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:26.640
There's a display that's showing some visualization

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:27.880
with the radars detecting.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.160
Correct.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.680
And there's two different ways to do that.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.600
The first one is like the actual data,

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:37.200
like the radar where I am,

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.760
it's showing me the data kind of as if it's in front of me

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.720
and I'm selecting those contacts.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:42.560
And there's another screen

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.920
called the situational awareness page.

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.920
And that's kind of a God's eye view

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.560
that brings all that data into one spot.

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:51.840
And so I'm gonna talk about this from the SA page,

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.040
from the situational awareness page

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.320
versus the individual radar ones,

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:55.320
because it's easier.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.160
But-

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.400
Sorry to linger on that.

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:01.040
So the individual displays are like first person

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:04.280
and then the SA is,

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:05.680
when you say God's eye view,

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:06.920
it's like from the top,

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:09.000
the integration of all that information

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.720
as if it's looking down onto the earth.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:12.560
Yes.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.400
Is that a good way to summarize it?

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:14.240
It is.

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:15.200
But for the aviator, it's slightly different

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.520
because those two radar displays I talked about

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:20.240
are at the bottom of that display

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.440
is kind of representative of where I am.

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:23.760
And so I see what's in front of me.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.600
Got it.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.880
Whereas the situational awareness page,

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.320
the aircraft is located in the center of that.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.880
And then all around me,

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.240
based off of the data link

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.600
and wherever I'm getting information from,

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.800
I can see that whole awareness page.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.880
I can see all the situation.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.480
So I'm gonna kind of talk about this

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.520
from the situational awareness page,

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.920
which is a top-down view,

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:46.440
just to kind of frame our minds

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:47.960
instead of jumping around.

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.200
And so what we would see out there

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.840
is we'd see these indications

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:51.680
that something would be there

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.560
and they would have a track file.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.600
That track file,

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.080
that thing that represents the object,

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.240
has a line coming out of it.

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.440
And that represents,

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.480
it's called the target aspect indicator.

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:03.480
So there's some tracking from the radar.

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.320
Correct.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.360
So it's showing you where the object's going.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.320
This is all pretty cool

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.320
that the radar can do all this.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:10.480
So radar locks in on different objects

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:11.800
and it tracks them over time.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.640
Correct.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.480
That's coming from the radar.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.400
That's a built-in feature.

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.240
Okay, cool.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.440
Out there, we're seeing it.

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.920
We don't have to necessarily pull things

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:22.160
into our tracker in some sense.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.000
It's all out there

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.880
and then we can kind of choose to highlight on stuff

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.600
or to kind of focus in on it more so.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.040
But the information should all be out there.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.400
And so we'd see that target aspect indicator,

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.800
that line on a typical aircraft,

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.760
it would kind of look like this.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.040
It would be coming out and it would go steady

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.520
and if they turn,

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:39.840
it would be like boop, boop, boop, boop

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.120
and you see them turn.

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.200
It's not magic.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:43.040
But this object,

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.600
the target aspect would kind of be like all over the place,

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.480
like kind of randomly in the 360 degrees

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.920
from that top-down view,

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.760
that line would be in any place.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:56.600
So kind of, is it unable to determine the target aspect?

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.160
Is it stationary?

01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.240
And that's just how it puts it out

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.280
and it's not used to seeing it.

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.480
So I'm not saying that's necessarily super weird,

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.520
but it was different than what we were used to seeing

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.440
because we weren't used to seeing stationary objects

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:07.440
out there very much.

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:09.720
And what was also interesting is that

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:13.400
these weren't just stationary on a zero wind day, right?

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:17.040
These are stationary at 20,000 feet, 15,000 feet,

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.200
500 feet with the wind blowing.

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.800
And so much like the sea,

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.600
when we're up there fighting, it affects everything.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.720
We consider the wind when we're shooting missiles,

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:29.600
when we're flying or fuel considerations,

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.600
it's like operating in that volume of air,

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.040
like the ocean, everything's going with the current.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.360
And so anything that doesn't go with the current

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.920
is immediately kind of identifiable and strange

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.480
and that's why these were initially strangers

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:42.480
because they would be stationary against the wind.

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.360
So if you had something like a good drone

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:47.760
in a windy conditions, what would that look like?

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.360
Would it not come off as stationary?

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.280
Would it sort of float about kind of thing?

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:55.160
No, I think with the drone technology we have today,

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.520
they could stay within a pretty tight location.

01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.480
Well, I meant like DJI drone,

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:03.040
I'm saying like generically speaking,

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:03.880
not a military drone.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:05.840
No, I have a DJI drone myself even,

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.960
and you know, maybe not 100 knots,

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:11.080
but if that thing's in 30 or 40 knot winds,

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:14.520
the amount of distance it's going to be

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.960
kind of doing one of these, like that change

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.200
is not something I'm gonna detect from

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:19.680
maybe many miles away.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.520
Interesting.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.360
So it could look very stationary,

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:24.480
but that wasn't necessarily,

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:26.080
what's interesting about this story

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.160
is that there's not like the one smoking gun, right?

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.840
You have to kind of look at everything.

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:34.240
And that's what I don't like about the Department of Defense

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.840
and just generally people's take on this

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.680
is that everything is kind of based around a single image,

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.520
you know, or that one case,

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:44.600
but a lot of the interestingness comes from the duration

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.600
or the time it's been out there,

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.080
how they're interacting relative to other objects out there.

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.520
And you don't get that information

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.360
when you just look at a frame for a second, you know?

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.800
Everyone kind of bites off on the shiny object, but.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.360
So you yourself, from your particular slice

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.600
of things you've experienced and seen directly

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.360
or indirectly, you've kind of built up an intuition

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.960
about what the things that were being seen.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.880
I wouldn't go that far.

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:10.440
I've just been able to eliminate some variables

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.480
because of how long I've observed it.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.880
So like you said, yes,

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.480
can a drone stay in a particular position

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.320
against the wind like that?

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.640
Certainly, but I don't think it can do that

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.520
and then go 0.8 Mach for four hours after that, you know?

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.080
And so when you look at outside of that,

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.600
once that moment in time,

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.960
then it eliminates a lot of the potential things

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.720
it could be, at least from my perspective.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.560
So what kind of stuff did you see in the instruments?

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.600
We'd see them flying in patterns,

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.600
kind of racetrack patterns or circular patterns

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.520
or just going kind of straight east.

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:46.160
I occasionally see them supersonic, 1.1, 1.2 Mach,

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.080
but typically 0.6 to 0.8 Mach,

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.840
just for extremely extended periods of time,

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.640
you know, essentially all the time.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.200
And this is airspace where there's not supposed

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.520
to be anything else at all.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.800
And it's pretty far out there.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.480
It starts 10 miles off the coast, goes like 300 miles.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:03.880
Can you say the location that we're talking about?

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.720
Off the coast of Virginia Beach.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.560
Got it.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.360
And so nobody is supposed to be out there.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:10.560
It's possible for people to be there.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.200
It's not necessarily restricted,

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.560
but it's well monitored and we're out there

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:15.520
every day all day.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.320
And so, you know, people know to stay clear.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:18.680
If a Cessna goes bumbling in there,

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:19.880
everyone's going to know about it.

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:22.200
FAA is going to, you know, call them out,

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.240
going to tell us about it.

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:27.080
So incursions happen, not a big deal,

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.080
but they're pretty rare, honestly,

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.040
because everyone knows the area

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.120
we've been operating there for decades.

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:35.960
And what are the trajectories at 0.6 to 0.8 Mach

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.720
that these objects were taking?

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.160
Typically, they would be in some type of circular pattern

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.480
or kind of a racetrack pattern

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:44.760
when they were at those speeds,

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.440
or I just see them kind of,

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:50.120
and it wasn't always like a mechanical flight description.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.480
And when I say that, I mean like,

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:54.560
an autopilot is going to be just very precise, right?

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.520
It's going to be locked on straight.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.760
Whereas I could see an airplane,

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.280
I could tell if the pilot's flying it, right?

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.000
Because it's not going to be perfect.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.320
The computer's not controlling it.

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.760
And these seemed more like that.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.360
Not that they were imprecise,

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.840
but that they were even much more erratic than that.

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.080
So like, it wasn't like a straight line in a turn.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.080
It was just kind of like a, you know,

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.520
weird drift like that in that direction, you know?

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:17.360
So it wasn't controlled by a dumb computer,

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:20.120
or not disrespected computers.

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:23.000
So it wasn't controlled by autopilot kind of technology.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.640
That's not the sense that I got.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.880
So how many people have seen them in the squadron?

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.800
Sort of how many times were they seen?

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:36.400
How many were there times when there's multiple objects?

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.320
Once we started seeing them on the radar enough,

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.200
and we would get close enough,

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.880
we'd actually see them on our FLIR as well.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:45.080
So our advanced targeting pod.

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.320
It's essentially a infrared camera

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:48.480
that we use for targeting,

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:51.040
mostly in the air to surface environment.

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.880
We don't use it in the air to air arena.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:56.120
It's just not that good of a tool, frankly.

01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:00.440
But we would see IR energy emitting from that location

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:01.760
where the radar was dropping us off.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.960
So, you know, the radar we'd lock onto the object

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.520
and our sensors would all look there.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.960
And so then we could see that it's looking

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.040
at that right piece of sky,

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:11.080
but there's energy actually coming from there.

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.440
So now we started thinking that, okay,

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:14.680
maybe not radar malfunctions, maybe more,

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:16.680
maybe something is physically here, of course.

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:19.080
And then people started to try to fly by and see it.

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.720
And at this point, you know,

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.960
I would say maybe 80 to 90% of our squadron

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.720
have probably seen one of these on the radar at this point.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.320
Everyone was aware of it.

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.200
There was small communication, I think,

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.600
between squadrons of the same area that had the same radar.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.160
So I knew it wasn't just our squadron

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.120
for whatever strange reason.

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.760
Cause they would be, other squadron would be out there

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:37.880
and we would talk to them like,

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.600
hey, like careful, there's an object.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.440
Are you aware of that?

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.800
You know, so like they would be aware of it.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:43.680
And then of course,

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.360
people would want to go see what they look like, right?

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:46.840
So people would try to fly by it.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:48.280
I try to fly by him.

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:50.320
I like how that's an of course.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.240
Of course.

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:53.320
Of course you'd want to fly by it.

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.280
You know, there's an,

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.920
there's a argument against that kind of perspective

01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.480
that maybe the thing is dangerous.

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:00.640
So maybe we don't,

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.280
but perhaps that's part of the reason you want to fly by it

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.800
is to understand better what it is, if it's a threat.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.760
We have a lot of context now that we did it back then,

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.440
you know, and so it was still a,

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.360
hey, is this a balloon?

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.200
Is this a drone?

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.440
You know, at a certain point.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.600
And we're also aware of, you know,

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.360
potential intelligence gathering operations

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.040
that could be going on.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.600
We're up there flying our tactics.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:23.000
We're emitting, we're practicing our EW, you know,

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.440
we're turning at particular times.

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:25.680
Like there's stuff that can be learned.

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.520
It's not a secret.

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.960
And, you know, countries keep different fishing vessels

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:31.240
and whatnot in international waters off there.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.760
So it's not exactly a secret

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:35.360
that we're being observed out there.

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.080
So to think that a foreign hospital

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:40.240
or a foreign nation would want to, you know,

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.160
somehow intercept information,

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:46.760
whether that's our radar signals or our jamming capabilities

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:49.960
to try to break that down or understand it better,

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.800
be ready for that next fight.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:55.720
I mean, that's what scares me about this scenario

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:59.000
because we didn't jump right to aliens or UFOs.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
We thought, you know,

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.120
this is a radar malfunction we need to be aware of.

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:02.960
It's a safety issue.

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:04.160
And then, you know,

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.320
this could be a tactical problem right here

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:09.920
because everything we do is based off of crypto

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.960
and, you know, locations.

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.600
Everything's classified, we do out there, right?

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.560
And so over time, if you gather enough data

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:17.880
about those fights and just monitor them forever,

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:20.040
just like some nations do

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:23.080
with other pieces of technology or software,

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:25.560
they could probably learn a line.

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:27.120
So we have to be cognizant of the fact

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.200
and defend against it.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:32.640
So what can you say about the other characteristics

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:36.440
of these objects like shape, size,

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:43.360
texture, luminosity, how else do you describe object?

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.200
Is there something that could be said?

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.960
So you said that this is the Tectown radar, step one.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.000
Now you have clear images that can give you a sense

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.960
that that's actually a physical object.

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.720
What else can be said about those physical objects?

01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.480
So eventually someone did see one

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.640
with their own eyeballs, multiple people.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.760
And they saw it in a somewhat interesting way.

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.760
The object presented itself at the exact altitude

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.400
and geographic location of the entry points

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.240
into our working areas.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:16.240
So we enter at a very specific point at a certain altitude

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.120
and people leave the areas at the same point

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.680
at a lower altitude.

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:21.560
Probably one of the busiest pieces of sky

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:23.040
on the eastern seaboard.

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.760
So two jets from my squadron went out

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.560
and they went flying and they entered the area

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.560
and one of these objects went right between the aircraft.

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.280
So they're flying in formation

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.320
and the object went between the aircraft.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.680
They went between the object, I think.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.760
I don't think that the object was moving.

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.320
I don't think it aggressively went at them.

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:39.480
I think it was located still there

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.040
and then they flew through it.

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:43.720
But they didn't have it on their radar.

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:48.120
I think the radar might've been malfunctioning.

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.040
I don't know that for sure.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.360
I would like to look into it.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.600
But my supposition is that if their radar was malfunctioning

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.200
it would make sense that they wouldn't avoid

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.400
the object that was there

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:59.200
because they knew these were physical at that point.

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:02.080
And we would go up to these objects all the time

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:02.920
and try to see them.

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:05.400
We couldn't see them and we didn't know what it was.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.720
Was it, were they just not there or being fooled?

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:08.680
Was something happening?

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.160
Were they moving, dropping altitude at the last minute?

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:15.600
We're going by pretty quick, so it's difficult to tell.

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.000
But perhaps if his radar wasn't working

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.520
he wasn't receiving energy from the jet.

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:21.680
And the jet, of course, didn't know that he was there.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.160
And so whatever the case was, they flew right by

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:28.320
and they described it just as a dark gray or black cube

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:31.800
inside a clear translucent sphere.

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.440
And the apex of the little cube

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.440
were touching the inside of that sphere.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.520
That's an image that's haunting.

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:40.000
So what did they think it is?

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.320
What did they think at that moment that they,

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:46.000
is it just this kind of cloud of uncertainty

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.960
that they're just describing a geometric object?

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.840
It's not on radar, so it's unclear what it is.

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.640
Yeah, what was the, any kind of other description

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:01.400
they've had of it in terms of the intuition

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.800
from a pilot's perspective?

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.080
You know, you have to kind of identify

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:04.920
what a thing is.

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.000
To answer the first part,

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.920
they actually canceled the flight and came back

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:10.760
because they were, you know,

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:11.600
it's like if there's one of these out here

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.320
and one was hitting them and it's right there,

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:16.280
then perhaps we need to get a different jet

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.120
with better radar.

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.040
But so they came back and they're in their gear

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:21.040
and they're talking to the front desk

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.360
and talking to Skipper and like,

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:24.360
hey, we almost hit one of those damn things out there.

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:26.040
And this kind of was one of those

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.800
kind of slight watershed moments

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.120
where we all were kind of like, all right,

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:30.560
like this is a serious deal now.

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.400
Yeah.

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:32.880
Maybe it was a, maybe we thought,

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:36.160
maybe we thought they were balloons or drones

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.960
or malfunctions, or maybe we thought it was spying.

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:38.840
But at the end of the day,

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.000
if we're going to hit one of these things,

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.520
then we need to, you know,

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.440
we need to take care of the situation.

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:46.120
And that's actually when we started submitting

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.160
hazard reports or hazard reps to the Naval,

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.760
to the Naval Aviation Safety

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.640
kind of communication network.

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:56.560
And it's, you know, it's not like a big proactive thing

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:57.680
where people are going to investigate.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.320
It's more of a data collection mechanism

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:01.480
so that you can kind of share that aggregate data

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:03.880
and make sure that things are progressing.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:07.000
So it wasn't a mechanism that would result

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.440
in action being taken,

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.400
but we were hoping to at least get the message out

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.840
to whomever was maybe running a classified program

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:14.520
that we were not aware of or something like that,

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:16.320
that, hey, like you could kill somebody here.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:19.160
Like you've grown too big for your britches here.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.720
Take a step back.

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.720
So that was our concern at that point.

01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:25.080
That's kind of where we were thinking this was going.

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.360
What's the protocol for shooting at a thing?

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:31.360
Was there a concern that it's a direct threat,

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:35.480
not just surveillance, but a thing that could be, yeah,

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.320
a threat?

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.360
At least from my perspective,

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:39.480
like that never really crossed into my mind.

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:43.560
I thought it was potentially an intelligence, you know,

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.160
failure that could be being watched

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:46.800
and information gathered.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.400
But I didn't think that it was something

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:53.040
that would proactively engage me in a hostile manner.

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.320
It wouldn't really make sense either too.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.240
It would be shocking to like have one of these objects

01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.080
take out an F-18,

01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.400
but there's no real tactical advantage

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:01.640
other than fear, perhaps.

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.000
Psychological, yeah.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.120
I've learned a lot about the psychological warfare

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:11.640
in Ukraine as a big part of the war

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:14.000
in terms of when you talk about siege warfare,

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
about wars that last for many years, for many months,

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.600
and then perhaps could extend to years.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:24.800
But yes, it didn't seem,

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:29.800
it didn't fit your conception of a threatening entity.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:30.720
Correct.

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:34.000
So looking back now,

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.560
from all the pieces of data you've integrated,

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.160
you've personally added,

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:40.920
what do you think it could be?

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:42.920
I don't know.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.120
I don't know what it could be.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:47.080
I think we've been able to categorize it successfully

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.560
into a few buckets.

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.200
We've been able to say that, you know,

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:51.840
this could be US technology

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:55.880
that someone put in the wrong piece of sky,

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:58.080
or, you know, perhaps was developed

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.000
and tested in an inappropriate spot

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.840
by someone that wasn't paying best practices.

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:04.480
Is there, sorry to interrupt,

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:08.360
is there a sort of modularity to the way

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.040
the military operates,

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.520
the way it's possible for one branch

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:13.880
not to know about the tests of another?

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.640
Yeah, I think it's perfectly reasonable

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.680
to think that that could occur, right?

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:19.800
And so if we just make that assumption,

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.920
we can integrate that into our analysis here

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.400
and just say, okay, but at the point we're at now,

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.440
you know, we have to assume that that's not the case, right?

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:27.800
With everything that's been going on

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.280
and the statements have been made and the hearings,

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:35.280
I think that if it was a non-communication issue,

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.280
we're in big trouble at this point.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:40.480
What about it being an object from another nation,

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.680
from China, from Russia?

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.280
Or even one of our allies, perhaps, right?

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:46.400
Maybe that's, you know,

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:49.240
I don't think it's controversial to say

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:51.680
that our allies could be gathering information about us

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.520
or anything of that nature,

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:54.000
but that would be an extreme case,

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.760
but I think it's just important to say, right,

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.440
to not just say Russia or China

01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.680
and just call them the bad guys

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:01.600
and assume that if they don't have it, no one can do it.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.720
And so from my perspective, you know, anyone else,

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.440
anyone else, and it doesn't necessarily need to be

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:08.760
a foreign power, it could be a non-government entity,

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:10.880
perhaps, although I think that's very unlikely.

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.360
But again, these are things you must consider

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.720
if you kind of throw everything,

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.640
everything other than the US under scrutiny.

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:21.440
But, you know, from what has been reported

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.960
and the behaviors that have been seen,

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:26.760
it would be, I would expect to see remnants

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:29.960
of that technology elsewhere in the economy.

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.320
There seems to be too many things

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.680
that require advanced technology

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:37.920
that would be beneficial commercially

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.160
as well as in other military applications

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:42.240
for it to be completely locked away

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.200
by one of our competitors.

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.360
Now, I could see us perhaps locking something away

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.560
if we're already in the lead

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:50.600
and having it to pull out as needed.

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:53.520
But for someone that's perhaps in a power struggle

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.080
and they're in second place,

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.400
they might be more aggressive with the development

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:58.760
of different types of technology

01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.640
willing to accept bigger risks.

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:03.400
Do you think it could be natural phenomena

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:06.160
that we don't yet understand?

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.440
I think that there are a number of things

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:09.720
that this is going to be, right?

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:11.360
I don't think there's one thing at the end of the day,

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.360
but I certainly think that that is part

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.600
of what some of this could be.

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:17.640
I don't think it's what we were seeing on the East Coast,

01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:20.400
and I don't think it is related to the Roosevelt incident

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.000
or I'll even go out and say the Nimitz incident, but.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.520
What's the Roosevelt incident?

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:28.040
The Roosevelt incident typically referred to as the gimbal

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:29.520
and or the go fast video.

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:33.280
And then the Nimitz is from what the David Fravor

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.760
has witnessed directly and spoken about.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.160
We'll talk about that as well.

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:42.040
I'd just love to get your sort of interpretation

01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:43.720
of those incidents, but yeah.

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:45.560
So in this particular case,

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:48.720
natural phenomena could be a part of the picture,

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.920
but you're saying not the whole picture.

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.360
Yes, yes, and we can't discount it.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.440
Oh, the other thing is what about the failure

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:00.480
of pilot eyesight?

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:05.480
Like sort of some deep mixture of actual direct vision,

01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:10.960
human vision system failure and like psychology.

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:15.960
Like seeing something weird and then filling in the gaps

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.840
because in order to make sense of the weird.

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:25.840
I've tried to expose myself to scenarios like that

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:28.080
that I don't necessarily think are right,

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:31.360
but I've explored them to see if they could have some truth.

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:34.080
And one example is let's imagine a scenario

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.160
where if we're seeing these objects

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:37.440
every day off the East Coast,

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:40.040
I can imagine a technology or an operation

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:43.680
where you had some type of traditional propulsion system

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.000
operating drones in order to gather data

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.680
like we had discussed.

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.640
And I could envision a clever enough adversary

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:54.640
that could perhaps destroy or somehow remove these objects

01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:56.480
and replace them with new objects

01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:58.080
essentially when we're not looking, right?

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:02.480
And that accounts for the large airborne time.

01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:04.920
And so I explore options like that

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:08.280
and I try to see what evidence and assumptions

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:11.440
need to be made in order to prove or disprove that.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.640
And you would need so much infrastructure.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.360
You'd need so many assets.

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:18.720
And so I try to explore some of those fallacies

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.040
and some of those concerns.

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:23.200
And as aviators, we're trained into many

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:26.800
like actual physical eyesight and kind of illusion training.

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:28.520
So like at nighttime flying,

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:29.680
there's so many things that can happen

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:30.920
flying with false horizons.

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:34.880
And so we receive hours of training on that type of stuff,

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.320
but this just falls outside the category

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:38.400
from my perspective.

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:40.160
What was the visibility conditions

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:43.000
when in the times when people were able to see it?

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.960
And then we just earlier discussed

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:49.080
complete nighttime, darkness.

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:53.080
In this case, was it during the day?

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:56.080
It was a perfectly clear day that particular incident, yep.

01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:59.080
In a world that's full of mystery,

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:02.760
I have to ask, what do you think is the possibility

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:06.560
that it's not of this earth origin?

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:11.320
I like the term non-human intelligence in a sense,

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:16.080
because again, there's a lot of assumptions in there

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:18.960
that may cause us to go down the wrong roads.

01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:22.000
It could, these could be something

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.240
that are weather phenomena of earth, right?

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:26.240
Or something else that is just something

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:27.080
we don't understand.

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:30.320
I can't imagine right now that's still of this earth.

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.880
If we consider extraterrestrials

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:35.240
or something that came from a physical place

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:36.760
far away in space time,

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.880
that leads us to some detection assumptions

01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:41.000
that we would need to make.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.800
And so I just try to not categorize it under anything

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:47.080
and just say, hey, is this demonstrating intelligence

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:49.160
and start from there as a single object?

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.800
What can we learn about it kinematically?

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:51.640
How it's performing?

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:53.560
What does that mean for its energy source?

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.040
What does that mean for the G forces inside?

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:58.360
And then step it out a level and say, okay,

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.160
how are these interacting with our fighters?

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:02.160
If they are, how are they interacting with the weather

01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.360
and their environment?

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.920
How are they interacting with each other?

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.960
So can we look at these and how they're interacting

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:09.880
perhaps as a swarm, especially off the East coast

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:13.080
where this is happening all the time with multiple objects.

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.080
And so we might be able to determine some things

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.520
about their maybe sensor capabilities

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.960
or the areas of focus,

01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:21.200
if we can determine how they're working

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:22.760
in conjunction with each other.

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:25.160
But seeing one little flash of an object

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:27.000
doesn't provide that type of insight.

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:29.160
But we have the systems for it,

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.440
but it's kind of made on irony,

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.400
but it's a fact of life,

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:36.320
it's a reality that many of these well deployed,

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:40.120
highly capable systems are held under the military umbrella,

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:42.440
which makes it difficult to provide that data

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:44.480
for scientific analysis.

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:48.120
So there's probably a lot more data on these objects

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.600
that's not being, that's not made available

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.920
probably even within the military for analysis.

01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:55.960
I think so, yeah.

01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:58.800
I think there's a lot of data that could be made available.

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:02.640
And that's one of the reasons why I've been engaged

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:05.720
with the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:10.560
to build a large resources of cross domain expertise

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:13.120
so that if or when that data is available

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.800
or that there's additional analysis needed,

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.640
we can spin up those teams and make that analysis.

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:22.160
So there was a recently a house intelligence subcommittee

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:25.120
hearing on UFOs that you were a part of.

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:26.600
What was the goal of that hearing?

01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:30.840
And can you maybe summarize what you heard?

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:35.280
The hearings from my perspective seemed a bit disingenuous,

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.560
kind of top level.

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.720
I think-

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:39.440
Who was it run by, sorry to interrupt,

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.440
like who were the people involved

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.200
and what was the goal, the stated goal?

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:46.120
Congressman Andre Carson did chair the committee

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.200
and he was I think ultimately responsible

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.800
for bringing it all together.

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:51.480
You know, I think the intent from Congress

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:52.840
was to try to bring light

01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:55.280
to what has been happening with the Navy

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:58.040
and to help show the American people

01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.800
that Congress is taking this serious

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:02.760
because something serious is happening.

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.640
But the sense I got seemed a bit disingenuous.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:06.880
They talked around it a lot.

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:11.880
They advertised their love of science fiction,

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:15.120
but they didn't treat this, I would say,

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.600
in the manner it deserved as a potential tactical threat

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:20.240
if it's coming from a foreign power.

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:21.560
And I get it though, at the same day,

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:25.840
they have very specific objectives within the DOD, right?

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:27.320
They have a very important job.

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:29.840
Their job isn't necessarily to do exploratory science

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:30.680
for no reason.

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:35.400
So I applaud and I encourage their efforts

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:38.280
on the intelligence side to help understand this,

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:41.400
but my concern is that they play a role

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:44.400
they're not well suited for, which is doing science.

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:46.160
And the Pentagon has opened a new office

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:47.600
to investigate UFOs called

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:50.720
All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:52.360
What do you think about this office?

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:55.760
Do you think it can help alleviate in a way

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:58.840
which this hearing perhaps has failed

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:01.920
to improve more the scientific rigor

01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:05.160
and the seriousness of investigating UFOs?

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:07.680
I think that remains to be seen.

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:09.400
I think it's a step in the right direction,

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:10.880
but it's a step that was taken

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:14.080
because the previous step didn't happen, right?

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:18.720
So the AOIMSG was the progeny, essentially,

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:21.480
of the AARO or Aero.

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:25.920
And the name was changed because nothing was happening

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:29.120
and it was essentially just a confusing mess of words

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:31.720
that were created to make this topic unpalatable.

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.560
The Airborne Object Identification

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:38.320
Synchronization Management Group, quite the mouthful.

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.000
I practiced that.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.120
But the new All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office,

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:44.360
from my perspective at least,

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.280
at least the perspective that they're putting out,

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.280
they seem to wanna be open.

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:50.000
They've put out a Twitter handle,

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.400
they're going out on Twitter and communicating,

01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.640
saying they wanna keep this open.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:57.640
But that's gonna run into a classification wall.

01:30:57.640 --> 01:31:02.640
Well, so Dr. Sean Kropatchik seems like an interesting guy.

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.800
He does, yes.

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:09.000
So he's got a, Evan looked into deeply,

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.360
but he seems to have sort of,

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:15.800
he's coming from a science research background.

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:20.320
So he might be, at least in the right mindset,

01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:23.200
mindset, the right background

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.840
to kind of lead a serious investigation.

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:26.680
I think so.

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:28.360
I'll just say generally,

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:31.080
the office has been receptive to AIWA reaching out

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:35.040
in order to collaborate, which has been a positive sign.

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:38.560
Also pass the same kudos to Dr. Spergel

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:42.040
and NASA's effort as well.

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:44.760
I see these organizations that are standing up.

01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:47.800
I do see them as good faith efforts

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:51.920
that are coming about through a lot of difficulty

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.960
and negotiation most likely, right?

01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:57.360
And I see these as a small door opening

01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.640
that if we can take advantage of,

01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:01.760
can lead to a much more productive relationship

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.480
between these organizations.

01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:05.960
How do you put pressure on this kind of thing?

01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:08.280
Does it come from the civilian leadership?

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:10.760
Does it come from sort of Congress and presidents?

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:12.480
Does it come from the public?

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:15.320
Does the public have any power to put pressure on this?

01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:19.000
Or is the giant wall of bureaucracy

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.960
going to protect it against any public pressure?

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:22.880
What do you think?

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:25.880
I think we've been in that latter state for a while,

01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:29.080
but society seems to be a bit different nowadays.

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.400
We have the ability to communicate and to group

01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:34.600
and to form relationships in a way

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:37.520
that hadn't been able to be present in the past.

01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:39.560
We've been able to do research,

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.440
for better or worse, on our own

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.920
in a way that hasn't been able to happen before.

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:47.200
And so I sense that people are a bit less willing

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:49.280
to kind of buy the bottom line statement

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:52.280
from those in power as they used to be

01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:54.840
back when they didn't have access to those tools.

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:56.680
And so I do think there is a massive role

01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:59.600
for the general society, general populace to play

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:02.080
to show that they are interested in this.

01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:05.240
Because it's not that I don't think the politicians

01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:07.960
or the leaders in the Pentagon,

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:10.520
it's not that they don't like this topic necessarily

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:12.200
or think it's toxic per se,

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:15.040
but they exist in a culture where this has been toxic

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.840
and they don't feel comfortable talking about it.

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:19.400
And these are people that have spent their entire careers

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:20.360
working towards a goal

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:22.680
and getting to very high positions within government.

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.520
And so this is very against their nature

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.800
to take a stance on a topic like this.

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:30.640
And so the fact that these are standing up,

01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:32.560
even if they do have a small budget

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:34.360
or if they struggled a bit at first,

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:36.680
I still think it's a massive change

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:38.800
and it's a big step away from that stigma

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:41.680
that has been pervading this topic for so long.

01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:45.760
And you're actually part of alleviating the stigma

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:49.720
for somebody that's as credible, as intelligent,

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:53.160
as varied in background, able to speak about these things.

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:55.240
That's a big risk that you took,

01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:57.000
but it's extremely valuable

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.840
because it's alleviating the stigma.

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:00.760
I thank you for saying that,

01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:03.480
but it didn't feel like much of a risk for me.

01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:07.160
I didn't come out about aliens or whatever.

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:10.120
I had a safety problem that I started asking questions about.

01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.240
And I went down a road

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:15.680
as a Navy trained aviation safety officer, right?

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:17.000
That sent me to school for six weeks

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.840
in Pensacola to be a safety officer.

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:21.800
We're almost hitting these objects

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:23.920
and it's not something that happened in the past

01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:25.880
and we want to understand it, it's happening right now.

01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:28.320
Like these occurrences are still happening.

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.960
Aviators are flying right now,

01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:31.240
are still flying by these things.

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:34.760
And in fact, I mentioned I was a instructor pilot.

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:39.400
I had a student call me about eight months ago or so

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:43.760
and he's like, hey, sir, I made it to the fleet finally.

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:44.960
I had trained him how to fly.

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:47.880
And then he goes to F-18, he goes another year of training

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:50.160
and then he gets out to his squadron on the East coast

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:53.720
and he's flying with a senior member of the base,

01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:55.840
NES Oceania, where the fighters fly out of,

01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:58.440
senior 05 or 06.

01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.280
And it was kind of a bad weather day.

01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:02.360
And so they said, hey, if the weather's not good enough

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:04.240
for us to do this dog fighting set,

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.720
we'll go out and do a UAP hunt,

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:09.040
see if we can't find any aliens or take a look at them.

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.440
I don't know if it was ingest or not,

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:14.280
but I actually would say it's not ingest

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:16.800
because there were notices that were being briefed

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.880
about this being a safety hazard at this point.

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:23.080
And so now that I think about it, it likely wasn't ingest.

01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:24.560
Long story short, they went flying.

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:25.880
The weather was too bad.

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:28.880
They did go on a UAP hunt and they physically saw one.

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:30.160
And he called me up and he's like,

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:31.520
hey, sir, I saw a cube and a sphere.

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:33.400
They're still out here years later.

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.760
And so it's almost like a generational issue

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:38.000
for these fighter pilots, at least on these coasts.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.880
But that's great that they can talk about it, right?

01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:41.080
Exactly, exactly.

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:42.200
They feel at least comfortable.

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.880
They have a reporting mechanism.

01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:46.080
And so that was one of the problems that I noticed

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.680
that we have a lot of reporting mechanisms

01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:51.120
to take care of safety issues

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:53.720
and even tactical issues when the time's right

01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:55.840
in order to keep track of what's going on.

01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:58.400
But there's no way to communicate about this.

01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:00.880
Sure, we could submit a hazard report,

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:03.320
but nothing's actually being investigated.

01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:07.200
And if this is a tactical vulnerability or something more,

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:09.040
it deserves attention.

01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:13.720
If I could ask your sort of take your opinion

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:17.280
of the different UFO sightings

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:19.680
that the DOD has released videos on.

01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:22.640
So what do you think about the Tic Tac UFO

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:26.000
that David Fravor and others have sighted?

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.800
That's a truly anomalous experience.

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:35.360
I can't do like mental models in my head

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.600
to find potential solutions to discredit that, right?

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:40.800
Like as much as I try, right?

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:42.600
Just as a logical process, as a practice,

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:45.200
I can't pick it apart in the way

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:46.480
that we were just talking about a moment ago

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:49.280
about thousands of drones being like sent up

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.360
in very tricky manners, right?

01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:53.560
I can't really bring myself to a clever solution

01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:56.320
that other than just saying the pilots are lying

01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:57.960
or it was error, you know?

01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:01.000
And I believe, I know Dave Fravor,

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.240
I consider him a friend, we talk a lot.

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:07.040
I have zero reason to disbelieve anything he says.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:10.720
Yeah, I agree with you.

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:14.160
But in terms of the actual UFO,

01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:18.520
is there something anomalous and interesting to you

01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:20.000
about that particular case?

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.880
Maybe one interesting aspect there is

01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:28.400
how much do I understand about the water surface

01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:30.600
and underwater aspects of these UFOs?

01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:32.440
It seems like a lot of the discussions

01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:36.240
is about the movement of this particular thing

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:40.400
that seems to be weird, anomalous, seems to defy physics.

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:42.160
But what about stuff that's happening underwater?

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.840
That's interesting to me.

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.480
If I had advanced technology,

01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:49.480
I would certainly like to operate in part underwater

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:51.680
because you can hide a lot of stuff there.

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:54.200
You think it would be somewhat as easy as traveling

01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.080
through interstellar space, at least, right?

01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:56.920
Yeah.

01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.120
I wish I had a great answer for that,

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:04.920
but as an aviator, that's kind of a black box for us.

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:06.800
We don't have great what I would call

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:08.200
cross-domain tracking, right?

01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:09.880
I can't see something go underwater

01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:11.440
and then follow it underwater.

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:12.880
So it's literally not your domain,

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:15.480
like underwater, like leave it out for somebody else.

01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:17.560
Yeah, and I use that terminology

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:20.040
because it's kind of important, right?

01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:22.160
Cross-domain tracking is something

01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:23.760
that we haven't had to necessarily worry about, right?

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.880
Because airplanes operated in the air

01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:28.440
and submarines operated underwater

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:30.360
and space planes operate in space, right?

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:34.280
But there's gonna be, that's gonna blur, I think,

01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:35.840
as we move along here,

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:38.360
especially in the air and space regime.

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:41.880
And being able to perhaps transition my radar contact

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:44.760
at 40,000 feet to another radar system

01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:47.000
that can track it up to 200,000 feet,

01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:48.840
that might be of value.

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:51.360
And so we seem to be missing that right now.

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.760
So what about the go fast and the gimbal videos

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.520
that you mentioned earlier?

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:57.960
What's interesting there to you?

01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:01.120
So the gimbal, I'll talk about that one first.

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.840
I was airborne for that one.

01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:06.000
The person that recorded it is a good friend of mine.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.520
But I mean, both air crew, I knew both of them,

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:10.120
but the Wizard himself, very close friends with,

01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:12.080
went through a lot of her training together.

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:14.600
We went to the same fleet squadron.

01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.800
He ended up transitioning to be a pilot

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:19.440
and then came to where I was instructing.

01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:21.960
So I got to instruct him a bit on his transition.

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:26.360
And the way that was was we went out

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:28.920
on a air to air training mission.

01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:33.120
So simulating a air fight against our own guys.

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:34.280
They're acting like the bad guys

01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:36.680
and kind of go head to head against each other.

01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:38.000
And when we fly on those missions,

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.560
we all fly out together, more or less.

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.320
We set up and then we kind of a trite from the fight

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.080
as we either run out of gas or something happens.

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.120
And so people usually go back onesies or twosies.

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:51.760
And so the air crew that recorded the gimbal,

01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:53.040
they were going back to the boat

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:55.440
and we were on what's called a workup training event.

01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:57.720
And so this is like a month on the boat

01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:00.680
where we're essentially conducting wartime operations,

01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:03.440
more or less, to stress ourselves out

01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:06.320
and to kind of do the last training block

01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:07.560
before we go on deployment essentially.

01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.360
So it's pretty high stress.

01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:12.800
They actually do send aircraft from like land bases

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:14.440
to kind of try to penetrate

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:16.040
and we're expected to go intercept them.

01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:18.640
And so we're kind of practicing like we play.

01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:21.720
And so he saw these objects on the radar,

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:27.240
the gimbal and a fleet of other aircraft or vehicles.

01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:29.520
And they initially thought it was part

01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:31.840
of the training exercise that they were sending something

01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:35.160
in to try to penetrate the airspace.

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:37.200
And so they flew over to it.

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:40.440
And as they got close enough to get out on the FLIR,

01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:43.120
I think everyone has heard their reaction

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:44.520
and they realized that it wasn't something

01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:46.120
they were expecting to see.

01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:47.520
Can you actually describe what's in the video

01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:49.920
and what's the reaction in case they haven't seen it?

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:51.520
Yeah, a lot of swearing.

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:56.000
So what you see on the FLIR footage is a black or white,

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.200
depending on when you look at it,

01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:59.480
object that's somewhat shaped like a gimbal.

01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:02.680
It appears almost as if someone put two plates together

01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:05.880
and then there seems to be almost like a small funnel

01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:08.280
of IR energy that's at the top of the bottom

01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:09.640
of those plates in a sense.

01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:11.560
So almost as if, you know,

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:13.240
there's a stick going in between two plates,

01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:14.600
but not that pronounced, right?

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:16.320
So there's an energy field that kind of went

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:17.760
to a funnel on the top and the bottom.

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:20.360
At least that's how it's being portrayed on the FLIR.

01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:23.280
There's a lot of conversation about that being glare,

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:24.120
things of that nature,

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:26.520
but it was actually a very tight IR image.

01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:30.400
It just was nondescript shape, which was interesting.

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:32.840
Typically we would see the skin of the aircraft.

01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:35.040
We can see the flames coming out of the exhaust,

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:36.360
especially at those ranges.

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.960
And there was no flames or there's no exhaust here?

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.000
There was no exhaust.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.520
There was no, you know,

01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:45.600
there was no outgassing of repellent in any manner, right?

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:48.400
It was just an object that had nothing emitting from it

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:49.880
that was stationary in the sky.

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:50.720
Well, not stationary,

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:53.760
but it was moving along a path, right?

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:55.960
It wasn't falling out of the sky.

01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:57.120
And it continued along,

01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:59.440
if we were to consider it from a God's eye view,

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:00.960
again, on the SA page,

01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:02.800
it continued along in a path.

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:05.760
And from the perspective, that top down view,

01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:07.120
it just went in the other direction.

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:10.760
So no instantaneous direction change

01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:12.000
from that perspective.

01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:14.200
You also hear them, you know,

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:17.680
very excitedly talking on the tapes about, you know,

01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:18.960
whatever the heck this thing is,

01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:22.840
and look at the SA, there's a whole formation of them.

01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:25.880
And so the SA is a situational awareness page.

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:27.120
And again, it's a large display

01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:29.920
that gives that God's eye view of all the radar contacts.

01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:32.480
So the video is actually showing just one,

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:36.000
and then they're speaking about many of them

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.040
on the SA display.

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:38.880
Correct.

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:40.600
And what they essentially saw was,

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:42.920
if we were to consider above the object north,

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:46.400
so kind of offset to the north of the object,

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.320
there was a formation of about somewhere between four

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:51.360
and six of these objects in a rough wedge formation,

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:54.520
you know, so kind of side by side like this.

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:57.440
And again, not in a like autopilot type manner

01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:58.320
where it was very stiff.

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:00.680
It was very kind of non-mechanical,

01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:02.640
the flight mechanics again.

01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:04.480
And these objects were in that formation

01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.520
and they were going along.

01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:07.680
And then they turned pretty sharply,

01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:09.680
but they still had a radius of turn

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:11.560
and then went back in the opposite direction.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.320
And during that turn,

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:14.600
they were kind of like all over the place.

01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:15.640
Like it wasn't tight.

01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:17.280
They weren't even like super,

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:18.960
they weren't flying in a way I would expect them

01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:20.880
to be flying in relation to a flight lead.

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:23.040
They were flying as if they were flying close

01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:24.480
to each other, but not in formation,

01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:26.080
which was kind of strange, right?

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:28.160
And then when they rolled out,

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:29.320
they kind of tightened backed up.

01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:31.600
Like, so when they basically, they started that turn

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:32.920
and then 180 degrees out,

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:35.600
essentially they started flowing in the opposite direction

01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:37.480
and kind of got back in that formation.

01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:38.840
And while that was happening,

01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:40.520
the gimbal object was proceeding,

01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:41.800
was they left or right?

01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:45.880
And as those, the formation kind of turned up to the north

01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:47.360
and was just passing back it,

01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:49.840
the gimbal just kind of went back in the opposite direction.

01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:52.080
So to follow it back in that direction.

01:43:54.080 --> 01:43:55.960
And in the FLIR itself,

01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:59.000
you see the object changes orientation quite a bit.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.440
So you see it more or less level,

01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:03.520
maybe candid about 45 degrees.

01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:06.360
And then you see it kind of moving around like this,

01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:08.320
almost as if it was a gimbal.

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:12.000
I've come to learn after some,

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.680
having seen some research online

01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:15.880
and people really looking into this,

01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:19.000
that it seemed that the object actually climbed

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000
during that maneuver.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.200
And so the reason it looked like it turned immediately

01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:24.520
is because it turned like this.

01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:26.720
It turned in a vertical fashion like that,

01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:28.320
which was pretty interesting.

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:31.760
That's kind of like another example of a flight mechanics

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:33.280
that we don't normally operate

01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:36.040
because we don't change our directions

01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:38.680
by maneuvering in the vertical, if we can help it.

01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:41.560
It's, you're just killing the fuel, you know?

01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:44.800
And so if you're like a surveillance platform

01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:46.640
looking to spend as much time around something,

01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:51.280
you're not gonna climb 500 feet every time you make a turn.

01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:53.480
Unless you're Tom Cruise.

01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:55.000
Unless you're Tom Cruise, naturally.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.080
Okay, so is that one of the more impressive

01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:00.400
flight mechanics you've seen in video forms

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:03.040
and not the direct eyesight reports,

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:05.640
but like in terms of video evidence that we have?

01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:06.840
I think so.

01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:08.600
We were seeing a lot of these,

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:10.840
but we weren't just going on recording them all day.

01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:13.040
We just kind of put them in that safety bucket.

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:14.280
Be like, all right, there's objects over there.

01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:16.200
We're just not gonna go near it, you know?

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:19.040
And so we weren't putting our sensors on them that much.

01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:21.360
We were gathering the data kind of secondarily,

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:23.280
but we weren't primarily focusing on it

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:24.760
to see all the details, so.

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:27.400
That's so fascinating because you have a busy day.

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:28.920
You have a lot to do.

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:31.320
All right, well, there's some weird stuff going on there.

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.720
We're just not gonna go there.

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:35.120
And that says something about sort of the,

01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:39.960
about human nature, about the way that bureaucracy's

01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:42.000
functioning, the way the military functions.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.880
It fills up your day with busy, important things,

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:48.040
and you don't get to, I mean, that is something

01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:52.200
that I'm in a sort of absurd way worry about,

01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:56.840
which is like, we fill our days with so much busyness

01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:59.600
than when truly beautiful things happen,

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:01.840
whatever they are, truly anomalous things,

01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:03.280
we just won't pay attention

01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:07.800
because they don't fit our busy schedule.

01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:10.360
It's beautiful, and I think that's right on the nose,

01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:12.400
and it's on my nose because, you know,

01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:15.280
I didn't give this topic the attention it deserved

01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:16.920
until I left, right, until I left

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:19.480
and I went to be an instructor pilot

01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:21.840
where I had more time, you know,

01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:24.840
I had more downtime to kind of process and think

01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:27.480
and get out of exactly what you just described.

01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:29.360
And that's kind of what broke me out of it

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:31.360
and got me thinking more about it.

01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:33.760
Why do you think the DOD released these videos?

01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:36.080
That's a great question.

01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.320
Did the DOD release it or they kind of get out

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:39.560
on their own in some sense?

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:41.240
So I don't know the answer to that question,

01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:44.800
but my understanding of the situation is that the DOD

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:45.880
talked about them so much

01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:47.760
because they're already out there in a sense.

01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:50.160
And so, you know, they had a choice

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:51.360
where they could have just straight up lied

01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:52.960
and said it wasn't theirs or it was fake.

01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:56.280
But again, I think our culture now is too open

01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:59.600
and the information moves too freely to do things like that.

01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:00.760
And it kind of left them in a pickle

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:02.720
that they had to respond to.

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:05.520
So what was the role of Pentagon's

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:09.240
Advanced Aerospace Threat Intelligence Program, ATIP?

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:11.560
From your perspective, from what you know, baby,

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:14.960
your intuition, is ATIP a real thing that existed?

01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:16.840
I was in a position as an aviator

01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:20.160
that never would have exposed me to anything like that.

01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:22.520
But I was curious about what people knew.

01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:26.120
And I think in my mind, maybe hoped her, you know,

01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:27.880
hoped someone was looking into this in some sense.

01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:31.040
But on the day that Gimbal was recorded,

01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:34.120
I heard that they caught something extra interesting

01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:35.200
on the FLIR.

01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:40.200
And I went to the Intel debrief space to go see the film.

01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:43.200
And, you know, everyone's gathered around,

01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:44.280
watching it, very interesting.

01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:45.960
And I heard the admiral's coming down.

01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.760
And so I was like, I'm gonna hang out back, you know,

01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:49.520
quietly minding my own business and see,

01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:51.040
I just want to see his reaction and try to read it

01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:52.680
to see if this is brand new

01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:54.600
or if it is something that they've been dealing with,

01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:55.640
you know.

01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:57.760
And, you know, he came in and he watched a video

01:47:57.760 --> 01:47:58.920
for like five or six seconds.

01:47:58.920 --> 01:47:59.880
And they went, hmm.

01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:01.200
And then they turned around and walked out.

01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:02.320
And, you know, I was like,

01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:04.320
he's definitely seen these before.

01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:06.320
There's no way that you only watch that for a few seconds

01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:08.200
and don't have more interest.

01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:09.880
It was, you know, too bizarre.

01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:12.920
So kind of going back, does the office exist?

01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:17.240
Well, you know, I've heard that the admiral essentially

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:22.640
reported back to the Pentagon about that case real time,

01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:23.920
essentially, after he left, right?

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:26.480
So he basically went back and I was told he reported that

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:29.400
to either ATEP directly or to other, you know,

01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:30.640
somehow the information got there.

01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:33.880
So from my perspective and from what I've experienced,

01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:36.760
it seems like, yes, it was a thing,

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:40.160
but, you know, as an aviator, I wouldn't know either way,

01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:41.000
right?

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:41.880
That's just my experience from what happened.

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:45.520
But it seems like there's somewhere to report to.

01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:48.160
At the time, it seemed like there was at least

01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:50.480
some place to complain to, if not report to.

01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:54.200
Let me ask you about sort of people

01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:56.600
that are taking a serious look at the videos

01:48:56.600 --> 01:48:59.880
and just the different UFO sighting reports.

01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:03.800
So there's a person named Mick West who is a skeptic

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:05.480
and tries to take a skeptical view

01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:08.960
on every single piece of evidence on these UFO sightings.

01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:11.040
What do you think about his analysis?

01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:14.640
He tries to analyze in a way that debunks some of these

01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:18.560
videos and assign probabilities to their explanations,

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:23.560
sort of leaning towards things that give a very low point

01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:29.200
probability to alien, extraterrestrial type

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:31.320
of explanations for these UFOs.

01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:35.560
What do you think about his approach to these analysis?

01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:37.280
Well, two parts to his approach.

01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:39.800
One, I commend him for all the good work and effort

01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:41.240
he put into it.

01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:44.080
I've seen him build some models and things of that nature.

01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:46.920
And so I think that's something that's absolutely needed

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:47.760
in this environment.

01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:50.560
No one's asking anyone to believe anyone here, right?

01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:55.120
Trust but verify should certainly be the mantra.

01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:58.240
But where I have a disagreement with his approach

01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:03.240
is that he's approaching from a debunker standpoint.

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:06.160
From my perspective, not speaking for everyone,

01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:09.960
but when I hear that, that tells me that you're driving

01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:12.320
towards a particular conclusion,

01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:16.560
which has been a very safe process for the past X years,

01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:17.400
right?

01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:19.400
It's been like a very safe business to be in

01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:21.400
to tell people that they haven't seen aliens,

01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:23.960
but times have changed a little bit.

01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:28.960
And the tactics I've seen to try to retain that view

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:34.960
on reality has included things such as completely

01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:36.760
dismissing what the aircrew are saying.

01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:40.800
And I think that is a fallacy to think that we have to take

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:42.800
the human outside of that analysis.

01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:45.480
So those are the two things I disagree with.

01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:48.720
When you put the night vision on and you look at the stars

01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:51.520
and you look out there in the vast cosmos,

01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:53.680
only a small fraction of which we can see,

01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:57.560
how many intelligent alien civilizations

01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:58.840
do you think are out there?

01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:00.200
Do you think about this kind of stuff?

01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:01.640
I do.

01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:03.280
You know, I'm of the theory that we are not

01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:04.120
the only people out there.

01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:06.920
I think it would be a statistically silly comment

01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:09.240
to assume we are, although I get that we are

01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:11.160
the only data point that we currently have.

01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:13.840
Although I'm willing to jump over that fence

01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:16.640
and say that yes, there most likely is intelligent life

01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:19.960
elsewhere, although I'll concede that it is a possibility

01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:23.440
we are early or it could be limited or it could be

01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:25.520
in a manner that we don't recognize

01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:27.120
or can really understand.

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:30.640
I spend so much time thinking about how we

01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:34.080
anthropomorphize things on this UFO topic.

01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:36.320
And we've done it to ourselves with media in a sense, right?

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:38.680
We've trained ourselves what to think about,

01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:41.920
what we think is true or what this would be like.

01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:44.800
And by doing so, I think we're closing ourselves off

01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:47.760
to a lot of what the possibilities could be

01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:49.440
and the things that we could miss.

01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:54.520
You beautifully put that the thing that drew you

01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:57.160
to fighter jets is the technology.

01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:01.160
So if you were to think, to imagine from an alien

01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:05.600
perspective, what kind of technologies would we first

01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:09.000
encounter as human beings if we were to meet

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.200
another alien civilization in the next few centuries?

01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:15.880
What kind of thing would we see?

01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:18.200
So you're now at the cutting edge and you see

01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:20.800
the quick progress that's happening, that was happening

01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:23.160
throughout the 20th century, that's happening now

01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:25.520
with greater degrees of autonomy, with robots

01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:26.600
and that kind of stuff.

01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:29.000
What do you think we will encounter?

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.160
I think we're gonna see the ability to manipulate

01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:34.680
matter like we used to manipulate information.

01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:38.560
Like I think that's what, whether that means being able

01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:41.440
to pop something on the table that didn't exist

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:45.400
or to influence a chemical reaction somewhere

01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:49.360
but being able to manipulate and treat matter

01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:51.080
as if it was information.

01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:53.760
And so being able to design specific materials,

01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:57.640
being able to move past a lot of the barriers

01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:00.080
that seem to limit our progress with things such as

01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:03.120
miniaturized fusion or even just fusion in general

01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:07.080
is a lot of it is matter-based, is material-based

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:11.040
and our ability to not manipulate.

01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:13.520
We can only discover materials in a sense.

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:17.040
And so I think that a complete mastery of physical reality

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:21.200
would be one of the key traits of a very intelligent species.

01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:23.000
Well, you're actually working on some,

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.560
maybe you can correct me, but sort of quantum mechanical

01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:28.040
simulation to understand materials.

01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:31.280
So is that, do you see sort of the early steps

01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:33.800
that we're doing at quantum computing side

01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:37.220
to start to simulate, to deeper understand materials

01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:39.840
but maybe to engineer and to mess with materials

01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:43.480
at the very low level that aliens will be able to do

01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:46.520
and hopefully humans would be able to do soon?

01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:50.120
Yeah, I think that's, you know, so if we think about

01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:52.280
how what materials are made of,

01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:53.880
it's just a collection of atoms.

01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:55.560
But each one of those atoms has a lot of data

01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:56.400
associated with it.

01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:57.840
So if we want to kind of calculate

01:53:57.840 --> 01:53:59.920
how they interact with each other,

01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:02.440
it requires a massive amount of computational resources,

01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:04.600
so much so that it can't be done in a lot of cases

01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:06.120
with classical computers.

01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:09.120
And that's where quantum computers come in.

01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:10.880
Although we don't have a perfectly functioning

01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:13.120
quantum computer at this point,

01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:14.640
one of the things that we're working at

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:17.040
at Quantum General Materials is to essentially bridge

01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:19.640
that gap between what a classical computer can do

01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:21.440
as far as simulating materials

01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:23.720
and of course what a fully functioning quantum computer

01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:26.360
would mean for being able to design materials.

01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:29.880
And so, you know, having the ability to study matter

01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:31.160
at a very fundamental level

01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:32.960
and unleashing artificial intelligence

01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:35.200
and machine learning on that problem,

01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:38.640
I think is, you know, in a sense, you know, alien in a way

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:42.000
that we're able to advance our science using, you know,

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.760
a process that we may not fully understand

01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:47.200
with perhaps a non-human-based intelligence in some sense.

01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:50.240
And so we may find patterns in the processes, right?

01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:52.360
How does our machine learning output, you know,

01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:56.000
can we match behaviors with what we're observing

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.040
with what maybe a machine learning algorithm with output,

01:54:58.040 --> 01:54:58.880
right?

01:54:58.880 --> 01:54:59.840
Can we try to classify the intelligence

01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:01.120
in that manner perhaps?

01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:03.400
And so, you know, at GenMass,

01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:05.280
we're looking at these materials.

01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:06.840
We're considering what these algorithms

01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:09.160
could have used for later on.

01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:10.760
Could we perhaps reverse the process

01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:14.080
and determine what a unique or anomalous material,

01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:16.800
what type of properties it potentially could have?

01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:19.400
And you said GenMAT, right?

01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:22.600
What's, what is GenMAT?

01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:24.520
GenMAT is a quantum generative material.

01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:27.120
So it's the company I work for.

01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:31.680
We essentially are working on a couple of verticals.

01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:33.960
One of them is our quantum chemistry work.

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:35.840
We're essentially, we're bridging the gap

01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:38.240
between essentially physics and chemistry.

01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:41.400
We're working on those problems and again,

01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:43.320
implementing artificial intelligence machine learning

01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:45.680
into that process so that we can design those materials

01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:47.080
from the ground up.

01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:50.560
Additionally, we are what we consider

01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:52.600
a vertically integrated material science company,

01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:55.320
which means we can generate our own data.

01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:59.520
And so within the next quarter coming up,

01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:02.520
we are launching a satellite in the space.

01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:05.600
They'll have a fairly advanced hyperspectral sensor in there,

01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:08.240
which is intended to be the first launch

01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:11.920
that will help us detect different types of materials

01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:16.040
using our advanced knowledge of quantum chemistry, right?

01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:17.440
We're gonna be leveraging that experience

01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:19.600
in order to better analyze that data.

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:20.440
Oh, interesting.

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:25.440
So materials that are strange or novel out there in space.

01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:28.560
Not necessarily, but we'll be looking back at Earth

01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:30.920
and be able to detect deposits on Earth.

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:31.880
Got it, got it.

01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:34.400
Getting the greater perspective from out in space

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:36.440
to do analysis of different materials.

01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:37.440
Interesting.

01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:40.240
Yeah, I was really impressed by the DeepMind.

01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:41.800
I got to hang out at DeepMind recently

01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:43.440
and they really impressed me

01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:45.680
at the possibility of the application,

01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:47.480
as you were saying, of machine learning

01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:50.480
in the context of quantum chemical simulation

01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:53.560
for materials, so to understand materials.

01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:56.400
It's really, really, really interesting.

01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:59.880
So, manipulate matter, huh?

01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:02.280
I would say the next thing is horses, right?

01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:03.120
Or maybe fields.

01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:07.600
So, manipulating or managing gravity,

01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:12.320
can we maneuver within fields in some manner

01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:16.080
that allows us to perhaps move propellant-less

01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:17.040
or in other manners, right?

01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:21.200
And so, I think essentially having a deeper understanding

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:25.160
of different fields and being able to interact with them,

01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:29.680
I think would be a potential avenue for travel,

01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:31.200
or advanced travel, right?

01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:32.560
Propellant-less travel.

01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:36.280
Can we quantum entangle gravity fields together

01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:39.120
and propel a ship by the gravity field of a planet,

01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:41.640
the mass of a planet, and a drive on a ship?

01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:44.600
These are all sorts of interesting things, but...

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:46.840
Yeah, people will look back at people like you

01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:49.360
and say, wow, they used to fly

01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:51.280
like with this kind of propellant.

01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:54.160
It seems like to be a very antiquated way of flying.

01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:55.760
And they were very impressed with themselves,

01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:58.600
these humans, that they could fly like birds.

01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:02.040
It's like so much energy is used

01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:05.200
to fly such short distances from that perspective.

01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:07.280
We can only throw so many rocks at the back.

01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:08.320
There needs to be a better way.

01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:09.160
Exactly.

01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:11.440
It just seems dumb, like these...

01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:14.440
It's like Flintstones or something like that.

01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:16.440
We're getting good at it, but there's a limit, right?

01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:18.160
Like we need new science.

01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:21.840
I mean, that's an interesting sort of trade-off.

01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:24.800
How much do you invest in getting really good at it?

01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:29.840
I tend to believe the reason why it would be very important

01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:32.160
and very powerful to put a human on Mars

01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:35.560
is not necessarily for the exploration facet,

01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:39.040
but in all the different technologies that come from that.

01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:44.200
There's something about putting humans in extreme conditions

01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:46.960
where we figure out how to make it less extreme,

01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:51.600
more comfortable, and for that, we invent things

01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:55.400
like the DOD sort of helping invent the internet

01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:58.080
and all the different technologies we've invented.

01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:00.080
It's almost like an indirect consequence

01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:01.880
of solving difficult problems,

01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:05.200
whether that problem means winning wars

01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:07.360
or colonizing other planets.

01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:10.480
And so I don't think Mars will help us figure out

01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:13.560
proportional systems or to crack open physics

01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:16.240
to where you can travel close to the speed of light

01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:17.840
or faster than the speed of light,

01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:19.840
but it will help us figure out

01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:23.240
how to build some cool technology here on Earth, I think.

01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:27.000
So I'm a big proponent of doing really difficult things,

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.600
really difficult engineering things

01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:32.680
to see what kind of technologies emerge from that.

01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:34.800
But let me ask you this.

01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:39.600
Do you think US government is hiding some technology

01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:42.560
like alien spacecraft technology?

01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:45.960
I have no information either way.

01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:49.120
And if you did, you probably wouldn't tell me.

01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:52.680
But my assumptions, like what did my heart tell me?

01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:54.800
My heart tells me something's going on,

01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:56.720
but I have no evidence for that.

01:59:56.720 --> 01:59:58.640
Maybe that's me wanting something to go on.

01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:01.680
Maybe that's a human feeling to want to know

02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:03.040
that my government's in control

02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:05.360
of what some strange unknown thing is.

02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:09.760
What's your sense if such a thing happened?

02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:12.800
Would this kind of information leak?

02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:15.680
Would this kind of information be released by the government?

02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:17.000
I mean, that's the worry that you have

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:18.840
is because when you don't understand a thing

02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:20.680
and it's novel, you want to hide it

02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:25.080
so that some kind of enemy doesn't get access to it

02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:26.280
and use it against you.

02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:29.840
I wonder if that is the underlying assumption.

02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:31.560
It's the one people always jump to,

02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:35.240
that it's to maintain secrecy of technology,

02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:36.640
and I assume that's part of it.

02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:38.040
I wonder if there's any other reasons

02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:40.400
that we would want to not talk about it.

02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:43.360
I imagine that such information would have a shock

02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:46.720
to the social economic system of any country,

02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:48.120
if not the world.

02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:51.960
So I wonder if perhaps that was part of the concern as well,

02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:53.800
how society can react to it.

02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:56.040
Maybe we're anti-fragile enough now

02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:57.800
with everything that's going on

02:00:57.800 --> 02:00:59.880
and with our communication networks that,

02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:02.800
why not now?

02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:06.160
I don't know, but that's something I think about as well.

02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:10.720
Yeah, the effect on the mass psyche

02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:13.120
of something like this,

02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:16.760
that there's another intelligence out there.

02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:22.120
We had trouble enough to deal with a pandemic,

02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:25.160
to have something of this scale,

02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:30.880
basically having just an inkling of a phenomena

02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:32.480
that we have no understanding of

02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:35.360
and could lead to complete destruction of human civilization

02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:38.000
or a flourishing of it.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.840
And what do you do?

02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:42.960
What does a bureaucracy of government do with that?

02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:45.680
Especially when they're the ones holding a range of power

02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:48.480
and such a communication would relinquish that power,

02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:50.240
essentially, to some degree.

02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:55.160
Since you think there's aliens out there

02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:01.240
and you're somebody that's thought about war quite a bit,

02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:05.360
do you think alien civilizations,

02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:07.280
when we meet them, would want war?

02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:10.600
Would they be a danger to us?

02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:12.200
Would they be a friend to us?

02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:16.960
What's your intuition about intelligences out there?

02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:21.040
My intuition tells me that when two people like yourself

02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:23.480
and myself or anyone get together,

02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:26.840
often the output is greater than the individuals.

02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:30.520
And when we work together, we can typically do things

02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:32.000
that are more impressive and better

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.800
than if a single person works alone.

02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:40.680
And now I know that war has driven technological progress

02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:46.320
but perhaps there's other mechanisms that can do so.

02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:50.640
But regardless, I wonder if we truly think about

02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:53.680
an advanced society that has been perhaps thousands

02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:55.920
or millions of years ahead of us,

02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:59.560
I would imagine that same truth to be there,

02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:02.760
that people working together, creatures working together

02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:07.760
is a good thing for society or its society as a whole.

02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:09.800
And if we consider that,

02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:14.400
as we imagine the society growing and expanding,

02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:17.000
in a sense, the ultimate output of a planet

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.640
could only be achieved in some senses

02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:21.080
if everyone was working towards the same goal.

02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:24.760
And there might be wonders and secrets and things

02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:27.320
that we can't imagine just simply because of the timeframes

02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:30.320
that we live under and we think in.

02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:33.560
But if a planet has a single unit

02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:36.440
and it almost is as an entity itself at a certain level,

02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:38.760
if everything's working towards the same output,

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:40.960
I could almost imagine an intelligent species

02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:43.360
that approached us planet to planet

02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:44.760
instead of person to person

02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:46.040
because that's how they've evolved

02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:47.800
and they've assumed any intelligent species

02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:51.120
would understand that working together is better than not.

02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:55.520
And so my heart tells me that at a certain point,

02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:00.320
love and caring and desire to work together

02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:03.920
is much more powerful than the technological progress

02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:04.960
that war would bring.

02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:07.960
I hope so as well.

02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:10.800
Well, let me jump to the AI topic that you've done.

02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:13.040
So you've done research and development efforts

02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:14.880
focused on multi-agent intelligence

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:18.440
for collaborative autonomy, machine learning AI stuff

02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:21.400
that we've been talking about for combat,

02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:24.880
for air-to-air combat, man-on-man teaming technologies,

02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:26.440
all that kind of stuff.

02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:28.480
What's some interesting ideas in the space

02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:30.240
that fascinate you?

02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:34.560
Randomness, being able to not predict

02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:36.840
what the enemy is doing almost no matter what,

02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:38.120
because there's a level of randomness

02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:39.960
that's within the tactical envelope.

02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:42.400
The utility of randomness.

02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:44.920
The utility of randomness in an increasing...

02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:46.440
Sounds like a book you should write.

02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:49.240
I think it'd be a good title.

02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:50.440
Name my band.

02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:52.000
Name your band, yeah.

02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:55.320
So yeah, can you elaborate that?

02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:57.560
So like trying to deeper understand

02:04:57.560 --> 02:05:02.280
how you can integrate randomness through AI

02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:03.920
in the context of combat.

02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:06.200
In order to make yourself...

02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:07.920
In order to take away the enemy's ability

02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:09.840
to try to predict what you're gonna do

02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:12.640
to disrupt their technological progress cycles

02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:16.120
so that they don't have a clear target to aim at.

02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:17.720
And if you don't have a clear target to aim at,

02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:18.880
it's hard to hit it.

02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:23.280
Additionally, more distribution of assets and capability.

02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:27.600
So imagine being able to digitally model your weapon

02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:29.800
or your system or your entire tactical engagement

02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:32.400
or scenario, or allow machine learning

02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:35.280
to help you better understand the technology

02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:36.120
that you need to build

02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:38.760
in order to defeat a particular scenario.

02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:41.720
And I'm talking hardware now, not just the tactic itself.

02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:46.560
And being able to use large amounts of simulation

02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:49.240
and machine learning to build individual assets

02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:50.760
that are small boutique

02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:54.600
using advanced manufacturing techniques for a mission

02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:56.120
or for a particular battle.

02:05:56.120 --> 02:05:58.280
Instead of just having these large things against an enemy,

02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:02.080
you're building systems and technology for individual cases.

02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:06.040
What about manned and unmanned teaming?

02:06:06.040 --> 02:06:09.040
So man and machine working together.

02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:10.760
Is there interesting ideas there?

02:06:10.760 --> 02:06:13.520
I approach it from the position

02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:18.040
that the human should be commanding

02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:19.560
from the highest level possible, right?

02:06:19.560 --> 02:06:23.240
So mission objective-based targeting.

02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:25.520
And so if, just for an example,

02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:26.920
if there's a building here

02:06:26.920 --> 02:06:28.240
and I want that building to go away,

02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:29.800
that's the message I wanna communicate.

02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:31.480
I don't wanna tell certain vehicles

02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:32.440
to be in a certain spot.

02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:34.000
I don't wanna know how much fuel they have.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:34.840
I don't even wanna know

02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:36.600
what capabilities they have necessarily.

02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:39.480
I just wanna know that I have the ability

02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:41.800
to select from a cloud of capabilities

02:06:41.800 --> 02:06:43.640
and the right assets are gonna arrive

02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:46.320
such that they deal with the contingencies

02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:49.400
around the target, such as protection systems or EW,

02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:50.960
and then can prosecute the target

02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:53.520
to the high enough probability of satisfaction

02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:54.720
that's needed by the mission commander.

02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:57.240
And that's the power of the human mind

02:06:57.240 --> 02:07:00.640
is it's able to do some of these strategic calculations

02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:03.720
but also ethical calculations, all that kind of stuff.

02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:05.360
That's what humans are good at.

02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:08.480
Does it worry you a future

02:07:08.480 --> 02:07:12.000
where we have increasingly higher autonomy

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.480
in our weapon systems, in our war?

02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:15.660
So you said building.

02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:21.640
What about telling a set of fully autonomous drones

02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:25.800
to get rid of all the terrorists in the city?

02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:29.840
So it's multiple buildings, region,

02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:34.080
that kind of, so greater and greater autonomy.

02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:36.920
So that's a fear, right?

02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:41.400
You're viewing it from a, we can cover more perspective,

02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:45.920
which is fair and a lot of,

02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:48.440
I don't approach it from that topic.

02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:51.040
At least I don't think of it that way, at least morally.

02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:54.160
I think that with the advancement of warfare,

02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:57.960
assuming we have a just and moral leadership,

02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:02.240
if that's the case, then I am an advocate

02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:04.600
for increased autonomy and technology

02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:09.040
because I see it as an ability to be more precise.

02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:14.040
And if we trust the moral leadership of our government,

02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:17.480
then we would want to be as precise as possible

02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:21.120
in order to mitigate effects that we don't want.

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:24.480
So I know that's not a satisfying answer

02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:27.160
and it leaves us maybe with bad feelings, but.

02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:29.920
No, because having experienced sort of

02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:37.120
directly seen what it looks like

02:08:37.120 --> 02:08:40.760
when deliberately or carelessly

02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:44.520
war leads to the death of a large number of civilians

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:46.720
as it does currently in Ukraine,

02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:52.560
the value of precision given ethical leadership

02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:54.200
becomes apparent.

02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:57.320
So there's something distinctly unethical

02:08:57.320 --> 02:09:00.920
about the murder of civilians in a time of war.

02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:05.960
And I think technology helps less than that.

02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:08.440
Of course, all death is terrible,

02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:13.440
but there's something about schools, hospitals

02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:16.640
being destroyed with everybody inside,

02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:21.240
being killed is particularly terrible.

02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:22.440
It is.

02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:25.760
And you approached it from the angle of more autonomy

02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:30.000
enables a wider swath of destruction.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.440
And that's where we get back into

02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:34.920
who's making the decisions based off of this.

02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:38.000
And my hope again would be that we would have

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.600
the leadership that would use these things

02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:42.920
when needed in the precise way as possible to minimize that.

02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:45.760
And I've seen that firsthand, I've seen that in country,

02:09:45.800 --> 02:09:49.400
I've seen not blue forces,

02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:53.080
but I've seen truck bombs go off on school buses,

02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:57.840
driving around Afghanistan while escorting convoys.

02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:01.840
And it wasn't easy then, and I'm sure it's not any easier now,

02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:03.920
especially after what you've just seen.

02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:07.200
Do you have thoughts about the current war in Ukraine,

02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:09.600
maybe from a military perspective,

02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:11.400
maybe from the Air Force perspective?

02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:13.800
So I could just mention a few things.

02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:17.920
There's the Barak-Tar drones that are being used.

02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:19.040
They're unmanned.

02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:21.600
I think they have capability to be autonomous,

02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:23.920
but they're usually remotely controlled.

02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:25.480
They're used for reconnaissance,

02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:28.600
but they're also used by the Ukraine side for reconnaissance.

02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:33.480
And I think also to destroy different technologies,

02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:36.240
tanks and so on, different targets like this.

02:10:36.240 --> 02:10:40.080
So there's also on the Russian side, the Orlan 10,

02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:43.640
there's the fighter jets, MiG-29,

02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:46.480
the Ukrainian side, and Su-25 on the Russian side.

02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:48.120
Is there anything kind of stands out to you

02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:51.640
about this particular aspects of what this war looks like

02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:53.720
that's unique to what you've experienced?

02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:56.800
Maybe not unique, but it's just been absolutely incredible

02:10:56.800 --> 02:10:59.280
to see the footage.

02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:02.760
I mean, we're watching war on Twitter, essentially,

02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:06.200
and to see these aircraft flying down low,

02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:08.960
spitting flares out, getting shot down,

02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:11.920
it's incredible to see this happening

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:13.520
live for everyone to see.

02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:16.240
So that's just kind of a quick meta comment.

02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:18.600
But as far as the actual,

02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:20.760
I think these small form factor UAVs

02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:22.920
where they're just like strapping weapon to it

02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:25.360
and flying over and trying to drop it at the right time

02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:29.080
or any of these type of commercial applications

02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:31.960
of technology into this ad hoc warfare area

02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:34.640
is incredibly interesting because it shows

02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:38.840
how useful that technology can be outside of the military.

02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:40.160
Especially like DJI, right?

02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:41.680
There's obviously a lot of technology in there

02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:43.640
that's being leveraged for other capabilities

02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:47.800
within PLC military, or at least we would assume.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.560
What happens if that is more widespread, right?

02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:54.520
What if we were creating our own drones

02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:56.040
and they were being used against us?

02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:57.680
Would we want to have some type of kill switch

02:11:57.680 --> 02:11:58.760
or something like that, right?

02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:01.680
So I think governments are gonna have to consider

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:04.440
all these tools that are gonna be easily available

02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:08.040
to just any person could be turned into a tool of war.

02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:10.480
How do we stop that from being turned against us?

02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:12.960
Especially as we look at 10 years from now

02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:15.520
when we have a large number of autonomous UAVs

02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:17.640
delivering packages and doing everything else

02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:19.560
over our country, and any one of those

02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:20.760
could be potentially a weapon

02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:22.520
if we don't have the proper security.

02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:27.080
Well, we're now in Texas, and Texas values its guns

02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:30.160
and sees guns as, among other things,

02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:33.480
a protector of individual freedom.

02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:35.480
You could see a future perhaps where,

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:37.240
and I've certainly experienced this

02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:41.480
in the empowering nature of this in Ukraine,

02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:45.960
where you can put the fight for independence

02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:50.160
into your own hands by literally strapping explosives

02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:54.280
to GGI drones that you purchase on your own salary.

02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:55.600
I mean, one of the interesting things

02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:58.280
about the volunteer army in Ukraine

02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:01.120
is that they're basically using their own salary

02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:04.200
to buy the ammunition to fight for their independence.

02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:07.960
It's the very kind of ideal that people speak about

02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:12.080
when they speak about the Second Amendment in this country,

02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:16.000
that it's interesting to see

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.960
the advanced technology version of that,

02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:22.800
especially in Ukraine, using computer vision technology

02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:25.840
for surveillance and reconnaissance

02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:29.480
to try to integrate that information

02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:32.880
to discover the targets and all that kind of stuff,

02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:35.480
to put that in the hands of civilians.

02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:36.520
It's fascinating to see.

02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:38.680
So to sort of fight for their independence,

02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:43.680
you could say that to fight against authoritarian regime

02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:45.440
of your own government, all that kind of stuff.

02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:47.440
It shows you how complicated the workspace

02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:50.520
in the future is gonna be, evading a land like that

02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:53.560
where people have that many different types of resources.

02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:55.840
It could absolutely change warfare.

02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:00.840
I mean, hopefully that creates a disincentive to start war.

02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:04.440
To go to war with a, yeah,

02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:07.080
sort of it changes the nature of guerrilla warfare.

02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:08.360
It does, yeah.

02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:11.480
I don't think Putin was expecting to be in that engagement

02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:14.080
quite as long as he has, of course,

02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:16.520
but it can show you how you can get caught up.

02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:21.520
If land wars turn into an inescapable quagmire each time

02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:26.560
due to the complications around the society's ability

02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:28.800
to access interesting tools,

02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:34.000
it could be a huge demotivator for aggression.

02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:38.600
Well, let me ask you about this.

02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:41.200
Do you think there will always be war in the world?

02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:45.480
Is this just a part of human nature?

02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:51.520
I think so.

02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:53.600
I think it is.

02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:58.080
Until we move past resource limitation,

02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:02.480
there's always gonna be at least that one particular

02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:04.960
cause of conflict.

02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:09.200
And then we can also consider all our psychological

02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:14.920
lizard brain emotions that cause us to act out.

02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:18.800
Although, hopefully we have enough things in place

02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:22.160
to stop that from rising to the level of war.

02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:24.080
But we have our own biology, our own psychology

02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:25.480
and evolution to combat.

02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:28.320
And then, but there are pragmatic reasons

02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:30.400
to exert violence sometimes, unfortunately,

02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:33.520
and one of those cases could be resource limitations.

02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:34.760
And so your question was,

02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:37.120
do I think there'll always be war in this world?

02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:39.520
My unfortunate answer is perhaps yes,

02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:41.640
but once there's more than one world

02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:43.080
and we're less resource constrained,

02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:45.760
then perhaps there'll be a valve of sorts for that.

02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:50.960
I talked to Jaco on this podcast.

02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:55.560
I told him about a song called Brothers in Arms

02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:56.920
by Dire Straits.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.720
And the question I asked him,

02:15:59.720 --> 02:16:01.480
I'd like to ask you the same question,

02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:05.040
is like the song goes,

02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:07.160
do you think we're fools to wage war

02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:09.240
on our brothers in arms?

02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:14.240
And Jaco said, our enemy is not our brothers in arms,

02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:15.240
they're the enemy.

02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:20.760
And so this kind of notion that we're all human,

02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:24.640
that's a luxury you can have,

02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:27.600
but there is good and bad in this world,

02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:29.160
according to Jaco.

02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:34.160
I hear that anger and hate when I was in Ukraine

02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:36.400
amongst some people,

02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:41.400
where there was a sense where you could be brothers

02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:42.760
and sisters, you can have family,

02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:47.200
you can have love from Ukraine to Russia.

02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:50.160
But now that everything's changed

02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:54.880
and generational hate for some people have taken over.

02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:57.560
So I guess the question is,

02:16:57.560 --> 02:16:59.160
when you think about the enemy,

02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:02.280
is there hate there?

02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:04.400
Do you acknowledge that they're human?

02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:06.560
I had never had any hate or discontent

02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:10.280
when I was doing my job, I'll say.

02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:14.680
But I was also never in a true life or death situation

02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:17.280
where they were gonna kill me if I didn't kill them.

02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:23.440
But I think that environment isn't one born out of hate,

02:17:23.440 --> 02:17:25.480
being in that type of scenario,

02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:27.320
since it's how to be alive, right?

02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:30.000
I mean, our natural state is be fighting

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:31.800
for our survival in a sense.

02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:35.200
And so I think there's great power and strength

02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:36.840
and clarity perhaps in that.

02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:39.080
And it's not always born out of hate,

02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:40.120
but out of necessity.

02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:42.320
And we can't always control that.

02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:46.520
And I think as we focus on ourselves so much,

02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:48.200
we only dance on that pinhead

02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:51.920
when we find ourselves fighting for things that we need.

02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:54.720
And we're always taking from someone else at this point.

02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:57.480
And so as someone that's been in combat

02:17:57.480 --> 02:17:59.560
and very high above of it, I'll say, right?

02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:02.200
Where I didn't feel like I was in particular danger.

02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:07.840
I rationalized it and I made my way through it

02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:09.520
knowing that there were people on the other side

02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:13.360
that were going to die that were on our side than not.

02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:15.840
So it was always a very human thing.

02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:20.840
It was never a reaction, emotional reaction of any sense.

02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:25.840
So you were able to see the basic,

02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:28.000
it's human versus human.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
That there's some aspect of war

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:34.720
that is basically one people fighting each other.

02:18:35.720 --> 02:18:36.560
Yes.

02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:41.680
At the end of the day, especially I would say in aviation,

02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:43.840
tactical aviation, there's almost a kinship

02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:45.640
with your enemies in a sense,

02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:48.440
because you know them in a sense, right?

02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:50.960
You know what they've been through.

02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:52.160
You know what training they've been through.

02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:54.360
You know where they've failed.

02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:55.800
And you know what type of person they are,

02:18:55.800 --> 02:18:57.680
because it's a very unique person that does that job

02:18:57.680 --> 02:18:59.240
and usually can spot them.

02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:01.840
I guess it's the kind of respect you have

02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:06.880
for the craftsmanship of the job that's taken on.

02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:08.720
Certainly, and that person didn't come out

02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:11.680
in his $100 million jet because I pissed him off.

02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:13.960
You know, it's not an emotional response.

02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:16.040
We're both there,

02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:17.960
maybe because we chose to be in some sense,

02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:20.800
but at the behest of someone else

02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:22.960
and outside of our control and power.

02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:24.960
And so in a sense for me,

02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:28.120
it's almost a challenge that we've engaged upon agreeably,

02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:29.720
but that's such a romantic version

02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:33.280
that I have the luxury to have being high in my castle

02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:35.600
in the jet up there, not on the ground.

02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:37.680
So I understand that it's a bit more romantic

02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:40.960
than perhaps, you know, someone on the ground

02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:42.840
experiencing all the horrors down there,

02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:45.200
because everything looks very small from above.

02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:50.160
And that's another aspect of war with greater autonomy

02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:54.680
when you're controlling the mission versus, you know,

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.520
have a Genghis Khan type of intimacy

02:19:58.520 --> 02:20:01.680
in terms of the actual experience of war

02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:03.760
where you directly have,

02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:06.640
you murder with a sword versus a gun

02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:09.480
versus a remotely controlled drone

02:20:09.480 --> 02:20:12.080
versus a strategic mission assignment

02:20:12.080 --> 02:20:14.920
to an autonomous drone that executes.

02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:17.560
Abstracted away until it's just a small decision.

02:20:18.480 --> 02:20:23.240
And my worry is the people without a voice

02:20:24.840 --> 02:20:28.360
are completely forgotten.

02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:31.040
And silence in all of these calculations.

02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:34.840
I spoke to a lot of people, poor people,

02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:37.760
they feel like they've never really had a voice

02:20:37.760 --> 02:20:40.280
and they're too easily forgotten.

02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:42.520
Even within the country of Ukraine,

02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:47.520
it's the big city versus the rural divide.

02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:49.840
You know, it's easy to forget the people

02:20:49.840 --> 02:20:52.360
that don't have a Twitter account

02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:55.720
and don't, that their basic existence

02:20:55.720 --> 02:20:57.120
is just trying to survive,

02:20:57.120 --> 02:20:58.520
trying to put food on the table

02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:00.640
and they don't have anything else.

02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:03.560
Anything else and then they are the ones

02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:06.120
that truly feel the pain of war

02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:08.320
of the supply chain going down,

02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:10.120
of the food supplies going down,

02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:12.920
of a cold winter without power.

02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:18.080
You're still young, but you've seen some things.

02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:22.640
So let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat

02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:25.840
and give advice to young people.

02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:28.960
Whether they're fascinated by technology

02:21:28.960 --> 02:21:31.560
or fascinated by fighter jets,

02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:35.000
whether they're fascinated by sort of engineering

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.840
or the way the stars look at night.

02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:39.880
What advice would you give them?

02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:41.840
How to have a career they can be proud of

02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:44.040
or how to have a life they can be proud of?

02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:49.520
I'd suggest that they don't fear looking foolish.

02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:52.040
I spent a large portion of my life

02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:57.000
considering the laughter or the comments at my statements

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.840
as indication that I shouldn't pursue that.

02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:04.440
And so, I kind of woke up to that fact a bit later,

02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:07.320
but I would encourage, I would advise

02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:09.640
that people trust in themselves

02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:11.520
and trust in the things that they care about.

02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:14.160
It doesn't matter if they're good at it.

02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:16.000
All that matters is that they find something

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:19.040
that they can apply love and care to

02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:20.640
and they will grow better at it.

02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:22.080
And they will most likely make the world better

02:22:22.080 --> 02:22:23.400
because of it.

02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:25.720
And don't be afraid to look stupid.

02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:27.240
Don't be afraid to look stupid.

02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:30.720
Yeah, that's one of the things that I think as you get older,

02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:34.160
you're expected to have it all figured out

02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:37.040
and so you are afraid to take on new things.

02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:40.320
But I think as long as you're always okay looking stupid

02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:41.720
and having a beginner's mind,

02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:45.120
you can get really, really far even later on in life.

02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:46.960
So this isn't just advice for young people,

02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:50.280
this is really advice for young people.

02:22:51.280 --> 02:22:52.520
And for everybody.

02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:56.640
Maybe a dark question,

02:22:56.640 --> 02:23:01.520
but has there been a difficult time in your life,

02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:03.680
a really dark place you've gone in your mind

02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:07.240
that stands out that you had to really overcome?

02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:13.000
I would suggest that I've been a pretty firm ground

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:14.120
for most of my life.

02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:18.880
I haven't had too many personal tragedies, I'll say,

02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:21.640
that have really defined me.

02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:25.800
Certainly none that I would think are outside the norm.

02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:29.040
So there is no truly low point?

02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:29.960
Actually, I have one.

02:23:29.960 --> 02:23:32.920
And it's tough for me because I've spent most of my life

02:23:32.920 --> 02:23:37.880
beating motions and high emotional responses

02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:38.720
out of my system, right?

02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:40.080
Because that's what flying is, right?

02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:43.400
It's keeping a steady line and doing what you need to do.

02:23:44.280 --> 02:23:45.840
In fact, there's been studies that show

02:23:45.880 --> 02:23:49.440
reduced adrenaline production in fighter pilots

02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:50.720
for a number of years after they get out.

02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:54.360
But getting out of the Navy was difficult for me.

02:23:54.360 --> 02:23:56.080
And I wasn't expecting it to be.

02:23:56.080 --> 02:23:59.480
A lot of bravado and machoism, of course, in the military,

02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:01.320
especially in fighter community.

02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:03.600
And we all have our plans made up to get out.

02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:08.080
And none of it really accounts for any type of mental health

02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:08.920
or anything like that.

02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:11.560
It's all very much, where am I gonna get my paycheck from?

02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:12.640
Where am I gonna move to?

02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:16.400
And whether it's the Navy or just individuals,

02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:18.320
truly understanding the difference that makes.

02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:21.040
When I got out, it was difficult for me.

02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:23.200
I think a lot of guys in that job, when they get out,

02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:26.280
they almost, at least I had anxiety when I got out

02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:29.920
because I was so used to being highly involved

02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:34.920
in something that I was always involved with

02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:37.680
that when I got out, I didn't know how to fill that space

02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:38.520
essentially.

02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:42.280
And while I wouldn't say it was an overly traumatic

02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:44.400
experience, I think it's one that's not accounted for

02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:46.920
enough that people that are getting out,

02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:49.160
so I would encourage them to take it serious

02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:51.720
and actually think about it and respect the change

02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:53.520
because it is a big one.

02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:58.520
Well, if I may say, you found a place in nature currently,

02:24:58.520 --> 02:24:59.480
a home.

02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:03.480
Is there, can you speak to that being a source of happiness

02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:04.320
for you?

02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:05.140
Absolutely.

02:25:05.140 --> 02:25:06.280
An escape from the world?

02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:08.080
Certainly, it very much is.

02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:11.240
Was it deliberate that you found it there?

02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:12.120
That's home for me.

02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:14.920
So I moved back up to the Boston area

02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:18.440
and my wife and I had an idea after moving

02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:20.280
about eight or nine times in the Navy

02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:23.560
of kind of what we wanted just generally.

02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:25.760
And it was all really about the land

02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:26.920
and not about the house.

02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:29.480
We just wanted privacy and to be nearby.

02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:31.920
And so we ended up finding a lot of land,

02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:34.160
a parcel of land, we put a house on it

02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:36.520
and it provides me with a sense of peace

02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:40.200
that I think I can only get when I'm in nature.

02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:44.680
A sense of clarity that helps me think, helps me relax.

02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:46.640
Maybe it's the relaxing that helps me think, I don't know.

02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:50.640
But being surrounded by nature and birds and animals

02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:54.880
for me has always allowed me to, I don't know,

02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:59.320
feel most in touch with my own thoughts in a sense.

02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:01.240
It just provides clarity.

02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:04.600
And so this little sanctuary you could say I've built

02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:08.960
allows me to interface by a fiber line at my house,

02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:12.440
but also feel like I'm a million miles away sometimes,

02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:13.880
which is the best of both worlds.

02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:16.280
And you can just walk outside to escape it all.

02:26:16.280 --> 02:26:17.120
Yes.

02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:21.480
To experience life as hundreds of generations

02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:23.520
of human species have experienced it.

02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:25.240
Maybe it's the dichotomy, my desire

02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:28.520
for the vastness of technology and experience

02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:31.360
compared with the most basic baseline that we have.

02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:33.160
Isn't that strange?

02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:34.880
How do you square that?

02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:36.120
I don't know.

02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:38.120
How drawn you are to the cutting edge

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.360
and still the calm you find in nature.

02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:42.480
I think it makes sense.

02:26:42.480 --> 02:26:45.720
Nature is vastly superior to almost all of our technology.

02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:46.560
From a technology perspective?

02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:48.080
Yeah, it is.

02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:50.200
And so the way it's being surrounded by perfection

02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:51.200
in a lot of senses.

02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:55.120
In the military and in general,

02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:57.200
have you contemplated immortality?

02:26:57.200 --> 02:26:58.960
Have you been afraid of death?

02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:01.080
What's your relationship like with death?

02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:05.480
I was willing to accept an oversized amount of risk,

02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:07.760
I'll say, when I was younger as an aviator.

02:27:07.760 --> 02:27:10.120
Not in the jet, but just that was my life.

02:27:10.120 --> 02:27:11.920
I felt like I was gonna live forever.

02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:14.680
And going out in the war,

02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:18.640
strangely didn't really change that because as an aviator,

02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:20.520
again, we're riding up high on our horse up there.

02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:25.080
So there were times when I was in situations

02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:27.640
that could have resulted in death from flying

02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:31.440
or from emergency in the aircraft.

02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:35.960
But I'll be honest, I never really sat down

02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:39.320
to think about the mortality of it afterwards.

02:27:39.320 --> 02:27:41.960
I feel like I assigned a check at the beginning

02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:44.280
and it was my job to perform as well as I could.

02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:46.040
And if something happened in that,

02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:47.680
then I better damn well be sure

02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:49.480
I would do my best at the time then.

02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:55.520
So I maybe didn't personally reflect on it as much as I,

02:27:55.720 --> 02:27:57.280
one would think.

02:27:57.280 --> 02:27:58.840
Because once you get in that machine,

02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:01.320
it doesn't give you a lot of time to sit back

02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:05.000
and philosophize on your current situation.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:06.840
And the same, just like we weren't seeing these,

02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:08.560
or when we seen these objects off the coast,

02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:10.840
we weren't necessarily examining them every day, right?

02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:11.920
We'd put them into that bucket

02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:12.800
because it wasn't something

02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:14.840
that was gonna kill us right away.

02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:17.800
And thinking about death when you're so close to it

02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:19.560
all the time would be debilitating.

02:28:20.480 --> 02:28:22.520
It would probably make you worse at your job.

02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:23.360
It would.

02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:26.760
Well, maybe you can think about death

02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:28.360
when you look out, when you go out into nature

02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:32.880
and think like the fact that this whole ride ends,

02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:34.680
it's such a weird thing.

02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:37.840
And the old makes way to new.

02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:39.280
And that's all throughout nature.

02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:42.120
And if you just look at the cruelty of nature

02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:44.120
or the beauty of nature, however you think about it,

02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:47.720
the fact that the big thing eats the little thing

02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:53.480
over and over, and that's just how it progresses.

02:28:53.480 --> 02:28:55.720
And that's how adaptation happens.

02:28:55.720 --> 02:28:59.520
Death is a requirement for evolution.

02:28:59.520 --> 02:29:02.600
And whether evolution allows us

02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:04.680
to see objective reality or not,

02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:06.640
it still gives you some interesting thoughts

02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:08.400
about perspectives of death,

02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:11.760
and especially concerning it's a biological necessity

02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:13.800
as far as evolution is concerned.

02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:14.640
Yeah, it's weird.

02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:18.560
It's weird that there's been like a hundred billion people

02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:22.160
that lived before us and that you and I will be forgotten.

02:29:22.160 --> 02:29:24.720
This whole thing we're doing now is meaningless

02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:26.880
in that sense, but at the same time,

02:29:26.880 --> 02:29:28.720
it feels deeply meaningful somehow.

02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:32.920
I guess that's the question I wanna ask.

02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:36.040
When you go out to nature with family,

02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:38.760
what do you think is the meaning of it all?

02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:40.120
What's the meaning of life?

02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:44.400
Or maybe when you put on the night goggles,

02:29:44.400 --> 02:29:47.200
the night vision goggles and look up at the stars,

02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:49.360
why are we here?

02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:51.920
I can't speak for everyone,

02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:54.560
but at least the way I interpret it,

02:29:55.640 --> 02:29:58.600
or at least I feel like I interpret my way here.

02:29:58.600 --> 02:30:02.320
My job is, I feel like my role is just to be curious

02:30:02.320 --> 02:30:04.680
about the environment in a manner that allows us

02:30:04.680 --> 02:30:07.080
to understand as much as possible.

02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:09.720
I think that the human mind,

02:30:09.720 --> 02:30:12.400
whether it's just the mass inside our skull

02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:15.760
or whether there's some type of quantum interactions

02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:18.960
going on, our mind has incredible ability

02:30:18.960 --> 02:30:23.160
to output new information in a universe

02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:26.200
that is somewhat stale of information.

02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:30.920
Our minds are somewhat unique in that we can imagine

02:30:30.920 --> 02:30:33.240
and perceive things that could never ever

02:30:33.240 --> 02:30:35.200
have possibly naturally occurred,

02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:36.320
and yet we can make it happen.

02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:38.920
We can instantiate that with enough belief

02:30:38.920 --> 02:30:40.880
that it's true and it can happen.

02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:44.440
And so for me, I feel like I just need to encourage that,

02:30:44.440 --> 02:30:47.440
to encourage interaction with reality

02:30:47.440 --> 02:30:50.800
such that it leads us to newer and grander interactions

02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:52.600
with this universe.

02:30:52.600 --> 02:30:55.400
And all that starts with a little bit of curiosity.

02:30:55.400 --> 02:30:56.240
Exactly.

02:30:57.080 --> 02:30:59.000
Ryan, you're an incredible person.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:00.280
You've done so many things,

02:31:00.280 --> 02:31:03.480
and there's so much still ahead of you.

02:31:03.480 --> 02:31:07.120
Thank you for being brave enough to talk about UFOs

02:31:07.120 --> 02:31:09.160
and doing it so seriously,

02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:10.640
and thank you for pushing forward

02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:12.800
on all these fronts in terms of technology.

02:31:12.840 --> 02:31:17.680
So from just the fighter jets, the engineering of that,

02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:21.040
to the AI ML applications in the combat setting,

02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:24.400
that's super interesting, and then now quantum.

02:31:24.400 --> 02:31:26.560
I can't wait to see what you do next.

02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:28.320
Thank you so much for sitting down and talking today.

02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:29.160
It was an honor.

02:31:29.160 --> 02:31:29.980
It was my pleasure.

02:31:29.980 --> 02:31:31.320
Thank you, Lex.

02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:33.040
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:31:33.040 --> 02:31:34.880
with Lieutenant Ryan Graves.

02:31:34.880 --> 02:31:36.280

And now let me leave you with some words from Buzz Aldrin.

02:31:43.120 --> 02:31:44.960
Bravery comes along

02:31:44.960 --> 02:31:47.200
as a gradual accumulation of discipline.

02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:51.360
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
