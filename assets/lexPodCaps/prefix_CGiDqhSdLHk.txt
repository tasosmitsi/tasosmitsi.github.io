WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
every star in the sky probably has planets and life is probably emerging on these planets.

00:07.760 --> 00:13.200
But I think the commentarial space associated with these planets is so different. Our causal

00:13.200 --> 00:18.000
cones are never going to overlap or not easily. And this is the thing that makes me sad about

00:18.000 --> 00:22.480
alien life, why it's why we have to create alien life in the lab as quickly as possible.

00:23.040 --> 00:28.320
Because I don't know if we are going to be able to be able to build

00:30.480 --> 00:34.880
architectures that will intersect with alien intelligence architectures.

00:34.880 --> 00:38.240
Intersect, you don't mean in time or space?

00:38.240 --> 00:39.840
Time and the ability to communicate.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.200
The ability to communicate.

00:41.200 --> 00:45.040
Yeah. My biggest fear in a way is that life is everywhere,

00:45.040 --> 00:49.440
but we become infinitely more lonely because of our scaffolding in that commentarial space.

00:49.440 --> 00:57.440
The following is a conversation with Lee Cronin, his third time on this podcast. He is a chemist

00:57.440 --> 01:02.880
from University of Glasgow, who is one of the most fascinating, brilliant, and fun to talk to

01:02.880 --> 01:08.640
scientists I've ever had the pleasure of getting to know. This is the Alex Friedman podcast. To

01:08.640 --> 01:14.240
support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Lee

01:14.240 --> 01:19.040
Cronin. So your big assembly theory paper was published in Nature.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.240
Congratulations.

01:20.880 --> 01:21.360
Thanks.

01:21.360 --> 01:27.040
It created, I think it's fair to say, a lot of controversy, but also a lot of interesting

01:27.040 --> 01:32.400
discussion. So maybe I can try to summarize assembly theory and you tell me if I'm wrong.

01:32.400 --> 01:32.880
Go for it.

01:33.520 --> 01:39.440
So assembly theory says that if we look at any object in the universe, any object,

01:40.320 --> 01:45.360
that we can quantify how complex it is by trying to find the number of steps it took to create it.

01:46.160 --> 01:49.920
And also, we can determine if it was built by a process

01:50.640 --> 01:54.240
akin to evolution by looking at how many copies of the object there are.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.480
Yeah, that's spot on.

01:56.480 --> 02:01.440
Yeah, spot on. I was not expecting that. Okay. So let's go through definitions.

02:03.040 --> 02:09.280
So there's a central equation I'd love to talk about, but definition wise, what is an object?

02:10.160 --> 02:18.880
So if I'm going to try to be as meticulous as possible, objects need to be finite

02:20.800 --> 02:28.160
and they need to be decomposable into subunits. All human-made artifacts are objects.

02:29.360 --> 02:35.840
Is a planet an object? Probably yes if you scale out. So an object is finite and countable and

02:35.840 --> 02:42.240
decomposable, I suppose mathematically. But yeah, I still wake up some days and go

02:42.880 --> 02:50.640
to think to myself, what is an object? Because it's a non-trivial question.

02:50.640 --> 02:54.000
Persists over time. I'm quoting from the paper here.

02:54.880 --> 03:01.440
An object that's finite is distinguishable. Sure, that's a weird adjective. Distinguishable.

03:01.440 --> 03:07.440
We've had so many people offering to rewrite the paper after it came out.

03:07.440 --> 03:08.720
You wouldn't believe it's so funny.

03:09.840 --> 03:14.880
Persists over time and is breakable such that the set of constraints to construct it

03:14.880 --> 03:17.280
from elementary building blocks is quantifiable.

03:18.800 --> 03:24.720
Such that the set of constraints to construct it from elementary building blocks is quantifiable.

03:25.280 --> 03:28.560
The history is in the objects. It's kind of cool, right?

03:29.360 --> 03:35.440
What defines the object is its history or memory, whichever is the sexier word.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.160
I'm happy with both, depending on the day.

03:39.840 --> 03:43.440
The set of steps it took to create the object, there's a sense

03:45.440 --> 03:47.840
in which every object in the universe has a history.

03:49.520 --> 03:55.680
And that is part of the thing that is used to describe its complexity, how complicated it is.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.960
Okay. What is an assembly index?

03:59.920 --> 04:07.520
So the assembly index, if you're to take the object apart and be super lazy about it or

04:07.520 --> 04:11.520
minimal, say, it's like you've got a really short term memory.

04:11.520 --> 04:18.080
So what you do is you lay all the parts on the path and you find the minimum number of steps

04:18.080 --> 04:23.600
you take on the path to add the parts together to reproduce the object.

04:23.840 --> 04:27.280
That minimum number is the assembly index. It's a minimum bound.

04:27.840 --> 04:31.200
It was always my intuition. The minimum bound in assembly theory was really important.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.400
I only worked out why a few weeks ago, which is kind of funny because I was just like,

04:34.400 --> 04:37.600
no, this is sacrosanct. I don't know why. It will come to me one day.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.760
And then when I was pushed by a bunch of mathematicians,

04:42.080 --> 04:47.280
we came up with the correct physical explanation, which I can get to.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.680
But it's the minimum and it's really important. It's the minimum.

04:50.320 --> 04:53.920
And the reason I knew the minimum was right is because we could measure it.

04:53.920 --> 04:57.760
So almost before this paper came out, with published papers,

04:57.760 --> 05:00.640
explain how you can measure the assembly index of molecules.

05:00.640 --> 05:06.080
Okay. So that's not so trivial to figure out. So when you look at an object,

05:06.080 --> 05:10.640
we can say a molecule, we can say object more generally to figure out the minimum

05:11.280 --> 05:16.640
number of steps it takes to create that object. That doesn't seem like a trivial thing to do.

05:17.280 --> 05:23.280
So with molecules, it's not trivial, but it is possible because what you can do,

05:23.280 --> 05:27.920
and because I'm a chemist, so I'm kind of like, I see the lens of the world for just chemistry.

05:29.280 --> 05:35.920
I break the molecule apart, break bonds. And if you take a molecule and you break it all apart,

05:35.920 --> 05:42.560
you have a bunch of atoms. And then you say, okay, I'm going to then take the atoms and form bonds

05:42.560 --> 05:47.680
and go up the chain of events to make the molecule. And that's what made me realize,

05:47.680 --> 05:53.120
take a toy example, literally toy example, take a Lego object, which is broken up of Lego blocks.

05:53.120 --> 05:58.960
So you could do exactly the same thing. In this case, the Lego blocks are naturally the smallest,

05:58.960 --> 06:07.760
they're the atoms in the actual composite Lego architecture. But then if you maybe take a couple

06:07.760 --> 06:13.760
of blocks and put them together in a certain way, maybe they're offset in some way, that offset is

06:13.760 --> 06:17.120
on the memory. You can use that offset again with only a penalty of one and you can then make a

06:17.120 --> 06:24.080
square triangle and keep going. And you remember those motifs on the chain. So you can then leap

06:24.080 --> 06:29.760
from the start with all the Lego blocks or atoms just laid out in front of you and say, right,

06:29.760 --> 06:36.000
I'll take you, you, you connect and do the least amount of work. So it's really like the smallest

06:36.640 --> 06:41.920
steps you can take on the graph to make the object. And so for molecules, it came relatively

06:41.920 --> 06:46.720
intuitively. And then we started to apply it to language. We've even started to apply it to

06:46.720 --> 06:51.040
mathematical theorems, but I'm so well out of my depth, but it looks like you can take minimum

06:51.040 --> 06:57.520
set of axioms and then start to build up kind of mathematical architectures in the same way.

06:57.520 --> 07:01.280
And then the shortest path to get there is something interesting that I don't yet understand.

07:01.840 --> 07:09.200
So what's the computational complexity of figuring out the shortest path with molecules,

07:09.200 --> 07:15.520
with language, with mathematical theorems? It seems like once you have the fully constructed Lego

07:15.520 --> 07:22.960
castle or whatever your favorite Lego world is, figuring out how to get there from the

07:22.960 --> 07:28.480
building, basic building blocks, isn't like a, is that an MP hard problem? It's a hard problem.

07:28.560 --> 07:32.480
It's a hard problem. But actually, if you look at it, so the best way to look at it for this,

07:32.480 --> 07:37.760
take a molecule. So if the molecule has 13 bonds, first of all, take 13 copies of the molecule and

07:37.760 --> 07:42.800
just cut all the bonds. So take 12 bonds, and then you just put them in order. And then that's how

07:42.800 --> 07:51.360
it works. So you keep looking for symmetry or copies. So you can then shorten it as you go down.

07:51.520 --> 07:56.800
That becomes commentorially quite hard. For some natural product molecules,

07:57.840 --> 08:02.640
it becomes very hard. It's not impossible, but we're looking at the bounds on that at the moment.

08:02.640 --> 08:09.200
But as the object gets bigger, it becomes really hard. But that's the bad news. But the good news

08:09.200 --> 08:14.800
is there are shortcuts. And we might even be able to physically measure the complexity without

08:14.800 --> 08:19.680
computationally calculating it, which is kind of insane. How would you do that?

08:20.320 --> 08:25.600
Well, in the case of molecule, so if you shine light on a molecule, let's take infrared,

08:26.480 --> 08:31.680
the molecule has each of the bonds absorbs the infrared differently in what we call the

08:31.680 --> 08:39.200
fingerprint region. And because it's quantized as well, you have all these discrete kind of

08:39.200 --> 08:45.040
absorbences. And my intuition after we realized we could cut molecules up in mass spec, that was the

08:45.040 --> 08:50.960
first go at this. We did it with using infrared and the infrared gave us an even better correlation

08:50.960 --> 08:55.840
assembly index. And we used another technique as well. In addition to infrared called NMR,

08:55.840 --> 09:00.080
nuclear magnetic resonance, which tells you about the number of different magnetic environments in

09:00.080 --> 09:06.000
a molecule. And that also worked out. So we have three techniques, which each of them independently

09:06.000 --> 09:11.440
gives us the same or tending towards the same assembly index for molecule that we can calculate

09:11.440 --> 09:18.560
mathematically. Okay, so these are all methods of mass spectrometry, mass spec. You scan a molecule,

09:18.560 --> 09:24.160
it gives you data in the form of a mass spectrum. And you're saying that the data correlates to the

09:24.160 --> 09:30.000
assembly index. Yeah. How generalizable is that shortcut? First of all, to chemistry,

09:30.000 --> 09:36.320
and second of all, beyond that, because that seems like a nice hack. And you're extremely

09:36.320 --> 09:41.200
knowledgeable about various aspects of chemistry, so you can say, okay, it kind of correlates.

09:42.160 --> 09:48.160
But, you know, the whole idea behind assembly theory paper, and perhaps why it's so controversial,

09:48.960 --> 09:58.080
is that it reaches bigger. It reaches for the bigger general theory of objects in the universe.

09:58.080 --> 10:03.680
Yeah, I'd say so. I'd agree. So I've started assembly theory of emoticons with my

10:03.680 --> 10:08.480
lab, believe it or not. So we take emojis, pixelate them, and work out the assembly index

10:08.480 --> 10:13.440
and emoji, and then work out how many emojis you can make on the path of emoji. So there's

10:13.440 --> 10:20.720
the uber emoji from which all other emojis emerge. So you can then take a photograph,

10:20.720 --> 10:27.040
and by looking at the shortest path, by reproducing the pixels to make the image you want,

10:27.040 --> 10:32.880
you can measure that. So then you start to be able to take spatial data. Now there's some

10:32.880 --> 10:39.120
problems there. What is then the definition of the object? How many pixels? How do you break it

10:39.120 --> 10:45.040
down? And so we're just learning all this right now. So how do you compute this? How would you

10:45.040 --> 10:54.000
begin to compute the assembly index of a graphical, like, a set of pixels on a 2D plane that form a

10:54.000 --> 11:00.480
thing? So you would, first of all, determine the resolution. So then what is your x, y,

11:00.480 --> 11:05.200
all the number on the x and y plane, and then look at the surface area, and then you take all

11:05.200 --> 11:09.600
your emojis and make sure they're all looked at the same resolution. And then we would basically

11:09.600 --> 11:16.560
then do the exactly the same thing we would do for cutting the bonds. You'd cut bits out of the emoji

11:17.280 --> 11:24.240
and look at them. You'd have a bag of pixels, and you would then add those pixels together

11:24.240 --> 11:32.160
to make the overall emoji. But like, first of all, not every pixel is, I mean, this is at the core

11:32.160 --> 11:37.120
sort of machine learning and computer vision. Not every pixel is that important. And there's

11:37.120 --> 11:42.480
like macro features, there's micro features and all that kind of stuff. Exactly. Like, you know,

11:42.480 --> 11:48.160
the eyes appear in a lot of them. The smile appears in a lot of them. So in the same way in

11:48.160 --> 11:53.280
chemistry, we assume the bond is fundamental. What we do in there here is we assume the resolution

11:53.280 --> 11:56.880
at the scale at which we do it is fundamental. And we're just working that out. And that you're

11:56.880 --> 12:01.840
right, that will change, right? Because as you take your lens out a bit, it will change dramatically.

12:01.840 --> 12:08.000
But it's just a new way of looking at not just compression, what we do right now in computer

12:08.000 --> 12:16.880
science and data. One big kind of misunderstanding is assembly theory is telling you about how

12:16.880 --> 12:24.480
compressed the object is. That's not right. It's a how much information is required on a chain of

12:24.480 --> 12:30.000
events. Because the nice thing is if when you do compression in computer science, we're wandering

12:30.000 --> 12:35.280
a bit here, but it's kind of worth wondering, I think, in you, you assume you have instantaneous

12:35.280 --> 12:39.520
access to all the information in the memory. Yeah. In assembly theory, you say no, you don't get

12:39.520 --> 12:43.120
access to that memory until you've done the work. And then you don't access that memory, you can

12:43.120 --> 12:47.920
have access but not to the next one. And this is how in assembly theory, we talk about the four

12:47.920 --> 12:53.280
universes, the assembly universe, the assembly possible, and the assembly contingent, and then

12:53.280 --> 12:59.760
the assembly observed. And they're all scales in this combinatorial universe. Yeah. Can you explain

12:59.760 --> 13:05.600
each one of them? Yep. So the assembly universe is like anything goes, just this just combinatorial

13:05.600 --> 13:09.680
kind of explosion in everything. So that's the biggest one? That's the biggest one. It's massive.

13:09.760 --> 13:18.240
Assembly universe, assembly possible, assembly contingent, assembly observed. And on the y-axis

13:18.240 --> 13:25.680
is assembly steps in time. Yeah. And, you know, in the x-axis, as the thing expands through time,

13:26.960 --> 13:32.560
more and more unique objects appear. So yeah, so assembly universe, everything goes. Yep.

13:33.200 --> 13:38.000
Assembly possible, laws of physics come in, in this case in chemistry bonds. In assembly,

13:38.000 --> 13:42.160
so that means- Those are actually constraints, I guess? Yes. And they're the only constraints,

13:42.160 --> 13:45.440
they're the constraints of the base. So the way to look at it, you've got all your atoms,

13:45.440 --> 13:48.880
they're quantized, you can just bung them together. So then you can become a kind of,

13:49.440 --> 13:53.200
so in the way, in computer science speak, I suppose the assembly universe is just like no

13:53.200 --> 13:59.280
laws of physics. Things can fly through mountains beyond the speed of light. In the assembly

13:59.280 --> 14:05.120
possible, you have to apply the laws of physics, but you can get access to all the motifs

14:05.120 --> 14:10.960
instantaneously with no effort. So that means you could make anything. Then the assembly

14:10.960 --> 14:16.160
contingent says, no, you can't have access to the highly assembled object in the future until you've

14:16.160 --> 14:22.400
done the work in the past on the causal chain. And that's really the really interesting shift

14:22.400 --> 14:28.800
where you go from assembly possible to assembly contingent. That is really the key thing in

14:28.800 --> 14:33.760
assembly theory that says you cannot just have instantaneous access to all those memories.

14:33.760 --> 14:38.960
You have to have done the work somehow. The universe has to have somehow built a

14:40.720 --> 14:46.880
system that allows you to select that path rather than other paths. And then the final thing

14:47.520 --> 14:52.640
the assembly observed is basically are saying, oh, these are the things we actually see. We

14:52.640 --> 14:59.280
can go backwards now and understand that they have been created by this causal process.

14:59.520 --> 15:04.640
Wait a minute. So when you say the universe has to construct the system that does the work,

15:04.640 --> 15:08.560
is that like the environment that allows for selection?

15:08.560 --> 15:09.280
Yeah.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.640
That's the thing that does the selection.

15:10.640 --> 15:14.960
You could think about in terms of a von Neumann constructor versus selection, a ribosome,

15:15.760 --> 15:23.440
Tesla plant assembling Teslas. The difference between the assembly universe in Tesla land and

15:23.440 --> 15:28.320
the Tesla factory is everyone says, no, Teslas are just easy. They just spring out. You know how

15:28.320 --> 15:32.400
I make them all the Tesla factory. You have to put things in sequence and out comes a Tesla.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.760
So you're talking about the factory.

15:33.760 --> 15:38.880
Yes. This is really nice. Super important point is that when I talk about the universe having a

15:38.880 --> 15:45.520
memory or there's some magic, it's not that. It's that tells you that there must be a process

15:45.520 --> 15:52.400
encoded somewhere in physical reality, be it a cell, a Tesla factory or something else that

15:52.400 --> 15:57.360
is making that object. I'm not saying there's some kind of woo woo memory in the universe,

15:57.840 --> 16:04.880
morphic resonance or something. I'm saying that there is an actual causal process that is being

16:04.880 --> 16:10.080
directed, constrained in some way. So it's not kind of just making everything.

16:10.080 --> 16:13.760
Yeah. But Lee, what's the factory that made the factory?

16:18.080 --> 16:24.000
So first of all, you assume the laws of physics has just sprung to existence at the beginning.

16:24.880 --> 16:29.040
Those are constraints, but what makes the factory the environment that does the selection?

16:29.040 --> 16:34.640
This is the question of, well, it's the first interesting question that I want to answer

16:34.640 --> 16:40.320
out of four. I think the factory emerges in the interplay between the environment

16:40.880 --> 16:48.240
and the objects that are being built. I'll have a go at explaining to you the shortest path.

16:48.240 --> 16:53.280
So why is the shortest path important? Imagine you've got, I'm going to have to go chemistry

16:53.280 --> 17:00.880
for a moment and then abstract it. So imagine you've got a given environment that you have

17:00.880 --> 17:07.280
a budget of atoms, you're just flinging together, and the objective of those atoms that are being

17:07.280 --> 17:15.840
flung together and say molecule A, they decompose. So molecules decompose over time. So the molecules

17:16.960 --> 17:22.720
in this environment, in this magic environment, have to not die, but they do die. They have a

17:22.720 --> 17:26.720
half-life. So the only way the molecules can get through that environment out the other side,

17:26.720 --> 17:32.080
let's pretend the environment is a box and go in and out without dying, and there's just an

17:32.080 --> 17:40.240
infinite supply of atoms coming or a large supply. The molecule gets built, but the molecule that

17:40.240 --> 17:47.440
is able to template itself being built and survives in the environment will basically

17:48.080 --> 17:56.560
reign supreme. Now let's say that molecule takes 10 steps and it's using a finite set of atoms.

17:57.760 --> 18:02.880
Now let's say another molecule, a smart ass molecule we'll call it, comes in and can survive

18:02.880 --> 18:10.240
in that environment and can copy itself, but it only needs five steps. The molecule that only

18:10.240 --> 18:14.640
needs five steps, because both molecules are being destroyed, but they're creating themselves

18:14.640 --> 18:21.360
faster, they can be destroyed. You can see that the shortest path reigns supreme. So the shortest

18:21.360 --> 18:26.800
path tells us something super interesting about the minimal amount of information required to

18:26.800 --> 18:34.880
propagate that motif in time and space. And it seems to be like some kind of conservation law.

18:34.880 --> 18:41.520
So one of the intuitions you have is the propagation of motifs in time will be done

18:41.520 --> 18:49.280
by the things that can construct themselves in the shortest path. So like you can assume

18:49.280 --> 18:53.360
that most of the objects in the universe are built in the shortest, in the most efficient way.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.480
Big leap I just took there.

18:58.480 --> 19:03.520
Yeah. Yes and no, because there are other things. So in the limit, yes,

19:03.520 --> 19:08.000
because you want to tell the difference between things that have required a factory to build them

19:08.000 --> 19:16.160
and just random processes. But you can find instances where the shortest path isn't taken

19:16.160 --> 19:23.760
for an individual object, an individual function. And people go, ah, that means the shortest path

19:23.760 --> 19:30.560
isn't right. And then I say, well, I don't know, I think it's right still. So of course, because

19:30.560 --> 19:35.680
there are other driving forces, it's not just one molecule. Now when you start to consider two

19:35.680 --> 19:41.520
objects, you have a joint assembly space. And now it's a compromise between not just making

19:41.520 --> 19:46.560
A and B in the shortest path. You want to make A and B in the shortest path, which might mean

19:46.560 --> 19:52.880
that A is slightly longer. You have a compromise. So when you see slightly more nesting in the

19:52.880 --> 19:57.920
construction, when you take a given object, that can look longer. But that's because the

19:57.920 --> 20:04.560
overall function is the object is still trying to be efficient. And this is still very hand wavy.

20:06.160 --> 20:09.600
Maybe I have no legs to stand on. We think we're getting somewhere with that.

20:09.600 --> 20:14.480
And there's probably some parallelization. Yeah, right. So this is all, this is not sequential.

20:14.480 --> 20:21.920
The building is, I guess, when you're talking about complex objects, you don't have to work

20:21.920 --> 20:25.120
sequentially. You can work in parallel. You can get your friends together and they can.

20:25.120 --> 20:31.680
Yeah. And the thing we're working on right now is how to understand these parallel processes. Now

20:31.680 --> 20:38.240
there's a new thing we've introduced called assembly depth. And assembly depth can be

20:39.040 --> 20:44.640
lower than the assembly index for a molecule when they're cooperating together because exactly

20:44.640 --> 20:50.000
this parallel processing is going on. And my team have been working this out in the last few weeks

20:50.000 --> 20:54.800
because we're looking at what compromises does nature need to make when it's making molecules

20:54.800 --> 21:01.440
in the cell. And I wonder if, you know, I'm maybe like, well, I'm always leaping out of

21:02.240 --> 21:07.040
my competence. But in economics, I'm just wondering if you could apply this in economic

21:07.040 --> 21:11.680
processes. Seems like capitalism is very good at finding shortest path, you know, every time.

21:11.680 --> 21:15.920
But there are ludicrous things that happen because actually the cost function has been minimized.

21:15.920 --> 21:21.280
And so I keep seeing parallels everywhere where there are complex nested systems, where if you

21:21.280 --> 21:26.640
give it enough time and you introduce a bit of heterogeneity, the system readjusts and finds a

21:26.640 --> 21:31.920
new shortest path. But the shortest path isn't fixed on just one molecule. Now it's in the actual

21:32.480 --> 21:37.040
existence of the object over time. And that object could be a city, it could be a cell,

21:37.040 --> 21:42.000
it could be a factory. But I think we're going way beyond molecules. And my competence,

21:42.000 --> 21:46.320
I probably should go back to molecules, but hey. All right. Before we get too far,

21:46.320 --> 21:52.400
let's talk about the assembly equation. Okay, how should we do this? Now, let me just even

21:52.400 --> 21:58.720
read that part of the paper. We define assembly as the total amount of selection necessary

21:58.720 --> 22:05.040
to produce an ensemble of observed objects quantified using equation one.

22:06.400 --> 22:10.720
The equation basically has a on one side, which is the assembly of the ensemble.

22:11.120 --> 22:20.880
And then a sum from one to N, where N is the total number of unique objects. And then there

22:20.880 --> 22:27.440
is a few variables in there that include the assembly index, the copy number, which we'll

22:27.440 --> 22:31.680
talk about. That's an interesting, I don't remember you talking about that. That's an interesting

22:31.680 --> 22:38.240
addition and I think a powerful one has to do with what that you can create pretty complex

22:38.240 --> 22:44.000
objects randomly. And in order to know that they're not random, that there's a factory involved,

22:44.000 --> 22:48.800
you need to see a bunch of them. That's the intuition there. It's an interesting intuition.

22:49.520 --> 22:56.480
And then some normalization. What else is N? In minus one, just to make sure that more than

22:56.480 --> 23:00.480
one object, one object could be a one-off and random. And then you have more than one

23:00.480 --> 23:05.840
identical object. That's interesting. When there's two of a thing. Two of a thing is

23:05.840 --> 23:09.200
super important, especially if the assembly index is high.

23:09.920 --> 23:15.680
So we could say several questions here. One, let's talk about selection. What is this term

23:15.680 --> 23:19.920
selection? What is this term evolution that we're referring to? Which aspect of

23:20.560 --> 23:23.920
Darwinian evolution are we referring to? That's interesting here.

23:27.200 --> 23:30.560
This is probably the paper. We should talk about the paper for a second. The paper,

23:30.560 --> 23:35.600
what it did is it kind of annoyed. We didn't know it. I mean, it got attention

23:36.160 --> 23:41.360
and obviously the angry people were annoyed. There's angry people in the world. That's good.

23:41.360 --> 23:45.360
So what happened is the evolutionary biologist got angry. We were not expecting that because

23:45.360 --> 23:51.120
we thought evolutionary biologists would be cool. I knew that some, not many, computational

23:51.120 --> 23:55.600
complexity people will get angry because I'd kind of been poking them and maybe I deserved it,

23:55.600 --> 24:01.520
but I was trying to poke them in a productive way. And then the physicists kind of got grumpy

24:01.520 --> 24:06.400
because the initial conditions tell everything. The pre-biotic chemists got slightly grumpy

24:06.400 --> 24:09.520
because there's not enough chemistry in there. Then finally, when the creationists said it

24:09.520 --> 24:14.400
wasn't creationist enough, I was like, I've done my job. You're saying the physics, they say,

24:15.680 --> 24:21.200
because you're basically saying that physics is not enough to tell the story of how biology

24:21.200 --> 24:27.840
emerges. I think so. And then they said, a few physics is the beginning and the end of the story.

24:28.880 --> 24:33.600
Yeah. So what happened is the reason why people put the phone down on the call of the paper,

24:34.320 --> 24:39.280
if you're reading the paper like a phone call, they got to the abstract. And in the abstract,

24:39.280 --> 24:45.200
the first two sentences caused everybody. Scientists have grappled with reconciling

24:45.200 --> 24:50.880
biological evolution with the immutable laws of the universe defined by physics.

24:51.760 --> 24:54.080
There's nothing wrong with that statement. Totally true.

24:55.440 --> 25:00.720
Yeah. These laws underpin life's origin, evolution, and the development of human

25:00.720 --> 25:05.360
culture and technology, yet they do not predict the emergence of these phenomena.

25:06.320 --> 25:10.960
Wow. First of all, we should say the title of the paper. This paper was accepted and

25:10.960 --> 25:16.080
published in Nature. The title is Assembly Theory Explains and Quantifies Selection and

25:16.080 --> 25:24.080
Evolution. Very humble title. And the entirety of the paper, I think, presents interesting ideas,

25:24.080 --> 25:31.760
but reaches high. I am not. I would do it all again. This paper was actually on the

25:31.760 --> 25:34.640
preprint server for over a year. You regret nothing.

25:34.640 --> 25:38.800
Yeah. I think, yeah, I don't regret anything. You and Frank Sinatra did it your way.

25:39.440 --> 25:44.400
What I love about being a scientist is kind of sometimes, because I'm a bit dim, I'm like,

25:44.400 --> 25:46.880
and I don't understand what people are telling me. I want to get to the point.

25:47.520 --> 25:53.600
This paper says, hey, laws of physics are really cool. The universe is great, but

25:56.480 --> 26:00.160
it's not intuitive that you just run the standard model and get life out.

26:00.160 --> 26:06.560
I think most physicists might go, yeah, we can't just go back and say that's what happened,

26:06.560 --> 26:11.840
because physics can't explain the origin of life yet. It doesn't mean it won't or can't.

26:12.160 --> 26:15.920
Just to be clear, sorry, intelligent designers. We are going to get there.

26:16.800 --> 26:22.720
Second point, we say that evolution works, but we don't know how evolution got going,

26:22.720 --> 26:27.920
so biological evolution and biological selection. For me, this seems like a simple continuum.

26:28.560 --> 26:33.120
When I mentioned selection and evolution in the title, I think, and in the abstract,

26:33.760 --> 26:37.840
we should have maybe prefaced that and said non-biological selection and non-biological

26:37.840 --> 26:42.240
evolution. Then that might have made it even more crystal clear, but I didn't think that

26:43.280 --> 26:48.640
evolutionary biology should be so bold to claim ownership of selection and evolution.

26:49.280 --> 26:53.200
Secondly, a lot of evolutionary biologists seem to dismiss the origin of life question

26:53.200 --> 26:59.600
and just say it's obvious. That causes a real problem scientifically, because when the physicists

26:59.600 --> 27:04.320
are like, we own the universe, the universe is good, we explain all of it, look at us,

27:04.800 --> 27:10.000
biologists say we can explain biology, and the poor chemist in the middle going, but hang on.

27:12.800 --> 27:21.840
This paper says, hey, there is an interesting disconnect between physics and biology,

27:21.840 --> 27:25.440
and that's at the point at which memories get made in chemistry through bonds.

27:26.080 --> 27:33.600
Hey, let's look at this close and see if we can quantify it. I never expected the paper to get

27:33.600 --> 27:37.280
that much interest, and still, I mean, it's only been published just over a month ago now.

27:38.000 --> 27:46.640
Just to link on the selection, what is the broader sense of what selection means?

27:46.640 --> 27:56.080
Yeah. Good. For selection, I think for selection, so this is where for me the concept of an object

27:56.080 --> 28:01.360
is something that can persist in time and not die, but basically can be broken up.

28:02.320 --> 28:09.280
So if I was going to bolster the definition of an object, so if something can form

28:10.400 --> 28:20.320
and persist for a long period of time under an existing environment that could destroy other,

28:21.280 --> 28:26.880
and I'm going to use anthropomorphic terms, I apologize, weaker objects or less robust,

28:27.200 --> 28:32.480
then the environment could have selected that. So good chemistry examples, if you took some carbon

28:32.480 --> 28:40.000
and you made a chain of carbon atoms, whereas if you took some, I don't know, some carbon, nitrogen,

28:40.000 --> 28:45.360
and oxygen and made change from those, you'd start to get different reactions and rearrangements. So

28:45.360 --> 28:54.400
a chain of carbon atoms might be more resistant to falling apart under acidic or basic conditions

28:54.400 --> 29:00.480
versus another set of molecules. So it survives in that environment. So the acid pond, the

29:02.000 --> 29:08.400
resistant molecule can get through, and then that molecule goes into another environment.

29:08.400 --> 29:14.640
So that environment now maybe being an acid pond is a basic pond, or maybe it's an oxidizing pond.

29:14.640 --> 29:19.200
And so if you've got carbon and it goes in an oxidizing pond, maybe the carbon starts to oxidize

29:19.200 --> 29:24.320
and break apart. So you go through all these kind of obstacle courses, if you like, given

29:24.320 --> 29:31.040
by reality. So selection is the ability happens when an object survives in the environment for

29:31.040 --> 29:40.320
some time, but, and this is a thing that's super subtle, the object has to be continually being

29:40.320 --> 29:45.440
destroyed and made by process. So it's not just about the object now, it's about the process and

29:45.440 --> 29:51.120
time that makes it, because a rock could just stand on the mountainside for four billion years

29:51.120 --> 29:55.920
and nothing happened to it. And that's not necessarily really advanced selection. So for

29:55.920 --> 30:00.800
selection to get really interesting, you need to have a turnover in time. You need to be continually

30:00.800 --> 30:06.400
creating objects, producing them, what we call discovery time. So there's a discovery time for

30:06.400 --> 30:12.640
an object. When that object is discovered, if it's a molecule that can then act on itself,

30:12.640 --> 30:17.840
or the chain of events that caused itself to bolster its formation, then you go from discovery

30:17.840 --> 30:22.640
time to production time. And suddenly you have more of it in the universe. So it could be a

30:22.640 --> 30:27.360
self replicating molecule. And the interaction of the molecule in the environment in the warm

30:27.360 --> 30:33.680
little pond or in the sea or wherever in the bubble could then start to build a proto factory,

30:33.680 --> 30:38.880
the environment. So really, to answer your question, what the factory is, the factory is

30:38.880 --> 30:43.440
the environment, but it's not very autonomous. It's not very redundant. There's lots of things

30:43.440 --> 30:51.040
that could go wrong. So once you get high enough up the hierarchy of networks of interactions,

30:52.000 --> 30:55.200
something needs to happen that needs to be compressed into a smaller volume and made

30:55.200 --> 31:01.520
resistant robust. Because in biology, selection and evolution is robust, that you have error

31:01.520 --> 31:06.240
correction built in, you have really, you know, there's good ways of basically making sure

31:06.240 --> 31:12.880
propagation goes on. So really the difference between inorganic, abiotic selection and evolution

31:12.880 --> 31:19.920
and evolution and stuff in biology is robustness. The ability to kind of propagate over,

31:22.400 --> 31:28.480
the ability to survive in lots of different environments. Whereas our poor little inorganic

31:29.280 --> 31:34.480
soul molecule, whatever, just dies in lots of different environments. So there's something

31:34.480 --> 31:40.560
super special that happens from the inorganic molecule in the environment that kills it

31:40.560 --> 31:43.280
to where you've got evolution and cells can survive everywhere.

31:44.720 --> 31:49.600
How special is that? How do you know those kinds of evolution factors aren't everywhere in the

31:49.600 --> 31:58.000
universe? I don't and I'm excited because I think selection isn't special at all. I think what is

31:58.000 --> 32:04.960
special is the history of the environments on earth that gave rise to the first cell

32:04.960 --> 32:11.760
that now has, you know, has taken all those environments and is now more autonomous.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.800
And I would like to think that, you know, this paper

32:17.120 --> 32:23.360
could be very wrong, but I don't think it's very wrong. I mean, it's certainly wrong,

32:23.360 --> 32:28.800
but it's less wrong than some other ideas, right? And if this allows, inspires us to go and look

32:28.800 --> 32:33.040
for selection in the universe, because we now have an equation where we can say we can look

32:33.040 --> 32:38.400
for selection going on and say, oh, that's interesting. We seem to have a process that's

32:39.600 --> 32:45.840
giving us high copy number objects also are highly complex, but that doesn't look like life as we

32:45.840 --> 32:50.400
know it. And we use that and say, oh, there's a hydrothermal vent. Oh, there's a process going

32:50.400 --> 32:55.760
on. There's molecular networks because the assembly equation is not only meant to identify

32:55.760 --> 33:02.400
at the higher end, advanced selection, what you get, I would call it in biology, you super advanced

33:02.400 --> 33:07.040
selection. And even, I mean, you could use the assembly equation to look for technology and

33:08.320 --> 33:12.800
God forbid we could talk about consciousness and abstraction, but let's keep it primitive

33:12.800 --> 33:17.680
molecules and biology. So I think the real power of the assembly equation is to say how

33:17.680 --> 33:23.120
much selection is going on in this space. And there's, there's a really simple thought experiment

33:23.120 --> 33:27.360
I could do is you, you know, have a little Petri dish and on that Petri dish, you put some simple

33:27.360 --> 33:32.880
food. So the assembly index of all the sugars and everything is quite low. So then, and you put a

33:32.880 --> 33:38.320
single echo cell of the E. coli cell, and then you say, I'm going to, I'm going to measure the

33:38.320 --> 33:45.040
assembly in this amount of assembly in the box. So it's quite low, but the rate of change of

33:45.040 --> 33:51.760
assembly DADT will go vum sigmoidal as it eats all the food and the number of coli cells will

33:51.760 --> 33:56.480
replicate because they take all the food, they can copy themselves, the assembly index of all

33:56.480 --> 34:02.240
the molecules goes up, up, up and up until the food is exhausted in the box. So now the, now the

34:02.240 --> 34:08.320
E. coli's stop, I mean, die is probably a strong word, they stop respiring because all the food

34:08.320 --> 34:12.560
has gone, but suddenly the amount of assembly in the box has gone up gigantically because of

34:12.560 --> 34:18.880
that one E. coli factory has just eaten through, milled lots of other E. coli factories, run out

34:18.880 --> 34:24.160
of food and stopped. And so that looking at that, so in the initial box, although the amount of

34:24.160 --> 34:29.920
assembly was really small, it was able to replicate and use all the food and go up.

34:29.920 --> 34:34.000
And that's what we're trying to do in the lab actually is kind of make those kind of experiments

34:34.000 --> 34:40.800
and see if we can spot the emergence of molecular networks that are producing complexity as we feed

34:40.800 --> 34:47.200
in raw materials and we feed a challenge, an environment, we try and kill the molecules.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.320
And really that's the main kind of idea for the entire paper.

34:52.320 --> 34:56.640
Yeah. And see if you can measure the changes in the assembly index throughout the whole system.

34:56.640 --> 34:57.040
Yeah.

34:57.040 --> 35:02.160
Okay. What about if I show up to a new planet, we'll go to Mars or some other planet from a

35:02.160 --> 35:09.440
different solar system. And how do we use assembly index there to discover alien life?

35:11.360 --> 35:15.520
Very simply, actually, let's say we'll go to Mars with a mass spectrometer with a sufficiently

35:15.520 --> 35:20.160
high resolution. So what you have to be able to do, so good thing about mass spec

35:22.080 --> 35:28.240
is that you can select the molecule from the mass. And then if it's high enough resolution,

35:28.240 --> 35:34.080
you can be more and more sure that you're just seeing identical copies. You can count them

35:34.080 --> 35:38.080
and then you fragment them and you count the number of fragments and look at the molecular

35:38.080 --> 35:41.760
weight. And the higher the molecular weight and the higher the number of fragments, the higher

35:41.760 --> 35:46.560
the assembly index. So if you go to Mars and you take a mass spec or high enough resolution

35:46.560 --> 35:52.000
and you can find molecules, and I'll give a guide on earth, if you could find molecules, say,

35:52.640 --> 36:00.080
greater than 350 molecular weight with more than 15 fragments, you have found artifacts that can

36:00.080 --> 36:07.040
only be produced, at least on earth, by life. Now you would say, oh, well, maybe the geological

36:07.040 --> 36:11.360
process, I would argue very vehemently that that is not the case. But we can say, look,

36:11.360 --> 36:17.920
if you don't like the cut off on earth, go up higher, 30, 100, right? Because there's going

36:17.920 --> 36:22.480
to be a point where you'll find a molecule with so many different parts, the chances of you

36:23.120 --> 36:30.560
getting a molecule that has 100 different parts and finding a million identical copies,

36:31.360 --> 36:37.280
you know, that's just impossible. That could never happen in an infinite set of universes.

36:37.280 --> 36:42.160
Can you just linger on this copy number thing? A million different copies.

36:44.400 --> 36:48.080
What do you mean by copies? And why is the number of copies important?

36:48.960 --> 36:56.080
Yeah, that was so interesting. And I always understood the copy number is really important,

36:56.080 --> 37:03.760
but I never explained it properly for ages. And I kept having this, it goes back to this,

37:03.760 --> 37:09.360
if I give you a, I don't know, a really complicated molecule, and I say it's complicated,

37:09.360 --> 37:14.880
you could say, hey, that's really complicated. But is it just really random? And so I realized

37:14.880 --> 37:23.920
that ultimate randomness and ultimate complexity are indistinguishable until you can see a structure

37:23.920 --> 37:31.280
in the randomness. So you can see copies. So copies implies structure. Yeah.

37:33.040 --> 37:38.880
The factory. I mean, there's a deep, profound thing in there. Because if you just have a random

37:41.760 --> 37:47.840
process, you're going to get a lot of complex, beautiful, sophisticated things. What makes them

37:47.840 --> 37:57.120
complex in the way we think life is complex? Or yeah, something like a factory that's operating

37:57.120 --> 38:02.800
under a selection process, there should be copies. Is there like some looseness about copies? Like,

38:04.240 --> 38:09.680
what does it mean for two objects to be equal? It's all to do with the telescope or the microscope

38:09.680 --> 38:16.800
you're using. And so at the maximum resolution, so the nice thing about chemists is they have

38:16.800 --> 38:20.800
this concept of the molecule, and they're all familiar with the molecule. And molecules,

38:20.800 --> 38:27.120
you can hold on your hand, lots of them, identical copies. A molecule is actually a super important

38:27.120 --> 38:31.520
thing in chemistry to say, look, you can have a mole of a molecule, an Avogadro's number of

38:31.520 --> 38:36.400
molecules, and they're identical. What does that mean? That means that the molecular composition,

38:36.400 --> 38:41.840
the bonding and so on, the configuration is indistinguishable. You can hold them together,

38:41.840 --> 38:48.080
you can overlay them. So the way I do it is if I say, here's a bag of 10 identical molecules,

38:48.080 --> 38:53.760
let's prove they're identical. You pick one out of the bag and you basically observe it using some

38:53.760 --> 38:58.000
technique, and then you take it away, and then you take another one out. If you observe it using

38:58.000 --> 39:01.760
technique, you see no differences, they're identical. It's really interesting to get right,

39:01.760 --> 39:07.680
because if you take, say, two molecules, molecules can be in different vibrational and rotational

39:07.680 --> 39:11.920
states, they're moving all the time. So with this respect, identical molecules have identical

39:11.920 --> 39:17.360
bonding. In this case, we don't even talk about chirality, because we don't have a chirality

39:17.360 --> 39:24.000
detector. So two identical molecules in one conception assembly theory basically considers

39:24.000 --> 39:29.760
both hands as being the same. But of course, they're not, they're different. As soon as you

39:29.760 --> 39:35.600
have a chiral distinguisher to detect the left and the right hand, they become different. And so

39:35.600 --> 39:39.760
it's to do with the detection system that you have and the resolution.

39:39.760 --> 39:47.200
So I wonder if there's an art and science to the which detection system is used when you show up

39:47.200 --> 39:51.360
to a new planet. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So like you're talking about chemistry a lot today.

39:52.320 --> 39:58.720
We have kind of standardized detection systems, right, of how to compare molecules.

39:59.680 --> 40:05.760
So, you know, when you start to talk about emojis and language and mathematical theorems and,

40:07.600 --> 40:12.320
I don't know, more sophisticated things at a different scale, at a smaller scale than molecules,

40:12.320 --> 40:19.360
at a larger scale than molecules. Like what detection, if we look at the difference between

40:19.360 --> 40:25.600
you and me, Lex and Lee, are we the same? Are we different? Sure. I mean, of course we're different

40:25.680 --> 40:30.000
close up. But if you zoom out a little bit, it will morphologically look the same.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.360
Yeah. You know, high characteristics, hair length, stuff like that.

40:35.360 --> 40:38.240
Well, also like the species and. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:38.240 --> 40:41.760
And also there's a sense why we're both from Earth.

40:42.480 --> 40:46.880
Yeah, I agree. I mean, this is the power of assembly theory in that regard, that you,

40:46.880 --> 40:51.200
if you, so if everything, so the way to look at it, if you have a box of objects,

40:51.920 --> 41:00.320
if they're all, if they're all indistinguishable, then using your technique, you then,

41:00.320 --> 41:05.120
what you then do is you then look at the assembly index. Now if the assembly index of them is really

41:05.120 --> 41:09.680
low, right, and they're all indistinguishable, then you've, then it's telling you that you have

41:09.680 --> 41:14.320
to go to another resolution. So that would be, you know, it's kind of a sliding scale. It's kind of

41:14.320 --> 41:19.280
nice. So you got it. So those two kind of are a tension with each other. Yeah. The number of

41:19.280 --> 41:25.600
copies in the assembly index. Yeah. That's really, really interesting. So, okay. So you

41:25.600 --> 41:30.880
show up to a new planet, you'll be doing what? I would do mass spec. I would bring. On a sample

41:30.880 --> 41:35.200
of what? Like, first of all, like how big of a scoop do you take? Did you just take the scoop?

41:35.200 --> 41:43.840
Like what? Like, so we're looking for primitive life. I would, I would look, yeah. So if we're

41:43.840 --> 41:50.160
just going to Mars or Titan or Enceladus or somewhere. So a number of ways of doing it. So

41:50.160 --> 41:55.120
you could take a large scoop or you go for the atmosphere and detect stuff. So you could make a

41:56.560 --> 42:04.960
life meter, right? So one of Sarah's colleagues at ASU, Paul Davis keeps calling it a life meter,

42:05.680 --> 42:09.360
a life meter, which is quite a nice idea because you think about it. If you've got

42:10.320 --> 42:15.840
a living system that's producing these highly complex molecules and they drift away and they're

42:15.840 --> 42:22.240
in a highly kind of demanding environment, they could be burnt, right? So they could just be

42:22.240 --> 42:26.400
falling apart. So you want to sniff a little bit of complexity and say warmer, warmer, warmer. Oh,

42:26.400 --> 42:31.440
we've found life. We've found the alien. We've found the alien Elon Musk smoking a joint in the

42:31.440 --> 42:35.840
bottom of the cave on Mars or Elon himself, whatever, right? You say, okay, found it.

42:35.840 --> 42:41.120
So what you can do is a mass spectrometer. You could just look for things in the gas phase

42:41.120 --> 42:45.680
or you go on the surface drill down because you want to find molecules that are,

42:47.360 --> 42:52.000
you've either got to find the source living system because the problem with just looking

42:52.000 --> 42:59.440
for complexity is it gets burnt away. So in a harsh environment on say on the surface of Mars,

42:59.440 --> 43:04.080
there's a very low probability that you're going to find really complex molecules because of all

43:04.080 --> 43:08.960
the radiation and so on. If you drill down a little bit, you could drill down a bit into

43:08.960 --> 43:15.600
soil that's billions of years old. Then I would put in some solvent, water, alcohol or something,

43:15.600 --> 43:22.880
or take a scoop, make it volatile, put it into the mass spectrometer and just try and detect

43:23.520 --> 43:28.320
high complexity, high abundant molecules. And if you get them, hey presto, you can have evidence

43:28.320 --> 43:33.520
of life. Wouldn't that then be great if you could say, okay, we've found evidence of life

43:34.240 --> 43:39.200
now we want to keep the life meter, keep searching for more and more complexity

43:39.200 --> 43:44.400
until you actually find living cells. You can get those new living cells and then you could bring

43:44.400 --> 43:47.840
them back to earth or you could try and sequence them. You could see that they have different DNA

43:47.840 --> 43:52.480
and proteins. Go along the gradient of the life meter. How would you build a life meter? Let's

43:52.480 --> 43:58.240
say we're together starting a new company launching a life meter. Mass spectrometer would be the first

43:58.240 --> 44:03.120
way of doing it. No, no, no, but that's one of the major components of it. But I'm talking about

44:04.080 --> 44:08.720
what if it's a device and branding logo, we've got to talk about that later.

44:08.720 --> 44:15.360
But what's the input? How do you get to the metered output?

44:15.360 --> 44:21.280
So I would take a life. So my life meter, our life meter, there you go.

44:21.280 --> 44:21.760
Thank you.

44:21.760 --> 44:29.520
Yeah, you're welcome. It would have both infrared and mass spec. So it would have two ports so it

44:29.520 --> 44:35.680
could shine a light. And so what it would do is you would have a vacuum chamber and you would

44:35.680 --> 44:42.400
have an electrostatic analyzer and you'd have a monochromator to producing infrared. You'd

44:42.400 --> 44:47.520
add the sump. So you'd take a scoop of the sample, put it in the life meter. It would then add a

44:47.520 --> 44:52.960
solvent or heat up the sample. So some volatiles come off. The volatiles would then be put into the

44:54.160 --> 44:57.920
mass spectrometer, into the electrostatic trap and you'd weigh the molecules and fragment them.

44:58.560 --> 45:01.680
Alternatively, you'd shine infrared light on them. You count the number of bands,

45:01.680 --> 45:05.280
but you'd have to, in that case, do some separation because you want to separate.

45:05.840 --> 45:10.000
And so in mass spec, it's really nice and convenient because you can separate electrostatically.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.760
But you need to have that.

45:11.760 --> 45:12.960
Can you do it in real time?

45:12.960 --> 45:17.760
Yeah, pretty much. So let's go all the way back. So okay, we're really going to get this.

45:17.760 --> 45:18.260
Let's go.

45:19.360 --> 45:21.520
Lex's life meter, Lex and Lee's life meter.

45:21.520 --> 45:25.120
Lex and Lee. It's a good ring to it.

45:25.120 --> 45:30.960
All right. So you have a vacuum chamber. You have a little nose. The nose would have

45:33.680 --> 45:40.480
a packing material. So you would take your sample, add it onto the nose, add a solvent or a gas.

45:40.480 --> 45:45.760
It would then be sucked up the nose and that would be separated using what we call chromatography.

45:45.760 --> 45:50.000
And then as each band comes off the nose, we would then do mass spec and infrared.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.800
And in the case of the infrared, count the number of bands. In the case of mass spec,

45:54.800 --> 45:56.640
count the number of fragments and weigh it.

45:56.640 --> 46:00.880
And then the further up in molecular weight range for the mass spec and the number of bands,

46:00.880 --> 46:06.480
you go up and up and up from the dead, interesting, interesting, over the threshold, oh my gosh,

46:06.480 --> 46:13.280
earth life. And then right up to the batshit crazy, this is definitely alien intelligence

46:13.280 --> 46:17.120
that's made this life, right? You could almost go all the way there, same in the infrared.

46:17.120 --> 46:18.080
And it's pretty simple.

46:18.720 --> 46:26.720
The thing that is really problematical is that for many years, decades, what people have done,

46:26.720 --> 46:31.440
and I can't blame them, is they've rather, they've been obsessing about small biomarkers

46:32.160 --> 46:37.440
that we find on earth, amino acids, like single amino acids or evidence of small molecules and

46:37.440 --> 46:42.960
these things and looking for those, run looking for complexity. The beautiful thing about this is

46:42.960 --> 46:50.880
you can look for complexity without earth chemistry bias or earth biology bias.

46:50.880 --> 46:56.160
So assembly theory is just a way of saying, hey, complexity in abundance is evidence of selection.

46:56.160 --> 46:58.400
That's how our universal life meter will work.

46:58.960 --> 47:02.400
Complexity in abundance is evidence of selection.

47:04.480 --> 47:09.200
Okay, so let's apply our life meter to earth.

47:09.440 --> 47:20.000
So what, if we were just to apply assembly index measurements to earth, what kind of stuff are

47:20.000 --> 47:26.400
going to be, are going to get, what's impressive about some of the complexity on earth?

47:26.400 --> 47:31.680
So we did this a few years ago when I was trying to convince NASA and colleagues that this

47:31.680 --> 47:34.560
technique could work. And honestly, it's so funny because everyone's like, no, it ain't going to

47:34.560 --> 47:41.520
work. And it was just like, because the chemists were saying, of course, there are complicated

47:41.520 --> 47:47.120
molecules out there you can detect that just form randomly. I was like, really? That's like,

47:47.120 --> 47:53.680
that was like, you know, it's a bit like a, I don't know, someone saying, of course, Darwin

47:54.400 --> 47:57.920
textbook was just written randomly by some monkeys and a typewriter. It was just for me,

47:57.920 --> 48:02.880
it was like, really? And I've pushed a lot on the chemists now. And I think

48:03.680 --> 48:07.920
most of them are on board, but not totally. I really, it really had some big arguments,

48:07.920 --> 48:12.240
but the copy number caught there. Cause I think I confused the chemists by saying one off. And

48:12.240 --> 48:15.920
then when I made clear about the copy number, I think that made it a little bit easier.

48:15.920 --> 48:21.920
Just to clarify chemists might say that, of course, out there outside of earth,

48:21.920 --> 48:28.240
there's complex molecules. Yes. Okay. And then you're saying, wait a minute, that's like saying,

48:28.320 --> 48:33.280
of course, there's aliens out there. Like you, yeah, exactly that. Okay. Exactly. But you're,

48:33.280 --> 48:40.080
you're saying you clarify that that's actually a very interesting question. And we should be

48:40.080 --> 48:46.800
looking for complex molecules of which the copy number is two or greater. Yeah, exactly. So on

48:46.800 --> 48:51.840
earth, so coming back to earth, what we did is we took a whole bunch of samples. We, and we were

48:51.840 --> 48:58.640
running pre-biotic chemistry experiments in the lab. We took various inorganic minerals and

48:58.640 --> 49:04.080
extracted them. Look at the volatile because there's a special way of treating minerals

49:04.080 --> 49:11.520
and polymers in assembly theory. In this, in our life machine, we're looking at molecules.

49:11.520 --> 49:15.760
We don't care about polymers because they don't, they're not volatile. You can't hold them.

49:15.760 --> 49:20.240
They're not. How can you make, if you can't assert that they're identical,

49:20.240 --> 49:25.280
then it's very difficult for you to, to, to work out if there's undergone selection or they're just

49:25.280 --> 49:30.080
a random mess. Same with some minerals, but we can come back to that. So basically what you do,

49:30.080 --> 49:35.920
we got a whole load of samples, inorganic ones. We got a load of, we got Scotch whiskey and also

49:35.920 --> 49:42.400
got, I took Ardberg, which is one of my favorite whiskeys, which is very peaty. And another whisk

49:42.400 --> 49:51.200
is like, so the way that on, in Scotland, in Islay, which is a little island, the Scotch,

49:51.200 --> 50:01.120
the whiskey is led to mature in barrels. And the, it's said that the peak, the complex molecules

50:01.120 --> 50:06.240
in the peat might find their way through into the whiskey. And that's what gives it this intense

50:06.800 --> 50:13.040
brown color and really complex flavor. It's literally molecular complexity that does that.

50:13.040 --> 50:16.400
And so, you know, Volcker is the complete opposite. It's just pure, right?

50:16.400 --> 50:19.680
So the better the whiskey, the higher the assembly index. The higher the assembly index,

50:19.680 --> 50:25.440
the better the whiskey. That's what I mean. I really love deep peaty Scottish whiskies. Near

50:25.440 --> 50:31.360
my house, there is a low, one of the lowland distilleries called Glengoyne. It's still beautiful

50:31.360 --> 50:37.040
whiskey, but not as complex. So for fun, I took some Glengoyne whiskey in Ardberg and put them

50:37.040 --> 50:41.600
into the mass spec and measure the assembly index. I also got E. coli. So the way we do it,

50:41.600 --> 50:49.680
take E. coli, break the cell apart, take it all apart. And also got some beer. And people were

50:49.680 --> 50:53.520
ridiculing us saying, oh, beer is evidence of complexity. And one of the, one of the

50:53.520 --> 51:01.360
computational complexity people was just throwing, yeah, kind of, kind of he's very

51:01.360 --> 51:05.280
vigorous in his disagreement of assembly theory was just saying, you know, you don't know what

51:05.280 --> 51:10.720
you're doing. Even beer is more complicated than human. We didn't realize is that it's not beer

51:10.720 --> 51:17.360
per se. It is taking the yeast extract, taking the extract, breaking the cells, extracting the

51:17.360 --> 51:20.320
molecules and just looking at the profile of the molecules, see if there's anything over the

51:20.320 --> 51:26.320
threshold. And we also put in a really complex molecule taxol. So we took all of these, but also

51:26.320 --> 51:30.880
NASA gave us, I think, five samples and they wouldn't tell us what they are. They said, no,

51:30.880 --> 51:34.720
we don't believe you can get this to work. And they really, you know, they gave us some super

51:34.720 --> 51:41.280
complex samples and they gave us two fossils, one that was a million years old and one was at 10,000

51:41.280 --> 51:46.720
years old. See, but something from Antarctica, seabed, they gave us the Murchison meter,

51:46.720 --> 51:52.000
right? And a few others, put them through the system. So we took all the samples,

51:52.000 --> 51:57.280
treat them all identically, put them into mass spec, fragmented them, counted. And in this case,

51:58.160 --> 52:05.680
implicit in the measurement was in mass spec, you only detect peaks when you've got more than say,

52:05.680 --> 52:10.000
let's say 10,000 identical molecules. So the copy numbers already baked in,

52:10.000 --> 52:14.160
but wasn't quantified, which is super important there. That was in the first paper because I was

52:14.160 --> 52:21.120
like, it's abundant, of course. And when you then took it all out, we found that the biological

52:21.120 --> 52:30.160
samples gave you molecules that had an assembly index greater than 15 and all the abartic samples

52:30.160 --> 52:33.600
were less than 15. And then we took the NASA samples and we looked at the ones that were more

52:33.600 --> 52:38.640
than 15, less than 15. And we gave them back to NASA and they're like, oh gosh, yep, dead,

52:38.640 --> 52:43.120
living, dead, living. You got it. And that's what we found on earth.

52:44.240 --> 52:47.280
That's a success. Yeah. Oh yeah. Resounding success.

52:49.040 --> 52:53.600
Can you just go back to the beer and the E. coli? So what's the assembly index on those?

52:54.240 --> 53:03.760
So what you were able to do is like the assembly index of, we found high assembly index molecules

53:04.480 --> 53:11.920
originating from the beer sample and the E. coli sample. I didn't know which one was higher. We

53:11.920 --> 53:17.520
wouldn't really do any detail there because now we are doing that because one of the things we've

53:17.520 --> 53:24.960
done, it's a secret, but I can tell you. Nobody's listening.

53:24.960 --> 53:30.160
Well, is that we've just mapped the tree of life using assembly theory because everyone said that

53:30.160 --> 53:34.080
you can't do it from biology. And what we were able to do is, so I think there's three ways,

53:34.080 --> 53:37.840
well, two ways of doing tree of life traffic. Well, three ways actually.

53:37.840 --> 53:40.640
What's the tree of life? So the tree of life is basically

53:41.840 --> 53:47.200
tracing back the history of life on earth, all different species going back, who evolved from

53:47.200 --> 53:52.160
what. And it all goes all the way back to the first kind of life forms and they branch off.

53:52.160 --> 53:58.640
And like you have plant kingdom, the animal kingdom, the fungi system kingdom, and different

53:58.640 --> 54:03.760
branches all the way up. And the way this was classically done, and I'm no evolutionary

54:03.760 --> 54:08.560
biologist, the evolutionary biologists are very, tell me every day, at least 10 times.

54:09.600 --> 54:12.000
I want to be one though. I kind of like biology. It's kind of cool.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.440
Yeah, it's very cool.

54:13.440 --> 54:19.280
But basically what Darwin and Mendeleev and all these people do is just they draw pictures,

54:19.280 --> 54:25.440
right? And they tax it. They were able to draw pictures and say, oh, these look like common

54:25.440 --> 54:35.040
classes. But they were able to find out a lot, right? And looking at vertebrates,

54:35.040 --> 54:42.000
invertebrates, Cameron explosion, all this stuff. And then came the genomic revolution and suddenly

54:42.000 --> 54:46.080
everyone used gene sequencing. And Craig Venter is a good example. I think he's gone around the

54:46.080 --> 54:50.080
world in his yacht, just picking up samples, looking for new species, where he's just found

54:50.080 --> 54:57.360
new species of life just from sequencing. It's amazing. So you have taxonomy, you have sequencing,

54:57.360 --> 55:04.240
and then you can also do a little bit of kind of molecular kind of archaeology, like measure the

55:04.240 --> 55:12.960
samples and kind of form some inference. What we did is we were able to fingerprint, so we took

55:12.960 --> 55:19.200
a load of random samples from all of biology, and we use mass spectrometry. And what we did now is

55:19.200 --> 55:24.720
not just look for individual molecules, but we looked for coexisting molecules, where they had

55:24.720 --> 55:30.400
to look at their joint assembly space, and where we were able to cut them apart and undergo recursion

55:30.400 --> 55:36.240
in the mass spec and infer some relationships. And we were able to recapitulate the tree of life

55:36.240 --> 55:44.240
using mass spectroscopy. No sequencing and no drawing. All right. Can you try to say that again

55:44.400 --> 55:49.440
with a little more detail? So recreating, what does it take to recreate the tree of life?

55:49.440 --> 55:52.080
What does the reverse engineering process look like here?

55:52.080 --> 55:56.000
So what you do is you take an unknown sample, you put it into the mass spec,

55:57.520 --> 56:01.120
because this comes from what you're asking, like what do you see in E. coli? And so in E. coli,

56:01.120 --> 56:07.520
you don't just see, it's not that the most sophisticated cells on Earth make the most

56:07.520 --> 56:12.960
sophisticated molecules. It is the coexistence of lots of complex molecules above a threshold.

56:13.520 --> 56:19.840
And so what we realized is you could fingerprint different life forms. So fungi make really

56:19.840 --> 56:23.440
complicated molecules. Why? Because they can't move. They have to make everything on site.

56:24.320 --> 56:30.160
Whereas some animals are like lazy. They can just go eat the fungi. They don't need to make very

56:30.160 --> 56:37.440
much. And so what you do is you look at the, so you take, I don't know, the fingerprint, maybe the

56:37.440 --> 56:42.400
top number of high molecular weight molecules you find in the sample, you fragment them to get

56:42.400 --> 56:50.320
their assembly indices. And then what you can do is you can infer common origins of molecules.

56:50.320 --> 56:57.200
You can do a kind of molecular, when the reverse engineering of the assembly space,

56:57.200 --> 57:00.960
you can infer common roots and look at what's called the joint assembly space.

57:02.000 --> 57:06.640
But let's translate that into the experiment. Take a sample, bung it in the mass spec,

57:06.640 --> 57:12.720
take the top say 10 molecules, fragment them, and that gives you one fingerprint.

57:13.280 --> 57:17.040
Then you do it for another sample, you get another fingerprint. Now the question is you say,

57:17.040 --> 57:24.160
hey, are these samples the same or different? And that's what we've been able to do. And by

57:24.160 --> 57:28.080
basically looking at the assembly space, these molecules create. Without any knowledge of

57:28.080 --> 57:33.360
assembly theory, you are unable to do it. With a knowledge of assembly theory, you can

57:33.360 --> 57:38.640
reconstruct the tree. How does knowing if they're the same or different give you the tree?

57:38.640 --> 57:44.640
Let's go to two leaves on different branches on the tree. What you can do by counting the

57:44.640 --> 57:50.160
number of differences, you can estimate how far away their origin was. And that's all we do.

57:50.160 --> 57:54.720
And it just works. But when we realized you could even use assembly theory to recapitulate the tree

57:54.720 --> 58:00.400
of life with no gene sequencing, we were like, huh. So this is looking at samples that exist today

58:00.400 --> 58:06.960
in the world. What about like things that are no longer exist? I mean, the tree contains information

58:06.960 --> 58:14.240
about the past. Some of it is gone. Yeah, absolutely. I would love to get old fossil

58:14.240 --> 58:20.480
samples and apply assembly theory mass spec and see if we can find new forms of life that are

58:20.480 --> 58:26.240
no longer amenable to gene sequencing because the DNA is all gone. Because DNA and RNA is quite

58:26.240 --> 58:30.960
unstable. But some of them are complex molecules might be there. I might give you a hint something

58:30.960 --> 58:37.920
new. Or wouldn't it be great if you find a sample that's worth really persevering and doing

58:40.080 --> 58:46.320
the proper extraction to PCR and so on and then sequence it and then put it together.

58:46.320 --> 58:50.720
So when a thing dies, you can still get some information about its complexity.

58:50.720 --> 58:59.520
Yeah, and it appears that you can do some dating. Now, there are really good techniques. There's

58:59.520 --> 59:04.960
radiocarbon dating, there is longer dating, going looking at radioactive minerals and so on.

59:04.960 --> 59:13.920
And you can also in bone, you can look at what happens after something dies. You get what's

59:13.920 --> 59:20.720
called racemization, where the chirality in the polymers basically changes and you get

59:20.720 --> 59:30.320
decomposition. And the deviation from the pure enantiomer to the mixture,

59:31.920 --> 59:37.920
gives you a time scale on it, a half-life. So you can date when it died. I want to use assembly

59:37.920 --> 59:43.680
theory to see if I can use it and date death and things and trace the tree of life and also

59:43.680 --> 59:48.640
decomposition of molecules. Do you think it's possible? Oh yeah, without a doubt. It may not

59:48.640 --> 59:52.720
be better than what, because I was just at a conference where some brilliant people were

59:52.720 --> 59:58.560
looking at isotope enrichment and looking at how life enriches isotopes and they're really

59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.720
sophisticated stuff that they're doing. But I think there's some fun to be had there because

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:10.000
it gives you another dimension of dating. How old is this molecule in terms of, or more

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.800
importantly, how long ago was this molecule produced by life? The more complex the molecule,

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:20.400
the more prospect for decomposition, oxidation, reorganization, loss of chirality and all that

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:27.760
jazz. But what life also does is it enriches, as you get older, the amount of carbon-13 in you goes

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:37.280
up because of the way the bonding is in carbon-13. So it has a slightly different bond strength than

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.280
you. It's called a kinetic isotope effect. So you can literally date how old you are

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.040
or when you stopped metabolizing. So you could date someone's death, how old they are, I think.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:52.240
I'm making this up. This might be right. But I think it's roughly right. The amount of carbon-13

01:00:52.240 --> 01:01:00.720
you have in you, you can estimate how old you are. How old humans are? Yeah. You could say,

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:04.720
oh, this person is 10 years old and this person is 30 years old because they've been metabolizing

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:09.440
more carbon and they've accumulated it. That's the basic idea. It's probably completely wrong

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:15.200
time scale. Signatures of chemistry are fascinating. So you've been saying a lot of chemistry

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:22.080
examples for assembly theory. What if we zoom out and look at a bigger scale of an object?

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:32.160
Mm-hmm. Like really complex objects like humans or living organisms that are made up of millions

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:38.880
or billions of other organisms. How do you try to apply assembly theory to that? At the moment,

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:46.240
we should be able to do this to morphology in cells. So we're looking at cell surfaces

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:52.800
and really trying to extend further. It's just that we work so hard to get this paper

01:01:53.680 --> 01:02:01.520
out and people to start discussing the ideas. But it's kind of funny because I think the penny

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:06.000
is falling on this. What does that even mean? What does it mean for a penny to be-

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.240
I mean, the penny's dropped, right? Because a lot of people are like, it's rubbish. It's rubbish.

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:15.840
You've insulted me. It's wrong. I mean, the paper got published on the 4th of October.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:21.920
It had 2.3 million engagements on Twitter, right? And it's been downloaded over a few hundred

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:26.080
thousand times. And someone actually said to me, wrote to me and said, this is an example of really

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:31.760
bad writing and what not to do. And I was like, if all of my papers got read this much, because

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.440
that's the objective. If I have a publishing a paper and people to read it, I want to write

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.160
that badly again. Yeah. I don't know what's the deep insight here about the negativity in the

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:45.200
space. I think it's probably the immune system of the scientific community, making sure that

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:50.400
there's no bullshit that gets published. And then it can overfire, it can do a lot of damage. It

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.880
can shut down conversations in a way that's not productive. I'll go back. I mean, I'll answer

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:59.440
your question about the hierarchy and assembly, but let's go back to the reception. People saying

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:03.520
the paper was badly written. I mean, of course we could improve it. We could always improve for

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:10.560
clarity. Let's go there before we go to the hierarchy. It has been criticized quite a bit,

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:16.240
the paper. What has been some criticism that you found most powerful,

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:26.640
like that you can understand? And can you explain it? Yes. The most exciting criticism

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:32.720
came from the evolutionary biologists telling me that they thought that origin of life was

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.720
a solved problem. And I was like, whoa, we're really onto something because it's clearly not.

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.960
And when you poke them on that, they just said, no, you don't understand evolution. And I said,

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:46.160
no, no, I don't think you understand that evolution had to occur before biology. And there's a gap.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:53.280
That was really, for me, that misunderstanding. And that did cause an immune response,

01:03:53.280 --> 01:04:00.240
which was really interesting. The second thing was the fact that physicists were actually really

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:04.640
polite, right? Really nice about it. But they just said, huh, we're not really sure about the

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:09.840
initial conditions thing. But this is a really big debate that we should certainly get into

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:15.520
because the emergence of life was not encoded in the initial conditions of the universe.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:21.120
And I think assembly theory shows why it can't be.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:31.600
Okay, sure. If you could say that again. The emergence of life was not and cannot,

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:35.360
in principle, be encoded in the initial conditions of the universe.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:39.600
Just to clarify what I mean by life is like, what, high assembly index objects?

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.960
Yeah. And this goes back to your favorite subject.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:43.600
What's that?

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:43.920
Time.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.240
Right. So why? What does time have to do with it?

01:04:51.360 --> 01:05:00.400
Probably we can come back to it later, but I think it might be if we have time. But I think I now

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:07.600
understand how to explain how, you know, lots of people got angry with the assembly paper,

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:12.640
but also the ramifications of this is how time is fundamental in the universe

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:19.040
and this notion of commentarial spaces. And there are so many layers on this, but

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.280
you have to become an, I think you have to become an intuitionist mathematician and you have to

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:30.720
abandon platonic mathematics. And also platonic mathematics has left physics astray,

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:34.640
but there's a lot to unpack there. So we can go to the-

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:39.680
Atomic mathematics. Okay. It's okay. The evolutionary biologists criticized because

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:51.120
the origin of life is understood and doesn't require an explanation that involves physics.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:51.600
Yeah.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:52.800
That's their statement.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:58.320
Well, I mean, I think they said lots of confusing statements. Basically, I realized

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:02.480
the evolutionary biology community that were vocal and some of them were really rude,

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:07.040
really spiteful and needlessly so, right? Because look, you know,

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:15.360
I didn't- people misunderstand publication as well. Some of the peoples have said,

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:19.840
how dare this be published in nature? This is, you know, what a terrible journal.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:30.160
And I said to the people, look, this is a brand new idea that's not only potentially going to

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:35.920
change the way we look at biology, it's going to change the way we look at the universe.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.880
And everyone's like saying, how dare you? How dare you be so grandiose? I'm like, no, no, no,

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:47.120
this is not hype. We're not like saying we've invented some, I don't know, we've discovered

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:53.600
alien in a closet somewhere just for hype. We genuinely mean this to genuinely have the impact

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:59.520
or ask the question. And the way people jumped on that was a really bad precedent for young people

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:06.240
who want to actually do something new, because this makes a bold claim. And the chances are

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:13.040
that it's not correct. But what I wanted to do is a couple of things. I want to make a bold claim

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:20.800
that was precise and testable and correctable, not a woolly another woolly information in biology

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:26.000
argument information, Turing machine, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, a concrete series of statements

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.400
that can be falsified and explored. And either the theory could be destroyed or built upon.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:38.400
Well, what about the criticism of you're just putting a bunch of sexy names on something

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:48.480
that's already obvious? Yeah, that's really good. So the assembly index of a molecule is not

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:53.360
obvious, no one had measured it before. And no one has thought to quantify selection,

01:07:54.320 --> 01:08:02.800
complexity and copy number before in such a primitive quantifiable way. I think the nice

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:08.240
thing about this paper, this paper is, is a tribute to all we're not to all the people

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:14.320
that understand that the biologist does something very interesting. Some people call it mega entropy,

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:19.520
some people call it think about, you know, organizational principles, that lots of people

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.720
were not shocked by the paper, because they've done it before a lot of the lot of the arguments

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:29.040
we got, some people said, Oh, it's rubbish. Oh, by the way, I had this idea 20 years before,

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:36.480
I was like, which one is the rubbish part or the really revolutionary part. So this kind of

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:41.280
plucked two strings at once it plucked the there is something interesting, the biology is as we

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:46.400
can see around this, but we haven't quantified yet. And what this is the first stab at quantifying

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:56.960
that. So the, the, the, the fact that people said, this is obvious, but it's also so if it's obvious,

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:02.560
why have you not done it? Sure. But there's, there's a few things to say there. One is,

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:10.240
you know, this is in part of a lot of philosophical framework, because, you know,

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:15.360
it's not like you can apply this generally to any object in the universe. It's very chemistry

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:19.440
focused. Yeah, well, I think you will be able to, we just haven't got there robustly. So

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:24.240
we can say, how can we, let's go up a level. So we go up from level, we go up, let's go up

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:28.880
from molecules to cells, because you jump to people. And I jumped to emoticons and both are

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:37.040
good. And they will be assembled. So we go from, if we go from, so if we go from molecules to

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:42.160
assemblies, and let's take a cellular assembly. A nice thing about a cell is you can tell the

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:47.120
difference between a eukaryote and a prokaryote, right? The organelles are specialized differently.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:51.840
When they look at the cell surface, and the cell surface has different glycosylation patterns,

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.600
and these cells will stick together. Now let's go up a level with multicellular creatures,

01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:00.080
you have cellular differentiation. Now if you think about how embryos develop, you go all the

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:06.560
way back, those cells undergo differentiation in a causal way that's biomechanically a feedback

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:12.000
between the genetics and biomechanics. I think we can use assembly theory to apply to tissue types.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.560
We can even apply it to different cell disease types. So that's what we're doing next. But we're

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:21.280
trying to walk, you know, the thing is, I'm trying to leap ahead, I want to leap ahead to go,

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:27.120
whoa, we apply it to culture. Clearly you can apply it to memes and culture. And we've also

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:34.960
applied assembly theory to CAs. And not as you think. Cellular automata, by the way.

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:39.440
Yeah, yeah, to cellular automata. Not just as you think. Different CA rules were invented by

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:46.080
different people at different times. And one of my co-workers, very talented chap,

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:50.080
basically, was like, oh, I can realize that different people had different ideas or different

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:55.840
rules, and they copied each other and made slightly different cellular automata rules

01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:01.200
and looked at them online. And so he was able to infer assembly index and copy number of

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:08.000
rule whatever doing this thing. But I digress. But it does show you can apply it at a higher scale.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.200
So what do we need to do to apply assembly theory to things? We need to agree there's a common set

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:18.560
of building blocks. So in a cell, well, in a multi-cellular creature, you need to look back

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:25.520
in time. So there is the initial cell, which the creature is fertilized and then starts to grow.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:30.080
And then there is cell differentiation, and you have to then make that causal chain both on those.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:38.080
So that requires development of the organism in time. Or if you look at the cell surfaces and the

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:45.920
cell types, they've got different features on the cell, what's the walls and inside the cell.

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:52.240
So we're building up. But obviously, I want a leap to things like emoticons, language,

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:59.120
mathematical theory. But that's a very large number of steps to get from a molecule to

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:06.000
the human brain. Yeah. And I think they are related, but in hierarchies of emergence,

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.200
you shouldn't compare them. I mean, the assembly index of a human brain, what does that even mean?

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:15.840
Well, maybe we can look at the morphology of the human brain, say all human brains have these

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:21.760
number of features in common. If they have those numbers, and then let's look at a brain in a whale

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:27.600
or a dolphin or a chimpanzee or a bird and say, okay, let's look at the assembly indices,

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:32.000
number of features in these. And now the copy number is just a number of how many birds are

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.240
there? How many chimpanzees are there? How many humans are there? Then you have to discover for

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:42.080
that, the features that you would be looking for. Yeah. And that means you need to have some idea

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:48.640
of the anatomy. Is there an automated way to discover features? I guess so. I mean, and I

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:54.320
think this is a good way to apply machine learning and image recognition, just to basically

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:58.640
characterize things. Apply compression to it to see what emerges and then use the thing,

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:06.800
the features used as part of the compression as the measurement of, as the thing that is searched

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:11.200
for when you're measuring assembly index and copy number. And the compression has to be,

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.680
remember the assembly universe, which is you have to go from assembly possible to assembly

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:20.400
contingent. And that jump from, because assembly possible, all possible brains, all possible

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:26.800
features all the time. But we know that on the tree of life and also on the lineage of life,

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:31.040
going back to Luca, the human brain just didn't spring into existence yesterday.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.920
It is a long lineage of brains going all the way back. And so if we could do assembly theory to

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:42.560
understand the development, not just in evolutionary history, but in biological development, as you

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:48.560
grow, we are going to learn something more. What would be amazing is if you can use assembly

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:57.840
theory, this framework to show the increase in the assembly index associated with, I don't know,

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:07.120
cultures or pieces of text, like language or images and so on, and illustrate without knowing

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:10.960
the data ahead of time, just kind of like you do with NASA, that you're able to demonstrate

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:15.760
that it applies in those other contexts. I mean, and that probably wouldn't at first,

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.320
and you have to evolve the theory somehow, you have to change it, you have to expand it.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:22.240
I think so.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:30.880
But like that, I guess this is as a paper, a first step in saying, okay, can we create a general

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:38.080
framework for measuring complexity of objects, for measuring life, the complexity of living

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:43.840
organisms? That's what this is reaching for. That is the first step. And also to say, look,

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:51.600
we have a way of quantifying selection and evolution in a fairly, not mundane, but a

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:59.360
fairly mechanical way. Because before now, the ground truth for it was very subjective.

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:03.600
Whereas here, we're talking about clean observables. And there's going to be layers

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:08.640
on that. I mean, with collaborators right now, we already think we can do assembly theory on

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:16.800
language. And not only that, wouldn't it be great if we can figure out how under pressure

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.880
language is going to evolve and be more efficient, because you're going to want to transmit things.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:26.160
And again, it's not just about compression. It is about understanding how you can make

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:31.520
the most of the architecture you've already built. And I think this is something beautiful

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:36.000
that evolution does. We're reusing those architectures. We can't just abandon our

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.280
evolutionary history. And if you don't want to abandon your evolutionary history, and you know

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:46.240
that evolution has been happening, then assembly theory works. And I think that's a key comment I

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:51.120
want to make is that assembly theory is great for understanding where evolution has been used.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:57.440
The next jump is when we go to technology. Because of course, if you take the M3 processor,

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:02.240
I want to buy it. I haven't bought one yet. I can't justify it, but I want it at some point.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:06.880
The M3 processor, arguably, there's quite a lot of features, a quite large number.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.960
The M2 came before it, then the M1 all the way back. You can apply assembly theory to

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:15.360
microprocessor architecture. It doesn't take a huge leap to see that.

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:18.400
I'm a Linux guy, by the way, so your examples go way over my head.

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.360
Yeah, well, whatever.

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:22.560
Is that like a fruit company or some sort? I don't even know.

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.040
Yeah, there's a lot of interesting stuff to ask about language. Like you could look at,

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:34.000
how would that work? You could look at GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, 3, 5, 4,

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:39.360
and try to analyze the kind of language it produces.

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:44.320
That's almost trying to look at assembly index of intelligent systems.

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:52.240
Yeah, I think the thing about large language models, and this is a whole hobby horse I have

01:16:52.240 --> 01:17:03.040
at the moment, is that obviously they're all about the evidence of evolution in the

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.400
large language model comes from all the people that produced all the language.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:13.760
And that's really interesting, and all the corrections in the mechanical Turk.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.920
That's part of the history, part of the memory of the system.

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:27.680
Exactly. So it would be really interesting to basically use an assembly-based approach to

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:36.240
making language in a hierarchy. My guess is that we might be able to build a new type of

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:44.560
large language model that uses assembly theory, that it has more understanding of the past and

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:49.920
how things were created. Basically, the thing with LLMs is they're like everything, everywhere,

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:55.280
all at once, splat, and make the user happy. So there's not much intelligence in the model.

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:59.520
The model is how the human interacts with the model, but wouldn't it be great if we could

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:04.640
understand how to embed more intelligence in the system? What do you mean by intelligence there?

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:13.600
Like you seem to associate intelligence with history. Yeah, well, I think selection produces

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:20.640
intelligence. You're almost implying that selection is intelligence. No.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:24.720
Yeah, kind of. I would go out and live and say that, but I think it's a little bit more. Human

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:30.240
beings have the ability to abstract, and they can break beyond selection. And this is like Darwinian

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:36.080
selection, because the human being doesn't have to basically do trial and error. They can think

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:39.440
about it and say, oh, that's a bad idea. We can do that, and then technologies and so on.

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:44.480
We escaped Darwinian evolution, and now we're onto some other kind of evolution, I guess,

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:49.760
higher level evolution. And assembly theory will measure that as well, right? Because it's all a

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:57.920
lineage. Okay, another piece of criticism, or by way of question, is how is assembly theory,

01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:02.320
or maybe assembly index, different from comagraph complexity? So for people who don't know,

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:08.320
comagraph complexity of an object is the length of a shortest computer program that produces the

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:15.040
object as output. Yeah, I seem to, there seems to be a disconnect between

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:23.120
the computational process. So yeah, so comagraph measure requires a Turing machine,

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:33.840
requires a computer. And that's one thing. And the other thing is, assembly theory is supposed to

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:41.600
trace the process by which life evolution emerged, right? There's a main thing there.

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:49.040
There are lots of other layers. So comagraph complexity, you can approximate comagraph

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:56.960
complexity, but it's not really telling you very much about the actual, it's really telling you

01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:03.200
about like your data set compression of your data set. And so that doesn't really help you

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:09.760
identify the turtle, in this case, is the computer. And so what assembly theory does is,

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:17.600
I'm going to say, trigger warning for anyone listening who loves complexity theory,

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:23.120
I think that we're going to show that AIT is a very important subset of assembly theory,

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:28.880
because here's what happens. I think that assembly theory allows us to build,

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:35.120
go understand when we're selections occurring. Selection produces factories and things.

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:40.160
Factories in the end produce computers and you can go, then algorithmic information theory comes

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:46.000
out of that. The frustration I've had with, with looking at life through this kind of information

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:52.800
theory is it doesn't take into account causation. So the main difference between assembly theory

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:57.600
assembly theory and all these complexity measures is there's no causal chain.

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.320
Yeah. And I think that's the main...

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:06.160
As the causal chain is at the core of assembly theory.

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:10.400
Exactly. And if you've got all your data in a computer memory, all the data is the same,

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:16.000
you can access it in the same way. You don't care, you just compress it and you either look

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:24.320
at the program runtime or the shortest program. And that for me, it is absolutely

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:28.080
not capturing what it is, what its selection does.

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:32.720
But assembly theory looks at objects. It doesn't have information about

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:42.160
the object history. It's going to try to infer that history by looking for the shortest history.

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:49.840
The object doesn't have a Wikipedia page that goes with it about its history.

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:54.640
I would say it does in a way. And it is fascinating to look at. So you've just got the objects

01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:58.880
and you have no other information about the object. What assembly theory allows you to do

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:05.120
with just with the object is to... And the word infer is correct. I agree with infer.

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:09.760
So you like say, well, that's not the history, but something really interesting comes from this.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:16.640
The shortest path is inferred from the object. That is the worst case scenario if you have no

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:22.160
machine to make it. So that tells you about the depth of that object in time.

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:28.480
And so what assembly theory allows you to do is without considering any other circumstances

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:34.400
to say from this object, how deep is this object in time if we just treat the object as itself

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:41.120
without any other constraints. And that's super powerful because the shortest path then allows

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:47.040
you to say, oh, this object wasn't just created randomly, there was a process. And so assembly

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:56.480
theory is not meant to one up AIT or to ignore the factory. It's just to say, hey, there was a

01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:03.040
factory. How big was that factory and how deep in time is it? But it's still computationally

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:09.920
very difficult to compute that history for complex objects.

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:16.640
It is. It becomes harder. But one of the things that's super nice is that it constrains your

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:22.400
initial conditions. It constrains where you're going to be. So if you take, say, imagine...

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:26.720
So one of the things we're doing right now is applying assembly theory to drug discovery.

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:31.920
Now, what everyone's doing right now is taking all the proteins and looking at the proteins and

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:38.240
looking at molecules docked with proteins. Why not instead look at the molecules that are involved

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:43.840
interacting with the receptors over time, rather than thinking about and use the molecules evolved

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:49.680
over time as a proxy for how the proteins evolved over time, and then use that to constrain your

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:56.400
drug discovery process. You flip the problem 180 and focus on the molecule evolution rather

01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:02.960
than the protein. And so you can guess in the future what might happen. So rather than having

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:07.920
to consider all possible molecules, you know where to focus. And that's the same thing if you're

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:13.760
looking at in assembly spaces for an object where you don't know the entire history, but you know

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:18.960
that in the history of this object, it's not going to have some other motif there that

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:24.400
doesn't appear in the past. But just even for the drug discovery point you made,

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:31.680
don't you have to simulate all of chemistry to figure out how to come up with constraints?

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:32.640
No.

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:33.440
In the molecules?

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:34.240
No.

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:36.320
I don't know enough about proteins.

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:40.960
Well, this is another thing that I think causes, because this paper goes across so

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:47.760
many boundaries. So chemists have looked at this and said, this is not correct reaction.

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:48.960
It's like, no, it's a graph.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:58.320
Sure. There's assembly index and shortest path examples here on chemistry.

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:03.280
Yeah. And so what you do is you look at the minimal constraints on that graph.

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:09.280
Of course it has some mapping to the synthesis, but actually you don't have to know all of

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:16.800
chemistry. You can build up the constraint space rather nicely. But this is just at the beginning,

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:20.560
right? There are so many directions this could go in. And as I said, it could all be wrong,

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.160
but hopefully it's less wrong.

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:29.680
What about the little criticism I saw of do you, by way of question, do you consider the

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:34.800
different probabilities of each reaction in the chain? So like that there could be different,

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:40.560
when you look at a chain of events that led up to the creation of an object,

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.160
doesn't it matter that some parts in the chain are less likely than others?

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.400
No, it doesn't matter.

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:55.120
No, no. Well, let's go back. So no, not less likely, but react. So no. So let's go back to

01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:00.240
what we're looking at. So the assembly index is the minimal path that could have created that

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:05.840
object probabilistically. So imagine you have all your atoms in a plasma, you've got enough energy,

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:10.880
you've got enough collisions. What is the quickest way you could zip out that molecule

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:12.560
with no reaction constraints?

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.560
How do you define quickest there then?

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:19.680
It's just basically what walk on a random graph. So we make an assumption that basically

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:23.520
the time scale for forming the bonds. So no, I don't want to say that because it's going to

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:26.880
have people getting obsessing about this point and your criticism is really good one.

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:31.600
What we're trying to say is like, this puts a lower bound on something. Of course,

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:38.400
some reactions are less possible than others, but actually, I don't think chemical reactions exist.

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:43.520
Oh, boy. What does that mean? Why don't chemical reactions exist?

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:48.720
I'm writing a paper right now that I keep being told I have to finish, and it's called

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:54.880
The Origin of Chemical Reactions. And it merely says that reactivity exists as controlled by the

01:26:54.880 --> 01:27:01.360
laws of quantum mechanics. And chemists put names on reactions. So you could have like,

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:07.200
I don't know, the Wittich reaction, which is by Wittich. You could have the Suzuki reaction,

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:12.640
which is by Suzuki. Now, what are these reactions? So these reactions are constrained by the

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:18.000
following. They're constrained by the fact they're on planet Earth, 1G, 298 Kelvin,

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:24.800
one bar. So these are constraints. They're also constrained by the chemical composition of Earth,

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:30.800
oxygen, availability, all this stuff. And that then allows us to focus in our chemistry.

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:36.720
So when a chemist does a reaction, that's a really nice compressed shorthand for constraint

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:41.920
application. Glass flask, pure reagent, temperature, pressure, bomb, bomb, bomb,

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:50.400
bomb, bomb, control, control, control, control. So of course, we have bond energies. So the bond

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:57.120
energies are kind of intrinsic in a vacuum. So the bond energy, you have to have a bond. And so

01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:01.920
for assembly theory to work, you have to have a bond, which means that bond has to give the

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:07.680
molecule certain half-life. So you're probably going to find later on that some bonds are weaker

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:12.880
and that you are going to miss in mass spectra. When you count, look at the assembly of some

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:17.920
molecules, you're going to miscount the assembly of the molecule because it falls apart too quickly

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:22.720
because the bonds just form. But you can solve that with looking at infrared. So when people

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:28.320
think about the probability, they're kind of misunderstanding. Assembly theory says nothing

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:33.840
about the chemistry because chemistry is chemistry and the constraints are put in by biology.

01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:38.880
There was no chemist in the origin of life, unless you believe in the chemist in the sky,

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:44.880
and they were, you know, it's like Santa Claus, they had a lot of work to do. But chemical reactions

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:52.560
do not exist in the constraints that allow chemical transformations to occur do exist.

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:57.920
Okay, so it's constraint application. So there's no chemical reactions. It's all constraint

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:10.240
application, which enables the emergence of what's a different word for chemical reaction?

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:10.880
Transformation.

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:11.600
Transformation.

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:16.000
Yeah, like a function. It's a function. But no, but I love chemical reactions in the shorthand.

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:20.720
And so the chemists don't all go mad. I mean, of course, chemical reactions exist on Earth.

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:21.280
It's a shorthand.

01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:23.280
It's a shorthand for all these constraints.

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:27.680
For right. So assuming all these constraints that we've been using for so long, we just assume

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:30.640
that that's always the case in natural language conversation.

01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:37.120
Exactly. The grammar of chemistry, of course, emerges in reactions, and we can use them reliably.

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:40.160
But I do not think the Wittek reaction is accessible on Venus.

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:46.880
Right. And this is useful to remember, you know, to frame it as constraint application is useful

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:51.280
for when you zoom out to the bigger picture of the universe and looking at the chemistry

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:55.040
of the universe and then starting to apply assembly theory. That's interesting.

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:56.080
That's really interesting.

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:00.960
But we've also pissed off the chemists now.

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:04.160
They're pretty happy, but well, most of them.

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:08.800
Everybody, everybody deep down is happy, I think.

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:13.520
They're just sometimes feisty. That's how they show. That's how they have fun.

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:17.120
Everyone is grumpy on some days when you challenge. The problem with this paper is

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:22.080
it's almost like I went to a party. It's like I used to do this occasionally when I was young.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:27.760
Go to a meeting and just find a way to offend everyone at the meeting simultaneously.

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:32.080
Even the factions that don't like each other, they're all unified in their hatred of you just

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:36.480
offending them. This paper, it feels like the person that went to the party and offended

01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:39.920
everyone simultaneously. So stop fighting with themselves and just focused on this paper.

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:46.080
Maybe just a little insider, interesting information. What were the editors of

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:52.960
nature? What the reviews and so on, how difficult was that process? This is a pretty big paper.

01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:02.320
When we originally sent the paper, we sent the paper and the editor said,

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.600
this is quite a long process. We sent the paper and the editor gave us some feedback.

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:20.640
Said, I don't think it's that interesting. It's hard. It's a hard concept. The editor gave us

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:28.000
some feedback. Sarah and I took a year to rewrite the paper. Was the nature of the feedback very

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:34.160
specific on this part, this part, or was it like, what are you guys smoking? Yeah, it was kind of

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:41.200
the latter. What are you smoking? Polite and there's promise.

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:47.200
Yeah. Well, the thing is the editor was really critical, but in a really professional way.

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:52.720
I mean, for me, this was the way science should happen. So when it came back, we had too many

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:55.680
equations in the paper. If you look at the preprint, they're just equations everywhere,

01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:59.760
like 23 equations. When I said to Abhishek, who was the first author, we've got to remove

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:05.040
all the equations, but my assembly equations thing, Abhishek was like, no, we can't. I said,

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:10.400
well, look, if we want to explain this to people, it's a real challenge. And so Sarah and I went

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:15.200
through the, I think it was actually 160 versions of the paper, but we basically, we got to version

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:20.080
40 or something. We said, right, zero, let's start again. So we wrote the whole paper again.

01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:22.240
We knew the entire- Amazing.

01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:27.120
And we just went bit by bit by bit and said, what is it we want to say? And then we sent the paper

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:35.600
in. And to us, we expected it to be rejected and not even go to review. And then we got notification

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:39.680
back, it had gone to review and we were like, oh my God, it's so going to get rejected. How's

01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:43.680
it going to get rejected? Because the first assembly paper that on the mass spec we sent to

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:51.040
nature got, went through six rounds of review and rejected, right? And this biochemist just said,

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:56.000
I don't believe you, you must be committing fraud. Long story, probably a boring story.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.640
But in this case, it went out to review, the comments came back and the comments were

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:10.400
incredibly, there were very deep comments from all the reviewers.

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:22.880
But the nice thing was the reviewers were kind of very critical, but not dismissive. They were

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:27.040
like, oh, really? Explain this, explain this, explain this, explain this. Are you sure it's

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:32.000
not common goller off? Are you sure it's not this? And we went through, I think, three rounds of

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:40.560
review pretty quick. And the editor went, yeah, it's in. Maybe you could just comment on the whole

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:46.160
process. You've published some pretty huge papers on all kinds of topics within chemistry and beyond.

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:52.800
Some of them have some little spice in them, a little spice of crazy. Like Tom Way says,

01:33:52.800 --> 01:34:01.760
I like my tongue with a little drop of poison. It's not a mundane paper. So what's it like

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:06.960
psychologically to go through all this process to keep getting rejected, to get reviews from

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:13.520
people that don't get the paper or all that kind of stuff? Just from a question of a scientist,

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:24.000
what is that like? I mean, this paper for me, because this wasn't the first time we tried to

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.280
publish assembly theory at the highest level. The Nature Communications paper on the mass spec,

01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:35.680
on the idea, went to Nature and got rejected, went through six rounds of review and got rejected.

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:46.640
And I just was so confused when the chemist said, this can't be possible. I do not believe

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:55.680
you can measure complexity using mass spec. And also, by the way, complex molecules can randomly

01:34:55.680 --> 01:35:00.160
form. And we're like, but look at the data. The data says, and they said, no, no, we don't believe

01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:08.880
you. And I just wouldn't give up. And the edit in the end was just like the different editors,

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:13.520
actually. Right. What's behind that never giving up? When you're sitting there,

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:18.720
10 o'clock in the evening, there's a melancholy feeling that comes over you.

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:25.120
You're like, okay, this is rejection number five. Or it's not rejection, but maybe it feels like a

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:30.640
rejection because the comments are that you totally don't get it. What gives you strength

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:42.160
to keep going there? I don't know. I don't normally get emotional about papers, but

01:35:55.600 --> 01:36:00.320
it's not about giving up because we want to get it published because we want the glory or anything.

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:16.480
It's just like, why don't you understand? So what I would just try to be as rational as possible and

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:31.360
say, yeah, you didn't like it. Tell me why. And then, sorry, silly. Never get emotional about

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:38.000
papers normally. But I think what we do is you just compress like five years of angst from this.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.200
So it's been rough.

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:43.680
It's not just rough. It's like it happened. I came up with the assembly equation

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:52.640
you know, remote from Sarah in Arizona and the people SFI. I felt like I was a mad person,

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:57.360
like, you know, the guy in depicted in a beautiful mind. It was just like,

01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:04.720
not the actual genius part, but just the crazy part. Because I kept writing expanded

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:09.360
and I have no mathematical ability at all. And I was making these mathematical expansions where

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:13.920
I kept seeing the same motif again. I was like, oh, I think this is a copy number,

01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:17.280
the same string is going again and again and again. I kept, I couldn't do the math.

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:21.280
And then I realized the copy number fell out of the equation and everything collapsed down.

01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:25.760
I was like, oh, that works kind of. So we submitted the paper and then when it was

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:32.160
almost accepted, right, the mass spec one, and it was astrobiologists are great, you know,

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:36.960
mass spectroscopists are great. And the chemist went nonsense, like biggest part of nonsense ever

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:42.880
fraud, you know, and I was like, but why fraud? And they just said, just because. And I was like,

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:50.080
well, and so, and I could not convince the editor in this case, the edit was just so pissed off,

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:55.760
because they see it as like a kind of, you know, you're wasting my time. And I would not give up.

01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:01.920
I wrote, I went and dissected, you know, all the parts. And I think, although I mean, I got upset

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:09.760
about it, you know, it was kind of embarrassing actually, but, but I guess, but it was just trying

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:15.440
to understand why they didn't like it. So they were part of me was like really devastated.

01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:20.240
And a part of me was super excited because I'm like, huh, they can't tell me why I'm wrong.

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:26.080
And this kind of goes back to, you know, when I was at school, I was in a kind of learning

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:31.200
difficulties class and I kept going to the teacher and say, you know, you know, how, what do I do today

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:35.360
to prove I'm smart? And they were like, nothing, you can't, I was like, give me a job, you know,

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:41.840
give me something to do, give me a job to do something to do as we, and I kind of felt like

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:46.080
that a bit when I was arguing with the, and not arguing, there was no ad hominem. I wasn't telling

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:50.560
the editor, they were idiots or anything like this, or the reviewers, I kept it strictly like

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:57.440
factual. And all I did is I just kept knocking it down bit by bit by bit by bit by bit. It was

01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:04.400
ultimately rejected and it got published elsewhere. And then the actual experimental data.

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:08.960
So this is kind of, in this paper, the experimental justification was already published.

01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:14.720
So when we did this one, and we went through the versions, and then we sent it in, and in the end,

01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:19.040
it just got accepted. We were like, well, that's kind of cool, right? This is kind of like, you

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:24.080
know, some days you have, you know, the student, sorry, the first author was like,

01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:29.680
I can't believe it got accepted. Like, nor am I, but it's great. It's like, it's good.

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:34.800
And then when the paper was published, I was not expecting the backlash. I was expecting

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:40.400
computational. No, actually, I was just expecting one person had been trolling me for a while about

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:46.720
it, just to carry on trolling, but I didn't expect the backlash. And then I wrote to the

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:50.560
editor and apologized. And the editor was like, what are you apologizing for? It was a great paper.

01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:54.160
Of course it's going to get backlash. You said some controversial stuff,

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:59.760
but it's awesome. And so it's, I think it's a beautiful story of perseverance.

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:06.960
And the backlash is just a negative word for discourse, which I think is beautiful.

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:13.360
I think you, as I said to, you know, when it got accepted and people were saying,

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.520
we're kind of like hacking on it. And I was like,

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:22.960
like papers are not gold medals. The reason I wanted to publish that paper in nature is

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:30.160
because it says, Hey, there's something before biological evolution. You have to have that.

01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:36.160
If you're not a creationist, by the way, this is an approach. First time someone has put a concrete

01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:42.240
mechanism or sorry, a concrete quantification. And what comes next you're pushing on is a mechanism.

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:46.800
And that's what we need to get to is an auto catalytic set, self replicating molecules,

01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:54.720
some other features that come in. And the fact that this paper has been so discussed for me is

01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:00.480
a dream come true. Like it doesn't get better than that. If you can't accept a few people hating it.

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:07.040
And the nice thing is the thing that really makes me happy is that no one has attacked the actual

01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:13.200
physical content. Like you can measure the assembly index, you can measure selection now.

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:20.160
So either that's right or it's well, either that's helpful or unhelpful. If it's unhelpful,

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:24.880
this paper will sink down and no one will use it again. If it's helpful, it'll help people build

01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:31.040
scaffold on it and we'll start to converge to a new paradigm. So I think that that's the thing that

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:37.360
I wanted to see, you know, my colleagues, authors, collaborators, and people were like,

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:41.920
you've just published this paper, you're a chemist. Why have you done this? Like who are you

01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:47.840
to be doing evolutionary theory? Like, well, I don't know. I mean, sorry, did I need to-

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:53.600
Who is anyone to do anything? Well, I'm glad you did. Let me just before coming back to origin of

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:58.880
life and these kinds of questions, you mentioned learning difficulties. I didn't know about this.

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:06.080
So what was it like? I wasn't very good at school, right? This is when you were very young?

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:12.800
Yeah, yeah. But in primary school, my handwriting was really poor and apparently I couldn't read

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:18.480
and my mathematics was very poor. So they just said this is a problem. They identified it.

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:22.400
My parents kind of at the time were confused because I was busy taking things apart,

01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:26.480
buying electronic junk from the shop, trying to build computers and things.

01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:33.520
And then once I got out of, when I was, I think about the major transition in my stupidity,

01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:38.880
like, you know, everyone thought I wasn't that stupid. Basically everyone thought I was faking.

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:43.520
I like stuff and I was faking wanting to be it. So I always want to be a scientist. So five, six,

01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:47.920
seven years old, be a scientist, take things apart. And everyone's like, you know, this guy wants to

01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:54.480
be a scientist, but he's an idiot. And so everyone was really confused, I think, at first, that I

01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:59.520
wasn't smarter than I, you know, was claiming to be. And then I just basically didn't do well in

01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:04.800
any of the tests and I went down and down and down and down. And then, and I was kind of like,

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:11.920
this is really embarrassing. I really like maths and everyone says, I can't do it. I really like

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:15.760
kind of, you know, physics and chemistry and all that and science. And people say, you're not,

01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:21.120
you can't, you can't read and write. And so I found myself in a learning difficulties class

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:25.840
at the end of primary school and the beginning of secondary school in the UK. Secondary school is

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:33.280
like 11, 12 years old. And I remember being put in the, in the remedial class and the remedial

01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:40.320
class was basically full of, well, two types, three types of people. There were people that had

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:48.240
quite violent, right? You know, and there were people who couldn't speak English and there were

01:43:48.240 --> 01:44:03.520
people that really had learning difficulties. So the one thing I can objectively remember

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:16.800
was, I mean, I could read. I like reading. I read a lot. But something in me, I'm a bit of a

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:23.520
rebel. I refused to read what I was told to read. And I found it difficult to read individual words

01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:28.880
in the way they were told. But anyway, I got caught one day teaching someone else to read.

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:38.960
And they said, okay, we don't understand this. I always knew what to be a scientist, but didn't

01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:42.240
really know what that meant. And I realized you had to go to university. And I thought,

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:45.760
I can just go to university. It's like curious people like, no, no, no, you need to have these,

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:49.920
you have to be able to enter these exams to get this grade point average. And the fact is,

01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:56.240
the exams you've been entered into, you're not, you're just going to get C, D or E. You can't

01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:02.640
even get A, B or C, right? These are the UK GCSEs. I was like, oh shit. And I said, can you just put

01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:08.720
me into the high exams? They said, no, no, you're going to fail. There's no chance. So my father

01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:14.000
kind of intervened and said, you know, just let him go in the exams. And they said, he's definitely

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.120
going to fail. It's a waste of time, waste of money. And he said, well, what if we paid?

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:24.400
So they said, well, okay. So you didn't actually have to pay if I failed. So I took the exams and

01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:29.840
passed them. Fortunately, I didn't get the top grades, but I, you know, I got into A levels,

01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:33.920
but then that also kind of limited what I could do at A levels. I wasn't allowed to do A level

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:39.840
maths. What do you mean you weren't allowed to? Because I had such a bad math grade from my GCSE,

01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:44.320
I only had a C, but I, they wouldn't let me go into the ABC for maths because of some kind of

01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:49.760
coursework requirement back then. So the top grade I could have got was a C, so C to E. So I got a C

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:55.200
and they let me do kind of A S level maths, which is this half intermediate and get to go to

01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:59.200
university. But then the, I liked chemistry. I had a good chemistry teacher. So in the end,

01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:03.280
I got to university to do chemistry. So through that kind of process, I think

01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:09.040
for kids in that situation, it's easy to start believing that you're not

01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:16.400
well, how do I put it? That you're stupid and basically give up, that you're just not good

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:23.680
at math. You're not good at school. So this is by way of advice for people, for interesting people,

01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:30.480
for interesting young kids right now experiencing the same thing. Where was the place? What was the

01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:41.360
source of you not giving up there? I have no idea other than I was really, I really like not

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:46.880
understanding stuff. For me, when I not understand something, I didn't understand, I feel like I

01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:53.040
don't understand anything, but now, but back then I was so, I remember when I was like, I don't know,

01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:58.560
I tried to build a laser when I was like eight and I thought, how hard could it be?

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:07.440
And I basically, I was going to build a CO2 laser. I was like, right, I think I need

01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:15.600
some partially coated mirrors and need some carbon dioxide and I need a high voltage.

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:22.000
So I kind of, and I was like, I didn't have a, and I was so stupid, right? I was kind of so embarrassed.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.880
I had to make enough CO2, I actually set a fire and try to filter the flame.

01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:27.920
Oh, nice.

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:35.120
Trap enough CO2 and I was like completely failed and I burnt half the garage down.

01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:39.120
So my parents were not very happy about that, but so that was one thing. I was like,

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:46.560
I really like first principle thinking and so, you know, so I remember being super curious

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:52.640
and being determined to find answers. And so the kind of, when people do give advice about this,

01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:57.120
why ask for advice about this? I don't really have that much advice other than don't give up.

01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:05.760
One of the things I try to do as a chemistry professor in my group is I don't, I hire people

01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:10.800
that I think that, you know, I'm kind of, who am I, if they're persistent enough,

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:17.200
who am I to deny them the chance? Because, you know, people gave me a chance and I was able to

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:23.680
do stuff. Do you believe in yourself essentially? I like, so I love being around smart people and

01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:28.560
I love confusing smart people. And when I'm confusing smart people, you know, not by stealing

01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:33.440
their wallets and hiding it somewhere, but if I can confuse smart people, that is the one piece

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:38.400
of hope that I might be doing something interesting. Wow, that's quite brilliant.

01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:43.520
Like as a gradient to optimize. Yeah. Hang out with smart people and confuse them.

01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:46.960
Yeah. And the more confusing it is, the more there's something there.

01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:51.040
And as long as they're not telling you just a complete idiot and they give you different

01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:56.240
reasons. And I mean, I'm, you know, if everyone, it's like with assembly theory and people said,

01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:00.000
oh, it's wrong. And I was like, why? And they're like, and no one could give me a consistent

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000
reason. They said, oh, because it's to be number four or it's just comma, goller off, or it's just

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:09.920
there, that and the other. So I think the thing that I like to do is, and in academia, it's hard,

01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:17.120
right? Because people are critical. But I mean, you know, the criticism, I mean, although I got

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:21.600
kind of upset about it earlier, which is kind of silly, but not silly, because obviously,

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:27.200
it's hard work being on your own or with a team spatially separated, like during lockdown and

01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:33.920
try to keep everyone on board and, and, and be, and I have some faith that I've always wanted to

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:39.040
have a new idea. And so, you know, I like a new idea and I want to, I don't want to, I want to

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:44.720
nurture it as long as possible. And if someone can give me actionable criticism, that's why

01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:48.080
I think I was trying to say earlier, when I was kind of like stuck for words,

01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:54.480
give me actionable criticism. You know, it's wrong. Okay, why is it wrong? So it doesn't,

01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:59.920
your equation is incorrect for this, or your method is wrong. And then so if it, and so what

01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:05.600
I try and do is get enough criticism from people to then triangulate and go back. And I've been very

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:12.080
fortunate in my life that I've got great colleagues, great collaborators, funders, mentors,

01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:17.840
and people that will take the time to say, you're wrong because, and then what I have to do is

01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:23.600
integrate the wrongness and go, oh, cool, maybe I can fix that. And I think criticism is really

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:28.080
good. People have a go at me because I'm really critical. And like, but I'm not criticizing,

01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:33.440
you know, you as a person, I'm just criticizing the idea and trying to make it better and say,

01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:38.080
well, what about this? And, you know, and sometimes I'm kind of, you know, my filters are

01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:42.240
kind of, you know, truncated in some ways. I'm just like, that's wrong, that's wrong,

01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:45.280
that's wrong. I want to do this. And people are like, oh my God, you just told me,

01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:51.280
you destroyed my life's work. I'm like, relax. No, I'm just like, let's make it better. And I

01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:58.000
think that we don't do that enough because we're, you know, we're either personally critical,

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.840
which isn't helpful, or we don't give any criticism at all because we're too scared.

01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:12.640
Yeah. Yeah. I've seen you be pretty aggressively critical, but it's, every time I've seen it's

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:18.480
the idea, not the person. I'm sure I make mistakes on that. I mean, I, you know, I argue,

01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:24.160
I argue lots with, with lots. I mean, I argue lots with Sarah and she's like kind of shocked.

01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:28.000
I've argued with Yasha in the past and he's like, you're just making Yasha back and you're like,

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:35.680
you're just making that up. I'm like, no, not, not quite, but kind of. You know, I had a big

01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:39.440
argument with Sarah about time. She's like, no, time, time doesn't exist. I'm like, no, no,

01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:46.080
time does exist. And now, and as she realized that her conception of assembly theory and my

01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:51.840
conception of assembly theory was the same thing, necessitated us to abandon the fact that time is

01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:57.520
eternal, to actually really fundamentally question how the universe produces combinatorial

01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:04.560
novelty. So time is fundamental for some theory. I'm just trying to figure out where you and Sarah

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:09.840
converge. So I think assembly theory is fine in this time right now, but I think it helps us

01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:15.840
understand that something interesting is going on. So there's, and I've been really inspired by a

01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:20.320
guy called Nick Gizen. I'm going to butcher his argument, but I love his argument a lot. So I

01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:28.160
hope he forgives me if he hears about it. But basically, if you want free will, time has to be

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:41.120
fundamental. And we can go, and if you want time to be fundamental, you have to give up on platonic

01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:47.760
mathematics. And you have to use intuitions, mathematics, by the, by the way. And again,

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:54.800
I'm going to butcher this. But basically, Hilbert said that, you know, infinite numbers are allowed.

01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:01.120
And I think it was Brouwer said, no, you can't, all numbers are finite. So they're kind of like,

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:06.080
so let's go back a step, because I was like, people are going to say, assembly theory seems

01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:15.040
to explain that large combinatorial space allows you to produce things like life and technology.

01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:20.480
And that large combinatorial space is so big, it's not even accessible to a

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:30.800
Sean Carroll, David Deutsch, multiverse. The physicists saying that all of the universe

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:44.080
already exists in time is probably, provably, strong word, not correct. That we are going to

01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:48.960
know that the universe as it stands, the present, the way the present builds a future,

01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:56.560
so big, the universe can't ever contain the future. And this is a really interesting thing.

01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:00.560
I think Max Tegmark has this mathematical universe, he says, you know, the universe is

01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:05.360
kind of like a block universe. And I apologize to Max, if I'm getting it wrong, but people think

01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:11.680
you can just move, you have the stat, you have the initial conditions. And you can run the universe

01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:16.400
right to the end and go backwards and forwards in that universe. That is not correct.

01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:20.880
Let me load that in. The universe is not big enough to contain the future.

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:22.880
Yeah. That's why that's it.

01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:26.720
That's another, that's a beautiful way of saying that time is fundamental.

01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:33.920
Yes. And that you can have, and that's what, this is why the law of the excluded middle,

01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:36.800
something is true or false, only works in the past.

01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:42.080
Is it going to snow in New York next week or in Austin? You might in Austin say, probably not.

01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:47.280
In New York, you might say, yeah. If you go forward to next week and say, did it snow in New York

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:52.320
last week, true or false? You can answer that question. The fact that the law of the excluded

01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:55.840
middle cannot apply to the future explains why time is fundamental.

01:54:57.200 --> 01:55:01.920
Well, I mean, that's a good example, intuitive example, but it's possible that we might be able

01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:10.080
to predict, you know, whether it's going to snow if we had perfect information.

01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:12.720
You're saying not?

01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:20.240
Impossible. Impossible. So here's why. I'll make a really quick argument. And this argument isn't

01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:26.400
mine. It's Nick's and a few other people. Can you explain his view on fundamental,

01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:31.040
on time being fundamental? Yeah. So I'll give my view, which kind of resonates with his,

01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:37.600
but basically it's very simple, actually. It would say that free will, your ability to design

01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:43.200
and do an experiment is exercising free will. So he used that thought process. I never really

01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:50.560
thought about it that way and that you actively make decisions. I used to think that free will

01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:56.640
was a kind of consequence of just selection, but I'm kind of understanding that human free

01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:01.680
will is something really interesting. And he very much inspired me. But I think that

01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:08.800
Sarah Walker said that inspired me as well, that these will converge is that I think that the

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:17.120
universe in the universe is very big, huge, but actually the own, the place is largest in the

01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:22.480
universe right now. The largest place in the universe is earth. Yeah. I've seen you say that

01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:30.000
and boy does that, that's an interesting process. What do you mean by that? Earth is the biggest

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.160
place in the universe. Because we have this combinatorial scaffolding going all the way

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:40.080
back from Luca. So you've got cells that can self-replicate and then you go all the way to

01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:44.080
terraforming the earth. You've got all these architectures, the amount of selection that's

01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:49.360
going on, biological selection, just to be clear, biological evolution. And then you have

01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:55.520
multicellularity, then animals and abstraction. And when abstraction, there was another kick

01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:01.680
because you can then build architectures and computers and cultures and language. And these

01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:06.160
things are the biggest things exist in the universe because we can just build architectures that

01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:12.480
couldn't naturally arise anywhere. And the further that distance goes in time and this kind of is

01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:18.880
just, it's gigantic. And from a complexity perspective. Yeah. Okay. Wait a minute. But

01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:22.880
I mean, I know you're being poetic, but how do you know there's not other earth like,

01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:30.640
how do you know, you're basically saying earth is really special. It's awesome stuff. As far

01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:37.120
as we look out, there's nothing like it going on, but how do you know there's not nearly infinite

01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:43.200
number of places where cool stuff like this is going on? I agree. And I would say, I'll say again,

01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:50.080
that earth is the most gigantic thing we know in the universe, commentorially, we know. We know.

01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:57.040
Now, I guess this is just purely a guess. I have no data, but other than hope, well, maybe not hope,

01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:06.480
maybe, no, I have some data that every star in the sky probably has planets and life is

01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:12.800
probably emerging on these planets. But the amount of contingency that is associated with life

01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:18.720
is I think the commentorial space associated to these planets is so different. We are never going

01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:23.600
to, our causal cones are never going to overlap or not easily. And this is the thing that makes

01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:28.480
me sad about alien life. Why it's why we have to create alien life in the lab as quickly as

01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:34.800
possible. Because I don't know if we are going to be able to be able to build

01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:42.800
architectures that will intersect with alien intelligence and architectures.

01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:47.760
And intersect, you don't mean in time or space? Time and the ability to communicate.

01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:52.960
The ability to communicate. Yeah. My biggest fear in a way is that life is everywhere,

01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:57.360
but we become infinitely more lonely because of our scaffolding in that commentorial space.

01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:04.800
Because it's so big. So you're saying the constraints created by the environment that led

01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:12.800
to the factory of Darwinian evolution are just like this little tiny cone in a nearly infinite

01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:19.840
commentorial space. Exactly. And so there's other cones like it. And why can't we communicate with

01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:26.560
other, like just because we can't create it doesn't mean we can't appreciate the creation,

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:33.840
right? Sorry, detect the creation. I truly don't know, but it's an excuse for me to ask

01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:37.360
for people to give me money to make a planet simulator. Yeah, right. If I can make...

01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:41.760
With a different kind of thing. Like another shameless say, it's like, give me money.

01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:48.080
This was all a long plug for a planet simulator. It's like, hey, I won't be the first in line to

01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:57.520
donate. My Rick garage has run out of room. This is a planet simulator,

01:59:57.520 --> 02:00:01.600
you mean like a different kind of planet with different sets of environments and pressures.

02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:08.400
Exactly. If we could basically recreate the selection before biology as we know it,

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:12.880
that gives rise to a different biology, we should be able to put the constraints on where I look

02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:18.800
in the universe. So here's the thing. Here's my dream. My dream is that by creating life in the

02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:24.240
lab, based upon constraints we understand, let's go for Venus type life or earth type life or

02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:29.760
something. Again, do earth 2.0, screw it. Let's do earth 2.0. And earth 2.0 has a different genetic

02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:37.120
alphabet. Fine. It's fine. Different protein alphabet. Fine. Have cells and evolution,

02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:41.360
all that stuff. We will then be able to say, okay, life is a more general phenomena.

02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:47.760
Selection is more general than what we think is the chemical constraints on life. And we can point

02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:53.920
to James Webb and other telescopes at other planets that we are in that zone, we are most

02:00:53.920 --> 02:01:02.640
likely to combinatorially overlap with. You're looking for some overlap.

02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:08.240
And then we can then basically shine light on them literally and look at light coming back

02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:14.800
and apply advanced assembly theory to general theory of language that we will get and say,

02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:20.320
huh, we in that signal, it looks random, but there's a copy number. Oh,

02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:28.640
this random set of things that shouldn't be that looks like a true random number generator has

02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:35.920
structure as a not common goller of AIT type structure, but evolutionary structure given by

02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:41.040
assembly theory and we start to, but I would say that because I'm a shameless assembly theorist.

02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:47.600
Yeah. It just feels like the cone that might be misusing the word cone here,

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:54.320
but the width of the cone is growing faster. It's growing really fast to where eventually

02:01:54.320 --> 02:02:00.960
all the cones overlap. Even in a very, very, very large combinatorial space.

02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:08.640
But then again, if you're saying the universe is also growing very quickly in terms of possibilities.

02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:21.040
I hope that as we build abstractions, one idea is that as we go to intelligence,

02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:25.120
intelligence allows us to look at the regularities around us in the universe.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.520
Intelligence allows us to look at the regularities around us in the universe,

02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:36.800
and that gives us some common grounding to discuss with aliens. And you might be right

02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:42.480
we will overlap there, even though we have completely different chemistry,

02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:48.880
literally completely different chemistry, that we will be our past information from one another,

02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:59.680
but it's not a given. And I have to kind of try and divorce hope and emotion away from what

02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:05.680
I can logically justify. But it's just hard to intuit a world, a universe where there's

02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:12.800
nearly infinite complexity objects and they somehow can't detect each other.

02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:16.800
But the universe is expanding, but the nice thing is that I would say I would look,

02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:21.120
you see, I think Carl Sagan did the wrong thing. Well, not the wrong thing. He flicked the Voyager

02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:25.040
probe around in a pale blue dot. He said, look how big the universe is. I would have done it the

02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:28.000
other way around and said, look at the Voyager probe that came from the planet Earth that came

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:32.800
from Luca. Look at how big Earth is. They produced that.

02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:34.240
It produced that. Yeah.

02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:38.960
And that I think is like completely amazing. And then that should allow people on Earth to think

02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:46.320
about, well, probably we should try and get causal chains off Earth onto Mars, onto the Moon,

02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:51.280
wherever. Whether it's human life or Martian life that we create, it doesn't matter.

02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:58.080
But I think this commentorial space tells us something very important about the universe.

02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:04.160
And I realized in assembly theory that the universe is too big to contain itself.

02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:10.640
And I think this is, and now I'm coming back and I want to kind of change your mind about time

02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:14.880
because I'm guessing that your time is just coordinate.

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:15.440
Yeah.

02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:22.160
So I'm going to change your mind in real time or at least attempt.

02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:26.560
Oh, in real time. There you go. I already got the tattoo. So this is going to be embarrassing

02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:30.960
if you change my mind. But you can just add an arrow of time onto it, right?

02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:32.240
Yeah, true. Just modify it.

02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:37.760
Or erase it a bit. And the argument that I think is really most interesting is like,

02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:43.520
people say the initial conditions specify the future of the universe.

02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:48.480
Okay, fine. Let's say that's the case for a moment. Now let's go back to Newtonian mechanics.

02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:54.560
Now, the uncertainty principle in Newtonian mechanics is this.

02:04:55.840 --> 02:04:59.200
If I give you the coordinates of an object moving in space

02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:05.840
and the coordinates of another object and they collide in space and you know those initial

02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:11.680
conditions, you should know exactly what's going to happen. However, you cannot specify

02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:16.560
these coordinates to infinite precision. Now everyone said, you know, oh, this is kind of like,

02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:21.120
you know, the chaos theory argument. No, no, it's deeper than that. Here's a problem with numbers.

02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:24.000
This is how, this is where Hilbert and Brouwer fell out.

02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:30.640
To have the coordinates of this object, a given object, they're colliding,

02:05:30.640 --> 02:05:33.760
you have to have them to infinite precision. That's what Hilbert says.

02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:37.280
This is no problem. Infinite precision is fine. Let's just take that for granted.

02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:45.040
But when the object is finite and it can't store its own coordinates, what do you do?

02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:53.040
So in principle, if a finite object cannot be specified to infinite precision,

02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:57.440
in principle, the initial conditions don't apply.

02:05:58.400 --> 02:05:59.840
Well, how do you know it can't store it?

02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:04.400
Well, how do you store an infinitely long number in a finite size?

02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:11.520
Well, we're using infinity very loosely here.

02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:12.480
No, no, we're using-

02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:14.720
Infinite precision. I mean, not loosely, but-

02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:15.360
Very precisely.

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:17.920
So you think infinite precision is required.

02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:23.760
Well, let's take the object. Let's say the object is a golf ball. Golf ball is a few

02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:28.400
centimeters in diameter. We can work out how many atoms are on the golf ball. And let's say we can

02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:34.720
store numbers down to atomic dislocations. So we can work out how many atoms are on the golf ball

02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:39.040
and we can store the coordinates in that golf ball down to that number. But beyond that,

02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:46.560
we can't. Let's make the golf ball smaller. And this is where I think that we think that we get

02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:49.600
randomness in quantum mechanics. And some people say you can't get randomness quantum

02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:55.120
mechanics deterministic, but this is where we realize that classical mechanics and quantum

02:06:55.120 --> 02:07:01.680
mechanics suffer from the same uncertainty principle. And that is the inability to specify

02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:10.080
the initial conditions to a precise enough degree to give you determinism. The universe

02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:16.720
is intrinsically too big, and that's why time exists. It's non-deterministic. Looking back

02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:23.600
into the past, you can use logical arguments because you can say, was it true or false?

02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:29.200
You really know. But the fact we are unable to predict the future with the precision

02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:36.480
is not evidence of lack of knowledge. It's evidence the universe is generating new things.

02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:42.320
Okay. So to you, first of all, quantum mechanics, you can just say statistically

02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:44.240
what's going to happen when two golf balls hit each other.

02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:49.040
Statistically, but sure, I can say statistically what's going to happen. But then when they do

02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:55.360
happen and then you keep nesting it together, you can't, I mean, it goes almost back to,

02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:04.560
let's think about entropy in the universe. So how do we understand entropy change? Well,

02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:10.320
we could do the process. We can use the Agurdic hypothesis. We can also have

02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:19.760
the counterfactuals where we have all the different states and we can even put that

02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:30.480
in the multiverse. But both of those, they're non-physical. The multiverse collapses back to

02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:38.880
the same problem about the precision. So if you accept you don't have to have true and false going

02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:46.320
forward in the future, the real numbers are real. They're observables.

02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:52.400
We're trying to see exactly where time being fundamental sneaks in. In this difference

02:08:52.400 --> 02:09:00.320
between the golf ball can't contain its own position perfectly precisely,

02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:04.960
how that leads to time needing to be fundamental.

02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:10.240
Let me, do you believe or do you accept you have free will?

02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:17.760
Yeah, I think at this moment in time, I believe that I have free will.

02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:21.200
So then you have to believe that time is fundamental.

02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:25.200
I understand that's a statement you've made.

02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:28.480
Well, no, that we can logically follow because if you don't have free will,

02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:33.520
so like if you're in a universe that has no time, the universe is deterministic.

02:09:34.160 --> 02:09:36.160
If it's deterministic, then you have no free will.

02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:43.920
I think the space of how much we don't know is so vast that saying the universe is deterministic

02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:48.240
and from that jumping there's no free will is just too difficult of a leap.

02:09:48.240 --> 02:09:54.480
No, I logically follow. No, no, I don't disagree. I'm not saying any, I mean it's deep and it's

02:09:54.480 --> 02:10:01.680
important. All I'm saying and it's actually different to what I've said before is that if

02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:09.280
you don't require Platonistic mathematics and accept that non-determinism is how the

02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:14.560
universe looks and that gives us our creativity in the way the universe is getting novelty,

02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:18.400
it's kind of really deeply important in assembly theory because assembly theory

02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:23.600
starts to actually give you a mechanism why you go from boring time, which is basically

02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:27.680
initial condition, specify everything, to a mismatch in creative time.

02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:33.680
I hope we'll do experiments. I think it's really important. I would love to do an experiment that

02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:40.320
prove that time is fundamental and the universe is generating novelty. I don't know all the

02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:46.400
features of that experiment yet, but by having these conversations openly and getting people

02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:53.120
to think about the problems in a new way, better people, more intelligent people with good

02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:57.840
mathematical backgrounds can say, oh, hey, I've got an idea. I would love to do an experiment

02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:04.000
that shows that the universe is too big for itself going forward in time.

02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:11.440
This is why I really hate the idea of the Boltzmann brain. The Boltzmann brain makes me super

02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:16.960
kind of like, everyone's having a free lunch. It's like saying, let's break all the laws of

02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:22.080
physics. So a Boltzmann brain is this idea that in a long enough universe, a brain will just emerge

02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:28.240
in the universe as conscious. And that neglects the causal chain of evolution required to produce

02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:32.960
that brain. And this is where the computational argument really falls down because the computations

02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:37.360
could say, I can calculate the probability of a Boltzmann brain and they'll give you a probability,

02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:41.920
but I can calculate the probability of a Boltzmann brain, zero. Just because the space of

02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:46.800
possibility is so large? Yeah. It's like when we start fooling ourselves with numbers that we

02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:56.400
can't actually measure and we can't ever conceive of. I think it doesn't give us a good explanation

02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:02.000
and I've become, I want to explain why life is in the universe. I think life is actually

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:08.400
the novelty minor. I mean, life basically minds novelty almost from the future and makes it

02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:13.760
actualize in the present. Okay. Life is a novelty minor

02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:20.240
from the future that is actualized in the present. Yep.

02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:31.200
I think so. Novelty minor. First of all, novelty. What's the origin of novelty when you go from

02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:37.680
boring time to creative time? Where is that? Is it as simple as randomness like you're referring to?

02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:44.640
I'm really struggling with randomness because I had a really good argument with Jascha Bach

02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:48.240
about randomness and he said, randomness doesn't give you free will. That's insane because you'd

02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:56.480
just be random. I think he's right at that level, but I don't think he is right on another level

02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:05.680
and it's not about randomness. It's about constrained, I'm making this up as I go along,

02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:11.600
so I'm making this up. Constrained opportunity. So what I mean is like, so you have to have,

02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:18.880
so the novelty, what is novelty? This is why I think it's a funny thing. If you ever want

02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:24.160
to discuss AI, why I think everyone's kind of gone AI mad is that they're misunderstanding

02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:30.720
novelty. But let's think about novelty. What is novelty? So I think novelty is a genuinely

02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:38.720
new configuration that is not predicted by the past and that you discover in the present

02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:45.600
and that is truly different. Now everyone says that some people say that novelty doesn't exist.

02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:51.600
It's always with precedent. I want to do experiments that show that that is not the case

02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:56.480
and it goes back to a question you asked me a few moments ago, which is, where is the factory?

02:13:57.200 --> 02:13:57.840
Yeah.

02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:02.400
Right? Because I think the same mechanism that gives us a factory gives us novelty

02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:08.960
and I think that that is why I'm so deeply hung up on time. I mean, of course I'm wrong,

02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:16.400
but how wrong? And I think that life opens up that commentarial space in a way that

02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:25.920
our current laws of physics as contrived in a deterministic initial condition universe,

02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:30.320
even with the get out of the multiverse, David Deutsch style, which I love by the way,

02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:36.000
but I don't think is correct. But it's really beautiful.

02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:38.240
Multiverse.

02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:45.360
David Deutsch's conception of the multiverse is kind of like given. But I think that the problem

02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:53.520
with wave particle duality and quantum mechanics is not about the multiverse. It's about understanding

02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:58.720
how determined the past is. Well, I don't just think that actually this is a discussion I was

02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:03.280
having with Sarah about that, right? Where she was like, oh, I think we've been debating this

02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:11.840
for a long time now about how do we reconcile novelty, determinism, indeterminism.

02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:17.440
Just to clarify, both you and Sarah think the universe is not deterministic.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:29.040
I won't speak for Sarah, but I think that the universe is deterministic looking back in the

02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:36.640
past, but undetermined going forward in the future. So I'm kind of having my cake and eating it here.

02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:41.680
This is because I fundamentally don't understand randomness, as Yasha told me or other people told

02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:48.160
me. But if I adopt a new view now, which the new view is the universe is just non-deterministic,

02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:53.040
but I'd like to refine that and say the universe appears deterministic going back in the past,

02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:59.680
but it's undetermined going forward in the future. So how can we have a determinist,

02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:05.120
a universe that has deterministically looking rules that's non-determined going in the future?

02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:10.000
It's this breakdown in precision in the initial conditions. And we have to just stop using initial

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:19.840
conditions and start looking at trajectories and how the combinatorial space behaves in expanding

02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:26.320
universe in time and space. And assembly theory helps us quantify the transition to biology.

02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:33.920
Biology appears to be novelty mining because it's making crazy stuff that we are unique to Earth.

02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:38.800
There are objects on Earth that are unique to Earth. They will not be found anywhere else

02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:43.840
because you can do the combinatorial math. What was that statement you made about life

02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:51.360
is novelty mining from the future? What's the little element of time that you're introducing?

02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:54.960
So what I'm kind of meaning is because the future is bigger than the present,

02:16:54.960 --> 02:17:02.240
in a deterministic universe, how do the states go from one to another? I mean, there's a mismatch,

02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:07.440
right? So that must mean that you have a little bit of indeterminism, whether that's randomness

02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:12.240
or something else. I don't understand. I want to do experiments to formulate a theory to refine

02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:19.680
that as we go forward that might help us explain that. And I think that's why I'm so determined to

02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:25.920
try and crack the non-life to life transition, looking at networks and molecules, and that might

02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:30.960
help us think about it, the mechanism. But certainly the future is bigger than the past

02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:34.560
in my conception of the universe and some conception of the universe.

02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:39.600
By the way, that's not obvious, right? That's what was just kind of the future being bigger

02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:46.240
than the past. Well, that's one statement. And the statement that the universe is not big enough to

02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:52.880
contain the future is another statement. That one is a big one. That one's a really big one.

02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:59.600
I think so. But I think it's entirely... Because look, we have the second law. And right now,

02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:04.480
I mean, we don't need the second law if the future's bigger than the past. It follows

02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:11.600
naturally. So why are we retrofitting all these sticking plasters onto our reality

02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:16.480
to hold on to a timeless universe? Yeah, but that's because it's kind of difficult

02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:23.440
to imagine the universe that can't contain the future. But isn't that really exciting?

02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:31.520
It's very exciting, but it's hard. I mean, we're humans on Earth, and we have a very kind of

02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:39.760
four-dimensional conception of the world of 3D plus time. And it's just hard to intuit a world

02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:45.760
where... What does that even mean? A universe that can't contain the future.

02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:53.200
Yeah. It's kind of crazy, but obvious. I mean, I suppose it sounds obvious. Yeah.

02:18:54.160 --> 02:19:00.640
But the nice thing is you can... So the reason why assembly theory turned me onto that was that

02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:06.160
let's just start in the present and look at all the complex molecules and go backwards in time

02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:15.040
and understand how evolutionary processes gave rise to them. It's not at all obvious

02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:21.200
that taxol, which is one of the most complex natural products produced by biology, was going

02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:27.360
to be invented by biology. It's an accident. Taxol is unique to Earth. There's no taxol elsewhere

02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:34.800
in the universe. And taxol was not decided by the initial conditions. It was decided by this

02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:44.000
interplay between the... So the past simply is embedded in the present. It gives some features,

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:49.280
but why the past doesn't map to the future one-to-one is because the universe is too big

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:57.200
to contain itself. That gives space for creativity, novelty, and some things which are unpredictable.

02:19:57.200 --> 02:20:02.720
Well, okay. So given that you're disrespecting the power of the initial conditions,

02:20:02.720 --> 02:20:07.680
let me ask you about... So how do you explain that cellular automata are able to produce such

02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:12.160
incredible complexity given just basic rules and basic initial conditions?

02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:21.280
I think that this falls into the Brouwer-Hilbert trap. So how do you get a cellular automata to

02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:26.960
produce a complexity? You have a computer, you generate a display, and you map the change of that

02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:35.440
in time. There are some CAs repeat functions. It's fascinating to me that for pi, there is a

02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:41.440
formula where you can go to the millionth decimal place of pi and read out the number without having

02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:46.000
to go there. But there are some numbers where you can't do that. You have to just crank through.

02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:53.120
Whether it's Wolframian computational irreducibility or some other thing, it doesn't matter.

02:20:53.680 --> 02:21:02.320
But these CAs, that complexity, is that just complexity or a number that is basically you're

02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:08.800
mining that number in time? Is that just a display screen for that number, that function?

02:21:08.800 --> 02:21:11.920
Well, can't you say the same thing about the complexity on Earth, then?

02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:17.360
No, because the complexity on Earth has a copy number and an assembly index associated with it.

02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:22.880
That CA is just a number running. You don't think it has a copy number? Wait a minute.

02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:27.360
Well, it does in the human, where we're looking at humans producing different rules, but then

02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:33.040
it's nested on selection. So those CAs are produced by selection. I mean, the CA is such a

02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:41.040
fascinating pseudo-complexity generator. What I would love to do is understand, quantify the

02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:46.080
degree of surprise in a CA and write it long enough. But what I guess that means is we have

02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:49.520
to instantiate, we have to have a number of experiments where we're generating different

02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:58.400
rules and running them time-spec steps. Oh, got it. CAs are mining novelty in the future by

02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:02.480
iteration. And you're like, oh, that's great. That's great. You didn't predict it. Some rules

02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:06.560
you can predict what's going to happen. Other rules you can't. So for me, if anything,

02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:11.680
CAs are evidence that the universe is too big to contain itself, because otherwise you'd know

02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:17.280
what the rules are going to do forever more. Right. I guess you were saying that the physicist

02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:21.440
saying that all you need is the initial conditions and the rules of physics

02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:29.440
is somehow missing the bigger picture. And if you look at CA's, all you need is the initial

02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:38.000
condition and the rules and then run the thing. You need three things. You need the initial

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:43.360
conditions, you need the rules, and you need time iteration to mine it out. Without the

02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:48.000
coordinate, you can't get it out. Sure. And that's that to use fundamentals. And you can't predict

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:54.240
it from initial conditions. If you could, then it'd be fine. And that time is a resource. The

02:22:54.240 --> 02:23:01.840
foundation of the history, the memory of each of the things that created, it has to have that

02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:07.120
memory of all the things that led up to it. I think it's, yeah, you have to have the resource.

02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:16.000
Yeah. Because time is a fundamental resource. And yeah, I'm becoming, I think I had a major

02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:23.600
epiphany about randomness, but I keep doing that every two days. And then it goes away again,

02:23:23.600 --> 02:23:29.200
it's random. You're a time fundamentalist. You should be as well. If you believe in free will,

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:35.120
the only conclusion is time is fundamental. Otherwise you cannot have free will. It logically

02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:46.640
follows. Well, the foundation of my belief in free will is just observation driven.

02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:51.040
But that's, I think if you use logic, it's like,

02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:55.120
logically it seems like the universe is deterministic.

02:23:55.840 --> 02:23:58.160
Looking backwards in time. And that's correct. The universe is.

02:23:59.040 --> 02:24:03.520
And then everything else is a kind of leap. It requires a leap.

02:24:04.720 --> 02:24:13.120
I mean, I think that it's kind of, this is what I think machine learning is going to provide a big

02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:18.560
chunk of that, right? Because it helped us explain this. So the way I'd say, if you take.

02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:25.360
That's interesting. Why? Well, let's just, my favorite one is,

02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:30.880
because I'm, the AI doomers are driving me mad. And AI, the fact that we don't have any intelligence

02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:36.880
yet. I call AI autonomous informatics just to make people grumpy. Yeah. You're saying we're

02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:43.280
quite far away from AGI. I think that we have no conception of intelligence.

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:47.120
And I think that we don't understand how the human brain does what it does.

02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:52.320
I think that we are neurosciences making great advances, but I think that we have no idea about

02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:59.760
AGI. So I am a technological, I guess, optimist. I believe we should do everything. The whole

02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:04.880
regulation of AI is nonsensical. I mean, why would you regulate Excel other than the fact that Clippy

02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:09.840
should come back and I love Excel 97? Cause we can play, you know, we can do the fight flight

02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:15.680
simulator. I'm sorry in Excel. Yeah. Have you not played the flight simulator in Excel? Yeah. Yeah.

02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:23.120
Seven. Yeah. What does that look like? It's like wireframe very, very basic, but basically I think

02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:30.560
it's X zero Y zero shift and it opens up and you can play the fight simulator. Oh, wow. Wait, wait,

02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:36.000
is it using Excel? Excel, Excel 97. Okay. I resurrected it the other day and saw Clippy

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:41.200
again for the first time in a long time. Well, Clippy is definitely coming back, but you're saying

02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:46.320
we don't have a great understanding of what is intelligence? What is the intelligence?

02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:52.320
I am very frustrated. I'm underpinning the human mind. I'm very frustrated by the way that

02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:57.920
we're AI dooming right now and people are bestowing some kind of magic. Now,

02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:03.600
um, let's go back a bit. So you said about AGI. Are we far away from AGI? Yes. I do not think

02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:09.440
we're going to get to AGI anytime soon. I've seen no evidence of it. And the AI doom scenario is

02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:14.560
nonsensical and extreme. And the reason why I think it's nonsensical, but it's not,

02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:20.560
and I don't think there isn't things we should do and be very worried about, right? I mean,

02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:25.120
there are things we need to worry about right now. What AI doing, whether it's fake data,

02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:30.880
fake users, right? I want authentic people or authentic data. I don't want everything to

02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:34.640
be faked. And I think it's a really big problem. And I'm absolutely want to go on the record to

02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:39.520
say, I really worry about that. What I'm not worried about is that some fictitious entity

02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:45.040
is going to turn us all to paper clips or detonate nuclear bombs. I don't know,

02:26:46.720 --> 02:26:53.200
maybe, I don't know, anything you can't think of. Why is this? I'll take a very simple series of

02:26:53.200 --> 02:27:08.960
logical arguments. And the AI doomers have not had the correct epistemiology. They do not understand

02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:13.680
what knowledge is. And until we understand what knowledge is, they're not going to get anywhere

02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:18.480
because they're applying things falsely. So let me give you a very simple argument. People talk

02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:26.000
about the probability P doom AI. We can work out the probability of an asteroid hitting the planet.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.320
Why? Because it's happened before. We know the mechanism. We know that there's a gravity well,

02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:35.920
or that space time has been and stuff falls in. We don't know the probability of AGI because we

02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:40.640
have no mechanism. So let me give you another one, which is like, I'm really worried about AG.

02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:47.680
What's AG? AG is anti-gravity. One day we could wake up and anti-gravity is discovered. We're all

02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:52.400
going to die. The atmosphere is going to float away. We're going to float away. We're all doomed.

02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:57.920
What is the probability of AG? We don't know because there's no mechanism for AG. Do we worry

02:27:57.920 --> 02:28:10.080
about it? No. And I don't understand the current reason for certain people in certain areas to be

02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:15.760
generating this nonsense. I think they're not doing it maliciously. I think we're observing

02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:20.000
the emergence of new religions, how religions come, because religions are about some control.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.320
So you've got the optimist saying AI is going to cure us all and AI is going to kill us all.

02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:29.520
What's the reality? Well, we don't have AI. We have really powerful machine learning tools

02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:32.880
and they will allow us to do interesting things. And we need to be careful about

02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:38.000
how we use those tools in terms of manipulating human beings and faking stuff, right?

02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:45.200
Right. Well, let me try to sort of steal man the AI-doomers argument. Actually, I don't know.

02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:50.880
Are AI-doomers in the Yudkowsky camp saying it's definitely going to kill us?

02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:55.200
Because there's a spectrum. 95%, I think, is the limit. Yeah. 95% plus.

02:28:55.200 --> 02:29:01.200
No, not plus. I don't know. I was seeing on Twitter today various things, but I think Yudkowsky is at

02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:06.800
95%. But to belong to the AI-doomer club, is there a threshold? I don't know what the membership is.

02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:14.480
And what are the fees? I think Scott Aronson. I was quite surprised. I saw this online,

02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:20.320
so it could be wrong. So sorry if it's wrong. It says 2%. But the thing is, if someone said

02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:24.000
there's a 2% chance you're going to die going into the lift, would you go into the lift?

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:30.160
In the elevator for the American English-speaking audience. Well, no, not for the elevator.

02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:37.600
So I would say anyone higher than 2%, I mean, I think there's a 0% chance of AGI-doom. Zero.

02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:45.200
Just to push back on the argument where the end of zero on the AGI, we could see on Earth that there

02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:51.280
is increasing levels of intelligence of organisms. We could see what humans with extra intelligence

02:29:51.280 --> 02:30:02.240
were able to do to the other species. So that is a lot of samples of data, what a delta in

02:30:02.240 --> 02:30:06.960
intelligence gives you. When you have an increase in intelligence, how you're able to dominate a

02:30:06.960 --> 02:30:15.920
species on Earth. And so the idea there is that if you have a being that's 10x smarter than humans,

02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:22.400
we're not going to be able to predict what that's going to do. What that being is going to be able

02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:29.040
to do, especially if it has the power to hurt humans, which you can imagine a lot of trajectories

02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:35.920
in which the more benefit AI systems give, the more control we give to those AI systems over our

02:30:35.920 --> 02:30:44.240
power grid, over our nuclear weapons or weapons of any sort. And then it's hard to know what

02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:49.360
ultra intelligence system would be able to do in that case. You don't find that convincing.

02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:53.920
I think I would fail that argument 100%. Here's a number of reasons to fail it on.

02:30:54.480 --> 02:31:00.000
First of all, we don't know where the intention comes from. The problem is that people think

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:04.720
they keep watching all the hucksters online with a prompt engineering and all this stuff.

02:31:06.480 --> 02:31:13.680
When I talk to a typical AI computer scientist, they keep talking about the AIs having some kind

02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:19.440
of decision-making ability. That is a category error. The decision-making ability comes from

02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:24.000
human beings. We have no understanding of how humans make decisions. We've just been discussing

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:29.840
free will for the last half an hour, right? We don't even know what that is. So the intention,

02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:35.280
I totally agree with you. People who intend to do bad things can do bad things and we should

02:31:35.280 --> 02:31:41.520
not let that risk go. That's totally here and now. I do not want that to happen and I'm happy

02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:46.800
to be regulated to make sure that systems I generate, whether they're like computer systems

02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:54.160
or I'm working on a new project called Chem Machina. Nice. Well done.

02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:03.760
For people who don't understand the pun, the X Machina is a great film about, I guess,

02:32:03.760 --> 02:32:09.520
AGI embodied and chem is the chemistry version of that. I only know one way to embody intelligence,

02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:15.120
that's in chemistry and human brains. Category error number one is they have agency.

02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:20.720
Category error number two is saying that assuming that anything we make is going to be more

02:32:20.720 --> 02:32:24.480
intelligent. Now, you didn't say super intelligent. I'll put the words into our mouths here,

02:32:24.480 --> 02:32:33.920
super intelligent. I think that there is no reason to expect that we are going to make

02:32:33.920 --> 02:32:39.920
systems that are more intelligent, more capable. When people play chess computers,

02:32:39.920 --> 02:32:45.840
they don't expect to win now. The chess computer is very good at chess. That doesn't mean it's

02:32:45.840 --> 02:32:51.120
super intelligent. So I think that super intelligence, I mean, I think even Nick Bostrom

02:32:51.120 --> 02:32:56.320
is pulling back on this now because he invented this. So I see this a lot. When did this first

02:32:56.320 --> 02:33:01.920
happen? Eric Drexler, nanotechnology, atomically precise machines. He came up with a world where

02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:07.040
we had these atom cogs everywhere. They were going to make self-replicating nanobots. Not

02:33:07.040 --> 02:33:11.040
possible. Why? Because there's no resources to build these self-replicating nanobots.

02:33:11.040 --> 02:33:16.720
You can't get the precision. It doesn't work. It was a major category error in taking engineering

02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:24.800
principles down to the molecular level. The only functioning nanomolecular technology we know,

02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:31.040
produced by evolution, there. So now let's go forward to AGI. What is AGI? We don't know. It's

02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:38.320
super. It can do this. Humans can't think. I would argue the only AGI's that exist in the

02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:43.360
universe are produced by evolution. And sure, we may be able to make our working memory better. We

02:33:43.360 --> 02:33:50.000
might be able to do more things. The human brain is the most compact computing unit in the universe.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:57.120
It uses 20 watts. It uses a really limited volume. It's not like a chat GPT cluster which has to have

02:33:57.120 --> 02:34:01.520
thousands of watts model that's generated and has to be corrected by human beings.

02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:07.200
You are autonomous and embodied intelligence. So I think that there are so many levels that we're

02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:13.120
missing out. We've just kind of went, oh, we've discovered fire. Oh gosh, the planet's just going

02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:18.080
to burn one day randomly. I mean, I just don't understand that leap. There are bigger problems

02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:23.840
we need to worry about. So what is the motivation? Why are these people, let's assume they have their

02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:31.200
earnest, have this conviction? Well, I think it's kind of, they're making leaps that

02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:36.400
they're trapped in a virtual reality that isn't reality. Well, I mean, I can continue

02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:43.520
this set of arguments here, but also it is true that ideologies that fear monger are dangerous

02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:51.040
because you can then use it to control, to regulate in a way that

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:58.640
halts progress, to control people, to cancel people, all that kind of stuff. So you have to

02:34:58.640 --> 02:35:05.280
be careful because reason ultimately wins, right? But there is a lot of concerns with

02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:11.520
super-intelligent systems, very capable systems. I think when you hear the word super-intelligent,

02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:19.200
you're hearing like it's smarter than humans in every way that humans are smart. But the

02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:27.440
paperclip manufacturing system doesn't need to be smart in every way. It just needs to be smart in

02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:34.400
a set of specific ways. And the more capable the AI systems become, the more you could see us

02:35:34.400 --> 02:35:39.760
giving them control over, like I said, our power grid, a lot of aspects of human life. And then

02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:45.280
that means they will be able to do more and more damage when there's unintended consequences that

02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:50.480
come to life. I think that that's right. The unintended consequences we have to think about,

02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:58.080
that I fully agree with. But let's go back a bit. Sentient, I mean, again, I'm far away from my

02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:02.720
comfort zone and all this stuff, but hey, let's talk about it because I give myself a qualification.

02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:07.040
Yeah, we're both qualified and sentient, I think, as much as anyone else.

02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:11.040
I think the paperclip scenario is just such a poor one because let's think about how that would

02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:19.120
happen. And also let's think about we are being so unrealistic about how much of the Earth's

02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:25.200
surface we have commandeered. You know, for paperclip manufacturing to really happen,

02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:29.440
I mean, do the math. It's like, it's not going to happen. There's not enough energy. There's

02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:34.240
not enough resource where they're all going to come from. I think that what happens in evolution

02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:42.160
is really why is a killer virus not killed all life on Earth? Well, what happens is,

02:36:42.720 --> 02:36:47.680
sure, super killer viruses that kill the ribosome have emerged, but you know what happens? They nuke

02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:52.720
a small space because they can't propagate. They all die. So there's this interplay between

02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:58.560
evolution and propagation, right, and death. In evolution. You don't think it's possible

02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:03.680
to engineer, for example, sorry to interrupt, but like a perfect virus that's deadly enough?

02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:08.640
No, nonsensical. I think that just wouldn't, again, it wouldn't work. It was too deadly.

02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:13.760
It would just kill the radius and not replicate. Yeah. I mean, you don't think it's possible to get

02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:17.360
I mean, if you were super, I mean, if you were

02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:24.480
not kill all of life on Earth, but kill all humans. There's not many of us. There's only like 8

02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:32.080
billion. There's so much more ants. I mean, I don't, I so many more ants and they're pretty smart.

02:37:32.800 --> 02:37:40.480
I think the nice thing about where we are, I would love for the AI crowd to take a leaf out

02:37:40.480 --> 02:37:47.920
of the book of the bio warfare chemical warfare crowd. I mean, not love because actually people

02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:51.600
have been killed with chemical weapons in the first and second world war and people and bio

02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:55.680
weapons have been made and you know, we can argue about COVID-19 and all this stuff. Let's not go

02:37:55.680 --> 02:37:59.920
there just now. But I think there is a consensus that some certain things are bad and we shouldn't

02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:08.320
do them. Right. And, and sure, it would be possible for a bad actor to, to engineer something bad,

02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:14.160
but the lip, the damage would be, we would see it coming and we would be able to do something about

02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:24.400
it. Now, I guess what I'm trying to say is when people talk about doom, and they just, when you

02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:30.160
ask them for the mechanism, they just say, you know, they just make something up. I'm, I mean,

02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:35.120
in this case, I'm we Yan LeCun. I think he put out a very good point about trying to regulate jet

02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:39.920
engines before we've even invented them. And I think that's what I'm saying. I'm not saying we

02:38:39.920 --> 02:38:45.200
should, I just don't understand why these guys are going around making, literally making stuff

02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:51.680
up about us all dying when basically we need to actually really focus on. Now let's say there's

02:38:51.680 --> 02:38:58.480
some actors are earnest, right? Let's say Yudekowski is being earnest, right? And he really cares,

02:38:58.480 --> 02:39:02.960
but he loves it. It goes, and then you're all going to die. It's like, you know, why don't we

02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:05.840
try and do the same thing and say, you could do this and then you're going to be happy forever

02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:12.000
after. Yeah. Well, I think there's several things to say there. One, I think there is a role in

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:18.480
society for people that say we're all going to die because I think it filters through as a message,

02:39:18.480 --> 02:39:24.560
it's a viral message that gives us the proper amount of concern. Okay. All right. Meaning not

02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:32.240
the, it's not 95%, but when you say 95% and it filters through society, it'll give an average

02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:39.280
of like a 0.03% an average. So it's nice to have people that are like, we're all going to die.

02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:44.320
Then we'll have a proper concern. Like for example, I do believe we're not properly concerned

02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:49.840
about the threat of nuclear weapons currently. Like that, that it just seems like people have

02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:55.920
forgotten that that's a thing. And you know, there's a war in Ukraine with the nuclear power

02:39:55.920 --> 02:40:00.160
involved. There's nuclear power throughout the world. And it just feels like we're on the brink

02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:06.400
of a potential world war to a percentage that I don't think people are properly calibrating

02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:12.000
like in their head. We're all thinking it's a Twitter battle as opposed to like actual threat.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:17.920
So like, it's nice to have that kind of level of concern. But to me, like what I, when I hear AI

02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:23.360
do is what I'm imagining is with unintended consequences, a potential situation where

02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:31.920
let's say 5% of the world suffers deeply because of a mistake made of unintended consequences.

02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:36.240
I don't want to imagine the entirety of human civilization dying, but there could be a lot

02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:41.280
of suffering if this is done. I understand that. And I'm, I kind of, I guess, I mean,

02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:47.680
I'm involved in the whole hype cycle. Like why, I would like us to, I don't want us to,

02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:51.280
I don't want us to, so what's happening right now is there seems to be,

02:40:52.240 --> 02:40:58.800
so let me, let's say having some people saying AI doom is a worry. Fine. Let's give them that.

02:40:58.800 --> 02:41:03.680
But what seems to be happening is there seems to be people who don't think AI is doing, they're

02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:10.000
trying to use that to control regulation and to push people to regulate where, which stops

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:14.800
humans generating knowledge. And I am an advocate for generating as much knowledge as possible.

02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:20.960
When it comes to nuclear weapons, I grew up in the seventies and eighties where the nuclear doom,

02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:27.120
a lot of adults really had existential threat, almost as bad as now with AI doom. They were

02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:31.840
really worried, right? There was some great, well, not great, there was some horrific documentaries.

02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:36.480
I think there's one called Fred's that was generated in the UK, which was like,

02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:44.720
it was terrible. It was like, so scary. And I think that the correct thing to do is obviously

02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:48.800
get rid of nuclear weapons, but let's think about unintended consequences. We've got rid of,

02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:54.480
we got rid of all the sulfur particles in the atmosphere, right? All the, all the soot.

02:41:55.120 --> 02:41:58.000
And what's happened in the last couple of years is global warming has accelerated

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:03.760
because we've cleaned up the atmosphere too much. So, sure. I mean, the same thing,

02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:09.040
if you get rid of nuclear weapons. Exactly. That's my point. So what we could do is if we

02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:14.880
actually started to put the AI in charge, which is, I really like an AI to be in charge of all

02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:19.280
world politics. And this sounds ridiculous for a second. Hang on. But if we could all agree on the-

02:42:19.280 --> 02:42:21.440
AI tumors just woke up. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:42:21.440 --> 02:42:22.240
On that statement.

02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:26.480
But I really don't like politicians who are basically just looking at local sampling. But

02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:30.960
if you could say globally, look, here's some game theory here. What is the minimum number

02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:35.680
of nuclear weapons we need to distribute around the night, the world to everybody

02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:39.680
to basically reduce war to zero.

02:42:39.680 --> 02:42:45.760
I mean, just the start experiment of the United States and China and Russia and major nuclear

02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:50.800
powers get together and say, all right, we're going to distribute nuclear weapons to every

02:42:50.800 --> 02:43:00.720
single nation on earth. Oh boy. I mean, that has a probably greater than 50%

02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:07.520
chance of eliminating major military conflict. Yeah. Yeah, but it's not a hundred percent.

02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:12.080
But I don't think anyone will use them because I think I think, and look, what you've got to

02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:17.840
try and do is like for to qualify for these nuclear weapons. This is a great idea. The

02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:22.960
game theorists could do this, right? I think the question is this. I really buy your question. We

02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:27.840
have too many nukes from just from a feeling point of view that we've got too many of them.

02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:30.960
So let's reduce the number, but not get rid of them because we'll have too much conventional

02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:35.760
warfare. So then what is the minimum number of nuclear weapons we can distribute around to

02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:43.520
remove? Humans hurting each other is something we should stop doing. It's in, it's not out with

02:43:43.520 --> 02:43:48.960
our conceptual capability. But right now, what about the nations, certain nations that are being

02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:54.400
exploited for their natural resources in the future because for a short term gain,

02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:59.760
because we don't want to generate knowledge. And so if everybody had an equal doomsday switch,

02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:06.560
I predict the quality of life in average human will go up faster. I am an optimist and I believe

02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:10.800
that humanity is going to get better and better and better, that we're going to eliminate more

02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:18.400
problems. But I think, yeah, let's, but the probability of a bad actor of one of the nations

02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:25.360
setting off a nuclear weapon. I mean, you have to, you have to integrate that into the,

02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:30.800
but we get, we just give you the nuclear nukes like population, right? We give what we do is we,

02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:37.440
but anyway, let's just, just go there. Let's say, so if a, if a small nation with a couple of nukes

02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:42.000
uses one because they're a bit bored or annoyed, they're going to, they, the likelihood that they

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:47.280
are going to be pummeled out of existence immediately is 100%. And yet they've only,

02:44:47.280 --> 02:44:51.200
they've only nuked one other city. I know this is crazy and I apologize for-

02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:55.520
No, no, I think this, just to be clear, we're just having a thought experiment. That's interesting,

02:44:55.520 --> 02:45:02.400
but you know, there's terrorist organizations that would take that, would take, would take that trade.

02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:08.400
We have to ask ourselves the question of how many, which percentage of humans

02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:14.960
would be suicide bombers essentially, where they would sacrifice their own life to, to,

02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:20.800
because they hate another group of people. And that, I believe it's a very small fraction,

02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:24.880
but is it large enough to, if you give out nuclear weapons?

02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:28.720
I can predict a future where we take all nuclear material and we burn it for energy,

02:45:28.720 --> 02:45:31.360
right? As well, because we're getting there. And the other thing you could do is say, look,

02:45:32.160 --> 02:45:36.400
there's a gap. So if we got all the countries to sign up to the virtual nuclear agreement where

02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:40.400
we all exist, we have a simulation where we can nuke each other in the simulation and the,

02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:45.760
economic consequences are catastrophic. Sure. In the simulation, I love it. It's not

02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:48.560
going to kill all humans. It's just going to have economic consequences.

02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:51.040
Yeah. I don't know. I just made it up. It seems like-

02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:54.720
No, it's interesting. I mean, but it's interesting whether that would have as much

02:45:55.360 --> 02:45:58.880
power in human psychology as actual physical nuclear.

02:45:58.880 --> 02:46:00.880
I think so. It's possible,

02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:06.880
but people don't take economic consequences as seriously, I think, as actual nuclear weapons.

02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:12.720
I think they're doing Argentina and they do in Somalia and they're doing a lot of these places

02:46:12.720 --> 02:46:17.280
where, no, I think this is a great idea. I'm a strong advocate now for, so what have we come

02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:22.880
up with? Burning all the nuclear material to have energy. And before we do that, because MAD is good,

02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:28.560
mutually assured destruction is very powerful. Let's take it into the metaverse and then get

02:46:28.560 --> 02:46:34.240
people to kind of subscribe to that. And if they actually nuke each other, even for fun in the

02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:39.280
metaverse, there are dire consequences. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like a video game. We all

02:46:39.280 --> 02:46:41.680
have to join this metaverse video game. Yeah.

02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:45.120
I can't believe it's- And then there's dire economic consequences.

02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:51.360
I don't know how, and it's all run by AI, as you mentioned. So the AI doomers are really terrified

02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:54.720
at this point. No, they're happy. They have a job for another 20 years, right?

02:46:55.920 --> 02:46:59.920
Fear mongering. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a believer in equal employment.

02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:06.720
You've mentioned that, what'd you call it? Chem machina?

02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:12.080
Yeah. Yeah. So you've mentioned that a chemical brain is something you're interested in creating.

02:47:13.840 --> 02:47:21.360
And that's the way you get conscious AI soon. Can you explain what a chemical brain is?

02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:26.000
I want to understand the mechanism of intelligence that's gone through evolution, right? Because

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:33.120
the way that intelligence was produced by evolution appears to be the following.

02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:40.640
Origin of life, multisolidarity, locomotion, sensors. Once you can start to see things

02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:47.440
coming towards you, and you can remember the past and interrogate the present and imagine the

02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:53.360
future, you can do something amazing, right? And I think only in recent years did humans

02:47:53.360 --> 02:47:56.400
become Turing-complete, right? Yeah.

02:47:58.880 --> 02:48:06.400
And so that Turing-completeness kind of gave us another kick up. But our ability to process that

02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:17.200
information is produced in a wet brain. And I think that we do not have the correct hardware

02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:23.840
architectures to have the domain flexibility and the ability to integrate information.

02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:30.640
And I think intelligence also comes at a massive compromise of data. Right now,

02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:35.120
we're obsessing about getting more and more data, more and more processing, more and more tricks

02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:40.640
to get dopamine hits. So when we look back on this, going, oh yeah, that was really cool.

02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:48.960
Because when I asked chat GPT, it made me feel really happy. I got a hit from it. But actually,

02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:57.760
it just exposed how little intelligence I use in every moment because I'm easily fooled.

02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:04.000
So what I would like to do is to say, well, hey, hang on. What is it about the brain? So the brain

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:11.680
has this incredible connectivity and it has the ability to, as I said earlier about my nephew,

02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:17.040
I went from Bill to Billy and he went, all right, Leroy. How did he make that leap?

02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:23.120
That he was able to basically, without any training, I extended his name. He doesn't like,

02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:26.640
he wants to be called Bill. He went back and said, you like to be called Lee? I'm going to

02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:34.560
call you Leroy. So human beings have a brilliant ability or intelligent beings appear to have a

02:49:34.560 --> 02:49:40.720
brilliant ability to integrate across all domains all at once and to synthesize something which

02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:50.880
allows us to generate knowledge and becoming true and complete on our own. Although AIs are

02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:55.760
built in true and complete things, their thinking is not true and complete in that they are not

02:49:55.760 --> 02:50:01.840
able to build universal explanations. And that lack of universal explanation

02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:09.040
means that they're just inductivists. Inductivism doesn't get you anywhere. It's just basically a

02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:16.400
party trick. I think it's in the fabric of reality from David Deutsch where basically

02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:22.080
the farmer is feeding the chicken every day and the chicken's getting fat and happy and the

02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:25.600
chicken's like, I'm really happy every time the farmer comes in and feeds me. And then one day

02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:32.640
the farmer comes in and instead of feeding the chicken, just rings its neck. That's kind of,

02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:36.720
and had the chicken had an alternative understanding of why the farmer was feeding it.

02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:42.160
It's interesting though, because we all know what's special about the human mind that's able to come

02:50:42.160 --> 02:50:48.000
up with these kind of generalities, this universal theories of things, and who come up with novelty.

02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:57.120
I can imagine, because you gave an example about William and Leroy, I feel like

02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:06.320
example like that we'll be able to see in future versions of large language models. We'll be really,

02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:15.200
really, really impressed by the humor, the insights, all of it, because it's fundamentally

02:51:15.200 --> 02:51:19.360
trained on all the incredible humor and insights that's available out there on the internet.

02:51:20.880 --> 02:51:26.720
I think we'll be impressed. Oh, I'm impressed. Right. I'm impressed. Increasingly so. But we're

02:51:26.720 --> 02:51:31.680
mining the past. Yes. And what the human brain appears to be able to do is mine the future.

02:51:31.680 --> 02:51:36.880
Yes. So novelty. It is interesting whether these large language models

02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:42.400
will ever be able to come up with something truly novel. I can show on the back of a piece of paper

02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:47.920
why that's impossible. And it's like the problem is that, and again, these are domain experts kind

02:51:47.920 --> 02:51:56.000
of bullshitting each other. The term generative. Yes. Right. Average person, oh, it's generative.

02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:03.040
No, no, no. Look, if I take the numbers between zero and 1000, and I train a model to pick out

02:52:03.040 --> 02:52:07.200
the prime numbers by giving them all the prime numbers between zero and 1000, he doesn't know

02:52:07.200 --> 02:52:12.960
what prime number is. Occasionally, if I can cheat a bit, we'll start to guess that it never

02:52:12.960 --> 02:52:17.360
will produce anything out with the data set because you mined the past. The thing that I'm

02:52:17.360 --> 02:52:21.760
getting to is I think that actually current machine learning technologies might actually

02:52:21.760 --> 02:52:27.120
help reveal why time is fundamental. It's like kind of insane because they tell you about what's

02:52:27.120 --> 02:52:31.760
happened in the past, but they can never help you understand what's happening in the future

02:52:31.760 --> 02:52:39.760
without training examples. Sure, if that thing happens again, it's like, so I think, so let's

02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:44.960
think about what large language models are doing. We have the, we have the, we have all the internet

02:52:44.960 --> 02:52:49.680
as we know it, you know, language, but also they're doing something else. We're having human beings

02:52:49.680 --> 02:52:56.800
correcting it all the time. Those models are being corrected. Steered. Corrected.

02:52:56.800 --> 02:53:04.480
Modified. Tweaked. It's cheating. Well, you could say that training on human data in the first place

02:53:04.480 --> 02:53:08.560
is cheating. Well, let me, human is in the loop. Sorry to interrupt. Yes, so human is definitely in

02:53:08.560 --> 02:53:16.800
the loop, but it's not just human is in the loop. A very large collection of humans is in the loop.

02:53:16.800 --> 02:53:23.200
Look, I totally- And that could be, I mean, to me, it's not intuitive that you said prime numbers,

02:53:23.440 --> 02:53:31.200
that the system can't generate an algorithm, right? That the algorithm that can generate prime

02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:36.000
numbers or the algorithm that can tell you if a number is prime and so on, and generate algorithms

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:42.880
that generate algorithms that generate algorithms that start to look a lot like human reasoning,

02:53:42.880 --> 02:53:48.800
you know? I don't think, I think again, we can show that on a piece of paper that sure, I think

02:53:48.800 --> 02:53:57.600
there has to, you have to have, so this is the failure in epistemiology. Like I'm glad I even

02:53:57.600 --> 02:54:01.120
say that word, let me know what it means. You said it multiple times. I know, it's like three

02:54:01.120 --> 02:54:06.640
times now. Without failure. Quit while you're ahead. Just don't say it again, because you did

02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:13.920
really well. Thanks. So, but I think, so what is reasoning? So coming back to the chemical brain,

02:54:13.920 --> 02:54:19.600
if I could basically, if I could show that in a, because I mean, I'm never going to make an

02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:24.640
intelligence in can Machina, because if we don't have brain cells, they don't have glial cells,

02:54:24.640 --> 02:54:31.360
they don't have neurons, but if I can make, if I can take a gel and engineer the gel to have it be

02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:37.680
a hybrid hardware for reprogramming, which I think I know how to do, I will be able to process a lot

02:54:37.680 --> 02:54:44.720
more information and train, train models billions of times cheaper and use cross-domain knowledge.

02:54:44.720 --> 02:54:50.000
And there's certain techniques I think we can do, but it's still missing though the, the,

02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:57.040
the abilities of human beings have had to become true and complete. And so I guess the question to

02:54:57.040 --> 02:55:01.520
give back at you and I, it's like, how do you tell the difference between trial and error

02:55:02.320 --> 02:55:08.080
and the generation of new knowledge? I think the way you can do it is this,

02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:14.160
is that you come up with a theory and explanations, inspiration comes from out there. Yeah. And then

02:55:14.160 --> 02:55:19.360
you then test that and then you, you see that's going towards a truth and human beings are very

02:55:19.360 --> 02:55:23.760
good at doing that in the transition between philosophy, mathematics, physics, and natural

02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:31.520
sciences where, and I think that we, we can see that where I get confused is why people

02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:38.320
misappropriate the term artificial intelligence to say, Hey, there's something else going on here

02:55:38.320 --> 02:55:41.920
because I think you and I both agree machine learning is really good. It's only gonna get

02:55:41.920 --> 02:55:47.040
better. We're going to get happier with the outcome, but why would you ever think the model

02:55:47.040 --> 02:55:52.080
was thinking or reasoning, reasoning requires intention

02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:59.600
and the intention. If the model isn't reasoning, the intentions come from the prompter

02:56:00.560 --> 02:56:06.240
and the intention has come from the person who programmed it to do it. So I, I,

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:14.400
but don't you think you can prompt it to have intention, basically start with the initial

02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:23.360
conditions and get it going where the, you know, currently large language models, Chad GPT

02:56:24.400 --> 02:56:30.800
only talks to you when you talk to it. There's no reason why you can't just start talking.

02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:34.880
But wait, but those initial condition conditions came from someone starting it.

02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:38.240
Yes. And that causal chain in there. So that intention comes from the outside.

02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:42.560
I think that there is something in that causal chain of intention that's super important.

02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:47.520
I don't disagree. We're going to get to AGI. It's a matter of when and what hardware,

02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:52.400
I think we're not going to do it in this hardware. And I think we're unnecessarily fetishizing

02:56:52.400 --> 02:56:56.400
really cool outputs and dopamine hits, because obviously that's what people want to sell us.

02:56:57.680 --> 02:57:03.680
Well, but there could be, I mean, AGI is a loaded term, but there could be incredibly super

02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:12.640
and impressive intelligence systems on the way to AGI. So these large language models, I mean,

02:57:13.760 --> 02:57:17.280
if it appears conscious, if it appears super intelligent,

02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:25.360
who are we to say it's not? I agree. But I, the super intelligence, I want, I want to,

02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:28.800
I want to be able to have a discussion with it about

02:57:28.800 --> 02:57:35.920
coming up with fundamental new ideas that generate knowledge. And if the super intelligence

02:57:35.920 --> 02:57:39.760
we generate can mine novelty from the future that I didn't see in its training set in the past,

02:57:39.760 --> 02:57:43.920
I would agree that something really interesting is coming on. I'll say that again, if the,

02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:48.480
if the intelligence system, be it a human being, a chat, chat bot, something else,

02:57:48.480 --> 02:57:55.600
is able to produce something truly novel that we could not predict, even having full audit trail

02:57:55.600 --> 02:58:01.440
from the past, then I would be sold. Well, so we should be clear that it can currently produce,

02:58:01.440 --> 02:58:08.960
it can currently produce things that are in a shallow sense novel that are not in the training

02:58:08.960 --> 02:58:15.200
set, but you're saying truly novel. I think they are in the training set. I think everything it

02:58:15.200 --> 02:58:18.800
produces comes from a training set. They might be inter there's a difference between interpret

02:58:18.800 --> 02:58:24.080
novelty and interpolation. We do not understand where these leaps come from yet. That is what

02:58:24.080 --> 02:58:28.960
intelligence is. I would argue those leaps. And some people say, no, it's actually just what will

02:58:28.960 --> 02:58:33.280
happen if you just do cross domain training and all that stuff. And that may be true. And I may

02:58:33.280 --> 02:58:40.320
be completely wrong. But right now, the human mind is able to mine novelty in a way that

02:58:40.320 --> 02:58:43.920
artificial intelligence systems cannot. And this is why we still have a job and we're still doing

02:58:43.920 --> 02:58:48.000
stuff. And, you know, I use chat GPT for a few weeks. Well, this is cool. And then it took me

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:51.920
too much. I had to, well, what happened is it took me too much time to correct it. Then it got

02:58:51.920 --> 02:58:55.920
really good. And now they've, they've done something to it. It's not actually that good.

02:58:55.920 --> 02:59:00.640
Yeah, right. I don't know what's going on with censorship. Yeah. So I mean, that's interesting,

02:59:00.640 --> 02:59:06.480
but it will push us humans to characterize novelty better, like characterize the novel,

02:59:06.480 --> 02:59:10.480
like what is novel? What is truly novel? What's the difference between novelty and interpolation?

02:59:10.480 --> 02:59:14.960
I think that this, this is the thing that makes me most excited about these technologies

02:59:14.960 --> 02:59:20.240
is they're going to help me demonstrate to you that time is fundamental and unit future is bigger

02:59:20.880 --> 02:59:27.520
than the present, which is why we are, human beings are quite good at generating novelty

02:59:27.520 --> 02:59:33.040
because we have to expand our data set and to cope with unexpected things in our environment.

02:59:33.040 --> 02:59:36.800
Our environment throws them all at us. Again, we have to survive in that environment.

02:59:36.800 --> 02:59:44.720
And I mean, I never say never, I would be very interested in how we can get cross domain training

02:59:44.720 --> 02:59:50.080
cheaply in chemical systems, because I'm a chemist and the only thing I know of is human brain,

02:59:50.080 --> 02:59:53.280
but maybe that's just me being boring, predictable and not novel.

02:59:54.080 --> 02:59:58.960
Yeah. You mentioned GPT for electron density. So a GPT like system for

03:00:00.480 --> 03:00:05.600
generating molecules that can bind to host automatically. I mean, that's, that's interesting.

03:00:06.240 --> 03:00:10.000
That's really interesting. Applying this same kind of transform mechanism.

03:00:10.800 --> 03:00:18.240
Yeah. I mean, this is one, it goes, my team, I try and do things that are non obvious,

03:00:18.240 --> 03:00:22.000
but non obvious in certain areas. And one of the things I was always asking about

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:28.480
in chemistry, people like to represent molecules as graphs. And it's quite difficult. It's really

03:00:28.480 --> 03:00:33.200
hard. If you're doing AI in chemistry, you really want to basically have good representations. You

03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:37.840
can generate new molecules. They're interesting. And I was thinking, well, molecules aren't really

03:00:37.840 --> 03:00:43.040
graphs and they're not continuously differentiable. Could I do something that was continuously

03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:46.240
differentiable? I was like, well, molecules are actually made up of electron density.

03:00:46.240 --> 03:00:50.720
So I got thinking, say, well, okay, could there be a way where we could just basically take a,

03:00:52.240 --> 03:00:58.720
take a database of readily solved electron densities for millions of molecules. So we

03:00:58.720 --> 03:01:03.360
took the electron density for millions of molecules and just train the model to put,

03:01:03.360 --> 03:01:09.200
to learn what electron density is. And so what we built was a system that you literally could

03:01:09.200 --> 03:01:14.160
give it a, let's say you could take a protein that has a particular active site or, you know,

03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:19.040
a cup with a certain hole in it, you pour noise into it. And with a GPT, you turn the noise into

03:01:19.040 --> 03:01:24.400
electron density. And then in this case, it hallucinates like all of them do, but the

03:01:24.400 --> 03:01:29.280
hallucinations are good because it means I don't have to train on such a large number, such a huge

03:01:29.920 --> 03:01:34.480
dataset, because these datasets are very expensive because how do you produce it? So,

03:01:35.120 --> 03:01:39.600
so go back a step. So you've got all these molecules in this dataset, but what you've

03:01:39.600 --> 03:01:44.400
literally done is a quantum mechanical calculation. We produce electron densities

03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:47.760
for each molecule. So you say, oh, this representation of this molecule has these

03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:51.920
electron densities associated with it. So you know what the representation is and you train

03:01:51.920 --> 03:01:56.880
the neural network to know what electron density is. So then you give it an unknown pocket.

03:01:56.880 --> 03:02:01.760
You pour in noise and you say, right, produce me electron density. It produces electron density

03:02:01.760 --> 03:02:07.120
that doesn't look ridiculous. And what we did in this case is we produce electron density that

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:12.640
maximizes the electrostatic potentials to the stickiness, but minimizes the, what we call

03:02:12.640 --> 03:02:17.120
the steric hindrance. So the overlaps, it's repulsive. So, you know, make the perfect fit.

03:02:17.120 --> 03:02:23.200
And then we then use the kind of a, kind of like a chat GPT type thing to turn that electron

03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:28.960
density into what's called a smile. A smile string is a, is a, is a, a way of representing

03:02:28.960 --> 03:02:34.320
a molecule in letters. And then we can then just generates them, just generates them.

03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:38.000
And then the other thing is, and we bung that into the computer and then it just makes it.

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:41.040
Yeah. The, the computer being the thing that you're right.

03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:46.640
Robot that we've got that can basically just do chemistry. So kind of, we kind of got this

03:02:46.640 --> 03:02:51.360
end to end drug discovery machine where you can say, oh, you want to buy into this active site.

03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:55.280
Here you go. I mean, it's a bit leaky and things kind of break, but it's the,

03:02:55.280 --> 03:03:01.040
it's a proof of principle. Well, were the hallucinations, what are those still accurate?

03:03:01.040 --> 03:03:04.880
Well, the hallucinations are really great in this case, because in the case of a large

03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:08.880
language model, the hallucinations just like, just make everything up to when it doesn't

03:03:08.880 --> 03:03:12.400
just make everything up, but it gives you an output that you're plausibly comfortable with.

03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:17.840
It thinks you're doing probabilistically. The problem on these electron density models is

03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:22.400
it's very expensive to solve a Schrodinger equation going up to many heavy atoms

03:03:23.040 --> 03:03:31.920
and large molecules. And so we wondered if we trained the, the, the system on up to nine

03:03:31.920 --> 03:03:36.800
heavy atoms, whether it would go beyond nine. And it did. It started to generate molecules of 12.

03:03:37.520 --> 03:03:41.360
No problem. They look pretty good. And I was like, well, this hallucination, I will take for free.

03:03:41.360 --> 03:03:46.000
Thank you very much. Cause it just basically, this is a case where interpolation extrapolation

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:52.080
worked relatively well. And we were able to generate the really good molecules. And then

03:03:52.080 --> 03:03:55.840
what we were able to do here is, and this is a really good point of what I was trying to say

03:03:55.840 --> 03:04:04.320
earlier, that we were able to generate new molecules from the known dataset that would bind

03:04:04.880 --> 03:04:11.520
to the, the host. So a new guest would bind. Were these truly novel? Not really, because they,

03:04:12.400 --> 03:04:20.960
that they were constrained by the host. Were they new to us? Yes. So I do understand, I can concede

03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:26.880
that machine learning systems, artificial intelligence systems can generate new entities,

03:04:27.440 --> 03:04:34.320
but how novel are they? It remains to be seen. Yeah. And how novel the things that humans generate

03:04:34.320 --> 03:04:42.480
is also difficult to quantify. They seem novel. That's what a lot of people say. Like, you know,

03:04:43.840 --> 03:04:48.480
so the way to really get to genuine novelty and the assembly theory shows you the way

03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:59.600
is to have different causal chains overlap. And this really resonates with the time is fundamental

03:04:59.600 --> 03:05:06.320
argument. And if you're bringing together a couple of objects with different initial conditions

03:05:06.320 --> 03:05:13.040
coming together, when they interact, the more different their histories, the more novelty

03:05:13.120 --> 03:05:19.520
they generate in time going forward. And so it could be that genuine novelty is basically about

03:05:19.520 --> 03:05:24.480
mix, mix it up a little, and the human brain is able to mix it up a little,

03:05:24.480 --> 03:05:28.400
little and all that stimulus comes from the environment. But all I think I'm saying

03:05:29.120 --> 03:05:34.000
is the universe is deterministic going back in time, non deterministic going forward in time,

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:37.920
because the future is too, the universe is too big in the future to contain in the present.

03:05:38.720 --> 03:05:45.120
Therefore, these collisions of known things generate unknown things that then become part

03:05:45.120 --> 03:05:50.320
of your data set and don't appear weird. That's how we give ourselves comfort. The past looks

03:05:50.320 --> 03:05:54.240
consistent with this initial condition hypothesis, but actually we're generating more and more

03:05:54.240 --> 03:06:01.520
novelty. And that's how it works. Simple. So it's hard to quantify novelty looking backwards. I mean,

03:06:02.640 --> 03:06:07.120
the present and the future are the novelty generators. But I like this whole idea of

03:06:07.120 --> 03:06:14.800
mining novelty. I think it is going to reveal why the limitations of current AI is a bit like

03:06:14.800 --> 03:06:21.120
a printing press, right? Everyone thought that when the printing press came that writing books

03:06:21.120 --> 03:06:24.400
is going to be terrible, that you had evil spirits and all this, they were just books.

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:31.760
And same with AI. But I think they're just the scale you can achieve in terms of impact

03:06:31.760 --> 03:06:37.840
with AI systems is pretty nerve wracking. But that's what the big companies want you to think.

03:06:39.120 --> 03:06:42.560
But not like in terms of destroy all humans, but you can have major

03:06:44.880 --> 03:06:50.160
consequences in the way social media has had major consequences, both positive and negative. And so

03:06:50.160 --> 03:06:54.880
you have to kind of think about and worry about it. But yeah, people that fear monger, you know,

03:06:54.960 --> 03:07:02.000
my theory for this, you want to know? Yeah, is I think that a lot of and maybe I'm being

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:08.000
and I think I really do respect, you know, a lot of the people out there who are trying to have

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:13.440
discourse about the positive future. So open AI guys, met guys and all this. And what I wonder

03:07:13.440 --> 03:07:17.280
if they're trying to cover up for the fact that social media has had a pretty disastrous effect

03:07:17.280 --> 03:07:21.600
at some level. And they're just trying to say, Oh, yeah, we should do this because and covering

03:07:21.600 --> 03:07:28.160
up for the fact that we have got some problems with, you know, teenagers and Instagram and

03:07:28.160 --> 03:07:32.880
Snapchat, and, you know, all this stuff, and maybe they're just overreacting now. Yeah,

03:07:32.880 --> 03:07:37.360
it's like, Oh, yeah, sorry, we made the bubonic plate and gave it to you all and you're all dying

03:07:37.360 --> 03:07:41.680
and Oh, yeah, but look at this over here is even worse. Yeah, there's a there's a little bit of

03:07:41.680 --> 03:07:46.640
that. But there's also not enough celebration of the positive impact that all these technologies

03:07:46.640 --> 03:07:54.000
have had, tend to focus on the negative and tend to forget that in part because it's hard to measure

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:57.520
like it's very hard to measure the positive impact social media had on the world.

03:07:58.080 --> 03:08:03.920
Yeah, I agree. But if what I worry about right now is like, I'm really I do care about the ethics

03:08:03.920 --> 03:08:08.480
of what we're doing. And one of the reasons why I'm so open about the things we're trying to do in

03:08:08.480 --> 03:08:13.600
the lab, make life look intelligence, all this is so people say, what are the consequences of this?

03:08:13.600 --> 03:08:19.440
And you say, what are the consequences of not doing it? And I think that what worries me right

03:08:19.440 --> 03:08:26.240
now in the present is lack of authenticated users and authenticated data and human users.

03:08:26.240 --> 03:08:33.280
Yeah, human. I still think that there will be AI agents that appear to be conscious,

03:08:33.280 --> 03:08:39.360
but they would have to be also authenticated and labeled as such. There's too much. There's too

03:08:39.360 --> 03:08:44.560
much value in that, you know, like friendships with AI systems, there's too much meaningful

03:08:44.560 --> 03:08:49.200
human experiences to have with AI systems that I just. But that's like a tool, right? It's a bit

03:08:49.200 --> 03:08:52.960
like a meditation tool, right? Some people have a meditation tool, it makes them feel better.

03:08:52.960 --> 03:08:58.560
But I'm not sure you can ascribe sentience and legal rights to a chat bot that makes you feel

03:08:58.560 --> 03:09:06.080
less lonely. Sentience, yes. I think legal rights, no. I think it's the same. You can have a really

03:09:06.080 --> 03:09:13.440
deep, meaningful relationship with a dog. With a dog sentient? Yes. The chat bot's not,

03:09:13.440 --> 03:09:15.920
right now, using the technology we use, it's not going to be sentient.

03:09:17.520 --> 03:09:21.600
This is going to be a fun, continued conversation on Twitter that I look forward to.

03:09:24.640 --> 03:09:29.840
Since you've had also, from another place, some debates that were inspired by the

03:09:29.840 --> 03:09:38.640
Assembly Theory paper, let me ask you about God. Is there any room for notions of God in

03:09:38.640 --> 03:09:48.720
Assembly Theory? Who's God? Yeah, I don't know what God is. I mean, so God exists in our mind,

03:09:48.720 --> 03:09:54.560
created by selection. So the human beings have created the concept of God in the same way that

03:09:54.560 --> 03:09:59.280
human beings have created the concept of superintelligence. Sure. But does it mean,

03:10:02.480 --> 03:10:08.800
it still could mean that that's a projection from the real world, where we're just assigning words

03:10:09.760 --> 03:10:16.640
and concepts to a thing that is fundamental to the real world, that there is something out there

03:10:17.600 --> 03:10:21.120
that is a creative force underlying the universe?

03:10:22.160 --> 03:10:26.320
I think the universe, there is a creative force in the universe, but I don't think

03:10:27.200 --> 03:10:34.080
it's sentient. I mean, I think the, so I do not understand the universe. So who am I to say,

03:10:38.480 --> 03:10:44.960
that God doesn't exist? I am an atheist, but I'm not an angry atheist, right? I have lots of,

03:10:45.920 --> 03:10:48.800
there's some people I know that are angry atheists and say, you know,

03:10:49.920 --> 03:10:55.680
say that religious people are stupid. I don't think that's the case. I have faith in some things,

03:10:55.680 --> 03:10:58.080
because I don't, I mean, when I was a kid, I kept like, you know, I was like,

03:10:59.040 --> 03:11:01.920
I need to know what the charge of electron is. And I'm like, I can't measure the charge of

03:11:01.920 --> 03:11:07.200
electron. That was, you know, I just gave up and had faith. Okay. You know, resistors worked. So

03:11:07.200 --> 03:11:14.320
when it comes to, I want to know why the universe is growing in the future and what humanity is

03:11:14.320 --> 03:11:22.080
going to become. And I've seen that the, the acquisition of knowledge via the generation of

03:11:22.080 --> 03:11:27.920
novelty to produce technology has uniformly made humans lives better. I would love to continue

03:11:27.920 --> 03:11:35.120
that tradition. And you said that there's that creative force. Do you, do you think just to

03:11:35.120 --> 03:11:39.600
think on that point, do you think there's a creative force? Like, is there like a thing,

03:11:39.600 --> 03:11:47.920
like a driver that's like, that's creating stuff? Yeah, I think that, so I think that,

03:11:48.640 --> 03:11:52.560
and where, what can you describe it like mathematically? Well, I think selection,

03:11:52.560 --> 03:11:57.600
I think selection is the force. Selection is the force in the universe. It creates novelty.

03:11:58.640 --> 03:12:05.840
So is selection somehow fundamental? Like what? Yeah, I think persistence of objects that could

03:12:05.840 --> 03:12:11.680
decay into nothing through operations that maintain that structure. I mean, think about it.

03:12:11.680 --> 03:12:17.200
If, it's amazing that things exist at all, that we're just not a big commentarial mess.

03:12:17.200 --> 03:12:21.840
Yes. So the fact that- And exist, a thing that exists,

03:12:21.840 --> 03:12:29.840
persists in time. Yeah. I mean, let's think maybe the universe is actually in the present,

03:12:29.840 --> 03:12:33.680
the things, everything that can exist in the present does exist.

03:12:35.840 --> 03:12:44.240
Well, that would mean it's deterministic, right? No, I think the universities might,

03:12:44.240 --> 03:12:48.480
so the universe started super small, the past was deterministic, there wasn't much going on,

03:12:48.480 --> 03:12:56.080
and it was able to mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. And so the process, I mean, is somehow generating,

03:12:57.920 --> 03:13:02.560
universe is basically, I can't put, I'm trying to put this into words. Did you just say there's no

03:13:02.560 --> 03:13:06.240
free will though? No, I didn't say that. As if-

03:13:06.240 --> 03:13:11.920
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I said there is free will. I think, I'm saying that free will

03:13:13.280 --> 03:13:18.560
occurs at the boundary between the present- The past and the future.

03:13:18.560 --> 03:13:23.920
The past and the future. Yeah, I got you. But everything that can exist does exist.

03:13:23.920 --> 03:13:30.400
Everything that is, so everything that's possible to exist at this, so no, I'm really-

03:13:30.400 --> 03:13:35.920
There's a lot of loaded words there. There's a time element loaded into that statement.

03:13:35.920 --> 03:13:39.920
I think that the universe is able to do what it can in the present, right?

03:13:39.920 --> 03:13:41.520
Yeah. And then I think in the future,

03:13:41.520 --> 03:13:44.640
there are other things that could be possible. We can imagine lots of things, but they don't all

03:13:44.640 --> 03:13:50.080
happen. Sure. That's where you sneak in free will right there.

03:13:50.080 --> 03:13:58.640
Yeah. So I guess what I'm saying is what exists is a convolution of the past with the present and

03:13:58.640 --> 03:14:02.480
the free will going into the future. But we can still imagine stuff, right?

03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:03.840
Yeah. We can imagine stuff that will never happen.

03:14:03.840 --> 03:14:09.120
And it's an amazing force because you're imagining- This is the most important thing

03:14:09.120 --> 03:14:16.720
that we don't understand is our imaginations can actually change the future in a tangible way,

03:14:16.720 --> 03:14:22.000
which is what the initial conditions in physics cannot predict. Your imagination

03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:26.080
has a causal consequence in the future. Isn't that weird too?

03:14:26.800 --> 03:14:35.760
Yeah. It breaks the laws of physics as we know them right now.

03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:40.960
Yeah. So you think the imagination has a causal effect on the future.

03:14:41.920 --> 03:14:46.640
But it does exist in there, in the head. And there must be a lot of power in whatever's

03:14:46.640 --> 03:14:49.600
going on. There could be a lot of power, whatever's going on in there.

03:14:50.720 --> 03:14:56.000
If we then go back to the initial conditions, and it's simply not possible that can happen,

03:14:56.400 --> 03:15:02.640
but if we go into a universe where we accept that there is a finite ability to represent

03:15:02.640 --> 03:15:09.520
numbers and you have- We're not rounding errors. What happens, your ability to make decisions,

03:15:09.520 --> 03:15:15.360
imagine and do stuff is at that interface between the certain and the uncertain.

03:15:15.360 --> 03:15:20.960
It's not as Yasha was saying to me, randomness goes and you just randomly do random stuff.

03:15:20.960 --> 03:15:24.960
It is that you are set free a little on your trajectory.

03:15:24.960 --> 03:15:31.120
Free will is about being able to explore on this narrow trajectory that allows you to build.

03:15:31.120 --> 03:15:36.480
You have a choice about what you build or that choice is you interacting with a future in the

03:15:36.480 --> 03:15:44.880
present. What to you is most beautiful about this whole thing? The universe.

03:15:45.280 --> 03:15:52.880
The fact that it seems to be very undecided, very open. The fact that

03:15:55.280 --> 03:15:59.200
every time I think I'm getting towards an answer to a question, there are so many more questions

03:15:59.200 --> 03:16:05.360
that make the chase. Do you hate that it's going to be over at some point?

03:16:06.640 --> 03:16:13.040
Well, for me, I think if you think about it, is it over for Newton now?

03:16:15.440 --> 03:16:18.560
Newton has had causal consequences in the future. We discuss him all the time.

03:16:18.560 --> 03:16:20.080
His ideas, but not the person.

03:16:21.120 --> 03:16:24.560
The person just had a lot of causal power when he was alive, but oh my God,

03:16:24.560 --> 03:16:28.080
one of the things I want to do is leave as many Easter eggs in the future when I'm gone to go,

03:16:28.080 --> 03:16:35.040
oh, that's cool. Would you be very upset if somebody made like a good large language model

03:16:35.040 --> 03:16:38.960
that's fine tuned to Lee Connor? It would be quite boring because I mean-

03:16:40.800 --> 03:16:43.840
Novelty generation? I mean, if it's a faithful

03:16:43.840 --> 03:16:48.160
representation of what I've done in my life, that's great. That's an interesting artifact,

03:16:48.720 --> 03:16:52.400
but I think the most interesting thing about knowing each other is we don't know what we're

03:16:52.400 --> 03:17:01.520
going to do next. I mean, within some constraints, I can predict some things about you, you can

03:17:01.520 --> 03:17:07.040
predict some things about me, but we can't predict everything. Because we can't predict

03:17:07.040 --> 03:17:13.760
everything is why we're excited to come back and discuss and see it. So yeah, I'm kind of happy

03:17:13.760 --> 03:17:19.920
that it will be interesting that some things that I've done can be captured, but I'm pretty sure that

03:17:19.920 --> 03:17:27.040
my angle on mining novelty from the future will not be captured.

03:17:28.080 --> 03:17:36.720
Yeah. That's what life is. It's just some novelty generation and then you're done.

03:17:37.040 --> 03:17:43.120
Each one of us just generate a little bit, or have the capacity to at least.

03:17:43.120 --> 03:17:52.480
I think life is a selection produces life and life affects the universe. Universes with life

03:17:52.480 --> 03:17:57.680
in them are materially and physically fundamentally different than universes without life. And that's

03:17:57.680 --> 03:18:03.600
super interesting. And I have no beginnings of understanding. I think maybe this is like in a

03:18:03.600 --> 03:18:08.240
thousand years, there'll be a new discipline in humans. Yeah, of course, this is how it all works.

03:18:10.000 --> 03:18:12.240
In retrospect, it will all be obvious, I think.

03:18:13.360 --> 03:18:16.720
I think assembly theory is obvious. That's why a lot of people got angry, right? They were like,

03:18:16.720 --> 03:18:23.520
oh my God, this is such nonsense. And like, oh, actually it's not quite, but the writing's really

03:18:23.520 --> 03:18:32.080
bad. Well, I can't wait to see where it evolves. Lee, and I'm glad I get to exist in this universe

03:18:32.080 --> 03:18:36.160
with you. You're a fascinating human. This is always a pleasure. I hope to talk to you

03:18:36.160 --> 03:18:42.960
many more, many more times. And I'm a huge fan of just watching you create stuff in this world.

03:18:42.960 --> 03:18:46.640
And thank you for talking to me. It's a pleasure as always, Lex. Thanks for having me on.

03:18:47.680 --> 03:18:51.440
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Lee Cronin. To support this podcast,

03:18:51.440 --> 03:18:56.240
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Carl

03:18:56.240 --> 03:19:02.720
Sagan who can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers,

03:19:03.440 --> 03:19:08.160
our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good.

03:19:08.960 --> 03:19:11.840
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
