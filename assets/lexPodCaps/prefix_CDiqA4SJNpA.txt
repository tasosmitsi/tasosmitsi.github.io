00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
The following is a conversation with Robert Cruz,

00:02.640 --> 00:04.440
a historian at Stanford,

00:04.440 --> 00:09.440
specializing in the history of Afghanistan, Russia, and Islam.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.040
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:12.040 --> 00:14.040
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:14.040 --> 00:15.240
in the description.

00:15.240 --> 00:19.000
And now, here's my conversation with Robert Cruz.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.120
Was it a mistake for the United States

00:22.120 --> 00:25.920
to invade Afghanistan in 2001, 20 years ago?

00:25.920 --> 00:27.440
Yes.

00:27.480 --> 00:30.480
As simple as yes, why was it a mistake?

00:30.480 --> 00:33.720
I'm a historian, so I say this with some humility

00:33.720 --> 00:35.120
about what we can know.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.720
I think I'd still like to know much more

00:36.720 --> 00:39.080
about what was going on in the White House

00:39.080 --> 00:42.200
in the hours, days, weeks after 9-11.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.360
But I think the George W. Bush administration

00:45.360 --> 00:47.040
acted in a state of panic,

00:47.040 --> 00:49.080
and I think they wanted to show toughness.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.880
They wanted to show some kind of resolve.

00:51.880 --> 00:55.120
This was a horrific act that played out

00:55.120 --> 00:57.320
on everyone's television screens,

00:58.160 --> 01:00.000
and I think it was really fundamentally

01:00.000 --> 01:02.160
a crisis of legitimacy within the White House

01:02.160 --> 01:03.920
that they've lost, and I think they felt like

01:03.920 --> 01:07.080
they had to do something and something dramatic.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.320
I think they didn't really think through

01:09.320 --> 01:12.360
who they were fighting, who the enemy was,

01:12.360 --> 01:15.120
what this geography had to do with 9-11.

01:15.120 --> 01:17.680
I think looking back at it, I mean, some of us,

01:17.680 --> 01:20.320
not to say I was clairvoyant or could see into the future,

01:20.320 --> 01:22.880
but I think many of us were, from that morning,

01:22.880 --> 01:24.800
skeptical about the connections that people were drawing

01:25.000 --> 01:27.600
of Afghanistan as a state, as a place,

01:27.600 --> 01:30.200
and the actions of Al-Qaeda in Washington

01:30.200 --> 01:33.000
and New York and Pennsylvania.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.920
So as you watch the events of 9-11,

01:35.920 --> 01:40.280
the things that our leaders were saying

01:40.280 --> 01:44.760
in the minutes, hours, days, weeks that followed,

01:44.760 --> 01:47.760
maybe you can give a little bit of a timeline

01:47.760 --> 01:49.720
of what was being said.

01:49.720 --> 01:52.400
One was the actual invasion of Afghanistan,

01:52.440 --> 01:55.400
and also what were your feelings

01:55.400 --> 01:59.440
in the minutes, weeks after 9-11?

01:59.440 --> 02:04.200
I was in D.C., I was on the way to American University,

02:04.200 --> 02:07.280
hearing on NPR what had happened,

02:07.280 --> 02:10.600
and I thought of the American University logo,

02:10.600 --> 02:13.000
which is red, white, and blue, it's an eagle,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.440
and I thought Washington is under attack,

02:15.440 --> 02:18.680
and symbols of American power are under attack.

02:18.720 --> 02:21.000
And so I was quite concerned,

02:21.000 --> 02:24.800
and at the time lived just a few miles from the capital.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.400
And so I felt that it was real.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.280
So I appreciate the sense of anxiety and fear and panic,

02:32.280 --> 02:35.360
and four, two, three years later in D.C.,

02:35.360 --> 02:38.680
we were constantly getting reports, mostly rumors,

02:38.680 --> 02:40.840
and unconfirmed about all kinds of attacks

02:40.840 --> 02:41.680
that would befall the city.

02:41.680 --> 02:46.240
So I definitely appreciate the sense of being under assault.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.280
But in watching television,

02:47.280 --> 02:48.680
including Russian television that day,

02:48.680 --> 02:51.240
because I just installed a satellite thing,

02:51.240 --> 02:52.480
so I was trying to watch world news

02:52.480 --> 02:53.320
and get different points of view,

02:53.320 --> 02:55.680
and that was quite useful to have

02:55.680 --> 02:57.400
an alternative set of eyes.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.240
In Russian?

02:58.240 --> 02:59.440
Yeah, in Russian, yeah.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.520
Okay, so your Russian is good enough

03:01.520 --> 03:03.200
to understand Russian television.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.600
The news, yeah, the news and the visuals that were coming

03:05.600 --> 03:07.960
that were not shown on American television.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.360
I don't know how they had it, but they had,

03:09.360 --> 03:11.400
they were not filtering anything

03:11.400 --> 03:13.160
in the way that the major networks

03:13.160 --> 03:14.560
and cable televisions were doing here.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.000
So it was a very unvarnished view

03:17.760 --> 03:19.440
of the violence of the moment in New York City,

03:19.440 --> 03:21.600
of people diving from the towers,

03:21.600 --> 03:24.480
and it was really, they didn't hold back on that,

03:24.480 --> 03:26.320
which was quite fascinating.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.600
I think much of the world saw much more

03:27.600 --> 03:29.920
than actually the American public saw.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.800
But to your question, amid that feeling of imminent doom,

03:33.800 --> 03:36.880
I watched commentators start to talk about al-Qaeda

03:36.880 --> 03:39.120
and then talk about Afghanistan.

03:39.120 --> 03:42.920
And one of the experts was Barnett Rubin,

03:42.920 --> 03:46.840
who's at NYU, who's kind of long, very learned.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.720
Afghanistan hand, and he's brought on Peter Jennings

03:49.720 --> 03:52.800
on ABC News to kind of lay this out for everyone.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.320
And I thought, you know, he did a fine job,

03:55.320 --> 03:57.920
but I think it was formative in submitting the view

03:57.920 --> 04:00.160
that somehow al-Qaeda was synonymous

04:00.160 --> 04:02.040
with this space, Afghanistan.

04:02.040 --> 04:06.240
And I think, again, I was no al-Qaeda expert then,

04:06.240 --> 04:09.160
and I'm not now, but I think my immediate thought

04:09.160 --> 04:13.720
went to war, and because my background had been with,

04:13.720 --> 04:15.840
at that point, mostly Afghans who had been displaced

04:15.840 --> 04:19.080
from decades of war, whom I encountered in Uzbekistan,

04:19.080 --> 04:20.920
who were refugees and so on,

04:20.920 --> 04:24.080
I thought immediately my mind went to the suffering

04:24.080 --> 04:28.240
of Afghan people, that this war was going to sweep up,

04:28.240 --> 04:30.000
of course, the defenseless people

04:30.000 --> 04:31.400
who have nothing to do with these politics.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.320
So we should give maybe a little bit of context

04:33.320 --> 04:35.240
that you can speak to.

04:35.240 --> 04:38.240
So assume nobody's an expert at anything.

04:38.240 --> 04:43.240
So let's just say you and I are not experts at anything.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.440
What, as a historian, were you studying at the time

04:46.440 --> 04:47.280
and thinking about?

04:47.280 --> 04:52.280
Say, is it the full global history of Afghanistan?

04:53.760 --> 04:55.480
Is it the region?

04:55.480 --> 04:58.960
Were you thinking about the Mujahideen

04:58.960 --> 05:01.760
and al-Qaeda and Taliban?

05:01.760 --> 05:04.200
Were you thinking about the Soviet Union,

05:04.200 --> 05:06.640
the proxy war through Afghanistan?

05:06.640 --> 05:09.120
Were you thinking about Iraq and oil?

05:09.120 --> 05:12.080
Like, what's the full space of things

05:12.080 --> 05:14.360
in your heart, in your mind at the time?

05:14.360 --> 05:15.200
I mean, just at the moment, of course,

05:15.200 --> 05:18.880
it was just the sense of the suffering

05:18.880 --> 05:21.440
and the tragedy of the moment of the deaths.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.360
And that was, I think, I was preoccupied

05:23.360 --> 05:25.400
by the violence at the moment.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.560
But as the conversation turned to Afghanistan

05:28.560 --> 05:31.320
as a kind of theater, to somehow respond to this moment,

05:31.320 --> 05:33.440
I think immediately what came to mind was that

05:33.440 --> 05:34.640
little I knew about al-Qaeda at the time

05:34.640 --> 05:38.120
suggested that the geography was inaccurate,

05:38.120 --> 05:41.360
that this was a global network, a global threat,

05:41.360 --> 05:44.080
that this was a kind of a movement

05:44.080 --> 05:45.240
that went beyond borders.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.240
And I think that it felt early on

05:47.240 --> 05:50.520
that Afghanistan was gonna be used as a scapegoat.

05:50.520 --> 05:51.680
And just intellectually, at the time,

05:51.680 --> 05:53.000
I was teaching at American University.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.360
My courses touched on a range of subjects,

05:56.360 --> 05:59.360
but I was trying to complete a book on Islam

05:59.360 --> 06:01.240
and the Russian Empire, actually.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.080
But in doing that research, which took me across Russia

06:04.080 --> 06:06.560
and Central Asia, purely by accident,

06:06.560 --> 06:08.560
I had developed an interest in Afghanistan

06:08.560 --> 06:12.760
because, again, a series of coincidences,

06:12.760 --> 06:15.320
I found myself in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan,

06:15.320 --> 06:18.000
without housing, through an American friend

06:18.000 --> 06:20.200
who was the king of the market in Tashkent.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.440
He knew everyone.

06:21.440 --> 06:24.440
He ran into some Afghan merchants there.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.800
They found out I didn't have a place to live.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.280
I didn't know where Afghanistan was, honestly.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.360
This was 1997.

06:29.360 --> 06:30.600
I had a vague idea it was next door.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.200
Well, you lived in Uzbekistan?

06:32.200 --> 06:34.400
Yeah, in Tashkent, doing decision research.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.560
Yeah, because it was a hub of the Russian Empire

06:36.560 --> 06:37.920
in Central Asia.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.280
So just by accident, I ended up with these young Afghans

06:40.280 --> 06:42.760
who took me in as roommates.

06:42.760 --> 06:46.280
And then I think that the sense of that community

06:46.280 --> 06:48.520
shaped my idea of what Afghanistan is.

06:48.520 --> 06:51.200
It was my first exposure to them.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.520
They were part of a trading diaspora.

06:53.520 --> 06:57.480
They had brought matches from Riga, Latvia.

06:57.480 --> 07:00.000
They had somehow brought blower

07:00.000 --> 07:02.840
and some agricultural products from Egypt.

07:02.840 --> 07:06.520
And they were sitting in closed containers in Tashkent,

07:06.560 --> 07:10.200
waiting for the Uzbekistani state to permit them to trade.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.960
So these guys are mostly hanging out during the day.

07:11.960 --> 07:12.880
They would get dressed up.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.240
They'd put on suits and ties like you're wearing.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.520
They'd polish their shoes.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.720
Then they would sit around offices,

07:18.720 --> 07:21.840
drink tea, pistachios.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.320
Then they'd feast at lunch.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.200
And then at night, we would go out.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.840
So part of my research,

07:26.840 --> 07:28.240
because I also had a bottleneck in my research,

07:28.240 --> 07:31.920
I was going to the state archives in Tashkent.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.240
And because of the state of Uzbekistan,

07:34.240 --> 07:36.560
that was a very kind of suspicious thing to do.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.200
So it took a while to get in.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.640
So I had downtime in Tashkent, just like these guys.

07:41.640 --> 07:42.840
So I got to know them pretty well.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.920
And it was really just an accidental kind of thing,

07:45.920 --> 07:47.640
but grew quite close to them.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.440
And I developed an appreciation of,

07:50.520 --> 07:51.560
which now I think, again,

07:51.560 --> 07:53.280
thinking of the seeds of all this,

07:53.280 --> 07:55.800
these people had already lived,

07:55.800 --> 07:57.280
young guys in their 20s,

07:57.280 --> 07:59.880
they'd already lived in six or seven countries.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.080
They all spoke half a dozen languages.

08:02.280 --> 08:03.120
One of my best friends there

08:03.120 --> 08:07.280
had been a kickboxer and break dancer,

08:07.280 --> 08:08.240
trained in Tehran.

08:08.240 --> 08:11.240
His father was a theater person in Afghanistan.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.480
He told stories of escaping death in Afghanistan

08:14.480 --> 08:15.920
during the civil war,

08:15.920 --> 08:18.640
going to Uzbekistan, escaping death there.

08:18.640 --> 08:21.200
And these were very real stories.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.920
Can you also just briefly mention,

08:23.920 --> 08:25.880
geographically speaking,

08:25.880 --> 08:28.720
Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,

08:28.720 --> 08:30.240
you mentioned Iran.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.720
What, who are the neighbors of all of this?

08:32.720 --> 08:35.240
What are we supposed to be thinking about for people?

08:35.240 --> 08:38.840
I was always terrible at geography and spatial information.

08:38.840 --> 08:39.960
So can you lay it out?

08:39.960 --> 08:41.000
Yeah, sure, sure.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.320
So Tashkent is the capital of Uzbekistan.

08:44.320 --> 08:49.320
It was a hub of Russian imperial power in the 19th century.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.480
The Russians take the city from a local

08:52.480 --> 08:55.400
kind of Muslim dynasty in 1865.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.640
It becomes the city,

08:56.880 --> 09:01.800
the kind of hub of Soviet power in Central Asia after 1917.

09:01.800 --> 09:06.800
It becomes the center of the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan,

09:06.840 --> 09:09.240
which becomes independent finally in 1991

09:09.240 --> 09:10.760
when the Soviet Union collapses.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.040
So these are all like,

09:12.040 --> 09:15.720
these republics are the fingertips

09:15.720 --> 09:18.440
of Soviet power in Central Asia.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.360
That's right.

09:19.360 --> 09:22.400
And they've been independent since 1991,

09:22.400 --> 09:25.600
but they have struggled to disentangle themselves

09:25.600 --> 09:28.360
from Moscow, from one another.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.440
And now they face very serious pressure from China

09:31.440 --> 09:35.000
to form a kind of periphery of the great machine

09:35.000 --> 09:36.320
that is the Chinese economy

09:36.320 --> 09:39.760
and its ambitions to stretch across Asia.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.680
For Afghanistan, where my roommates, my friends hailed from,

09:45.720 --> 09:50.720
Afghanistan had fallen into civil war in the late 1970s

09:51.600 --> 09:54.760
when leftists tried to seize power there in 1978.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.480
The Soviet Union then extended from Uzbekistan,

09:58.480 --> 10:01.680
crossing the border with its forces in 1979

10:01.680 --> 10:03.720
to try to shore up this leftist government

10:03.720 --> 10:06.440
that had seized power in 1978.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.880
And so for Central Asians in the wider region,

10:11.080 --> 10:14.000
their fate had for some decades been tied to Afghanistan

10:14.000 --> 10:15.120
in a variety of ways,

10:15.120 --> 10:18.440
but it became much more connected in 1980s

10:18.440 --> 10:23.360
when the Soviet Red Army occupied Afghanistan for 10 years.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.160
And here I refer your listeners and viewers

10:25.160 --> 10:28.680
to Rambo III as the guide to-

10:28.680 --> 10:32.400
The historically accurate guide to the occupation of-

10:32.400 --> 10:34.520
The Bible of African history in Rambo III, yeah.

10:34.520 --> 10:39.400
As a fantastic window onto the American view of the war.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.880
But for most Afghans,

10:40.880 --> 10:44.200
there are people who fought against the Soviet army.

10:44.200 --> 10:48.000
But of a certain generation, the guys I knew,

10:49.280 --> 10:50.920
their mission was to survive.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.480
And so they fled in waves,

10:53.480 --> 10:56.760
by the millions to Pakistan, to Iran,

10:56.760 --> 11:00.560
somewhat north into Soviet Central Asia later in the 1990s.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.280
And some were displaced across the planet.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.000
So California, where we're sitting today,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.400
has a large community that came

11:06.400 --> 11:09.760
in the 80s and 90s in the East Bay.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.800
Can I ask a quick question that's a little bit of attention?

11:12.800 --> 11:14.000
Yeah.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.800
What is the correct or the respectful way

11:17.800 --> 11:22.800
to pronounce Afghanistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iran?

11:25.920 --> 11:28.680
So as a Russian speaker, Afghanistan.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.080
Yeah.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.440
The an versus the an.

11:32.440 --> 11:33.280
Yeah.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.760
Is it a different country by country?

11:34.760 --> 11:37.200
As an English speaker in America,

11:37.200 --> 11:41.440
is it pretentious and disrespectful to say Afghanistan?

11:41.440 --> 11:44.480
Or is it the opposite, respectful to say it that way?

11:44.480 --> 11:45.640
What are your thoughts on this?

11:45.640 --> 11:47.280
That's a fascinating question.

11:47.320 --> 11:50.280
I defer to the people from those countries

11:50.280 --> 11:52.680
to of course sort out those politics.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.600
I think one of the fascinating things

11:54.600 --> 11:56.160
about the region broadly is that it is a place

11:56.160 --> 12:00.120
of so many cultures and really quite cosmopolitan.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.080
So I think people are mostly quite forgiving

12:02.080 --> 12:04.600
about how you say Afghanistan, Afghanistan.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.920
It's not like Paris.

12:05.920 --> 12:06.760
Yeah, right, right.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.960
The French are not forgiving.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.240
No, no, exactly.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.760
I think people are very, very forgiving.

12:10.760 --> 12:15.760
And I think that Iranians are a bit more instructive

12:16.560 --> 12:20.160
in suggesting Iran rather than Iran, right?

12:20.160 --> 12:25.080
Iraq, Iraq, I think there's gonna be a fit

12:25.080 --> 12:27.560
between certain ways of pronouncing these places

12:27.560 --> 12:31.080
and the position that Americans take about them, right?

12:31.080 --> 12:36.080
So it's more jarring when people say Iraq

12:36.320 --> 12:41.320
and it comes with a claim that a certain kind of person

12:41.600 --> 12:43.560
should be the victim of violence or.

12:43.560 --> 12:44.400
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.080
It's kind of like talking about the Democratic Party

12:47.080 --> 12:48.480
or the Democrat Party.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.760
It's sometimes using certain kind of terminology

12:51.760 --> 12:56.760
to make a little bit of a sort of implied statement

12:57.760 --> 12:58.720
about your beliefs.

12:58.720 --> 12:59.560
It's fascinating.

12:59.560 --> 13:02.680
Yeah, I mean, I think when I hear Iraq and Iran,

13:02.680 --> 13:04.880
I mean, I think it, yeah, is it intentional

13:04.880 --> 13:07.280
in the case of a Democrat or is it just a,

13:07.280 --> 13:08.120
you know, and it's a whatever.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.960
I think, again, I think most Iranians and Afghans

13:09.960 --> 13:12.920
people I know have been very cool about that.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.520
What annoys Afghans now, I can say,

13:15.520 --> 13:16.920
I think it's fair to say, I don't mean to speak

13:16.920 --> 13:20.200
for mainstream people, entire group of people,

13:20.200 --> 13:23.360
but I can just share with our non-Afghan friends.

13:24.480 --> 13:28.680
The term Afghani is a kind of term of offense

13:28.680 --> 13:30.000
because that's the name of the currency.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.480
And so lots of people ask, you know, why having,

13:34.480 --> 13:36.680
especially, again, it's more directed at Americans

13:36.680 --> 13:39.360
because we've been so deeply involved in that country

13:39.360 --> 13:41.040
obviously for the last 20 years, right?

13:41.040 --> 13:43.440
So Afghans ask why after 20 years

13:43.440 --> 13:45.400
are you still calling us the wrong name?

13:45.400 --> 13:46.560
What is the right name?

13:46.560 --> 13:47.400
Or somebody-

13:47.400 --> 13:48.520
They prefer Afghans.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.360
Afghans.

13:49.360 --> 13:52.240
Yeah, and Afghani is the name of the currency.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.080
And so-

13:53.080 --> 13:54.080
I just dodged a bullet

13:54.080 --> 13:54.920
because I was going to say Afghanis.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.120
That's cool, no, no, yeah, I hear you.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.360
That's really great to know.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.440
Yeah, yeah, and it's, again, I think,

13:59.440 --> 14:01.840
but I would emphasize that people are quite open

14:01.840 --> 14:06.280
and, you know, it's a whole region of incredible diversity

14:06.280 --> 14:09.920
and respect for linguistic pluralism, actually.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.280
So I think that, you know,

14:11.280 --> 14:14.320
but I also appreciate that during, in this context,

14:14.320 --> 14:16.200
when there's a lot of pain, you know,

14:16.200 --> 14:18.920
in the Afghan diaspora community in particular,

14:18.920 --> 14:22.080
you know, being called the wrong name after 20 years

14:22.080 --> 14:24.880
when they already feel so betrayed at this moment,

14:24.880 --> 14:25.840
you know, just kind of,

14:25.840 --> 14:28.040
if one follows us on social media,

14:28.040 --> 14:32.240
that is one kind of hot wire, right?

14:32.240 --> 14:35.480
Yeah, so the reason I ask about pronunciation

14:35.480 --> 14:37.440
is because, yes, it is true

14:37.440 --> 14:39.960
that there are certain things when mispronounced

14:39.960 --> 14:42.880
kind of reveal that you don't care enough

14:42.880 --> 14:44.400
to pronounce correctly.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.120
So you don't know enough to pronounce correctly

14:47.120 --> 14:49.840
and you dismiss the culture and the people,

14:49.840 --> 14:52.280
which I think, as per your writing,

14:52.280 --> 14:57.240
is something that, if it's okay, I'll go with Afghanistan

14:57.240 --> 14:58.520
just because I'm used to it.

14:58.520 --> 15:01.600
I say Iraq, Iran, but I say Afghanistan.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.960
Yeah, that's great.

15:02.960 --> 15:05.000
As you do in your writing,

15:05.040 --> 15:07.440
Afghanistan suffers from much misunderstanding

15:07.440 --> 15:08.720
from the rest of the world.

15:08.720 --> 15:13.720
But back to our discussion of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,

15:13.880 --> 15:17.680
the whole region that gives us context

15:17.680 --> 15:18.960
for the events of 9-11.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.400
Right, right.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.680
So yeah, if we go back to that day

15:21.680 --> 15:23.960
and the weeks that followed,

15:23.960 --> 15:26.560
in my mind went to the community I knew in Tashkent,

15:28.120 --> 15:28.960
which was interesting.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.840
I mean, they were, so Islam was the focal point

15:31.840 --> 15:34.120
of our conversation in the US about 9-11, right?

15:34.120 --> 15:36.320
Everyone wanted to know what was the relationship

15:36.320 --> 15:39.920
between this horrific violence and that religious tradition

15:39.920 --> 15:44.920
with its 1 billion plus followers across the globe, right?

15:45.240 --> 15:47.040
That became the issue, of course,

15:47.040 --> 15:49.480
for American security institutions,

15:49.480 --> 15:53.520
for local state and police institutions, right?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.640
I mean, it became the, I think it was the question

15:55.640 --> 15:56.760
that most Americans had on their minds.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.840
So again, I didn't imagine myself as someone

15:59.840 --> 16:00.920
who had all the answers, of course,

16:00.920 --> 16:03.720
but given my background and coming at this

16:03.720 --> 16:06.920
from Russian history, coming at this from studying empire

16:06.920 --> 16:09.960
and trying to think about the region broadly,

16:09.960 --> 16:10.800
you know, I was very alarmed

16:10.800 --> 16:12.920
at the way that the conversation went.

16:12.920 --> 16:13.960
Can I ask you a question?

16:13.960 --> 16:18.960
What was your feeling on that morning of 9-11?

16:19.200 --> 16:20.320
Who did this?

16:20.320 --> 16:22.560
Isn't that a natural feeling?

16:22.560 --> 16:25.720
It's coupled with fear of what's next,

16:25.720 --> 16:28.760
especially when you're in DC, but also who is this?

16:28.760 --> 16:30.360
Is this an accident?

16:30.360 --> 16:32.120
Is this a deliberate terrorist attack?

16:32.160 --> 16:35.000
Is this domestic?

16:35.000 --> 16:37.480
What were your thoughts of the options

16:37.480 --> 16:41.080
and the internal ranking given here at expertise?

16:41.080 --> 16:44.080
I mean, I suppose I was taken by the narrative

16:44.080 --> 16:46.440
that this was international.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.960
I mean, I'd also lived in New York

16:47.960 --> 16:50.800
during one of the first bombings in 94

16:50.800 --> 16:52.280
of the World Trade Center.

16:52.280 --> 16:53.960
So it was clear to me that a radical community

16:53.960 --> 16:58.320
had really fixed New York as part of their imagination of,

16:58.320 --> 17:01.640
and I immediately thought it was a kind of

17:02.960 --> 17:04.360
blow to American power.

17:04.360 --> 17:08.800
And I was drawn by the symbolism of it.

17:08.800 --> 17:09.720
If you think of it as an act,

17:09.720 --> 17:13.160
it was a kind of an act of speech, if you will,

17:13.160 --> 17:16.880
a kind of a way of speaking to,

17:16.880 --> 17:18.600
from a position of relative weakness,

17:18.600 --> 17:21.480
speaking to an imperial power.

17:21.480 --> 17:25.800
And I saw it as a kind of symbolic speech act of that

17:25.800 --> 17:29.040
with horrific real world consequences

17:29.040 --> 17:31.000
for all those innocent victims,

17:31.000 --> 17:32.080
for the firing of the police,

17:32.080 --> 17:34.640
and just the horror of the moment.

17:35.680 --> 17:39.720
So I did see it as transcending the United States,

17:39.720 --> 17:42.880
but I did not see it as really having anything necessarily

17:42.880 --> 17:45.440
to do fundamentally about Afghanistan

17:45.440 --> 17:48.080
and the history of the region that I'd been studying

17:48.080 --> 17:49.840
and the community people that I knew

17:49.840 --> 17:52.000
who were not particularly religious, right?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.280
The guys I hung out with actually wore me out

17:54.280 --> 17:56.200
because they wanted to go out every night.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.720
They wanted to party every night.

17:57.720 --> 17:58.560
We had-

17:58.560 --> 17:59.380
Drinking?

17:59.380 --> 18:00.220
Yep.

18:00.220 --> 18:01.060
We had discussions about alcohol.

18:01.060 --> 18:02.720
I mean Uzbekistan is famous for its-

18:02.720 --> 18:03.560
Drinking.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.400
It's drinking.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.240
You know, it's-

18:05.240 --> 18:06.080
That's something to look forward to.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.120
So I do want to travel to that part of the world.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.480
When was the last time you were in that part of the world?

18:11.480 --> 18:12.800
Early 2000s.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.920
Well, in the mid-2000s, 2010s.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.560
So wait, so by the way, we're drinking vodka.

18:17.560 --> 18:20.120
What's the, what's the weapon of choice?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.400
Uzbekistan has incorporated vodka

18:23.160 --> 18:25.180
as the choice.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.320
And that, and it informs, you know, and it's,

18:28.320 --> 18:29.640
but the fascinating thing, you know,

18:29.640 --> 18:32.600
as a student is what you're observing as a non-Muslim.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.280
You know, I'm a non-Russian.

18:34.280 --> 18:38.880
I'm, this is all, you know, culturally new to me.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.880
And I'm, you know, a student of all that, right?

18:40.880 --> 18:42.600
As a grad student doing my work there.

18:42.600 --> 18:45.360
So you're like Jane Goodall of vodka in Russia.

18:45.360 --> 18:46.200
That's right.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.020
Just observing.

18:47.020 --> 18:47.860
That's right.

18:47.860 --> 18:48.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.480
And then you get the, you get the Samogon,

18:50.480 --> 18:52.080
the grass vodka, you get, you know,

18:53.040 --> 18:56.680
I've had some long nights on the Kazakhstan frontier

18:56.680 --> 19:00.160
that I'm not proud of, you know.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.560
But you got to know the people

19:01.560 --> 19:03.840
and some of them from Kazakhstan.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.400
But intellectually, so the thing, I mean,

19:05.400 --> 19:08.060
the fascinating thing there was that, and just as a,

19:08.060 --> 19:09.960
I mean, there's a whole, you know, I'm a historian, right?

19:09.960 --> 19:14.440
But there are great contributions by, you know,

19:14.440 --> 19:15.920
anthropologists and ethnographers

19:15.920 --> 19:16.960
who've gone across the planet

19:16.960 --> 19:20.000
and tried to understand how Muslims understand the tradition

19:20.000 --> 19:21.600
at different contexts.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.340
So many Uzbeks will say, you know,

19:25.680 --> 19:27.200
this is part of our national culture

19:27.200 --> 19:29.760
to drink and eat as we please, right?

19:29.760 --> 19:31.600
And yet I'm a very devout Muslim.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.900
And so of course you can encounter other Muslim communities

19:34.900 --> 19:37.400
who won't touch alcohol, right?

19:37.400 --> 19:40.120
But it's become kind of, I think it's very much,

19:40.120 --> 19:42.360
you know, Soviet culture left a deep impression

19:42.360 --> 19:43.200
in each of these places.

19:43.200 --> 19:47.400
And so there are ways of thinking, ways of performing,

19:47.400 --> 19:50.520
ways of enjoying oneself that are shared

19:50.520 --> 19:54.680
across Soviet and former Soviet space to this day, right?

19:54.680 --> 19:57.840
And you've written also about Muslims in the Soviet Union.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.160
That's right.

19:59.160 --> 20:02.400
There's an article that there was a paywalls

20:02.400 --> 20:04.960
that couldn't read it and I really want to read it.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.800
Is- Happy to share with you, yeah.

20:06.800 --> 20:10.240
Moscow and the mosque or something like that.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.880
Right, right.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.280
By the way, just another tangent on a tangent.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.120
Yeah.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.320
So I bought all your books.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.160
I love them very much.

20:18.160 --> 20:21.600
One of the reasons I bought them and read many parts

20:21.600 --> 20:24.360
is because they're easy to buy.

20:24.360 --> 20:27.920
Unlike articles, every single website has a paywall.

20:27.920 --> 20:28.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.480
So it's very- I hear you, I'm sorry.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.720
Very frustrating to read brilliant scholars

20:32.720 --> 20:33.560
such as yourself.

20:33.560 --> 20:34.400
No, no, no.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.520
I wish there was one fee I could pay everywhere.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.840
I don't care what that fee is.

20:38.840 --> 20:39.680
Right, right.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.200
Where it just allows me to read

20:41.200 --> 20:42.200
some of your brilliant writing.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.040
No, no, thank you, I hear you.

20:43.040 --> 20:47.360
No, I think moving toward more kind of open source

20:47.400 --> 20:49.160
formatting stuff I think is what a lot of journals

20:49.160 --> 20:51.800
are thinking about now and I think it's definitely

20:51.800 --> 20:54.560
for the kind of democratization of knowledge and scholarship

20:54.560 --> 20:55.960
that's definitely an important thing

20:55.960 --> 20:56.920
that we should all think about.

20:56.920 --> 21:00.400
And I think we need to exert pressure

21:00.400 --> 21:02.000
on these publishers to do that.

21:02.000 --> 21:02.840
So I appreciate that.

21:02.840 --> 21:03.880
This is what I'm doing here.

21:03.880 --> 21:04.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, good, good.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.560
Yeah, no, I appreciate it, appreciate it.

21:06.560 --> 21:11.560
So your thought was Afghanistan is not going to be

21:12.320 --> 21:14.960
the center, the source of where-

21:14.960 --> 21:16.080
It's not the center of this

21:16.080 --> 21:18.760
and evading that country isn't gonna fix

21:18.760 --> 21:22.200
the toxic milestone of politics

21:22.200 --> 21:25.240
that produced 9-11, right?

21:25.240 --> 21:26.560
Again, just thinking of some of the personalities,

21:26.560 --> 21:28.880
just thinking about going back to the Tashkent story

21:28.880 --> 21:29.840
which I'll end with.

21:29.840 --> 21:34.080
I mean, just observing real Muslims doing things

21:34.080 --> 21:35.880
and then asking questions about it

21:35.880 --> 21:39.040
and trying to understand through their eyes

21:39.040 --> 21:40.960
what the tradition means to them.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.720
And then we had a very narrow conversation

21:43.720 --> 21:46.880
about what Islam is that generated,

21:46.880 --> 21:50.120
immediately exploded on the day of 9-11, right?

21:50.120 --> 21:53.080
And then, of course, the antipathy

21:53.080 --> 21:58.000
toward Islam and Muslims was informed by racism,

21:58.000 --> 21:59.920
informed by xenophobia.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.320
So it became a perfect storm, I think,

22:01.320 --> 22:04.920
of demonization that didn't sit with

22:04.920 --> 22:06.200
what I knew about the tradition

22:06.200 --> 22:08.400
and with the actual people that I had known.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.360
Because then going back to, I mean,

22:09.360 --> 22:11.880
there were other friends and encounters and so on,

22:11.880 --> 22:13.280
but just thinking about Afghanistan

22:13.760 --> 22:15.360
and Tashkent for a moment, I mean,

22:15.360 --> 22:18.360
just thought about my friends who had been,

22:18.360 --> 22:20.600
who had suffered a great deal in their short lives,

22:20.600 --> 22:24.680
who had been cast aside from country to country,

22:24.680 --> 22:26.680
but had found a place in Tashkent

22:26.680 --> 22:28.680
with some relative stability.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.000
And they wanted to go out every night.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.720
And they explained, one friend,

22:33.720 --> 22:34.840
we talked about it with the alcohol and all that,

22:34.840 --> 22:37.320
and he didn't get crazy, but he was like,

22:37.320 --> 22:38.960
you can drink, but just don't get drunk.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.400
That's permissible within Islam, right?

22:42.400 --> 22:45.040
And he was, I think Pashtun,

22:45.040 --> 22:47.720
I think Uzbeks had a different view,

22:47.720 --> 22:49.920
often the more vodka, the better,

22:49.920 --> 22:51.920
and it doesn't violate, as I understand Islam.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.160
So even, it's kind of a silly example,

22:54.160 --> 22:56.240
but it's just an illustration of the ways in which

22:56.240 --> 22:58.040
different communities, different generations,

22:58.040 --> 23:00.360
different people could come at this very complex,

23:00.360 --> 23:02.560
rich tradition in so many different ways.

23:02.560 --> 23:06.200
So obviously, whatever kind of scholar you are,

23:06.200 --> 23:08.280
any kind of expert, whatever,

23:08.280 --> 23:11.200
it's always disconcerting to see your field,

23:12.200 --> 23:13.760
be flattened, right?

23:13.760 --> 23:16.520
And then be flattened and then be turned to

23:16.520 --> 23:18.440
arguments for violence, right?

23:18.440 --> 23:23.440
Mixed up with natural human feelings of hate and-

23:23.880 --> 23:25.440
And hurt at that moment, and pain.

23:25.440 --> 23:28.040
So I mean, that day, I vividly remember,

23:28.040 --> 23:32.760
I sat with other PhD historians in different fields.

23:32.760 --> 23:35.720
We, oddly enough, had lunch that day,

23:35.720 --> 23:37.280
and it kind of deserted Washington.

23:37.280 --> 23:38.800
Some place was open, we went.

23:39.760 --> 23:40.600
And we just thought, you know,

23:40.600 --> 23:43.400
this is gonna kind of open up like

23:43.400 --> 23:45.760
a great mall of destruction.

23:45.760 --> 23:50.760
And, you know, the American state is going to destroy,

23:50.960 --> 23:53.760
and it's gonna destroy in this geography.

23:53.760 --> 23:56.520
And I thought that was misplaced for lots of reasons.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.160
And then I think, if one, you know,

23:59.160 --> 24:02.520
I'd been doing some research on Afghanistan then,

24:02.520 --> 24:03.600
I was kind of shifting to the south,

24:03.600 --> 24:08.000
and I'd been looking at the Taliban from afar

24:08.000 --> 24:08.840
for some years.

24:08.840 --> 24:12.040
And, you know, I think it's clear now that,

24:12.040 --> 24:14.080
in retrospect, there were opportunities

24:14.080 --> 24:16.560
for alternative policies at that moment.

24:16.560 --> 24:20.880
So what should the conversation have been like?

24:20.880 --> 24:23.560
What should we have done differently?

24:23.560 --> 24:28.560
Because, you know, from a perspective of the time,

24:28.560 --> 24:33.440
the United States was invaded by a foreign force.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.080
What is the proper response,

24:35.080 --> 24:36.760
or what is the proper conversation

24:36.760 --> 24:39.080
about the proper response at the time, you think?

24:39.080 --> 24:41.320
You know, I know my colleague at Sanford,

24:41.320 --> 24:44.640
Condoleezza Rice, would tell me this is above my pay grade.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.680
And, you know, she makes a point in her classes

24:46.680 --> 24:50.280
to talk about how difficult decision-making is

24:50.280 --> 24:52.240
under such intense pressure.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.920
And I appreciate that.

24:53.920 --> 24:57.440
You know, I am a historian who sits safely in my office.

24:57.440 --> 24:58.760
I don't like battlefields.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.520
I don't like taking risks.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.000
So I can see all those limits.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.320
You know, I'm not a military expert.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.240
I've been accused of being a spy wherever I've gone

25:07.240 --> 25:08.760
because of the way I look and because of my nationality

25:08.760 --> 25:10.360
and so on, but I'm not a spy.

25:10.360 --> 25:11.760
So I defer, you know,

25:11.760 --> 25:13.760
I respect the expertise of all those communities.

25:13.760 --> 25:17.000
But I think they acted out of ignorance.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.720
They acted, I think, because, I mean, if you think of the,

25:19.720 --> 25:22.880
in a way, there was a compensatory aspect

25:22.880 --> 25:23.880
of this decision-making.

25:23.880 --> 25:27.600
I mean, the Bush administration failed.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.600
This was an extraordinary failure, right?

25:29.600 --> 25:30.440
So if we start-

25:30.440 --> 25:31.280
In which way?

25:31.280 --> 25:32.120
If we're gonna break down the nation?

25:32.120 --> 25:32.960
A failure of intelligence.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.720
If you follow the story of Richard Clarke.

25:36.840 --> 25:37.800
Who's Richard Clarke?

25:37.800 --> 25:40.840
He was a national security expert

25:40.840 --> 25:43.400
who was tasked with following Al-Qaeda,

25:43.400 --> 25:47.280
who had produced a dossier under the Clinton administration

25:47.280 --> 25:50.720
that he passed on to the George W. Bush administration.

25:50.720 --> 25:53.400
And if you look at the work of Condoleezza Rice,

25:53.400 --> 25:56.760
she wrote a very famous, I think, unpaywalled

25:56.760 --> 25:58.680
foreign affairs article that you can read,

25:58.680 --> 26:02.400
announcing the George W. Bush foreign policy kind of outlook.

26:03.080 --> 26:05.280
And it was all about great powers.

26:05.280 --> 26:06.480
It was about the rise of China.

26:06.480 --> 26:07.520
It was about Russia.

26:07.520 --> 26:10.920
I mean, there's definitely a kind of hangover

26:10.920 --> 26:15.920
of those who missed having Russia as the boogeyman,

26:16.000 --> 26:17.680
who spoke, you know, the Clinton administration

26:17.680 --> 26:19.920
repeated again and again the idea of making sure

26:19.920 --> 26:21.840
the bear stayed in his cage,

26:22.840 --> 26:26.560
which is why the United States threw a lifeline

26:26.560 --> 26:29.240
to the Central Asian states,

26:29.240 --> 26:31.120
hoping to have pipelines,

26:31.200 --> 26:34.640
hoping to shore up their national sovereignty

26:34.640 --> 26:38.240
as a way of containing Russia initially,

26:38.240 --> 26:42.240
but also Iran, you know, which sits to the South and West,

26:42.240 --> 26:43.880
and then peripherally looking down the road

26:43.880 --> 26:45.680
to China, to the East.

26:45.680 --> 26:50.280
So the bear is what, like Russia?

26:50.280 --> 26:53.240
Or is it kind of like some weird combination

26:53.240 --> 26:55.400
of Russia, Iran, and China?

26:55.400 --> 26:59.960
The bear is Russia, and Russia is this,

27:00.280 --> 27:01.800
I'm trying to characterize the imagination

27:01.800 --> 27:04.000
of some of these national security figures.

27:04.960 --> 27:07.280
This is an image formed in the Cold War.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.520
I mean, it has deeper seeds in European

27:09.520 --> 27:12.200
and Western intellectual thought that go back

27:12.200 --> 27:17.200
at least to the 1850s in the reign of Tsar Nicholas I.

27:17.640 --> 27:21.160
When we first get this language about the Russian empire

27:21.160 --> 27:25.000
is this kind of evil polity.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.080
Obviously, this was a kind of pillar of Reaganism,

27:29.040 --> 27:31.000
but the Clinton folks kept that alive.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.320
They wanted to make sure that, you know,

27:33.320 --> 27:36.120
American power would be unmatched,

27:36.120 --> 27:39.440
and they, being creatures of the Cold War themselves,

27:39.440 --> 27:42.880
they looked to Russia as a resurgent power,

27:42.880 --> 27:45.560
well before Putin was even thought of.

27:45.560 --> 27:49.480
Yeah, I mean, this is, you mentioned one deep,

27:49.480 --> 27:52.160
profound historical piece in Rambo.

27:52.160 --> 27:55.680
It's probably, this conflict has to do

27:55.680 --> 27:58.680
with another Celesta Stallone movie, A Rocky IV,

27:58.680 --> 28:00.600
which is also historically accurate

28:00.600 --> 28:03.560
and based on, it's basically a documentary.

28:03.560 --> 28:07.440
So there is something about the American power,

28:07.440 --> 28:10.160
even at the level of Condoleezza Rice,

28:10.160 --> 28:15.160
these respected, deep kind of leaders and thinkers

28:15.760 --> 28:17.600
about history and the future,

28:17.600 --> 28:22.200
where they like to have competition with other superpowers

28:22.200 --> 28:26.560
and almost conjure up superpowers,

28:26.560 --> 28:30.640
even when those countries don't maybe,

28:30.640 --> 28:33.560
at the time at least, deserve the label of superpower.

28:33.560 --> 28:34.400
That's right, great point.

28:34.400 --> 28:35.800
You know, they're all, all have some points.

28:35.800 --> 28:39.440
So, yeah, I mean, Russia was, I think, many, many exports.

28:39.440 --> 28:43.360
I mean, my mentor at Princeton, Stephen Cockin, you know,

28:43.360 --> 28:46.320
was then writing great things about how, you know,

28:46.320 --> 28:49.400
if you look at Russia's economy, the scale of its GDP,

28:49.400 --> 28:52.280
you know, its capacity to actually act globally,

28:52.280 --> 28:54.200
it's all quite limited.

28:54.200 --> 28:58.400
But Condoleezza Rice and the people around her, you know,

28:58.400 --> 29:00.120
came into power with George W. Bush,

29:00.120 --> 29:02.880
thinking that, you know, the foreign policy challenges

29:02.880 --> 29:06.520
of her era would be those of the past, right?

29:06.520 --> 29:08.160
Richard Clark and others within the administration

29:08.160 --> 29:10.480
warned that, in fact, there is this group

29:10.480 --> 29:12.960
that has declared war against the United States

29:12.960 --> 29:14.800
and they are coming for us.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.320
The FBI had been following these people around

29:17.320 --> 29:18.160
for many months.

29:18.160 --> 29:21.880
So, you know, by the time George W. Bush comes to power,

29:21.880 --> 29:23.800
lots of Al-Qaeda activists, or well, not lots,

29:23.800 --> 29:26.120
but, you know, perhaps a dozen or so,

29:26.120 --> 29:29.840
are already, you know, training in the United States, right?

29:29.840 --> 29:31.800
And what we knew immediately from the biographies

29:31.800 --> 29:34.400
of some of the characters of the attackers of 9-11,

29:34.400 --> 29:37.120
it was a hodgepodge of people from across the planet,

29:37.120 --> 29:39.320
but mostly they were Saudi, right?

29:39.320 --> 29:41.240
And that was known very early on,

29:41.240 --> 29:43.240
or presumed very early on.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.520
So again, if we go back to your big question

29:44.520 --> 29:47.080
about the geography, why Afghanistan?

29:47.120 --> 29:48.280
It didn't add up, right?

29:48.280 --> 29:51.280
It seemed to me that Afghanistan was a kind of soft target.

29:51.280 --> 29:54.120
It was a place to have explosions,

29:54.120 --> 29:58.400
to seemingly recapture American supremacy.

29:58.400 --> 29:59.800
And also, I think, you know, there was,

29:59.800 --> 30:02.680
in many quarters, there was a deep urge for revenge,

30:02.680 --> 30:05.480
and this was a place to have some casualties,

30:05.480 --> 30:08.600
have some explosions, and then I think, you know,

30:08.600 --> 30:11.360
restore the legitimacy of the Bush administration

30:11.360 --> 30:14.080
by showing that we are in charge, we will pay.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.360
And I think that it was a very old-fashioned

30:16.360 --> 30:19.280
punitive dimension, which rests upon the presumption

30:19.280 --> 30:21.600
that if we intimidate these people,

30:21.600 --> 30:23.880
they'll know not to try this again, right?

30:23.880 --> 30:25.680
All these, I would suggest, are all misreadings

30:25.680 --> 30:28.360
of an organization that was always global.

30:28.360 --> 30:29.680
It had no real center.

30:29.680 --> 30:30.680
I mean, it called itself the center.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.880
That's one way to translate al-Qaeda.

30:32.880 --> 30:35.560
But that center was really in the imagination.

30:36.840 --> 30:39.240
Bin Laden bounced around from country to country.

30:40.120 --> 30:43.680
And crucially, I think a dimension that I don't claim

30:43.680 --> 30:46.400
to know anything new about but has endured

30:46.400 --> 30:49.040
as a kind of doubt is the role of Saudi Arabia

30:49.040 --> 30:51.040
and the fact that, you know, the muscle

30:51.040 --> 30:54.960
in that operation of 9-11 was Saudi, right?

30:54.960 --> 30:57.840
I mean, this was a Saudi operation with, if one thinks,

30:57.840 --> 31:00.360
again, just on the basis of nationalities,

31:00.360 --> 31:04.400
Saudis, you know, an Egyptian or two, a Lebanese guy,

31:04.400 --> 31:06.760
and the Egyptian guy, you know,

31:06.760 --> 31:08.600
had been studying in Germany.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.960
He was an urban planner, right?

31:10.960 --> 31:12.320
So if one thinks of the imagination of this,

31:12.320 --> 31:15.720
I mean, in fact, if you look at the kind of typology

31:15.720 --> 31:19.400
of the figures who have led this radical movement,

31:19.400 --> 31:21.960
I mean, if you think of the global jihadists,

31:21.960 --> 31:25.440
they are mostly not religious scholars, right?

31:25.440 --> 31:27.640
Bin Laden was not a religious scholar.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.160
His training was an engineer.

31:29.160 --> 31:31.080
You know, some biographers claim that he was a playboy

31:31.080 --> 31:32.600
for much of his youth.

31:32.600 --> 31:36.080
But really, these ideas, I think that's probably

31:36.080 --> 31:37.560
why they chose the Twin Towers.

31:37.560 --> 31:41.680
I mean, this is an imagination fueled

31:41.680 --> 31:43.840
by training and engineering.

31:43.840 --> 31:46.360
I mean, a lot of the, you know, the sociology,

31:46.360 --> 31:47.520
if you do a kind of post-propagography

31:47.520 --> 31:50.760
of a lot of these leading jihadists,

31:50.760 --> 31:53.120
their backgrounds are not in Islamic scholarship,

31:53.120 --> 31:55.720
but actually in engineering and kind of practical sciences

31:55.720 --> 31:57.120
and professions.

31:57.120 --> 31:59.240
Medical doctors are among their ranks.

32:00.360 --> 32:01.480
And so there's long been a tension

32:01.480 --> 32:03.920
between Islamic scholars who devote their whole lives

32:03.920 --> 32:07.960
to study of texts and commentary and interpretation.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.600
And then what some scholars call kind of new intellectuals,

32:10.600 --> 32:14.360
new Muslim authorities who actually have secular

32:14.360 --> 32:17.160
university educations, often in the natural sciences

32:17.160 --> 32:19.160
or engineering and technical fields,

32:19.160 --> 32:22.520
who then bring that kind of mindset, if you will,

32:22.520 --> 32:26.720
to what Muslim scholars call the religious sciences,

32:26.720 --> 32:30.560
which are, you know, a field of kind of ambiguity

32:30.560 --> 32:33.880
and of gradation and of subtlety and nuance

32:33.880 --> 32:36.480
and really of decades of training

32:36.480 --> 32:39.800
before one becomes authoritative to speak about issues

32:39.800 --> 32:41.160
like whether or not it's legitimate

32:41.160 --> 32:43.200
to take someone else's life.

32:43.200 --> 32:47.400
With the relation to Afghanistan, who was Bin Laden?

32:47.400 --> 32:49.280
Bin Laden was a visitor.

32:50.600 --> 32:52.640
If you look at his whole life course,

32:53.760 --> 32:55.720
part of it is an enigma still.

32:55.720 --> 32:59.840
You know, he is from a Saudi elite family,

32:59.840 --> 33:03.160
but a family that kind of has a Yemeni,

33:03.160 --> 33:07.000
Arabian Sea kind of genealogy.

33:07.080 --> 33:08.120
So the family has no relationship

33:08.120 --> 33:10.880
to Afghanistan past or present,

33:10.880 --> 33:13.560
except at some point in 1980s,

33:13.560 --> 33:16.960
when he went like thousands of other young Saudis,

33:16.960 --> 33:20.720
first to Pakistan to places like Bashar on the border,

33:20.720 --> 33:24.720
where they wanted to aid the jihad in some capacity.

33:25.760 --> 33:29.160
And for the most part, the Arabs who went

33:29.160 --> 33:32.160
opened up hospitals, some opened up schools.

33:32.160 --> 33:35.280
The Bin Laden family had long been based

33:35.320 --> 33:37.360
in engineering construction.

33:37.360 --> 33:39.440
So it's thought that he used some of those skills

33:39.440 --> 33:42.480
and resources and connections to build things.

33:44.320 --> 33:48.280
We have images of him firing a gun for show, right?

33:48.280 --> 33:50.640
It's not clear that he ever actually fired a gun

33:50.640 --> 33:52.240
in what we would call combat.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.520
Again, I could be corrected by this.

33:55.520 --> 33:58.640
And I think they're competing accounts of who he was.

33:58.640 --> 34:00.120
So he's kind of a...

34:00.120 --> 34:01.520
I mean, many of these figures who sit

34:01.560 --> 34:05.280
at the pinnacle of this world are fictive heroes

34:05.280 --> 34:08.440
that people map their aspirations onto, right?

34:08.440 --> 34:10.400
And so people like Mullah Omar,

34:10.400 --> 34:13.280
who was then head of the Taliban,

34:13.280 --> 34:15.920
was rarely seen in public.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.680
The current head of the Taliban

34:17.680 --> 34:19.480
is almost never seen in public.

34:19.480 --> 34:22.240
I mean, there's kind of studied Arab mystery

34:22.240 --> 34:25.360
that they've cultivated to make themselves available

34:25.360 --> 34:27.720
for all kinds of fantasies, right?

34:27.720 --> 34:28.880
Do you think he believed...

34:28.880 --> 34:32.040
So his religious beliefs,

34:33.720 --> 34:38.720
do you think he believed some of the more extreme things

34:39.120 --> 34:42.320
that enable him to commit terrorist acts?

34:42.320 --> 34:44.000
Maybe put another way,

34:44.000 --> 34:46.960
what makes a man want to become a terrorist?

34:46.960 --> 34:50.320
And what aspect of Bin Laden made him want to be a terrorist?

34:50.320 --> 34:52.520
Right, right.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.120
I mean, let me offer some observations.

34:54.120 --> 34:57.040
I think there are others who know more about Bin Laden

34:57.560 --> 34:59.600
and have far more expertise in al-Qaeda.

34:59.600 --> 35:04.360
So I'm coming at this in an adjacent way,

35:04.360 --> 35:06.520
kind of from Afghanistan and from my historical training.

35:06.520 --> 35:10.840
So this is my two cents, so bear with me.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.680
I don't have the authoritative account for this.

35:12.680 --> 35:14.040
Which in itself is fascinating

35:14.040 --> 35:17.000
because you're a historian of Afghanistan,

35:17.000 --> 35:21.160
and the fact that Bin Laden isn't a huge part

35:21.160 --> 35:23.960
of your focus of study just means

35:24.200 --> 35:28.680
that Bin Laden is not a key part of the history of Afghanistan

35:28.680 --> 35:31.000
except that America made him a key part

35:31.000 --> 35:32.240
of the history of Afghanistan.

35:32.240 --> 35:33.800
I would endorse that, definitely, that's it.

35:33.800 --> 35:36.280
I mean, you've put it in a very pithy way.

35:37.120 --> 35:40.480
Yeah, so listen, he was an engineer.

35:40.480 --> 35:42.520
He was said to be a playboy

35:42.520 --> 35:45.280
who spent a lot of cash from his family.

35:45.280 --> 35:48.240
Like many young Saudis and from some other countries,

35:48.240 --> 35:50.560
he was inspired by this idea

35:50.560 --> 35:52.760
that there was jihad in Afghanistan.

35:52.760 --> 35:55.840
It was gonna take down one of the two superpowers,

35:55.840 --> 35:57.200
the Soviet Union,

35:57.200 --> 36:01.720
who the Red Army did murder hundreds of thousands,

36:01.720 --> 36:05.680
perhaps as many as 2 million Afghan civilians

36:05.680 --> 36:06.840
during that conflict.

36:07.720 --> 36:12.720
It's very plausible and very completely understandable

36:13.480 --> 36:16.640
that many young people would see that cause

36:16.640 --> 36:21.640
as the righteous, pious fighters for jihad

36:21.800 --> 36:23.840
who call themselves mujahideen

36:23.840 --> 36:26.440
are a raid against this evil empire

36:26.440 --> 36:30.240
of a godless Soviet empire that,

36:30.240 --> 36:32.320
I mean, there's even confusion about what the Soviets wanted.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.400
Now we know much more about what the Kremlin wanted,

36:34.400 --> 36:36.240
what Brezhnev wanted

36:36.240 --> 36:37.560
and how the Soviet elite thought about it

36:37.560 --> 36:39.200
because we have many more of their records.

36:39.200 --> 36:42.720
But from the outside, for Jimmy Carter and then for Reagan,

36:42.720 --> 36:47.720
it looked like the Soviets were making a move on South Asia

36:47.880 --> 36:50.920
because they wanted to get to the warm water ports,

36:50.920 --> 36:52.720
which Russians always want supposedly, right?

36:52.720 --> 36:56.160
And it was kind of a move to take over our oil

36:56.160 --> 36:58.800
and to assert world domination, right?

36:58.800 --> 37:00.000
So there are lots of ways

37:00.000 --> 37:02.720
in which this looked like good versus evil.

37:02.720 --> 37:06.920
In Congress, it looked like kind of Vietnam again,

37:06.920 --> 37:08.960
but this time this is our chance to get them.

37:08.960 --> 37:12.320
And there are lots of great quotes, I mean, disturbing,

37:12.320 --> 37:13.920
but really revealing quotes

37:13.920 --> 37:15.560
that American policymakers made

37:15.560 --> 37:19.000
about wanting to give the Soviets their Vietnam.

37:19.000 --> 37:23.320
So the CIA funneled hundreds of millions of dollars

37:23.320 --> 37:25.680
into this project to back the Mujahideen,

37:25.680 --> 37:27.600
who Reagan called Freedom Fighters.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.480
And so Bin Laden was part of that universe.

37:29.480 --> 37:30.320
He's part of that.

37:30.320 --> 37:33.520
He's swimming in the ocean of these Afghan Mujahideen

37:33.520 --> 37:36.760
who out of size did 95% of the fighting.

37:36.760 --> 37:37.760
They're the ones who died.

37:37.760 --> 37:40.520
They're the ones who defeated the Red Army, right?

37:40.520 --> 37:43.120
The Arabs who were there did a little fighting,

37:43.120 --> 37:45.760
but a lot of it was for their purposes.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.080
It was to get experience.

37:47.120 --> 37:50.320
It was to kind of create their reputations,

37:50.320 --> 37:52.640
like Bin Laden began to forge for himself

37:52.640 --> 37:55.240
of being spokesman for a global project.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.000
Because by the late 80s,

37:57.000 --> 37:58.880
when Bin Laden I think was more active

37:58.880 --> 38:02.840
and began conspiring with people from other Arab countries,

38:02.840 --> 38:06.000
the idea that, you know, Gorbachev came to power in 85.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.080
He's like, let's get out of here.

38:07.080 --> 38:09.400
This is draining the Soviet budget.

38:09.400 --> 38:10.440
It's an embarrassment.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.240
We didn't think about this properly.

38:13.240 --> 38:17.240
Let's focus on restoring the party

38:17.240 --> 38:19.320
and strengthening the Soviet Union.

38:19.320 --> 38:20.680
Let's get out of this costly war.

38:20.680 --> 38:22.600
You know, it's a waste.

38:22.600 --> 38:23.800
It's not worth it.

38:23.800 --> 38:26.880
We don't lose anything by getting out of Afghanistan.

38:26.880 --> 38:31.880
And so their retreat was quite effective and successful

38:31.920 --> 38:33.120
from the Soviet point of view, right?

38:33.120 --> 38:35.160
It's not what we're seeing now.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.320
What year was the retreat?

38:37.320 --> 38:41.760
I mean, it began, Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 85.

38:41.760 --> 38:42.840
You know, he was a generation younger

38:43.360 --> 38:44.560
than the other guys.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.320
He was a critic of the system.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.160
He didn't want to abolish it.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.600
He wanted to reform it.

38:48.600 --> 38:51.400
He was a true believer in Soviet socialism

38:51.400 --> 38:55.640
and the party is a, you know, a monopolist, right?

38:56.800 --> 38:58.040
But he was critical of the old guard

38:58.040 --> 39:00.920
and recognized that the party had to change

39:00.920 --> 39:04.640
and the whole system had to change to continue to compete.

39:04.640 --> 39:07.440
And so Afghanistan was one element of this.

39:07.440 --> 39:11.480
And so he pushed the Afghan elites

39:11.480 --> 39:14.320
that Moscow was backing to basically say,

39:14.320 --> 39:16.320
listen, we're gonna share power.

39:16.320 --> 39:19.640
And so a figure named Najibullah

39:19.640 --> 39:23.280
who was a Soviet trained intelligence specialist

39:23.280 --> 39:26.400
sitting in Kabul agreed.

39:26.400 --> 39:30.280
And he said, we need to have a more kind of pluralistic

39:30.280 --> 39:33.200
accommodations approach to our enemies

39:33.200 --> 39:37.400
who are backed by the US mainly, sitting in Pakistan,

39:37.400 --> 39:40.560
sitting in Iran, backed by these Arabs to a degree,

39:40.600 --> 39:42.360
getting money from Saudi.

39:42.360 --> 39:45.160
And he said, let's draw some of them into the government

39:45.160 --> 39:48.480
and basically have a kind of unity government

39:48.480 --> 39:50.840
that would make some space the opposition.

39:50.840 --> 39:53.400
And for the most part, with US backing,

39:53.400 --> 39:56.040
with Pakistani backing, with Iranian backing

39:56.040 --> 39:58.160
and with Saudi backing, the opposition said,

39:58.160 --> 40:00.720
no, we're not going to reconcile.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.720
We're gonna push you off the cliff.

40:02.720 --> 40:06.680
And so that story goes on from at least 1987,

40:06.720 --> 40:10.160
the last Soviet Red Army troops leave early 1989,

40:11.240 --> 40:13.640
but the Najibullah government holds on

40:13.640 --> 40:15.240
for three more years.

40:15.240 --> 40:17.720
It is the, I mean, they're still getting some help

40:17.720 --> 40:18.760
from the Soviet Union.

40:18.760 --> 40:21.680
Its enemies are still getting help from the US mainly.

40:21.680 --> 40:26.680
And it's not until 1992 that they lose.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.560
And then Mujahideen come to power.

40:29.560 --> 40:33.040
They immediately, they're deeply fractured.

40:33.040 --> 40:35.920
And that's where Bin Laden is watching all of this unroll.

40:35.960 --> 40:36.800
That's right.

40:36.800 --> 40:37.880
And he's part of the mix, but he's also mobile.

40:37.880 --> 40:42.160
So he at one point goes, is in Sudan.

40:42.160 --> 40:44.080
He's moving from place to place.

40:44.080 --> 40:45.240
His people are all over the world.

40:45.240 --> 40:48.200
In fact, they, I mean, if you think of the,

40:48.200 --> 40:50.360
once the Mujahideen take power,

40:50.360 --> 40:52.120
they have difficulties with Arab fighters too.

40:52.120 --> 40:53.320
And they don't want them coming in

40:53.320 --> 40:57.160
and messing with Mujahideen regard this as like,

40:57.160 --> 40:59.360
this is an Afghan national state that we're gonna build.

40:59.360 --> 41:00.200
It's gonna be Islamic.

41:00.200 --> 41:01.640
It's gonna be an Islamic state,

41:01.640 --> 41:03.760
but you can't interfere with us.

41:03.760 --> 41:05.680
And so there are always tensions.

41:06.480 --> 41:07.320
And so the Arabs are always kind of,

41:07.320 --> 41:08.160
I would say they were,

41:08.160 --> 41:10.160
the Arab fighters were always interlopers.

41:11.280 --> 41:13.840
Yes, the Afghans are happy to take their money,

41:13.840 --> 41:17.440
send patients to their hospitals, take their weapons,

41:17.440 --> 41:20.680
but they were never gonna let this be like a Saudi

41:20.680 --> 41:22.680
or Egyptian or whatever project.

41:23.720 --> 41:26.320
But then many of those fighters went home.

41:26.320 --> 41:27.440
They went back to Syria.

41:27.440 --> 41:29.120
They went back to Egypt.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.600
Some wanted to go back to Saudi Arabia,

41:30.600 --> 41:31.600
but the Saudis were very careful.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.200
I mean, the Saudis always used Afghanistan

41:33.200 --> 41:34.840
as a kind of safety valve.

41:34.880 --> 41:37.200
In fact, they had fundraisers on television.

41:37.200 --> 41:38.440
They chartered jets.

41:38.440 --> 41:41.360
They filled them with people to fly to Pakistan,

41:42.440 --> 41:44.360
get out in the shower and say, you know, go fight.

41:44.360 --> 41:47.400
And it was one way that the monarchy, the Saudi monarchy,

41:49.000 --> 41:50.160
very cleverly, I think,

41:50.160 --> 41:52.680
created a kind of escape valve

41:52.680 --> 41:55.480
for would-be dissidents in Saudi Arabia, right?

41:55.480 --> 41:56.920
Just send them abroad.

41:56.920 --> 41:59.160
You wanna fight jihad, go do that somewhere else.

41:59.160 --> 42:01.320
Don't bother the kingdom.

42:01.320 --> 42:04.440
But all this became dicier in the early nineties

42:04.480 --> 42:06.320
when some of these guys came back home

42:06.320 --> 42:08.400
and some of the scholars around them said,

42:08.400 --> 42:10.200
let's, we've defeated the Soviet Union,

42:10.200 --> 42:11.240
which is a huge, huge boost.

42:11.240 --> 42:12.880
And I think part of the dynamic we see today

42:12.880 --> 42:16.040
is that the Taliban victory

42:16.040 --> 42:18.080
is a renewed inspiration for people who think,

42:18.080 --> 42:20.320
look, we beat the Soviets.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.000
Now we beat the Americans.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.640
And so already watching the Soviet retreat

42:24.640 --> 42:27.000
across this bridge, back into Uzbekistan,

42:27.000 --> 42:30.360
if you see these dramatic images of the tanks moving,

42:30.360 --> 42:32.520
a lot of people interpreted this as like,

42:32.520 --> 42:34.680
we are going to change the world.

42:34.680 --> 42:36.560
And now we're turning to the Americans

42:36.560 --> 42:38.280
and our local national governments

42:38.280 --> 42:39.840
are backed by the Americans.

42:39.840 --> 42:42.080
So let's start with those places

42:42.080 --> 42:44.840
and then let's go strike the belly of the beast,

42:44.840 --> 42:47.360
which is America, which is New York.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.840
And going back to Bin Laden, your question about

42:48.840 --> 42:51.800
what motivates him, what motivated him,

42:51.800 --> 42:56.800
again, he was not a rigorously trained Islamic scholar.

42:57.400 --> 43:00.640
And that, I think, when this comes up in our classes,

43:00.640 --> 43:02.040
I think, especially young people,

43:02.040 --> 43:03.120
young people who weren't even born on 9-11,

43:03.120 --> 43:05.440
I mean, they're shocked, they see his appearance,

43:05.440 --> 43:10.440
they see him pictured in front of a giant bookshelf

43:10.640 --> 43:11.880
of Arabic books.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.480
He's got the Kalashnikov.

43:13.480 --> 43:15.320
He's got what looks like a religious scholars'

43:15.320 --> 43:16.960
library behind him, right?

43:16.960 --> 43:20.040
But if you look at his words, I mean,

43:20.040 --> 43:21.480
one fascinating thing about just our politics

43:21.480 --> 43:22.680
and just one thing that kind of sums this up,

43:22.680 --> 43:25.160
I mean, the fact that on 9-11,

43:25.160 --> 43:29.720
we had to have a few people, a few experts,

43:29.760 --> 43:32.160
people like Bernard Rubin, who was an Afghanistan expert.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.840
So that was one way in which I think,

43:33.840 --> 43:35.280
I'm not faulting him personally,

43:35.280 --> 43:37.560
but it's just one way in which that relationship

43:37.560 --> 43:40.400
appeared to be formed, right,

43:40.400 --> 43:42.640
of linking Afghanistan to that moment.

43:44.160 --> 43:47.440
If one looks actually at what Bin Laden was saying and doing,

43:47.440 --> 43:49.400
people like Richard Clarke were studying this.

43:49.400 --> 43:51.960
There were Arab leaders, the Arab press was watching this

43:51.960 --> 43:54.080
because he gave some of his first interviews

43:54.080 --> 43:57.100
to a few Arab newspaper outlets.

43:57.900 --> 44:01.060
But speaking of our American kind of monolingualism,

44:01.060 --> 44:02.660
a lot of what he was saying wasn't known.

44:02.660 --> 44:05.540
And so I think for several years,

44:05.540 --> 44:08.420
people weren't reading what Bin Laden said.

44:08.420 --> 44:10.940
I mean, experts are reading it in Arabic,

44:10.940 --> 44:14.420
but there was great anxiety around translating his works.

44:14.420 --> 44:15.700
So, you know, we have Mein Kampf,

44:15.700 --> 44:16.540
we have all this other stuff.

44:16.540 --> 44:18.620
You can buy the collective works of Lin and Stalin,

44:18.620 --> 44:21.140
Mao, whatever you want, in whatever language you want.

44:21.140 --> 44:23.060
But Bin Laden was taboo for American publishing.

44:23.060 --> 44:26.180
So it was only Verso in the UK

44:26.220 --> 44:31.020
that published a famous volume called Messages to the World,

44:31.020 --> 44:33.900
which was the first compendium of Bin Laden's writings.

44:33.900 --> 44:36.060
So he has a Mein Kampf.

44:36.060 --> 44:38.220
He has a type, does he have a thing?

44:38.220 --> 44:39.300
I mean, it's a kind of collective works.

44:39.300 --> 44:40.140
It's a collective works.

44:40.140 --> 44:44.420
Okay, so he had, well, like a blog.

44:44.420 --> 44:45.260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:45.260 --> 44:46.900
It's a collection of articles versus.

44:46.900 --> 44:49.420
Yeah, these are interviews, these are his missives,

44:49.420 --> 44:54.420
his declarations, his decrees, right?

44:55.180 --> 44:57.300
But I think just in terms of,

44:57.300 --> 44:58.700
if we zoom out for a second about, you know,

44:58.700 --> 45:00.580
American policy choices and so on,

45:00.580 --> 45:02.700
the powers that be didn't trust us

45:02.700 --> 45:04.260
to know what he was really about.

45:04.260 --> 45:05.100
I put it that way.

45:05.100 --> 45:06.820
And I don't say that in a conspiratorial sense.

45:06.820 --> 45:11.100
I just think that it was, you know, it was a taboo.

45:11.100 --> 45:13.300
I think people, you know,

45:13.300 --> 45:17.100
there was a kind of consensus that, you know, trusts us.

45:17.100 --> 45:20.180
We know how to fight Al-Qaeda

45:20.180 --> 45:21.340
and you don't need to know what they're about

45:21.340 --> 45:22.540
because they're crazy.

45:22.540 --> 45:24.540
They're fanatics, they're fundamentalists.

45:24.540 --> 45:26.380
They hate us, remember that language?

45:26.380 --> 45:27.500
Yeah.

45:27.500 --> 45:28.780
Us versus them.

45:28.780 --> 45:30.740
But if you read Bin Laden, that's when it gets messy.

45:30.740 --> 45:34.220
That's where Bin Laden's argumentation

45:34.220 --> 45:37.140
is not fundamentally about Islam.

45:37.140 --> 45:39.220
And if you're sitting here with an Islamic scholar,

45:39.220 --> 45:43.140
he would say, you know, depending on which Islamic scholar,

45:43.140 --> 45:45.580
they would tend to go through and dissect

45:45.580 --> 45:48.700
and negate 99% of the arguments

45:48.700 --> 45:51.140
that Bin Laden claimed was in Islam, right?

45:51.140 --> 45:52.620
But what strikes me as an historian,

45:52.620 --> 45:55.060
who's again, looking at this adjacently,

45:56.100 --> 45:58.500
if we read Bin Laden, I mean, the arguments that he make

45:58.500 --> 46:01.460
are, first of all, they're sophisticated.

46:01.460 --> 46:06.460
They reflect a mind that is about geopolitics.

46:07.860 --> 46:09.980
He uses terms like imperialism.

46:09.980 --> 46:12.260
He knows something about world history.

46:12.260 --> 46:14.340
He knows something about geography.

46:14.340 --> 46:16.180
So imperialism is the enemy for him?

46:16.180 --> 46:17.980
Or what's the nature of the enemy?

46:17.980 --> 46:19.180
It's an amalgam.

46:19.180 --> 46:21.620
And like a good politician,

46:21.620 --> 46:23.380
which is what I would call him,

46:23.380 --> 46:27.020
he is adept at speaking in different ways

46:27.020 --> 46:28.060
to different audiences.

46:28.060 --> 46:30.620
So if you look at the context in which he speaks,

46:30.620 --> 46:33.020
if you look at messages to the world,

46:33.020 --> 46:34.700
if you look at his writings,

46:34.700 --> 46:35.740
and you can zoom out now,

46:35.740 --> 46:37.660
and we now have compendia of the writings

46:37.660 --> 46:39.340
of Al-Qaeda more broadly.

46:39.340 --> 46:41.300
You can purchase these.

46:41.300 --> 46:43.980
You know, they're basically primary source collections.

46:45.340 --> 46:47.020
We now have that for the Taliban.

46:47.020 --> 46:49.540
I mean, what's fascinating about,

46:49.540 --> 46:52.260
I think, if you'd like this culture,

46:52.260 --> 46:55.780
acknowledging it's very diverse internally,

46:55.780 --> 46:58.900
is that these people are representatives

46:58.900 --> 47:01.180
of political movements who seek followers.

47:01.180 --> 47:02.540
They speak.

47:02.540 --> 47:07.540
They often are very, I'd say, skilled at visual imagery.

47:08.500 --> 47:10.260
And especially now, I mean, what's fascinating is that,

47:10.260 --> 47:12.940
I mean, the Taliban used to shoot televisions.

47:12.940 --> 47:17.940
They used to, you know, blow up VCR, you know, videotapes.

47:19.420 --> 47:22.740
They used to string audio and video cassettes

47:22.740 --> 47:25.900
from trees and kind of ceremonial hangings, right?

47:25.900 --> 47:29.300
That we're killing this nefarious,

47:29.300 --> 47:32.300
infidel technology that is doing the work of Satan.

47:32.300 --> 47:35.780
And yet today, one of the keys to the Taliban success

47:35.780 --> 47:38.900
is that they got really good at using media.

47:38.900 --> 47:42.220
I mean, brilliant at using the written word,

47:42.220 --> 47:44.060
spoken word, music, actually.

47:45.100 --> 47:48.500
And, you know, Hollywood, Hollywood is the gold standard.

47:48.500 --> 47:52.300
And these guys have studied how to create drama,

47:52.300 --> 47:53.900
how to speak to modern users.

47:53.900 --> 47:55.020
I mean, Islamic State did this.

47:55.020 --> 47:57.580
I mean, the role of media, new media.

47:57.580 --> 48:02.580
I mean, I follow and I am followed by senior Taliban leaders,

48:02.700 --> 48:06.580
which is, you know, bizarre, you know, on Twitter.

48:06.580 --> 48:07.620
On Twitter?

48:07.620 --> 48:08.900
I don't know why they care about me.

48:08.900 --> 48:10.460
I'm nothing.

48:11.460 --> 48:12.820
They follow you on Twitter.

48:12.820 --> 48:13.660
I don't know why.

48:13.660 --> 48:14.740
This is no joke, this is no joke.

48:14.740 --> 48:17.260
So they are part of our modern world,

48:17.260 --> 48:18.380
and it's how they talk, and it's how they recruit,

48:18.380 --> 48:20.540
and this is part of the, this is why they are.

48:20.540 --> 48:22.100
You know, so Bin Laden, if you read Bin Laden,

48:22.100 --> 48:24.260
he speaks multiple languages, I would say.

48:24.260 --> 48:28.100
It's environmentalism.

48:28.100 --> 48:31.500
You know, the West is bad because we destroyed the planet.

48:31.500 --> 48:34.540
The West is bad because we abuse women.

48:34.540 --> 48:37.380
So in class, you know, especially, you know,

48:37.380 --> 48:40.180
female students are very surprised to learn,

48:40.900 --> 48:41.740
and actually saying, you know,

48:41.740 --> 48:45.500
this feminist argument is not, you know,

48:45.500 --> 48:47.420
we start with, you know, this is a murder.

48:47.420 --> 48:49.140
This is a person who has taken human life,

48:49.140 --> 48:51.380
innocent life, over and over again,

48:51.380 --> 48:56.060
and he is, you know, aspirationally genocidal.

48:56.060 --> 48:57.620
But let's try to understand what he's about.

48:57.620 --> 48:59.340
So we walk through the text, read them,

48:59.340 --> 49:03.820
and people are shocked to learn that it's not just about,

49:04.740 --> 49:06.340
you know, quotations in the Quran strung together

49:06.340 --> 49:08.300
in some irrational fashion.

49:08.300 --> 49:10.980
He knows, I mean, at the core,

49:10.980 --> 49:12.980
I'd say is the problem of human suffering.

49:12.980 --> 49:15.420
And he has a geography of that, that is mostly Muslim,

49:15.420 --> 49:17.700
but he talked about the suffering of Kashmir.

49:17.700 --> 49:19.580
All right, so if you have a student in your class

49:19.580 --> 49:22.260
who's from South Asia, he knows about Kashmir,

49:22.260 --> 49:23.940
you know, he or she will say,

49:23.940 --> 49:26.980
that's not entirely inaccurate, you know.

49:26.980 --> 49:29.980
The Indian state commits atrocities in Kashmir.

49:30.980 --> 49:32.900
You know, Pakistan is doing that too.

49:32.900 --> 49:35.100
You know, Palestine is an issue, right?

49:35.100 --> 49:37.940
So you have, in the American university setting,

49:37.980 --> 49:41.540
people across the spectrum who get that, you know,

49:41.540 --> 49:43.500
Palestinians have had a raw deal.

49:43.500 --> 49:46.260
And so it's, victimhood is central,

49:46.260 --> 49:50.180
and it's Muslim victimhood, which is primary,

49:50.180 --> 49:52.420
but as a number of scholars have written,

49:52.420 --> 49:55.460
and I definitely think this is a framework

49:55.460 --> 49:56.300
for what this is useful.

49:56.300 --> 49:58.540
I mean, in this kind of vocabulary,

49:58.540 --> 50:00.220
in this framing, this narrative,

50:01.420 --> 50:03.380
today, in today's world,

50:03.380 --> 50:06.620
if we think of today's world being post-Cold War,

50:06.660 --> 50:07.980
91 to the present,

50:08.860 --> 50:11.260
looking at the series of Gulf Wars,

50:12.100 --> 50:13.020
and seeing the visuals of that,

50:13.020 --> 50:13.860
I think that, you know,

50:13.860 --> 50:15.220
I think the American public has been shielded

50:15.220 --> 50:16.060
from some of this, but if you look at, you know,

50:16.060 --> 50:20.980
it's the carnage of the Iraqi army

50:20.980 --> 50:24.220
that George H.W. Bush produced, right?

50:24.220 --> 50:26.580
Or you think of, you know, the images of the suffering

50:26.580 --> 50:31.260
of Iraqi children under George H.W. Bush's sanctions,

50:31.260 --> 50:33.500
U.S.-British airstrikes,

50:33.500 --> 50:36.820
then you have Madeline Albright answer a question

50:36.820 --> 50:38.380
on 16 Minutes saying, do you think the deaths

50:38.380 --> 50:41.860
of half a million Iraqi kids is worth it?

50:41.860 --> 50:44.700
You know, is that justified to contain Saddam Hussein?

50:44.700 --> 50:47.900
And she says on camera, yes, it's worth it to me.

50:47.900 --> 50:50.940
If you put that all together, I mean, American kids,

50:50.940 --> 50:52.380
and of course, the American public,

50:52.380 --> 50:55.980
they're not always aware of those facts of global history,

50:55.980 --> 51:00.460
but these guys are, and they very capably

51:00.460 --> 51:03.100
use these images, use these tropes,

51:03.100 --> 51:03.940
and use facts.

51:03.940 --> 51:05.900
I mean, some of these things are not deniable.

51:05.900 --> 51:08.100
I mean, these estimates about the number

51:08.100 --> 51:10.820
of Iraqi civilian children dead, you know,

51:10.820 --> 51:12.180
that came from, I think, the Lancet,

51:12.180 --> 51:14.060
and it came from, you know, those are estimates.

51:14.060 --> 51:18.500
But looking at this one point of view of Amman,

51:18.500 --> 51:22.460
of, you know, Jaffa, of Nairobi,

51:22.460 --> 51:25.180
you know, just think around the planet.

51:25.180 --> 51:26.580
And if you see yourself as the victim

51:26.580 --> 51:29.780
of this great imperial power,

51:29.780 --> 51:31.100
you know, you can see why especially young men

51:31.100 --> 51:36.100
would be drawn to a road of self-sacrifice.

51:37.300 --> 51:41.900
And the idea is that in killing others,

51:41.900 --> 51:46.900
you are making them feel how you feel,

51:46.940 --> 51:49.260
because they won't listen to your arguments reasonably,

51:49.260 --> 51:50.380
because they won't, you know,

51:50.380 --> 51:52.700
recognize Palestinian suffering,

51:52.700 --> 51:54.460
Bosnian suffering, right?

51:54.460 --> 51:55.940
Chechen suffering.

51:55.940 --> 51:57.500
You go across the planet, right?

51:57.500 --> 52:00.060
Because they won't recognize our suffering,

52:00.060 --> 52:01.620
we're gonna speak to you in the only language

52:01.620 --> 52:04.260
that you understand, and that's violence.

52:04.260 --> 52:08.260
And look at the violence of the post-1991 world, right?

52:08.260 --> 52:12.380
In which American air power really becomes a global,

52:12.380 --> 52:15.620
you know, kind of fact in the lives of so many people.

52:16.860 --> 52:19.380
And then the big mistake after 9-11 among many,

52:19.380 --> 52:22.900
I mean, fundamentally was taking the war on terror

52:22.900 --> 52:25.100
to some, you know, 30 or 40 countries, right?

52:25.100 --> 52:28.900
So that you have more and more of the globe feel

52:28.900 --> 52:30.860
like they're under attack, right?

52:30.860 --> 52:33.500
And the logic is essentially it's free bin Laden,

52:33.500 --> 52:36.500
it's not we're going to convert you

52:36.500 --> 52:38.820
and turn you into Muslims, and that's why we're doing this.

52:38.820 --> 52:42.100
That appears, that claim does appear at times,

52:42.100 --> 52:45.140
but if you look at any given bin Laden text,

52:45.140 --> 52:47.500
I mean, there are 40 claims in each text.

52:47.500 --> 52:48.900
I mean, it's kind of, it's dizzying,

52:48.900 --> 52:51.060
but he's a modern politician,

52:51.060 --> 52:54.860
he knows the language of social equality,

52:54.860 --> 52:56.820
you know, there's a class dimension to it,

52:56.820 --> 52:58.660
there is an environmental dimension to it,

52:58.660 --> 53:00.740
there's a gender dimension to it.

53:00.740 --> 53:04.180
And yes, there are chronic quotes sprinkled in.

53:04.180 --> 53:06.500
And when he wants to speak that language,

53:06.500 --> 53:09.300
he knew that, you know, he's not a scholar.

53:09.300 --> 53:13.420
So he would often get a few recognized scholars to sign on.

53:13.420 --> 53:16.020
So some of his decorations of Jihad

53:16.020 --> 53:18.980
had his signature kind of sprinkled in

53:18.980 --> 53:20.500
with like a dozen other signatures

53:20.500 --> 53:22.780
from people who were somewhat known

53:22.780 --> 53:24.900
or at least, you know, with titles, right?

53:25.940 --> 53:28.220
So as a kind of intellectual exercise,

53:28.220 --> 53:31.500
it's fascinating to see that he is throwing everything

53:31.500 --> 53:33.100
at the wall in one level.

53:34.100 --> 53:35.780
That's one way to see that it's a,

53:35.780 --> 53:39.860
these are kind of testaments toward recruitment

53:39.860 --> 53:43.860
of people who, yes, they're angry, yes, they're unhappy.

53:43.860 --> 53:46.540
And this is what, you know, I think for a broader public,

53:46.540 --> 53:49.980
it's hard to get, you're like, well, bin Laden didn't suffer.

53:49.980 --> 53:51.260
He wasn't poor.

53:51.260 --> 53:54.780
Like, yeah, I mean, Lenin, Pol Pot.

53:54.780 --> 53:55.620
I mean-

53:55.620 --> 53:57.940
Speaking to, they're empathetic to the suffering,

53:57.940 --> 53:59.900
the landscape, the full landscape of suffering.

53:59.900 --> 54:03.460
It's interesting to think about suffering.

54:03.460 --> 54:06.940
You know, America, the American public,

54:06.940 --> 54:08.940
American politicians and leaders,

54:09.900 --> 54:13.100
when they see what is good and evil,

54:13.100 --> 54:16.580
they're often not empathetic to the suffering of others.

54:16.580 --> 54:20.340
And what you're saying is bin Laden

54:20.340 --> 54:24.900
perhaps accurately could speak to the ignorance of America,

54:24.900 --> 54:28.300
maybe the Soviet Union, to the suffering of their people.

54:28.300 --> 54:29.140
That's right.

54:29.140 --> 54:32.740
And I mean, if you look at the speeches

54:32.740 --> 54:37.260
and the ideas that are public of Hitler in the 1930s,

54:37.260 --> 54:42.260
he spoke quite accurately to the injustice

54:42.660 --> 54:46.500
and maybe the suffering of the German people.

54:46.500 --> 54:49.100
I mean, charismatic politicians

54:49.100 --> 54:50.860
are good at telling accurate stories.

54:50.860 --> 54:53.060
It's not all fabricated,

54:53.140 --> 54:55.620
but they emphasize certain aspects.

54:55.620 --> 55:00.140
And then the problem part is the actions you should take based on that.

55:00.140 --> 55:01.500
Right, right.

55:01.500 --> 55:06.700
So the narratives and the stories may be grounded in historical accuracy.

55:06.700 --> 55:11.780
The actions then cross the line, the ethical line.

55:11.780 --> 55:13.580
I found that too.

55:13.580 --> 55:14.740
Again, if you pick up just one of these texts,

55:14.740 --> 55:15.940
I mean, it's a cloud of scope.

55:15.940 --> 55:19.620
So the Hitler analogy is interesting because it's,

55:19.620 --> 55:21.140
you know, Hitler spoke to,

55:21.180 --> 55:23.380
he could speak to things like inflation, right?

55:23.380 --> 55:24.460
Which really existed.

55:25.380 --> 55:29.900
But he also appealed to the irrational emotions of Germans, right?

55:29.900 --> 55:32.940
He sought out scapegoats, you know,

55:32.940 --> 55:37.860
Jews, Roma, disabled people, homosexuals and so on, right?

55:37.860 --> 55:40.100
I mean, that's also there in bin Laden too.

55:40.100 --> 55:43.980
I mean, daddy of, you know, an antisemitism,

55:44.860 --> 55:47.620
the constant flagging of Zionists and crusaders.

55:47.620 --> 55:50.700
It's a kind of shotgun approach to a search for followers.

55:50.700 --> 55:53.140
But I'll also hasten to add that it's,

55:53.140 --> 55:55.620
for all of the things that we could take off saying,

55:55.620 --> 55:58.340
well, yes, Kashmiris have suffered.

55:58.340 --> 55:59.900
Chechens have suffered and so on.

56:01.220 --> 56:04.300
Bin Ladenism never became a mass movement.

56:04.300 --> 56:06.620
I mean, it never really, I think the,

56:08.020 --> 56:11.380
I mean, this is the encouraging thing, right, about ideology.

56:11.380 --> 56:14.820
I mean, I think the blood on his hands

56:14.820 --> 56:18.020
always limited his appeal among Muslims and others.

56:19.540 --> 56:20.380
But bin Laden did have,

56:21.140 --> 56:24.740
there's a great book by a great scholar at UC San Diego,

56:25.820 --> 56:29.100
Jeremy Prestol, who wrote a great book about global icons

56:29.100 --> 56:34.100
in which he has bin Laden, he has Bob Marley,

56:35.660 --> 56:40.460
he has Tupac, you know, he asked why,

56:40.460 --> 56:42.340
you know, when he was doing research in East Africa,

56:42.340 --> 56:46.260
why did he see young kids wearing bin Laden shirts?

56:46.260 --> 56:48.100
They're also wearing like Tupac shirts.

56:48.100 --> 56:49.980
They're wearing bin Bob Marley shirts.

56:50.740 --> 56:55.740
Basically it's a way of looking at a kind of partial embrace

56:56.740 --> 57:00.100
of some aspects of the rebelliousness

57:00.100 --> 57:02.540
of some of these figures, some of the time

57:02.540 --> 57:05.260
by some people under certain conditions.

57:05.260 --> 57:06.500
Well, the terrifying thing to me,

57:06.500 --> 57:08.780
so yeah, there is a longing in the human heart

57:08.780 --> 57:13.260
to belong to a group and a charismatic leader somehow,

57:14.140 --> 57:16.100
especially when you're young,

57:16.100 --> 57:18.820
just a catalyst for all of that.

57:18.820 --> 57:22.180
I tend to think that perhaps

57:22.180 --> 57:24.660
it's actually hard to be Hitler.

57:24.660 --> 57:29.540
So a leader so charismatic that he can rile a nation to war.

57:29.540 --> 57:32.580
And bin Laden perhaps were lucky,

57:32.580 --> 57:35.540
was not sufficiently charismatic.

57:35.540 --> 57:37.740
I feel like if his writing was better,

57:37.740 --> 57:41.660
if his speeches were better, if his ideas were stronger,

57:42.860 --> 57:46.020
better, it's like more viral

57:46.020 --> 57:51.020
and then there'll be more people kind of young people

57:51.340 --> 57:52.580
uniting around him.

57:52.580 --> 57:56.180
So in some sense, it's almost like accidents of history

57:56.180 --> 57:58.260
of just how much charisma,

57:58.260 --> 58:01.380
how much charisma a particular evil person has,

58:01.380 --> 58:03.180
person like bin Laden.

58:03.180 --> 58:05.620
I think it's fair, evil works, I think.

58:05.620 --> 58:07.380
So you think bin Laden is evil?

58:07.380 --> 58:08.220
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:08.220 --> 58:09.940
I mean, he was a mass murderer.

58:11.100 --> 58:13.740
I'm just saying that his ideas were,

58:13.740 --> 58:17.700
they're more complex than we've tended to acknowledge.

58:17.700 --> 58:21.980
They have a wider potential resonance

58:21.980 --> 58:23.340
than we would acknowledge.

58:23.340 --> 58:25.620
I mean, and also, I guess what I'm,

58:25.620 --> 58:27.620
just one fundamental point is that

58:29.540 --> 58:31.700
thinking about the complexity of bin Laden

58:31.700 --> 58:34.580
is also a way of removing him from Islam.

58:35.580 --> 58:36.780
He is not an Islamic thinker.

58:36.780 --> 58:41.300
He is a cosmopolitan thinker who plays

58:41.300 --> 58:43.260
in all kinds of modern ideologies,

58:43.260 --> 58:45.740
which have proven to mobilize people in the past, right?

58:45.740 --> 58:50.740
So, anti-Semitism, populism, environmentalism,

58:51.940 --> 58:56.420
and the urging to do something about humanity,

58:56.420 --> 58:57.860
do something about suffering.

58:57.860 --> 58:59.140
That's why I think the actual,

58:59.140 --> 59:00.340
you asked about what motivates people

59:00.340 --> 59:01.180
to do this kind of stuff.

59:01.180 --> 59:04.420
I think that's why if one goes below the level of leadership

59:04.420 --> 59:08.260
and this is being reported, if you look at the trial

59:08.260 --> 59:12.380
ongoing now in Paris of the Bataclan murders,

59:12.380 --> 59:15.620
I think the court allowed some discussion

59:15.620 --> 59:17.660
of the backgrounds of the accused

59:17.660 --> 59:20.380
and they come from different backgrounds,

59:20.380 --> 59:22.060
but if there's any common bond,

59:22.060 --> 59:26.180
it's kind of that they had some background in petty crime.

59:26.180 --> 59:28.340
Famously, in the 7-7 bombings in London,

59:29.300 --> 59:32.580
the Metropolitan Police, UK authorities

59:32.580 --> 59:36.420
looked at all those guys and what people want

59:36.420 --> 59:39.140
is this idea that they must be very pious.

59:39.140 --> 59:42.060
They must be super Islamic to do this kind of stuff.

59:42.060 --> 59:43.540
They must be fanatical true believers,

59:43.540 --> 59:45.900
but what they found with those guys was that

59:46.780 --> 59:50.020
some were nominally Muslim,

59:50.020 --> 59:51.700
some went to mosque, some didn't.

59:53.300 --> 59:57.660
Some were single young guys with like criminal backgrounds.

59:57.660 --> 01:00:01.900
Some were like, sorry, they were kind of misfits

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:04.380
who never succeeded in anything,

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:07.900
but others had, at least one thing, had a wife and family

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.460
who he widowed and orphaned.

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.860
And so there's no, I mean, for policing,

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:15.180
I mean, if you're looking at that lens,

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:18.940
there is no kind of typology that will predict

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:20.140
who will become violent.

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.180
And that's why I think we have to move beyond

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:24.420
thinking about religious argumentation narrowly

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:27.340
or by itself and think about things like geopolitics,

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:30.260
think about how people respond to inequality,

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:35.980
the existential threat of climate crisis,

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:40.020
of a whole host of matters and think about,

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:42.100
this is a mode of political contestation.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.580
I mean, it's a violent one, it's one I condemn,

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.220
it is evil, right?

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.780
But these are people that are, they're trying to be political,

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:49.820
they're trying to change things in some way.

01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.500
It's not narrowly about like,

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:54.260
I wanna impose Sharia law on you,

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:57.260
you must wear a veil, you must eat this kind of food.

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.380
It's not that parochial.

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.980
But another quick thought about your

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:03.420
interesting claim about charisma in this,

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:06.860
I think that the one self-limiting feature

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:08.780
of this subculture is that

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:13.980
definitely, I mentioned the enigma of not wanting to be seen

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:17.460
and that the kind of invisibility

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.780
is a productive force of a power,

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:23.900
which a colleague of mine who knows ancient history

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.460
far better than I said, this is,

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:29.460
when she looked at Malomar initially

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:30.700
or we come up in Laden, I mean,

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:34.860
this kind of studied posture of staying in the shadows

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.020
is also a source of authority potentially

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:41.180
because it invites the idea,

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:42.820
and it's partly dictatorships do as well.

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:45.820
I mean, it invites the idea that someone's working

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:47.860
and maybe it's the basis for a lot of QAnon

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.300
or other conspiracy theories that

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.260
someone's working behind the scenes

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:53.060
and things are gonna go the right way.

01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:55.420
You can't see it, but that's almost preferable

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.980
because you can kind of feel it.

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:01.180
And so not having someone out front

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:02.780
can maybe be more effective

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:04.940
than having someone out in front constantly.

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.780
Then the whole-

01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:06.620
Maybe.

01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:07.780
And then the whole Bin Laden,

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.340
Malomar thing like, you can't see me

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:11.420
or if you look at Bin Laden's photographs

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:15.020
and his video stuff, I mean, he's coy.

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:18.900
Some observers have noted that he's kind of effeminate.

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.180
He doesn't strike this kind of masculine.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:22.380
He's not a Mussolini.

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.180
He's not a Hitler, macho.

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.820
I'm standing, thumping my chest.

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:29.420
He's not doing the theatrical chin.

01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:31.780
The theater people tell us it's so aggressive.

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:35.540
Or a chin, what, bringing your chin up.

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.180
I saw a great BBC theater person.

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.180
It was kind of a, it was a makeover show

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:42.340
about how to become a better-

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:43.180
A better theater?

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:47.700
Oh no, just a powerful, yeah, leader authoritarian figure.

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:50.340
No, just how to get ahead in life and then-

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:51.180
Oh, okay, cool.

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:52.420
And just like about acting,

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:53.660
how you can act differently, right?

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:55.340
So it was a BBC thing.

01:02:56.180 --> 01:03:00.460
And this woman claimed that sticking your chin out

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:01.580
like a wrestler does, right?

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:02.980
Is the most like male-to-male-

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:04.060
I love this kind of-

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:04.900
Most aggressive.

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:08.380
Various analysis that people have about power.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.660
But watch the chin, watch the chin.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:13.900
It's the same as analyzing like in wrestling styles

01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:16.300
that win or fighting or so on.

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:17.420
There's so many ways to do-

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.420
Well, the chin, I mean, the chin is a,

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.620
could be interesting verbal gesture.

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:25.900
And I've watched enough Mussolini footage from my classes

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:27.500
to try to pick the right moment.

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.860
And the chin is, Mussolini's all about the chin, so.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:33.540
And I have watched human beings and human nature enough

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:36.260
to know that there's more to a man,

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:38.100
a powerful man than a chin.

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:40.380
Yeah, no, no, no, I'm saying it's an act of aggression.

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:41.220
I'm not saying it's-

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:43.900
It's one of the many tools in the toolkit.

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:44.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:45.580
So she definitely-

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:47.580
It's not all about the chin, but it's a-

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.060
But that's what I'm trying to tell you about.

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:52.580
Ben Laden, I don't think he was deliberate enough

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:55.140
with the way he presents himself.

01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:55.980
What I'm saying about Ben Laden

01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:57.060
that makes him different from these other characters

01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:01.540
is that because he played it being the scholar,

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:05.660
he played it being a figure of modesty and humility.

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:08.020
And that meant that he was often,

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:09.220
again, if you watch his visuals,

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.860
I mean, yes, there's one video of him firing a gun,

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:14.300
but if you watch how he moved,

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.260
how he wouldn't look at people directly,

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.980
how his face was almost,

01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:20.340
I mean, he appears to be incredibly shy.

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:23.940
He saw spoken, you know, his voice was low.

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:25.900
He attempted to be poetic, right?

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:28.580
So it wasn't a warrior kind of image

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.980
that he tried to project of like a tough guy.

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:34.700
It was, I'm demure, I'm humble.

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:37.180
I mean, you know, I'm offering you this message.

01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:41.500
And the appeal that he was going for was to see,

01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:45.700
to project himself as a scholar,

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:47.780
his knowledge and humility,

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:49.260
the whole package carried with it,

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:54.260
an authenticity and a valor that would animate,

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:56.220
inspire people to commit acts of violence, right?

01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:58.540
So there's a different kind of like logic of like,

01:04:58.540 --> 01:04:59.740
go and kill, right?

01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:04.740
So he presented himself in contrast to the imperialist

01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:08.980
kind of macho power, super powers.

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:09.820
Yeah.

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:13.060
So that's just yet another way of,

01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:14.500
and you have to have facial hair

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.220
or hair of different kindness recognized.

01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:18.180
We had a very recognizable look too,

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:20.060
or at least later in life.

01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:22.900
Yeah, no, he tried to look apart.

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:24.020
Yeah.

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:25.940
But I'm saying more fortunate

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:29.100
that whatever calculation that he was making,

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:32.900
he was not more effective.

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:33.740
Yeah.

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:38.260
I mean, the world is full of terrorist organizations

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:41.500
and we're fortunate to the degree,

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.700
any one of them does not have

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:45.620
an incredibly charismatic leader

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:47.780
that attains the kind of power

01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:52.540
that's very difficult to manage at the geopolitical level.

01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:55.060
Yeah, and we credit the publics,

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:57.180
you know, who don't bind to that, right?

01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:58.020
Who see through this.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:00.180
We credit the critics, you know?

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:03.940
Barely on, going back to 9-11 itself,

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:08.940
one of the problems was that US government officials

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:12.180
kept kind of leaning on Muslims to condemn this

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:16.300
as if all Muslims shared some collective responsibility

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.860
or culpability.

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:22.860
And in fact, dozens of scholars and organizations,

01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:25.140
hundreds condemn this,

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:27.220
but their condemnations never quite made it out.

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:29.540
But it created a tension where,

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:31.460
you know, if you wore a veil,

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:32.500
you must've been one of them

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.060
and you must be on Team Bin Laden.

01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:35.700
And so a lot of the, you know,

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.380
I think a lot of the popular violence

01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:39.820
and discrimination and profiling

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:43.820
came out of that urge to see a oneness,

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:45.500
which, you know, Bin Laden projected, right?

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.660
He wanted to say, we are one community.

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:50.740
You know, if you are Muslim, you must be with me, right?

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:54.060
But I think that's where the diversity

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:55.700
of Muslim communities became important

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.460
because outside of small pockets,

01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:00.100
I mean, they didn't accept his leadership, right?

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:01.540
People wore t-shirts in some countries.

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:02.460
I mean, non-Muslims wore t-shirts

01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:04.020
because he was like, he stuck it to the Americans.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:07.220
So in Latin America, people were like,

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:09.660
yeah, that was sad, but, you know, finally,

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:11.020
I mean, there was a kind of schadenfreude

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.100
in that moment internationally.

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:13.860
It's like Che Guevara or somebody like that.

01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:16.180
Che, yeah, Che is the character in Priscilla's book.

01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:17.780
Yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right.

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:18.740
It's just a symbol.

01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:20.980
It's not exactly what he believed

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:23.300
or the cruelty of actions he took.

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.980
It's more like he stood for an idea

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:28.140
of revolution versus authority.

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:31.380
That's right, and that's a great way

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:33.460
to understand bin Ladenism and the whole phenomenon,

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:35.420
but I think looking at the big picture,

01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:40.180
it's also, you wonder, will that ever end, right?

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:42.180
I mean, is that, I mean, that's the risk

01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:45.180
of being a kind of hyper power like the US,

01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:49.940
where you, in assisting on a kind of unipolar world

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.700
in 2001, 2002, 2003,

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:57.540
that created an almost irresistible target,

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:58.860
you know, wherever the US wanted

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.700
to exert itself militarily.

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:04.660
Before we go to the history of Afghanistan, the people,

01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:05.980
and I just want to talk to you

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:10.580
about just some fascinating aspect of the culture.

01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:15.580
Let's go to the end, withdrawal of US troops

01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:17.700
from Afghanistan.

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:20.700
What are your thoughts on how that was executed?

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:24.460
How could it have been done better?

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.020
Yeah, an important question.

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:29.020
I mean, I would preface all this by saying,

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:31.820
you know, as I noted, I think the war was a mistake.

01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:36.540
I had hoped the war would end sooner.

01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:39.900
I think there were different exit routes all along the way.

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:43.420
Again, I think there were lots of policy choices

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:45.940
in September, in October, when the war began.

01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:50.540
There were choices in December, 2001.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.060
So we could look at almost every six month stopping point

01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:57.580
and say, we could have done differently.

01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:00.700
As it turns out though, I mean, the way it played out,

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:02.380
you know, it's been catastrophic.

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:06.580
And I think the Biden administration

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:12.180
has remained unaccountable for the scale of the strategic

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:14.340
and humanitarian and ethical failure

01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:15.940
that they're responsible for.

01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:19.300
Well, okay, let's lay out the full,

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:24.060
there's George W. Bush, there's Barack Obama,

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:27.900
there's Donald Trump, there's Biden.

01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:32.860
So they're all driving this van and these exits

01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:34.540
and they keep not taking the exits

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:36.540
and they're running out of gas.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:37.980
I do this all the time thinking,

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:39.020
where am I gonna pull off?

01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.260
I'll go to the virtual, it's empty.

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.900
How could it have been done better?

01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:48.780
And what exactly, how much suffering

01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:52.420
have all the decisions along the way caused?

01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:54.260
What are the long-term consequences?

01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:56.380
What are the biggest things that concern you

01:09:56.380 --> 01:10:00.620
about the decisions we've made in both invading Afghanistan

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:03.420
and staying in Afghanistan as long as we have?

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.980
I mean, if we start at the end, as you proposed,

01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:09.620
you know, the horrific scenes of the airport,

01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:11.660
you know, that was just one dimension.

01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:14.420
I think in the weeks to come,

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:17.940
I mean, we're gonna see Afghanistan implode

01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:22.100
there are lots of signs that malnutrition,

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:26.980
hunger, starvation are going to claim tens of thousands,

01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:29.500
maybe hundreds of thousands of lives this winter.

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:33.060
And I think there is really nothing,

01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:38.060
there's no framework in place to forestall that.

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:42.900
What is the government, what is currently the system there?

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.740
What's the role of the Taliban?

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.620
So there could be tens of thousands,

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.460
hundreds of thousands that starve,

01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:54.380
either just almost to famine or starve to death.

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:58.140
So this is economic implosion, this is political implosion.

01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:01.580
What's the system there like?

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:05.020
And what could be the one, you know, some inkling of hope?

01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:05.860
Right, right.

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:09.420
The Taliban sit in control, that's unique.

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:14.420
When they were in power in 1990s from 1996, 2001,

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:18.900
they controlled some 85 to 90% of the country.

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:22.420
Now they own it all, but they have no budget.

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:27.420
The Afghan banking system is frozen.

01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:30.980
So the financial system is a mess.

01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:32.380
And it's frozen by the US

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:34.540
because the US is trying to use that lever

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.980
to exert pressure on the Taliban.

01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:40.580
And so the ethical quandaries are of course, Legion, right?

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:44.020
Do you release that money to allow the Taliban

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:46.740
to shore up their rule, right?

01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:48.900
The Biden administration has said no,

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.380
but the banks aren't working.

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.220
If you're in California,

01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:56.660
you wanna send a hundred dollars to your cousin

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:59.980
so she can buy bread, you can't do that now.

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.380
It's almost impossible.

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:02.580
There are some informal networks,

01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:06.140
they're removing some stuff, but there are bread lines.

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:09.300
The Taliban government is incapable,

01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:10.700
fundamentally just of ruling.

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:13.620
I mean, they can discipline people on the street,

01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:15.700
they can force people into the mosque,

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:18.820
they can shoot people, they can beat protesters,

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:20.780
they can put out a newspaper,

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:23.900
they're great at diplomacy it turns out,

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:24.900
they can't rule this country.

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:27.820
So essentially the hospitals

01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:31.660
and the kind of healthcare infrastructure

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:36.660
is being managed by NGOs that are international.

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:41.220
But these people had to leave

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:44.740
and the Taliban have impeded some of that work.

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:47.980
They've told adult women essentially to stay home, right?

01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:51.740
So a big part of the workforce isn't there.

01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:56.740
So I mean, the supply chain is kind of crawling to a halt.

01:12:57.220 --> 01:13:00.260
Trade with Pakistan and its neighbors,

01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:02.620
I mean, it's kind of a transit trade economy.

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:05.540
It exports fruits.

01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:07.500
Pakistan has been closing the border

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.060
because they're anxious about refugees.

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:12.060
They want to exert pressure on the international community

01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:13.660
to recognize the Taliban

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:17.460
because the Pakistan want the Taliban to succeed in power

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:20.420
because they see that in Pakistan's national interest,

01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:24.020
especially to the lens of its rivalry with India.

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:27.380
So the Pakistani security institutions

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.260
are playing a double game.

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.460
Essentially the Afghan people are being held hostage.

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:34.260
And so the Taliban are also saying,

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:36.260
if you don't recognize us,

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:39.100
you're gonna let tens of millions of Afghans starve.

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:44.100
So to which degree is Taliban, like who are the Taliban?

01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.700
What do they stand for?

01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:47.340
What do they want?

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:49.860
Obviously year by year this changes.

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:53.580
So what is the nature of this organization?

01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:57.780
Can they be a legitimate, peaceful, kind, respectful

01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:02.300
government sort of holder of power

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:06.940
or are they fundamentally not capable of doing so?

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.140
Yeah.

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:09.900
I mean, the briefest answer would be

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:14.900
that they are a clerical slash military organization.

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:23.620
This is kind of a imperfect metaphor,

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:28.180
but years ago a German scholar used the term caravan

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:29.260
to describe them.

01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:31.100
And that has some attractive elements

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:35.100
because different people have joined the Taliban

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.500
for different purposes at different times.

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:40.140
But today, and people tell us,

01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:42.180
scholars who know more about the movement than I have said,

01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:45.220
listen, the Taliban is this kind of hodgepodge

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:48.300
of different actors and people and competing interests.

01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:51.140
And I think, so we have a lot of scholars that said,

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:54.060
listen, it's polycentric.

01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:57.300
It's got people in this city and that city and so on.

01:14:57.300 --> 01:15:00.020
I think actually, I was always very skeptical.

01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:00.940
How do they know this?

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.580
I mean, this is an organization that doesn't want you

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:06.820
to know where that money comes from and so on.

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:09.700
But I would say now that we have a clear picture

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:12.540
of what has happened, I'd say they were a

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:17.540
astoundingly well-organized clerical military organization

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:22.740
that has a very cohesive and enduring ideology,

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:27.020
which is quite idiosyncratic if we zoom out

01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:29.140
and continue the conversation we're having about Islam

01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:30.620
and how we think about radicalism

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:32.780
and who's drawn to what.

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:36.940
People throw different terms around

01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:38.540
to describe the Taliban.

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:43.060
Some use a term that links it to a kind of school of thought

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.900
born in the 19th century in India, the Doabandi School.

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:49.260
But if you look at their teachings,

01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:51.540
it's very clear now, I think that these labels,

01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:54.140
it's like saying, you're an MIT guy.

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:54.980
Well, what does that mean?

01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:58.420
I mean, MIT is home to dozens of different

01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:02.380
potentially kinds of intellectual orientations, right?

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:03.900
I mean, attaching a name to a school

01:16:03.900 --> 01:16:07.460
doesn't quite capture, I mean, university.

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:08.300
It's complicated.

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:09.540
I mean, actually MIT is interesting

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:11.900
because I would say MIT is different than Stanford,

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.060
for example.

01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:16.540
I think MIT has a more kind of narrow.

01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:18.060
Yeah, I hear you.

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:19.780
Bad analogy on my part, maybe.

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:21.780
Well, no, it's interesting because I would argue

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:26.780
that there's some aspect of a brand like Taliban or MIT,

01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:32.020
no relation, that has a kind of interact,

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:37.100
like the brand results in the behavior of the,

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.220
like enforces a kind of behavior on the people

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.940
and the people feed the brand.

01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:41.860
And like, there's a loop.

01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:43.780
I think Stanford is a good example

01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:45.140
of something that's more distributed.

01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:48.220
There's sufficient amount of diversity

01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:50.020
in like all kinds of like centers

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:50.980
and all that kind of stuff

01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:55.020
that the brand doesn't become one thing.

01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:57.180
MIT is so engineering.

01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:59.100
It's so different than that.

01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:01.580
Okay, so scratch MIT, scratch Stanford too

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:03.540
because I think Stanford's more like MIT

01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:06.500
than you might imagine.

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:08.780
But isn't Taliban, isn't it pretty,

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:10.660
I don't think there's a diversity.

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:12.500
So yeah, sorry, so just to rephrase.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:15.060
So people say, oh, the Deobandi school.

01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:16.300
I'm like, what is that?

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:20.460
I mean, the Taliban are, they're an ethnic movement.

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:25.460
They represent a vision of Pashtun power, right?

01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:29.980
Pashtuns are people who are quite internally diverse,

01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:34.940
who actually speak multiple dialects of Pashto,

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:39.940
who reside across the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan.

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:42.820
There are Pashtuns who live all over the planet, right?

01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:45.340
There's a community in Moscow, California, everywhere, right?

01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:48.660
So it's a global diaspora of sorts.

01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:51.140
Pashtuns have a kind of genealogical imagination

01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:53.940
so that lots of Pashtuns can tell you the names

01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:55.540
of their grandparents, great-grandparents and so on.

01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:58.860
And that's kind of a, there's a sense of pride in that.

01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:03.540
Pashto language is a kind of core element of that identity,

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:05.300
but it's not universal.

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.740
So for example, you can meet people who say,

01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:10.660
I am Pashtun, but I don't know Pashto.

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:14.820
So as you claw away at this idea, it's amorphous.

01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:15.900
It also means different things,

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.020
different people at different times.

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:21.740
So saying Taliban are Pashtun requires lots of qualifiers

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:24.060
because lots of Pashtuns will say,

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:26.500
no, no, I have nothing to the Taliban.

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:27.500
I hate those people.

01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:32.720
So the Taliban tried to mobilize other Pashtuns

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:34.160
with limited success,

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:37.060
but their core membership is almost exclusively Pashtun.

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:40.220
And they say, no, no, we represent Afghans.

01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:42.500
We represent pious Muslims.

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:46.060
And so in recent two, three years,

01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.940
they've gone further to say, no, we have other groups.

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:52.700
We have Uzbeks, we have Tajiks, we have Hazaras.

01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:54.660
And in the North of Afghanistan, in recent years,

01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:57.340
they did do a bit better at drawing in people

01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:59.820
who were very disaffected because of the government.

01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:02.620
And they were able to diversify their ranks somewhat.

01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:04.500
But if you watch the August 15

01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:07.480
and who they've appointed, what language they've used,

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:10.020
how they've presented themselves,

01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:14.540
it's clear that they are Pashtun, they are male,

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:19.540
and they are extremely ideologically cohesive

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.860
and disciplined, I'd say, right?

01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:25.900
So I think that a lot of the polycentrism, blah, blah,

01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:28.900
some of that stuff was a way to fight a war.

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:33.020
They are fundamentally a guerrilla movement.

01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:37.660
They see themselves as kind of pious Robin Hoods.

01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:40.380
The rhetoric is very much about taking from the rich,

01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:43.140
taking from the privileged, giving to the poor,

01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:47.060
being on the side of the underdog, fighting against evil.

01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:50.260
And so, I mean, their bag, if you like, their thing,

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:53.820
their central theme, their brand is about public morality.

01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:55.980
And so their origin story, going back to 1994,

01:19:55.980 --> 01:20:00.980
is that they interceded, they broke up a gang of criminals

01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:03.340
who were trying to rape people.

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:06.740
And so there's a very interesting kind of emphasis

01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:10.820
on sexuality and on public morality

01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:12.860
and really being the core of like,

01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:16.100
we're gonna restore order in public morality.

01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:18.020
And how that translates into governance

01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:19.300
is something they've never sorted out.

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:20.860
I mean, how do you run a banking system?

01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:23.380
If your intellectual priorities are really about,

01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:25.380
you know, the length of a beard,

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:29.260
and then their path to power in a kind of abstract sense.

01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:32.140
I mean, a lot of that was very much driven by,

01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:37.300
if you like, propagating the problems of martyrdom.

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:39.780
And that sounds, I don't mean to say that in a way that,

01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:40.740
to make it sound ridiculous,

01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:44.380
make it sound like it's, you know, a moral judgment.

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:45.780
It's simply, I think, a fact.

01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:49.420
It's a fact of their appeal that they promised young men

01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:52.420
who have known nothing else

01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:56.300
but studying in certain schools, if at all.

01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:57.220
But they've known fighting,

01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:59.940
and they've known victimization.

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:03.180
And this isn't, I'm not asking for like, sympathy for them,

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:05.380
but I think the reality is that a lot of the,

01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:06.980
we know about the kind of foot soldiers

01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:10.820
is that they lost families in bombings,

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:14.260
in airstrikes, in night raids.

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:17.140
You know, I mean, orphans have always been a stream

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:20.980
living in all-male society,

01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:24.260
not knowing girls, not knowing women,

01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:27.420
hearing things from outside about places like Kabul.

01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:28.740
And so there's always been this kind of

01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:32.100
urban rural dimension, it's not just that,

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:36.180
but I think there's a whole imagination

01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:39.740
that being Taliban captures.

01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:41.980
And the whole marginal thing is really, it's,

01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:45.060
you know, I think to any religious person,

01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:46.860
I mean, it's not a bizarre idea.

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:50.780
I mean, it animates, I mean, so many global traditions,

01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:52.660
you know, but I think the,

01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:54.780
but when you try to sell like an army colonel, right,

01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:56.820
if you were to have a conversation with, you know,

01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:58.900
a U.S. Marine about this,

01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:00.420
I mean, some would get it from their own

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:04.260
religious backgrounds, but I think it's an alien idea,

01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:06.300
but I think it is essential to kind of stretch out

01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.620
my initials, I'm saying that's attractive.

01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:11.380
And now one of the dilemmas going forward is that

01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:14.220
they've got a pivot from martyrdom,

01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:16.740
and some have been, some have told foreign journalists,

01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:19.180
I mean, it's good that we're in charge now,

01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:21.780
we're going to build a proper state,

01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:23.740
but it's kind of boring.

01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:25.620
I want to keep fighting, I want to,

01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:26.860
maybe I'll do it in Pakistan.

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:28.420
Yeah, I mean, it's nice that they are

01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:30.220
expressing that thought.

01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:32.980
Some are not even honest sufficiently with themselves

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:34.260
to express that kind of thought.

01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:37.580
If you're a fighter,

01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:40.900
you see that with a bunch of fighters

01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:43.940
or professional athletes, once they retire,

01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:47.180
they don't know it's very, it's boring.

01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:48.020
Yeah, yeah.

01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:51.820
And so like, if the spirit of the Taliban,

01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:55.020
even the best version of the Taliban is to fight,

01:22:55.020 --> 01:23:00.020
is to be martyrs, is to paint the world as good and evil

01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:02.900
and you're fighting evil and all that kind of stuff

01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:04.660
that's difficult to imagine

01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:07.580
how they can run an education system, a banking system,

01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:10.260
respect all kinds of citizens

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:13.100
who have different backgrounds and religious beliefs

01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:16.620
and women and all that kind of stuff, so.

01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:18.460
Yeah, and they've walked into Kabul

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:19.820
and other major cities.

01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:22.060
You know, some of them are young,

01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:22.900
they didn't know those places,

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:26.980
but also the very important obstacle for them

01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:28.940
is that Afghan society has changed.

01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:31.500
I mean, it's not what, even for the older guys,

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:33.420
it's not what they knew in the 1990s.

01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:37.500
Some always had some ambivalence about the capital,

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.500
but now it's totally different.

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.380
I mean, they've been shocked to see,

01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:42.620
I think to me, one of the most striking features

01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:45.180
of the last few weeks has been that,

01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:47.100
you know, women have come out on the streets

01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:50.140
and have stood in their faces and said,

01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:52.180
you know, we demand rights, we demand education,

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:53.820
we demand employment,

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:57.940
and these foot soldiers are paralyzed, they're not sure.

01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:59.780
They don't know what to do with women, period.

01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:01.260
Yeah, yeah, and they don't know what to do

01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:03.300
with being yelled at and having someone

01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:04.300
stick their fingers in their faces.

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:07.740
I mean, this is not what they've imagined.

01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:10.380
And so I think, and at this juncture,

01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:12.500
there are still foreign cameras around.

01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:16.300
So they have committed acts of violence against women,

01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:18.620
against journalists, they've beaten people,

01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:19.580
they've disappeared people.

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:22.140
Even with cameras around, even in this tense period.

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:24.380
Yeah, but I think that when the cameras, you know,

01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:26.380
retreat and that's likely to happen,

01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:28.540
it's gonna get much worse, I think.

01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:31.980
So the challenge now is, you know, can the Taliban rule?

01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:35.060
And then this is where the diplomacy is so important

01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:38.580
because the Taliban can't rule in isolation

01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:39.500
and they know that.

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:42.860
And part of the success is due to the fact that they were,

01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:45.500
they became very good at talking to other people

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:48.220
in the last, I mean, it's been building for the last decade,

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:50.820
but I'd say the last five years,

01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:52.260
and they always had Pakistan's backing.

01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:55.820
And so the Taliban are, we noted they're a military force,

01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:57.260
very effective guerrilla force.

01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:00.900
They beat NATO, I mean, this is, still hasn't sunk in.

01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:04.300
I mean, the fact that they, with light arms,

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:08.660
using suicide attacks, using mines,

01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:13.340
improvised explosive devices, machine guns.

01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:17.100
In some recent years, they got sniper rifles

01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.020
and, you know, from the summer,

01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:22.340
they got American equipment on a broad scale, right?

01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:23.980
They have airplanes, they have a lot that

01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:26.500
they will be able to use eventually.

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:30.700
But still, basically, it's a story of AK-47s,

01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:33.740
some American small arms and mines.

01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:38.180
So it's very hoochie men, very old school guerrilla fighting.

01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:40.340
And they defeated the most powerful military alliance

01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:41.420
in world history, probably.

01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:43.220
So that has not yet sunk in

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:45.980
and what that means for American and global politics.

01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:49.420
And now they're trying to rule, right?

01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:52.500
They know they need international support.

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:56.140
And their most consistent backer has been Pakistan,

01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:59.980
who sees them as an extension of Pakistani power.

01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:02.700
You know, and this is very important for a Pakistani elite

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:05.340
that, of course, is looking toward India.

01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:08.580
They want to have their rear covered, right?

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:10.740
They want to make sure that these Pashtuns

01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:13.100
don't cause trouble for Pakistan.

01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:15.380
And they like, I mean, for some of the security forces,

01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:17.940
they like this vision of the Islamic State

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:19.580
that the Taliban are building there,

01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:22.100
because those are not citizens from their views

01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:24.300
of what Pakistan should be.

01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:27.220
But the Taliban have been smart enough

01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:30.420
to kind of diversify their potential international allies.

01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:32.580
So everyone in the neighborhood

01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:34.860
has wanted the US to leave, right?

01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:36.580
If we go back to 2001,

01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:39.180
there were Iranian and American special forces in the North

01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:41.700
working together against the Taliban to displace them

01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:46.500
using, you know, Iranian, American, and then Afghan

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:48.860
resistance forces against the Taliban.

01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:50.220
And that was a real moment of repression

01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:52.900
if we go back to the missed exits.

01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:56.020
The relationship with Iran could have been different

01:26:56.020 --> 01:27:00.820
at that moment, but the US, under George W. Bush,

01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:03.620
you know, devised this Axis of Evil language,

01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:06.980
put them together with their enemy, Iraq,

01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:10.220
and then North Korea, all that went south.

01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:12.500
That was the missed opportunity.

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.700
But in recent years, the Taliban in Iran

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:19.180
have kind of papered over the differences.

01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:22.580
They allowed the Taliban to open some offices

01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:25.660
on Iranian territory, likely shared some resources,

01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:28.540
some intelligence, some sophisticated weaponry.

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:30.700
And then the Taliban went to Moscow.

01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:32.940
And for the Putin administration,

01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:35.460
you know, they've long been worried that,

01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:38.100
you know, they see the Taliban as a kind of, you know,

01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:40.660
disease that will potentially move north,

01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:43.220
infect Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan,

01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:44.700
Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan,

01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:48.020
and maybe creep into Russia's sphere of influence.

01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:49.900
Maybe that's why they have, you know,

01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:52.380
a bunch of troops sitting in Tajikistan.

01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:55.100
I mean, the one, you know, forward base

01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:58.580
that Russia still has in Central Asia is in Tajikistan.

01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:00.780
And so the Taliban were always, you know,

01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:04.380
a worrying point, but also useful because they could say,

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:08.220
well, you know, in case the Taliban get out of control,

01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:09.740
we need to be here.

01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:12.140
And so Tajikistan said, okay, you know,

01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:15.020
you're helping secure us, and yes,

01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:17.980
it impinges upon our sovereignty, but it's okay, you know.

01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:21.420
So Putin said, you know, let's, you know,

01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:23.580
give another black eye to the Americans

01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:25.380
and let's treat the Taliban

01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:27.500
as if they're the kind of government in waiting.

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:30.220
Let's have them come to Moscow multiple times.

01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:32.620
This summer, you know, for the last year or two,

01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:34.340
they've been talking to China, right?

01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:39.340
So the photographs of senior Taliban figures

01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:40.780
going from their office in Qatar,

01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:43.500
which was a major blow to the US-backed government,

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:46.340
the fact that they were able to open up an office in Qatar,

01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:48.980
that at one point began to fly a flag

01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:51.420
of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,

01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:54.300
that basically said, we're a state in the waiting.

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:57.420
And as the US-backed Afghan government failed

01:28:57.420 --> 01:29:00.580
and failed and failed at ruling too, right?

01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:02.580
As they showed how corrupt they were.

01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:04.740
And as they really alienated more and more Afghans

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:07.420
by committing acts of violence against them,

01:29:07.420 --> 01:29:11.100
by stealing from them, by, you know,

01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:15.220
basically creating a kind of kleptocracy, right?

01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:20.740
The Taliban said, we are pure, we are not corrupt.

01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:22.700
And look at us, we're winning on the battlefield

01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:25.300
internationally, look, we're talking to China.

01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:27.980
We're talking to Putin, we're talking to China.

01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:31.260
We're a legitimate, powerful center of Central Asia.

01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:33.500
And also kind of, you know, hinting that, you know, we,

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:34.500
oh, we have a website.

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:36.180
I mean, the whole digital angle is amazing

01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:39.380
because they began to, and this is important actually,

01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:43.380
they had a website which grew more and more sophisticated,

01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:45.620
again, after having, you know, shot televisions

01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:47.580
and these kind of ceremonial killings

01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:49.900
of these infidel devices, right?

01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:53.540
They said, we have a government, we have commissions,

01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:55.420
we have a complaint line.

01:29:55.420 --> 01:29:57.980
They lifted all this technocratic language

01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:00.340
that you would get from any UN document, you know,

01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:02.660
about good governance and all the kind of, you know,

01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:05.460
generic language that the NGO world has produced for us,

01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:06.740
right, in English.

01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:08.620
They reproduced that in five languages

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:10.460
on their Taliban website.

01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:12.300
And of course, I'm not saying anyone believed this,

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:15.660
but it was like, you know, just put me in, coach.

01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.340
You know, I know the playbook.

01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:18.180
I know how to run a government.

01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:20.700
And look, we have an agricultural commission.

01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:24.260
We have, you know, a taxation system.

01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:26.220
And again, this idea, and then on the ground,

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:28.380
they had their own law courts

01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:30.420
and they would creep into a district,

01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:32.900
assassinate some people, the local authority figures,

01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:36.420
men of influence, talk to local clerics,

01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:39.780
either get them on board or kill them and say, you know,

01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:42.260
this state is corrupt, but we're bringing you justice.

01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:43.340
This is our calling card.

01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:45.740
We're bringing public morality and justice.

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:49.020
And then to a broader world, they said, you know,

01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:51.780
yeah, things didn't go perfectly, the whole al-Qaeda thing,

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:54.660
you know, wish we could have a do-over on that.

01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:58.820
We're not gonna let anyone hurt you from our territory.

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:03.220
We just want to rule and people like us and look.

01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:05.180
And so if you look at the neighborhood,

01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:08.380
Iran, even the central Asian states after a while,

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:09.540
recognizing they could make some money.

01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:12.180
I mean, one of the, one thing that Uzbekistan likes about

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.900
the current arrangement or they're not hostile to

01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:17.500
is that they have all these contracts.

01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:21.260
They can potentially make some money from, you know,

01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:25.100
the pipeline dream remains alive, running natural gas oil

01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:28.100
to, you know, which is the Indian Ocean,

01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:31.460
to markets, you know, beyond central Asia.

01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:32.820
It's sitting on a couple of trillion dollars,

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:34.180
probably in mineral resources

01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:36.540
that China would love to have, of course.

01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:39.220
And so people looking at Afghanistan now after 20 years

01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:42.740
under American rule, it was a basket case, right?

01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:46.700
There was immense human suffering, incredibly violent.

01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:49.180
The world did not start counting civilian casualties

01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:51.100
in Afghanistan until 2009.

01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:51.940
I mean, think about that.

01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:53.540
The war went on for eight years.

01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:54.860
The Taliban were never really defeated.

01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:56.180
They just went to Pakistan.

01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:59.260
They went to the mountains, they went to the woods.

01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:01.660
And so all these different American operations,

01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:05.460
as you noted, under Bush, Obama, Trump, and so on,

01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:09.420
killed countless civilians.

01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:10.580
The US never accounted for that.

01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:12.220
We never even counted.

01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:15.540
Trump escalated the civilian casualties

01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:17.300
by escalating the air war.

01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:20.020
But a lot of this was like very ugly on the ground,

01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:21.300
you know, night raid stuff,

01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:25.860
where you drop into a hamlet and massacre people.

01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:27.940
And then, you know, honest about what happened, right?

01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:31.180
So that dynamic continued to fuel the growth

01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:32.740
of the Taliban from below.

01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:35.140
So the foot soldiers, they never ran out of foot soldiers.

01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:39.340
The US and its allies killed tens of thousands,

01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:41.180
maybe hundreds of thousands of Taliban fighters

01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:42.780
over the last 20 years.

01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:44.900
But they just sprouted up again.

01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:46.460
And part of that was kind of solidarity culture,

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:51.060
the male bonding of martyrology, of martyrdom,

01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:56.060
and of revenge, and a sense of the foreign invader.

01:32:57.780 --> 01:32:59.500
And I've heard, I mean, I haven't taught a ton

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:03.420
of US military people, but through the Hoover,

01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:05.260
they put officers in our classes sometimes

01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:09.020
and met a few wonderful army and Marine officers

01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:10.620
who I really enjoyed.

01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:13.060
You know, we came from the South like me,

01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:14.060
always had great rapport with them.

01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:17.020
And they expressed a range of opinions about this.

01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:18.860
I think that, you know, I learned a lot from someone

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:21.820
who said, yeah, I mean, I get why they hate us.

01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:24.900
I get why they're still fighting because, you know,

01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:29.900
last week we just killed 14 of their fellow villagers.

01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:34.860
So the officers, the guys on the ground, you know,

01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:37.420
fighting this war, we're not stupid about that.

01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:39.580
I mean, they got the human dimension of that,

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.780
and yet no one got off the exit, as you said,

01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:42.780
people kept driving.

01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:46.460
But going forward now internationally,

01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:49.020
it's critical that they have,

01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:50.540
I mean, they've had meetings.

01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:52.740
I mean, what the Taliban have done since August 15th

01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:54.220
is a lot of diplomacy.

01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:55.980
They've had meetings, they've had people,

01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:58.580
they've had Tushkent come, they've had Beijing come,

01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:00.420
they've had Moscow come.

01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:04.900
I mean, they've had major visits from Islamabad,

01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:09.380
from security people, from diplomatic circles.

01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:12.060
And they're counting on things being different this time.

01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:13.220
I mean, the first time around,

01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:16.020
the only people who backed the Taliban by recognition,

01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:17.740
giving them diplomatic recognition,

01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:20.380
were the Saudis, Pakistanis, and the UAE.

01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:23.980
And because of Al-Qaeda, because of opium,

01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:26.980
because of some of the human rights stuff,

01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:28.540
the US pushed everyone to like,

01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:30.140
let's not recognize the state.

01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:33.380
Even though the US did, I mean, Colin Powell famously,

01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:37.340
summer of 2001, we did give a few grants in aid

01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:40.100
to the Taliban.

01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:44.500
As I kind of like massaging negotiations,

01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:46.300
they kept talking about bin Laden,

01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:49.500
but they also wanted them to stop opium production.

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:50.820
I mean, Afghanistan throughout all this period

01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:54.300
we've talked about is the global center of opium production.

01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:57.580
I mean, over the years, more and more of the Afghan economy

01:34:57.580 --> 01:35:00.580
continued to today is devoted to the opium trade.

01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:05.580
Opium, which is the thing that leads to heroin,

01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:07.980
some of the painkillers.

01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:12.860
And even if Afghan poppies don't make it to Hoboken,

01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:18.460
they are not the source of American deaths.

01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:22.900
They are part of a universal market, a global market,

01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:25.980
which I think any economist will tell you

01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:29.700
is part of the story of our opium problem.

01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:34.700
Something I read maybe a decade ago now,

01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:37.220
and I just kind of looked it up again to bring it up

01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:41.620
to see your opinion on this is a 2010 report

01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:44.420
by the International Council on Security and Development

01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:49.420
that showed that 92% of Afghans in Helmand

01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:54.700
and Kandahar province know nothing of the 9-11 attacks

01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:56.900
on US in 2001.

01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:00.540
Is this at all representative of what you know?

01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:01.700
Is this possible?

01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:03.820
So basically, put another way,

01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:10.060
is it possible that a lot of Afghans don't even know

01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:13.100
the reason why there may be troops

01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:17.460
or the sort of American provided narrative

01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:21.380
for why there's troops, American soldiers,

01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:25.540
and American drones overhead in Afghanistan.

01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:26.620
Right.

01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:28.740
I mean, my gut response,

01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:30.940
not knowing the details of this actual poll,

01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:35.940
is that that's a very unhelpful way to think about

01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:39.980
how Afghans relate to the world.

01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:43.540
And I think it could be, if you go to my hometown

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:48.220
in North Carolina, if you knock on some doors,

01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:50.780
you may meet people who don't know all kinds of things.

01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:52.140
I could probably walk around this neighborhood

01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:54.260
here in California and there'd be all kinds of people

01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:56.780
who don't know all kinds of things.

01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:01.540
Kyrie Irving apparently thinks the earth is flat.

01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:05.260
I mean, so we could make a lot

01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:08.100
of certain kinds of ignorance, I think.

01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:09.940
But I think what I would say,

01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:12.140
and then there's also, I mean, a companion point maybe

01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:15.140
that in thinking about the withdrawal, the collapse,

01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:16.980
the return of the Taliban,

01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:19.220
there's been a big conversation about

01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:21.740
what do Afghans think of us, really?

01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:24.260
And this famous piece in The New Yorker

01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:28.740
was about how many people liked the Taliban,

01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:33.740
that many women interviewed, supposedly, in this piece,

01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:37.340
were sympathetic because they'd lost family members

01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:38.260
and all the violence.

01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:40.260
And the idea kind of was that

01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:42.500
we haven't thought about that at all,

01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:45.380
when in fact, of course, we have and lots of people have.

01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:48.340
But I think if you're just dropping into the conversation,

01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:49.780
if you look at the immediate arc of coverage

01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:50.980
of Afghanistan and the United States,

01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:55.540
I mean, the arc went from lots of coverage during,

01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:57.820
of course, 9-11 and its aftermath,

01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:00.860
lots of coverage during Obama's surge,

01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:02.420
and then quickly dropped down.

01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:05.260
The last decade has been almost nothing.

01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:07.420
So if you ask the same question about Americans

01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:09.540
or other Americans, I'm not sure what they would say to you.

01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:11.380
What percentage would actually know

01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:14.380
why the US is in X, Y, or Z either, right?

01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:15.340
But again, the Afghan side,

01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:16.220
just to return to that for a moment,

01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:19.580
I think that we can fetishize these provinces.

01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:24.180
They are a place where Taliban support has been greatest.

01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:25.660
Also where there's been the most violence,

01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:27.300
where the Americans have been most committed

01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:30.460
to trying to root out the Taliban movement.

01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:31.300
Where-

01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:32.120
This is Hellman and Kanaan.

01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:32.960
Exactly, in the South.

01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:33.780
What are the other parts?

01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:34.620
It's in the South of Afghanistan.

01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:36.340
Yeah, and it's mostly Pashtun.

01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:38.340
Not exclusively, but mostly Pashtun.

01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:39.540
Mostly rural.

01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:40.460
What is Pashtun?

01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:42.860
That's the other group that the Taliban

01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:44.740
claim to represent, right?

01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:45.580
So they are this group-

01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:46.420
What other groups are there?

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.060
Yeah, okay, sorry, yeah, yeah, sorry.

01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:51.940
So in cities, you'll find everything that is in Afghanistan.

01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:54.780
You'll find Uzbeks, Tajiks, Hazaras.

01:38:55.780 --> 01:39:00.780
These are people who, Uzbek is a Turkic language, right?

01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:03.340
Most Uzbeks live in what is now Uzbekistan,

01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:06.740
but they form majorities in some northern parts of the city,

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:08.740
I'm sorry, of the country of Afghanistan.

01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:10.340
But what I emphasize is that,

01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:14.060
and you can find online an ethnographic map of Afghanistan

01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:16.900
and you'll see green where Pashtuns live,

01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:18.580
red where Hazaras live,

01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:20.500
orange where Uzbeks live,

01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:22.500
purple where Tajiks live.

01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:23.980
Then there are a bunch of other smaller groups

01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:25.500
of different kinds.

01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:30.620
There are Nuristanis, there are Baluch,

01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:32.660
there are different religious communities,

01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:34.980
there are Sunni, Shia, different kinds of Shia.

01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:36.700
What are the key differences between them?

01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:40.020
Is it religious basis from the origins

01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:43.460
of where they immigrated from and how different are they?

01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:46.260
So they're all, I mean, they're all indigenous, I think.

01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:47.340
I mean, there's a kind of mythology

01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:49.620
that some groups have been there longer, right?

01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:51.020
So they have a greater claim to power,

01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:55.180
but historically, I mean, it's like, you know,

01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:56.020
ethnic groups anywhere,

01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:58.540
people have different narratives about themselves,

01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:01.940
but many Pashtuns would tell you, not all,

01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:04.820
but many would say we are the kind of state builders

01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:09.660
of Afghanistan, the dynasty that ruled much of the space

01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:12.140
that was born in the mid 18th century

01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:15.420
that ruled until 1973, more or less,

01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:18.460
generalizing, you know, it was a Pashtun dynasty.

01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:21.860
The Taliban have definitely said to some audiences,

01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:24.940
we are the rightful rulers because we are Pashtun.

01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:28.620
The trick though is, I don't mean to be evasive,

01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:31.620
but just to convey some of the complexity,

01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:32.780
one quick answer as well,

01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:34.460
the majority is minorities.

01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:37.420
I mean, one finds that a lot along with those maps,

01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:40.980
but I would say suspend any firm belief in that

01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:43.020
because that could be entirely wrong.

01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:47.140
In fact, there's never been a modern census of Afghanistan.

01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:49.980
So when journalists say Pashtuns are majority,

01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:53.220
or they're the biggest group, I would say not so fast.

01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:54.060
I would say not so fast

01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:57.060
because of migration is one major issue.

01:40:57.060 --> 01:41:00.100
No major modern census,

01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:01.300
actually the Soviets got pretty close,

01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:04.100
but didn't quite, you know, find something comprehensive

01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:06.300
and didn't publicize it, knowing that it was,

01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:08.260
you know, modern times,

01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:11.060
ethnicity can be the source of political mobilization.

01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:14.780
It's not innately so, but it's been part of the story.

01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:16.060
But then you have mixed families, right?

01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:17.780
So a lot of people you'll meet,

01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:19.180
you'll encounter in the diaspora and around.

01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:24.180
I mean, well, I am, you know, my one parent is Tajik,

01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:26.260
one is Pashtun, right?

01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:28.020
Or I'm Pashtun, as I mentioned before,

01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:30.020
but I don't speak Pashto, right?

01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:33.700
Or I am Hazara, but you read about us

01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:36.940
as Shi'i Hazaras, in fact, I'm a Sunni Hazara,

01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:39.420
or I'm a secular Hazara, or I'm an atheist Hazara.

01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:41.940
I mean, everything's possible, right?

01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:46.140
One of my friends, if he were here,

01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:49.140
he'd say, I'm Kabuli, you know, I'm from Kabul.

01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:51.420
So if you think about it in Russian terms, you know,

01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:53.700
it means a lot if you're a Moskvich, you know,

01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:57.060
if you're from Pisa or Moscow, I mean, you know.

01:41:57.060 --> 01:42:02.060
Yeah, well, even here, there's Bostonians, Texans,

01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:04.500
Californians.

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:07.380
Yeah, East Coast, West Coast, all that stuff.

01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:08.820
Those are all part of the mix here.

01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:11.020
So you ask about Kandahar and Helmand,

01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:14.620
then I would say, yeah, if you go out to, you know,

01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:19.620
a pomegranate field, you'll meet a guy who may reckon time

01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:24.900
differently from you and me, who may not be literate.

01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:27.940
You may not have ever had a geography lesson,

01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:30.820
but if you go one door over, you may meet a guy

01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:36.060
who, you know, whose life path has taken him

01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:38.540
to live in, you know, six countries.

01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:40.380
He may speak five languages.

01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:41.820
And these are all things I'm not saying they're all,

01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:43.340
these are just because people have money,

01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:44.180
you can go fly around.

01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:46.900
I mean, they're people who were displaced by war

01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:48.540
from late 1970s, right?

01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:51.620
Even already in the early 70s, people were traveling

01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:53.860
by the tens of thousands to Iran, you know,

01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:55.220
as labor migrants.

01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:56.980
And once you get to Iran, once you get to Pakistan,

01:42:56.980 --> 01:43:00.100
once you get to Uzbekistan, you then connect

01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:02.620
to all kinds of cosmopolitan cultures.

01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:04.940
And in fact, I think one of the themes of the book,

01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:06.020
you know, that you may or may not have read,

01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:07.780
it may put you to sleep.

01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:09.620
You know, Afghan Modern was about, you know,

01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:11.860
conceptualizing Afghanistan as a cosmopolitan place

01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:14.900
where for centuries people went on the move

01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:15.740
and trade in this area.

01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:17.940
You think of, you know, I think this mischaracterization

01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:20.660
of places like Helmand and Kandahar, you know,

01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:24.460
you fly in or you're part of the Marine battalion

01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:26.620
and you see people there and they look different.

01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:30.220
And I think in our imagination, if I can generalize,

01:43:30.220 --> 01:43:31.860
you know, they look like they've been there

01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:33.420
for millennia, right?

01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:35.140
The dress, the whatever, right?

01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:38.260
You think of technology, you think of the mud compounds

01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:40.820
and so on, you think of, you know,

01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:43.940
animal drawn transportation, that kind of stuff, right?

01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:46.660
Or the motorbike, right, at most is what they have.

01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:49.220
But in fact, if you follow those families,

01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:51.940
their trade has taken them to Northern India

01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:53.100
for centuries, right?

01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:56.260
Their trade has connected them to cosmopolitan centers.

01:43:56.260 --> 01:43:58.060
You know, say they have a scholar in the family,

01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:00.620
that scholar may have studied all of the Middle East,

01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:02.220
South Asia, right?

01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:03.980
You know, their ancestors may have been horse traders

01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:05.660
who went all the way to Moscow, right?

01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:07.860
I mean, we have a sort of records of all these people

01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:10.420
traveling across Eurasia,

01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:12.580
pursuing all kinds of livelihoods.

01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:14.740
And so Afghanistan is this paradox

01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:17.300
of visually looking remote

01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:20.300
and looking like it's kind of stuck in time,

01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:22.700
but the family trajectories

01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:23.780
and the current trajectories

01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:26.420
are astoundingly cosmopolitan and mobile.

01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:29.860
And so, and a conception of being a world center

01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:30.900
is also quite strong.

01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:33.820
So, you know, another way to frame that question about like,

01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:36.220
do they know about 9-11 would be like,

01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:37.460
why should we know about 9-11?

01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:39.660
Because we are at the center of something important, right?

01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:41.140
We are the center of Asia.

01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:42.900
We are the heart of Asia.

01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:44.540
We have a kind of historic greatness.

01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:48.900
We are, you know, a proud culture of our own achievements,

01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:49.740
right?

01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:51.780
So we're not worried about that, right?

01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:54.340
That said, I mean, sure, there are different narratives

01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:56.100
about why Americans are there,

01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:57.860
why people are being killed.

01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:00.300
You know, of course you'd find, you know,

01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:01.740
they want to convert us.

01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:03.180
You know, they want our gold.

01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:04.620
They want our opium.

01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:06.580
They want X, Y, and Z, right?

01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:10.700
There was a recent story about a Taliban official

01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:11.780
sitting in an office in Kabul,

01:45:11.780 --> 01:45:12.620
and a journalist asked him,

01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:15.180
can you find in this rotating globe,

01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:17.900
find your country, where are we sitting right now?

01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:21.460
And he was filmed not being able to do it.

01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:22.420
And so a lot of, you know,

01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:24.260
race-fiscated Africans at Asperger's saying,

01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:25.900
you know, ha ha, look at this.

01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:27.260
And that exists.

01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:29.860
I mean, I think I could go to my Stanford classroom

01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:31.380
and there'd be a lot of kids who wouldn't know

01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:32.620
where Afghanistan is too, right?

01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:35.580
But I wouldn't use those metrics

01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:38.220
to suggest that this is a place

01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:40.340
that doesn't have a sense of its place in the world

01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:42.300
and of geopolitics.

01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:44.500
I think if anything, being a relatively small country

01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:46.620
in a very complicated neighborhood,

01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:48.340
I mean, everybody, every cab driver,

01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:50.780
I mean, people have, I mean, you know,

01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:52.420
this is where America is different

01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:54.300
because I don't think Americans have this sense.

01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:55.860
You know, we're talking about Moscow and stuff.

01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:58.700
I think, you know, Moscow cab drivers,

01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:02.260
I think a lot of them are gonna tell you, like,

01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:04.420
what's happening in the world and why, right?

01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:07.020
And it's just part of, it's part of their thing, right?

01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:07.940
You can find that in Ghana.

01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:09.100
You can find that in Mexico City, right?

01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:10.180
You find that lots of places.

01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:13.620
So I think Afghans are part of a very sophisticated

01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:17.900
kind of mapping of the world and where they fit in.

01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:19.980
And a lot of them remarkably had done it firsthand,

01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:21.300
which is what struck me so much.

01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:22.940
And, you know, relaying my experiences

01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:24.420
from the 1990s and Tashkent places

01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:26.340
that these guys had already lived

01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:28.340
in more countries than I'd ever been.

01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:30.060
They already knew half those languages.

01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:33.140
I mean, this one friend's Russian was impeccable.

01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:34.900
And of course it helped.

01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:36.420
They had Russian girlfriends.

01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:38.740
They had, you know, they mixed with the police.

01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:39.580
They had run-ins.

01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:42.900
I mean, this wasn't something you got from a book, right?

01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:44.900
This was like hard knock life.

01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:47.620
I mean, one friend was from a wealthy family

01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:51.180
in the trading diaspora and he was imprisoned.

01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:54.060
I mean, they sent him to prison in Pakistan.

01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:58.020
And he talks about how he started like running in the jail,

01:46:58.020 --> 01:47:00.580
you know, taking cigarettes to people, doing little things

01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:03.980
and kind of, you know, these are not stories of like,

01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:06.460
oh, I went to Harvard and so I'm so learned because of this.

01:47:06.460 --> 01:47:07.300
You know what I mean?

01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:08.860
It's a whole range of experiences.

01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:10.860
The interesting thing is a survey is a survey

01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:15.860
and it doesn't reflect ignorance,

01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:18.940
as you're saying perhaps,

01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:22.500
but it may reflect a different geopolitical view

01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:25.660
of the world than the West has.

01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:29.300
So if, you know, for a lot of the world,

01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:33.260
9-11 was one of the most important moments

01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:35.620
of recent human history.

01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:38.580
And for Afghanistan not to know that,

01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:41.460
especially when they're part of that story,

01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:43.100
means they have a very different,

01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:46.180
like there could be a lot of things said.

01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:49.700
One is the spread of information is different.

01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:52.580
The channels of the way information is spread.

01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:54.940
And two of the things they care about,

01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:59.940
maybe they see themselves as part of a longer arc of history

01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:04.020
where the bickering of these superpowers

01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:06.260
that seem to want to go to the moon

01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:09.260
are not as important as the big sort of arc

01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:11.340
that's been the story of Afghanistan.

01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:15.100
You know, that's an interesting idea,

01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:20.100
but it's still a bit, if at all representative of the truth,

01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:23.340
it's heartbreaking that they're not,

01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:28.340
do not see themselves as active player

01:48:28.700 --> 01:48:33.700
in this game between the United States and Central Asia,

01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:37.380
because they're such a critical player.

01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:41.580
And I feel, and obviously in many ways

01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:44.300
get the short end of the stick in this whole interaction

01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:49.300
with the, you know, invasion of Afghanistan for many years

01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:54.540
and then this rushed withdrawal of troops

01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:59.540
and now the economic collapse and it's sad in some ways.

01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:02.540
I mean, you know, another way to put it is this,

01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:04.300
I mean, yeah, there's a range of knowledge

01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:08.300
and you're right, the information flows are peculiar

01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:10.260
to different geographies and histories and stuff.

01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:11.580
And I think that, you know,

01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:15.340
plucking out one sample from some fairly remote area

01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:17.940
from one like follow the agricultural products.

01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:20.180
I mean, and this is where, you know,

01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:24.700
I think urban rural divides used to mean a lot more

01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:25.540
in the 19th century, right?

01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:27.780
So a lot of like nuts and bolts of history

01:49:27.780 --> 01:49:30.660
is about conceiving of these kinds of distinctions,

01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:32.100
you know, but I think that

01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:33.700
if one has the privilege of traveling a bit,

01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:38.460
you see that like urban areas are fed by rural hinterlands.

01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:42.020
And if you look, think of who actually brings the bread,

01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:44.700
the milk, you know, the pomegranates and so on,

01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:46.940
it creates these networks and then, you know,

01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:50.060
mobility channels, information and so on.

01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:52.980
And so I think that's the way to think about it.

01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:54.940
Channels, information and so on.

01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:57.220
But yeah, but your broader point

01:49:57.220 --> 01:49:58.060
about like the tragedy of this,

01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:01.140
I mean, I guess if I can quote a brilliant student of mine,

01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:04.220
an Afghan American woman who just received her PhD,

01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:07.980
who's now, you know, a doctor, he's a great scholar.

01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:10.620
You know, we've done several events now

01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:11.980
trying to just think through what's happened

01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:14.620
and of course she's very emotionally affected by it.

01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:17.340
And she continues to ask a really great question.

01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:19.540
If I can get her phrasing right,

01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:20.620
you know, if you think of the cycle

01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:23.540
of like the Taliban being in power in 2001

01:50:23.540 --> 01:50:25.700
in the way in which that affected women in particular,

01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:28.980
you know, half Afghan, half of the society, right?

01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:31.020
Then you think of this 20 year period of violence

01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:34.380
and, you know, missed exits, right?

01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:38.340
And repeated tragedy that also it created a space.

01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:40.020
I mean, it created a space for a whole,

01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:41.860
I'd say generationally, it created a space

01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:44.420
for people to realize something new.

01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:45.540
And I think, so we have to attend

01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:47.900
to the dynamism of the society, right?

01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:51.140
So yeah, this happened, you know, mostly in Kabul,

01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:53.980
other big cities, Mazar Sharif, Herat and Kandahar.

01:50:55.460 --> 01:50:56.740
But you can't limit your analysis to that

01:50:56.740 --> 01:51:00.580
because things like radio, television,

01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:02.380
everyone got a TV channel.

01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:05.380
There's a wonderful documentary called Afghan Star

01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:07.460
that I recommend to your listeners and viewers

01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:10.660
that it's about a singing show, a singing contest show.

01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:12.140
But you see, just for some of these things

01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:14.100
about like connections, I mean,

01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:18.020
it's a show by an independent television network

01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:21.260
that did drama, it did kind of infomercials

01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:24.380
for like government and huge American investment in it.

01:51:24.380 --> 01:51:25.620
So it wasn't politically neutral,

01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:27.740
but it did talk shows, did all kinds of stuff.

01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:31.900
It did the singing show that became incredibly popular,

01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:33.860
modeled upon the British and American,

01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:36.340
American Idol kind of stuff, you know, and you can vote.

01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:39.100
So it had a kind of democratic practice element.

01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:41.340
But it's fascinating to see that, you know,

01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:44.100
people hooked up generators to televisions

01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:47.060
and watch this, you know, you think of like literacy rates.

01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:48.980
Literacy rates are imperfect and, you know,

01:51:48.980 --> 01:51:51.660
people who study medieval or modern Europe

01:51:51.660 --> 01:51:54.940
talk about how, yeah, no one could read

01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:56.180
and there weren't many books,

01:51:56.180 --> 01:51:58.780
but if someone had a book, it'd be read aloud

01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:00.420
to a whole village potentially or gathering.

01:52:00.420 --> 01:52:01.580
So there wasn't much, you know,

01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:02.420
some of these metrics don't get

01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:05.260
what people actually perceive as information or exposure

01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:08.980
because there's the magnifying power of open spaces

01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:11.580
and hearing radio in group settings,

01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:15.380
seeing television group settings, having telephone,

01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:16.300
you know, cheap telephones,

01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:19.460
which then become an access point to the world

01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:20.460
and social media, right?

01:52:20.460 --> 01:52:23.180
So all this stuff swept across African society

01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:28.180
as it did elsewhere, you know, in the last decade or more.

01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:31.220
So African society became, you know, in important ways,

01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:33.340
really connected to everything going on.

01:52:33.340 --> 01:52:34.500
And so you see that reflected politically

01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:35.340
and what people wanted.

01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:37.540
So you had some people obviously back

01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:39.060
to return to the Taliban.

01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:41.260
Some people wanted the status quo,

01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:44.300
but increasingly many more people wanted something else.

01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:45.740
And one of the great failures was

01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:48.020
to expose people to democracy,

01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:50.060
but only give them the rigged version.

01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:52.820
And so the US and state department in particular

01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:55.100
continued to double down on faked elections

01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:57.900
for the parliament and for the presidency in Afghanistan.

01:52:57.900 --> 01:52:59.060
What kind of elections?

01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:02.180
Faked, fraudulent elections for parliament

01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:06.780
and for president in Afghanistan again and again

01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:08.340
from the very beginning.

01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:12.300
And those elections were partly theater for the US,

01:53:12.300 --> 01:53:14.620
like for remaining on the road that you're describing, right?

01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:15.860
For not deviating, for not exiting

01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:17.820
because we were building democracy there.

01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:19.820
In reality, the US government knew

01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:21.980
it was never really building democracy there.

01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:24.140
It was establishing control.

01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:27.100
And elections were one means to gather control, right?

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:28.500
But then you had on the ground,

01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:32.140
especially among young people, going to university,

01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:33.380
you know, having experiences

01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:36.460
that were denied to them before, you know,

01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:37.700
they took these promises seriously.

01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:40.140
So part of the disillusionment that we see today

01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:43.420
is that, you know, they believe what the US told them,

01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:45.180
that they're constructing democracy.

01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:46.580
And of course, you know, sending psychos

01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:48.060
may have been thinking, well, you know,

01:53:48.060 --> 01:53:49.380
you're not really doing that.

01:53:49.380 --> 01:53:50.500
You're backing fraud.

01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:52.260
They believed it when they were younger

01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:54.140
and now they're actually smart enough

01:53:54.140 --> 01:53:56.500
to understand that it's a farce,

01:53:56.500 --> 01:54:00.220
but indirectly had the consequence of actually working.

01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:05.300
And that it taught the young over a period of 20 years,

01:54:05.340 --> 01:54:08.460
young folks to believe that democracy is possible

01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:10.900
and then to realize what democracy is not.

01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:11.740
Exactly.

01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:12.860
That's beautifully said.

01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:14.660
And so, but now look at us.

01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:17.940
Now it's, you know, it's now November.

01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:21.660
And so this whole period,

01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:23.340
and I wouldn't say like, you know,

01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:25.580
I wouldn't cast the last 20 years

01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:27.820
if we're looking at all the achievements, you know,

01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:30.260
I wouldn't put them in an American tally sheet,

01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:31.660
like, oh, this is something

01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:32.700
we should pat ourselves on the back for.

01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:34.620
I think that much has happened actually

01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:35.980
against what the Americans wanted.

01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:39.340
I mean, that the kind of freethinking,

01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:42.420
democracy wanting, I mean, even like, you know,

01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:44.140
we could point out on the religious sphere.

01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:47.860
I mean, the African religious landscape

01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:49.380
became very pluralistic.

01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:51.660
Lots of young people wanted

01:54:51.660 --> 01:54:53.460
a different kind of secular politics,

01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:57.980
but the old guard who wanted the status quo

01:54:57.980 --> 01:55:00.980
and wanted something that they'd fought for in 1980s

01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:04.100
tended to still get American backing as the political elites

01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:06.940
who still tended to monopolize political power.

01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:09.540
So all this stuff was happening in different ways.

01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:11.580
I mean, the Americans established this

01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:12.860
American University of Afghanistan,

01:55:12.860 --> 01:55:14.620
which was I think one of the best things the US did there.

01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:18.460
And I regret that the US didn't fund 20 more, you know,

01:55:18.460 --> 01:55:20.020
sprinkling them across the country,

01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:20.860
making them accessible to people.

01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:23.220
Because it was, it was, you know, again,

01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:26.500
it wasn't an engine of Americanization.

01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:27.340
It was just opportunity.

01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:28.740
And so the thirst for higher education

01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:29.900
is really extraordinary.

01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:31.100
It was never really met.

01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:34.260
The US tended to put money in primary education,

01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:37.140
which much of that too was fraudulent.

01:55:37.140 --> 01:55:38.460
But so you have all this interesting dynamism.

01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:42.300
You have, you know, the arts, you have a critical space.

01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:43.700
I mean, I call it a public sphere

01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:45.740
in the classic European sense.

01:55:45.740 --> 01:55:46.860
You know, the Afghans made of their own.

01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:49.260
And again, it wasn't Americanization.

01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:51.580
It wasn't imposed.

01:55:51.580 --> 01:55:54.260
It was something that Afghans built across generations,

01:55:54.260 --> 01:55:58.380
but really with a firm foundation among youth

01:55:58.380 --> 01:56:01.620
who wanted importantly, a multi-ethnic Afghan society.

01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:03.700
You asked about Pashtuns and that kind of stuff.

01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:07.660
And a lot of that language in recent years was,

01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:09.820
they were aware that the US-backed government

01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:11.860
was playing ethnic politics

01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:14.460
and trying to kind of put people on the blocks

01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:17.860
and mobilize people based on their ethnic identity.

01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:19.820
And there was a younger cohort of people who said,

01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:21.540
you know, we are Afghan.

01:56:21.540 --> 01:56:23.260
And then there was interesting social media stuff

01:56:23.260 --> 01:56:26.500
where people would say, I am Hazara, but I'm also Tajik.

01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:28.340
I'm also Uzbek.

01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:30.420
I mean, it was a way of creating

01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:33.540
a multi-ethnic Afghan national identity

01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:34.940
that embraced everything.

01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:37.860
I mean, very utopian, you know, super utopian, right?

01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:39.220
But symbolically, it was very important

01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:42.940
that they rejected being mobilized politically,

01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:45.340
you know, voting as a Hazara or voting is whatever.

01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:47.580
And of course, there were communities who wanted to,

01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:50.660
you know, vote as that ethnic community.

01:56:50.660 --> 01:56:52.220
But there are also people who said, you know,

01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:55.060
let's put a kind of civic nationalism first,

01:56:55.060 --> 01:56:57.740
one that accommodates ethnic pluralism

01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:00.260
in a way that rejected the kind of majoritarian politics

01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:03.420
of one ethnic group dominating the thing.

01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:04.620
So all this stuff was quite interesting.

01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:07.180
I mean, women were asserting themselves

01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:09.660
across multiple spheres.

01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:10.780
Of course, it remained patriarchal.

01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:11.620
Of course, there were struggles.

01:57:11.620 --> 01:57:12.460
Of course, there was violence.

01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:14.260
Of course, you know, there's no utopia.

01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:18.900
But the door on all that shut on August 15.

01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:22.100
So to go back to the quote that I wanted to offer

01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:25.620
from the student, now professor,

01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:28.540
was it, you know, in trying to make sense of this,

01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:30.900
and you mentioned the tragic arc here,

01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:35.060
you think of the 20 years, like she asked, you know,

01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:37.580
why did you go to war in our country?

01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:39.220
Basically, why did you do this to us for 20 years

01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:41.460
when this was never about us?

01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:43.860
You know, you never asked us if you wanted to come.

01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:46.420
You never asked us what you wanted to build here.

01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:47.460
You didn't ask us when you were coming

01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:49.420
and you didn't ask us when you were leaving.

01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:51.460
You just did this all on your own.

01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:53.780
And we tried to make the most of it.

01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:55.860
And then you pulled the rug out from under us,

01:57:55.860 --> 01:58:00.500
you know, at the 11th hour and returned to power,

01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.140
partly by diplomacy.

01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:04.500
It wasn't, at the end, just a military loss.

01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:07.020
I mean, it was a series of diplomatic decisions.

01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:08.540
I mean, the idea, you asked about alternatives.

01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:10.940
I mean, giving up Bagram.

01:58:10.940 --> 01:58:12.780
I mean, holding to the timeline.

01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:14.300
I mean, the Biden people did not need to hold

01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:17.660
to the Doha agreement that Trump had signed.

01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:19.860
I mean, every American president

01:58:19.860 --> 01:58:21.940
writes his or her own foreign policy, right?

01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:24.620
So the Biden administration acted as if,

01:58:24.620 --> 01:58:27.340
and they tried to convince us that their hands were tied

01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:31.380
and that it was either this or 20 more years of war

01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:36.060
or some absurd kind of, you know, false alternative.

01:58:36.060 --> 01:58:38.060
And so, but I think that's important

01:58:38.060 --> 01:58:40.060
for American audiences to hear that, you know,

01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:42.260
they're like, you came to here to experiment.

01:58:42.260 --> 01:58:44.260
You came here to punish.

01:58:44.260 --> 01:58:47.860
You came here to kind of reassert, you know,

01:58:47.860 --> 01:58:50.060
your dominance to the world stage, you know,

01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:54.100
to work out the fear and hurt of 9-11 that we talked about,

01:58:54.100 --> 01:58:56.820
which was so real, you know, and palpable.

01:58:56.820 --> 01:58:59.140
And it's important for American politics since then.

01:58:59.140 --> 01:59:01.980
Like you worked out your problems, you know, on us,

01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:06.220
on our territory, and now what do we have for it?

01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:08.900
You know, and then the people who had a stake

01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:12.260
in that system, imperfect as it was,

01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:13.780
have been desperate to leave.

01:59:13.780 --> 01:59:15.700
And so this, I don't know how much people are aware of this,

01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:18.020
but, you know, I'm a scholar.

01:59:18.020 --> 01:59:21.060
I work in California, you know, I have friends.

01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:24.780
I edit a journal on Afghanistan and, you know,

01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:26.900
but I'm not a politician, I'm not a soldier.

01:59:26.900 --> 01:59:28.820
But people assume that, you know,

01:59:28.820 --> 01:59:31.140
Afghans have been desperately trying to reach me

01:59:31.140 --> 01:59:34.780
and anyone who is kind of on the radar as an American

01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:36.060
to help get them out.

01:59:36.060 --> 01:59:39.500
You know, that's the kind of like, you know,

01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:42.300
the symbol of voting with your feet, you know,

01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:45.500
is quite powerful. I mean, they, there's a huge swath

01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:47.300
of society that doesn't want the system

01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:50.620
and is literally living in terror about it.

01:59:50.620 --> 01:59:51.940
Naturally, women, you know, I mean,

01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:53.860
especially women of a certain age, I mean,

01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:54.820
they feel like their lives are over.

01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:56.860
I mean, there is an epidemic of suicide.

01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:02.780
They feel betrayed and some people have done some good things

02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:03.620
in getting people out.

02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:05.780
You know, I mean, some, you know,

02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:08.140
the US military vets have been, you know,

02:00:08.140 --> 02:00:11.580
at the forefront of working to get out people, you know,

02:00:11.580 --> 02:00:14.540
that they know they owe.

02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:17.620
But the US government doesn't want these people.

02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:20.380
I mean, they have created all these obstacles to,

02:00:21.540 --> 02:00:24.860
to allowing a safety valve for people to leave.

02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:27.860
Looking forward from a perspective of leadership,

02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:31.180
how do we avoid these kinds of mistakes?

02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:33.700
So obviously some interests,

02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:36.980
some aspects of human nature led to this war.

02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:39.180
How do we resist that in the future?

02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:44.580
I guess beyond my moral and intellectual capacity,

02:00:44.580 --> 02:00:45.900
I'll just say this, I mean, looking at it, again,

02:00:45.900 --> 02:00:47.220
looking at it from, you know, my home ground

02:00:47.220 --> 02:00:50.740
is the university and I think of the,

02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:53.740
the intellectual, you know, ways of,

02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:55.940
ways of thinking that I think students

02:00:55.940 --> 02:00:59.060
should develop for themselves as citizens, right?

02:00:59.060 --> 02:01:00.220
And maybe that's where to start is like,

02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:01.980
you know, historical thinking.

02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:04.220
I mean, these are all, you know, I try to tell people,

02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:07.500
you know, if you want to do robotics, computer science,

02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:08.740
you can be a doctor or whatever,

02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:10.140
you should study history.

02:01:10.140 --> 02:01:11.740
Yeah, I mean, you don't have to be an historian like me.

02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:13.340
And it's, you know, my job isn't perfect.

02:01:13.340 --> 02:01:15.140
My profession is deeply flawed, right?

02:01:15.140 --> 02:01:17.660
But as I get older, I'm like,

02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:19.300
there are fewer and fewer historians actually like,

02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:20.500
you know, want to hang out with and stuff.

02:01:20.500 --> 02:01:22.260
So it's like, I'm not offering myself

02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:24.260
as like a model for anything, but you know,

02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:26.420
whether you're a, you know, you carry the mail

02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:27.860
or you're a brain surgeon, whatever.

02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:29.300
I mean, I think it's not,

02:01:29.300 --> 02:01:31.820
it's a way of civic engagement in a way of like,

02:01:31.820 --> 02:01:32.740
you know, ethical being in the world

02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:34.540
that we need to familiarize ourselves with.

02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:36.260
Because if you're an American or if you're

02:01:36.260 --> 02:01:38.180
from a rich country, you know,

02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:40.260
you need to be aware of your effect

02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:42.260
on an intricate world.

02:01:42.260 --> 02:01:44.780
You can't say anymore that you don't know

02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:46.820
or care what's happening in Afghanistan

02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:49.580
or really circle the globe and point to a place.

02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:51.500
I mean, we're all connected

02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:54.420
and we're all, we have ethical obligations.

02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:55.940
That's one place to start, but I would just say this,

02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:57.540
and this is a lot for self-critique,

02:01:57.540 --> 02:02:01.180
and that is so much of my teaching

02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:03.020
in like the themes of my research have been about empire.

02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:06.580
You know, how big states work not only on big territories

02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:08.180
like the Russian empire and Soviet Union and stuff,

02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:11.820
but the way in which power often is projected

02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:14.100
beyond those boundaries in ways that we don't see.

02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:16.900
So this is where things like neoliberalism

02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:18.780
or just, you know, if you want to take capitalism

02:02:18.780 --> 02:02:21.820
or just things that, you know, the idea of humanity

02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:24.860
or of liberalism or of humanitarianism,

02:02:24.860 --> 02:02:26.860
ideas that move beyond state boundaries

02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:30.100
are all things that we think about as affecting power

02:02:30.100 --> 02:02:33.660
in some ways that often harm people, right?

02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:36.100
So I think part of, as I've seen my job so far

02:02:36.100 --> 02:02:38.260
is to think about, you know, building upon the work

02:02:38.260 --> 02:02:41.060
of my people in grad school and, you know,

02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:42.140
scholars that have affected me.

02:02:42.140 --> 02:02:44.820
I mean, you know, we're all concerned with how power works

02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:47.020
and its effects and trying to be attuned

02:02:47.020 --> 02:02:50.980
to understanding things that aren't visible, right?

02:02:50.980 --> 02:02:51.820
That we should be thinking about,

02:02:51.820 --> 02:02:52.940
that should be known to us.

02:02:52.940 --> 02:02:55.260
And as scholars, we can hopefully play some useful role

02:02:55.260 --> 02:03:00.260
in showing effects that aren't, you know, obvious initially.

02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:03.180
So empire is a framework to think about this.

02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:05.900
And so you think about evading foreign countries,

02:03:05.940 --> 02:03:07.980
obviously if you're a scholar of empire,

02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:11.900
you've seen what that looks like and that's horrific, right?

02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:13.100
You look at things like racism

02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:16.780
as one of the ideological pillars of empire.

02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:17.620
You know, that's horrific.

02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:18.460
It must be critiqued.

02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:20.900
It must be, you know, we must be educated against.

02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:24.100
Some of the, you know, gender exploitation of empire

02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:25.420
is also something to highlight, you know,

02:03:25.420 --> 02:03:28.660
to rectify and so on, you know, to be moral beings.

02:03:28.660 --> 02:03:31.260
We need to think about past inequality

02:03:31.260 --> 02:03:35.220
and the legacies of violence and destruction that live on.

02:03:35.220 --> 02:03:36.340
I mean, living in the Americas.

02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:39.620
I mean, look at, you know, we're all on stolen land.

02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:43.020
We're all in the sense living with the fruits of genocide

02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:44.380
and slavery and all those things

02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:46.980
that are hard to come to terms with, right?

02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:49.700
But the last few months in Afghanistan

02:03:49.700 --> 02:03:53.380
and thinking about empire, I think made me more humble

02:03:53.380 --> 02:03:57.100
when I read people who say,

02:03:57.100 --> 02:03:59.980
to put it simply, have taken some joy in this moment

02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:03.940
saying like, well, the Americans got kicked out of Afghanistan.

02:04:03.940 --> 02:04:07.020
You know, if you're against empire, this is a good thing.

02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:09.540
This is a kind of victory of anti-colonial.

02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:14.020
You could see from the perspective of Afghanistan

02:04:14.020 --> 02:04:16.940
that America is not some kind of place

02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:18.900
that has an ideal of freedom

02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:19.860
and all the kinds of things

02:04:19.860 --> 02:04:21.980
that we American tell ourselves.

02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:25.820
But it's more America has the ideal of empire,

02:04:25.820 --> 02:04:28.420
that there's one place that has the truth

02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:31.700
and everybody else must follow this truth.

02:04:31.700 --> 02:04:34.300
And so from a perspective of Afghanistan,

02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:36.380
it could be a victory against this idea

02:04:36.380 --> 02:04:38.660
of centralized truth of empire.

02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:41.620
That's another way to tell this story.

02:04:41.620 --> 02:04:43.500
And then in that sense, it's a victory.

02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:46.540
And in that sense also, I mean,

02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:49.300
you push back against this somewhat,

02:04:50.420 --> 02:04:54.660
this idea of Afghanistan as the graveyard of empires.

02:04:54.660 --> 02:04:56.140
Right, right.

02:04:56.140 --> 02:04:59.980
And outside of this, I mean, I'm a critic of empire.

02:04:59.980 --> 02:05:04.060
I mean, colonialism is a political phenomenon

02:05:04.060 --> 02:05:05.060
that stays with us.

02:05:05.060 --> 02:05:08.020
And I think we need scholars to point to the way

02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:10.180
in which it still works and still does harm.

02:05:11.780 --> 02:05:12.820
But it's part of being an empire

02:05:12.820 --> 02:05:15.780
that you can just get up and leave a place, right?

02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:19.820
That you can remake its politics on one day.

02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:22.580
And then because it fails to advance your agenda

02:05:22.580 --> 02:05:26.180
at one moment, you simply walk away.

02:05:26.180 --> 02:05:27.860
I mean, we can point to other moments.

02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:29.940
I mean, 1947 on the subcontinent,

02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:32.900
the way that the British withdrew

02:05:34.540 --> 02:05:38.340
played a significant role in mass violence,

02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:40.140
the accompanying partition.

02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:41.660
It wasn't all the actions of the British

02:05:41.660 --> 02:05:44.420
that dictated that, right?

02:05:44.420 --> 02:05:48.260
There were lots of actors who chose to pick up the knife

02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:49.900
to kill their neighbor and so on.

02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:52.060
I mean, there's lots of agency in that moment

02:05:52.060 --> 02:05:54.740
as there's now in what's happening in Afghanistan.

02:05:54.740 --> 02:05:57.020
But I think the capriciousness,

02:05:57.260 --> 02:06:02.260
the ability to act as if your political decisions

02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:04.340
about other people's lives

02:06:06.340 --> 02:06:09.540
are something that can be made in secret,

02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:11.780
that can be made willy-nilly,

02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:14.140
that really are beyond the accountability

02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:17.780
of those who are actually going to live with consequences

02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:20.540
of shifting the cards on a deck

02:06:20.540 --> 02:06:23.420
in a way that decides who rules and who doesn't.

02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:25.380
I would love to hear your conversation

02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:26.700
with somebody I just talked to,

02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:28.420
which is Neil Ferguson,

02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:30.940
who argues on the topic of empire

02:06:30.940 --> 02:06:34.700
that you can also zoom out even further

02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:38.220
and say, weigh the good and the bad of empire.

02:06:38.220 --> 02:06:41.260
And he argues, I think he gets a lot of flack for this

02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:42.900
from other historians,

02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:47.900
that the British empire did more good than bad

02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:50.420
in certain moments of history.

02:06:50.420 --> 02:06:52.860
And that's an uncomfortable truth.

02:06:52.860 --> 02:06:55.300
There's levels, it's a cake

02:06:55.300 --> 02:06:57.860
with layers of uncomfortable truths.

02:06:57.860 --> 02:07:00.780
And it's not a cake at all because none of it tastes good.

02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:01.620
Right.

02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:04.180
I mean, I would continue to disagree with Neil Ferguson.

02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:06.460
So I'm still working out where I am

02:07:06.460 --> 02:07:08.820
and what this moment does to kind of, I think,

02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:12.380
qualify my understanding of the past.

02:07:12.380 --> 02:07:14.220
I think in a moment of humility,

02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:18.220
I do, and I'm probably reacting to the kind of,

02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:19.940
as you put it, I mean,

02:07:19.940 --> 02:07:21.020
the idea that this is like a good thing

02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:23.180
that American power has been defeated here.

02:07:23.180 --> 02:07:25.820
I mean, I do think American power should contract.

02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:28.580
And I don't think, and again,

02:07:28.580 --> 02:07:30.700
if I had to create a tally sheet

02:07:30.700 --> 02:07:32.060
of what the Americans did in the US,

02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:34.620
I mean, I mentioned the American University of Afghanistan.

02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:35.500
Right.

02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:37.700
It could have done that without invading the country

02:07:37.700 --> 02:07:38.940
and killing people.

02:07:38.940 --> 02:07:41.500
I've not now become an apologist for empire.

02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:44.460
I'm not now a mini Neil Ferguson,

02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:48.820
but ending empire is, I mean,

02:07:48.820 --> 02:07:53.580
those decisions you make are,

02:07:53.580 --> 02:07:56.660
in some ways, a continuation of imperial hubris, right?

02:07:57.940 --> 02:07:59.420
So you're not really out of empire yet.

02:07:59.420 --> 02:08:01.020
You're not really contracting empire

02:08:01.020 --> 02:08:03.540
for those who are living it, you know?

02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:05.620
But I think it's also, I mean, maybe I put it this way,

02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:08.140
it's be careful what you ask for.

02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:11.060
You know, I mean, I wanted the US out of Afghanistan,

02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:15.020
but I wanted there to be a political settlement.

02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:18.140
I wanted my cake and I wanted to eat it too, right?

02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:20.620
I wanted all kinds of things to be different, right?

02:08:20.620 --> 02:08:22.780
But why is going to Afghanistan even needed for that?

02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:26.300
You can play all those games of geopolitics

02:08:26.300 --> 02:08:30.180
without ever invading and taking ownership of the place.

02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:31.660
It feels like the war.

02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:32.500
Yeah.

02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:35.700
It feels like, I mean, I'm not exactly sure

02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:38.460
what military force is necessary for,

02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:41.860
except for targeted, intense attacks.

02:08:41.860 --> 02:08:46.540
It feels like, to me, the right thing to do after 9-11

02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:49.940
was to show, was a display of force,

02:08:49.940 --> 02:08:52.060
unlike anything the world has ever seen

02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:54.220
for a very short amount of time,

02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:57.260
targeted at, sure, a terrorist,

02:08:57.260 --> 02:08:59.860
at certain strongholds and so on,

02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:03.500
and then in and out, and then focus on education,

02:09:03.500 --> 02:09:08.500
on empowering women into the education system,

02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:12.100
all those kinds of things that have to do with supporting

02:09:12.100 --> 02:09:16.420
the culture, the education, the flourishing of the place.

02:09:17.260 --> 02:09:21.260
It has nothing to do with military policing, essentially.

02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:22.100
Right.

02:09:22.100 --> 02:09:25.100
I mean, I think, yeah, if you look at it through that lens,

02:09:25.100 --> 02:09:28.100
I mean, invading Afghanistan and then invading Iraq

02:09:28.100 --> 02:09:30.580
didn't end Al-Qaeda.

02:09:30.580 --> 02:09:33.300
It didn't end terrorism, right?

02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:37.460
It didn't really deflate these ideologies entirely.

02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:42.540
If you like, you could say there were some

02:09:43.500 --> 02:09:46.100
limited discrediting of certain kinds of ideas,

02:09:46.100 --> 02:09:47.460
but in fact, I mean, look at the phenomenon

02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:49.500
of suicide bombing.

02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:50.660
I mean, it spread.

02:09:50.660 --> 02:09:52.740
I mean, it was never an Islamic thing.

02:09:52.740 --> 02:09:54.340
It was never a Muslim thing.

02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:57.020
Some Muslims adopted it in some places,

02:09:57.020 --> 02:09:59.740
but the circuits of knowledge about how to do

02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:01.660
these kind of things only expanded

02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:04.700
with the insurgencies that emerged in Afghanistan and Iraq,

02:10:04.700 --> 02:10:05.860
and then they kind of became connected,

02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:07.420
and then they became to the present.

02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:09.180
I mean, the Islamic State is,

02:10:09.180 --> 02:10:11.980
it's the best thing that happened to the Taliban ever.

02:10:12.580 --> 02:10:16.180
Because it's on the basis of its supposed

02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:20.060
new stance as a counter-terrorism outfit

02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:22.460
that it will get recognition from all its neighbors.

02:10:22.460 --> 02:10:24.380
It will get recognition from Russia.

02:10:24.380 --> 02:10:26.860
I mean, already with the evacuation of the airport,

02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:29.340
the United States was collaborating with the Taliban

02:10:29.340 --> 02:10:33.500
against the Islamic State and openly talking

02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:34.940
about the Taliban as if they were partners

02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:35.780
in this great operation.

02:10:35.780 --> 02:10:39.980
So, and then Al-Qaeda remains present in Afghanistan, so.

02:10:39.980 --> 02:10:42.300
Trillions of dollars spent.

02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:48.500
The drones up above bombing places

02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:51.180
that result in civilian death, the death of children,

02:10:51.180 --> 02:10:53.220
the death of fathers and mothers,

02:10:53.220 --> 02:10:56.060
and those stories, even at the individual level,

02:10:56.060 --> 02:10:58.940
propagate virally across the land,

02:10:58.940 --> 02:11:01.700
creating potentially more terrorists.

02:11:01.700 --> 02:11:04.900
And a cynical view of the trillions of dollars

02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:08.460
is the military-industrial complex,

02:11:08.500 --> 02:11:13.500
where there's just a momentum where, after 9-11,

02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:16.300
the feeling like we should do something

02:11:16.300 --> 02:11:20.220
led to us doing something, and then a lot of people

02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:21.620
realizing they can make money

02:11:21.620 --> 02:11:23.540
from doing more of that something.

02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:26.740
And then it's just a momentum where no one person

02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:30.940
is sitting there petting a cat in an evil way,

02:11:30.940 --> 02:11:33.260
saying, we're going to spend all of this money

02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:36.260
and create more suffering and create more terrorism.

02:11:36.260 --> 02:11:37.900
But it's just something about that momentum

02:11:37.900 --> 02:11:39.140
that leads to that.

02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:42.540
And it, to me, honestly, I just, I'm still a sucker.

02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:43.940
I believe in leadership.

02:11:43.940 --> 02:11:47.500
I believe in great, charismatic leaders

02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:51.460
and the power of that, one, to do evil and to do good.

02:11:51.460 --> 02:11:52.780
And it felt like,

02:11:54.820 --> 02:11:58.660
I honestly put the blame on George Bush,

02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:03.060
Obama, Trump, and Biden for the lack of leadership.

02:12:03.060 --> 02:12:05.100
Yeah, definitely, definitely.

02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:05.940
I agree.

02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:08.060
Yeah, there is the military-industrial complex component,

02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:09.380
which is huge.

02:12:09.380 --> 02:12:11.340
And there's also, I mean, speaking of government leadership,

02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:15.060
it's also, I'd say, the imbalance of power within Washington.

02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:18.740
I mean, the Pentagon used this moment,

02:12:20.180 --> 02:12:24.660
well, beginning in 2001, I think, to assert its authority

02:12:24.660 --> 02:12:27.940
at the expense of other institutions of national government.

02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:30.300
I mean, the State Department diplomacy

02:12:30.580 --> 02:12:35.580
has become a shadow of what it was once capable of doing.

02:12:35.860 --> 02:12:38.020
And of course, I mean, other historians, US historians,

02:12:38.020 --> 02:12:39.660
which I'm not firmly a historian of the United States,

02:12:39.660 --> 02:12:42.100
but we can go back to talk about Vietnam.

02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:46.220
We talk about lots of Cold War and post-Cold War engagements.

02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:49.020
And I think we need a reckoning

02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:52.580
about how the United States uses military power,

02:12:52.580 --> 02:12:55.220
why we devote so much to our military budget,

02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:56.780
and what could be available to us

02:12:56.780 --> 02:12:59.940
if we had a more sensible view

02:12:59.940 --> 02:13:03.060
of the value of military power, of its effectiveness.

02:13:03.060 --> 02:13:04.900
And I think we're willing to hammer home

02:13:04.900 --> 02:13:05.900
that this is a defeat.

02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:07.220
I mean, I think there should be accountability.

02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:09.780
And if you, and this could be a kind of opening

02:13:09.780 --> 02:13:11.220
for a kind of bipartisan conversation,

02:13:11.220 --> 02:13:16.220
because if you are a kind of American militarist,

02:13:16.460 --> 02:13:18.460
I mean, you have to look at the leadership

02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:20.660
that got you to a place where you were defeated

02:13:20.660 --> 02:13:25.660
by men wearing sandals firing AK-47s, right?

02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:27.820
Yeah, there should be a humility with that.

02:13:27.820 --> 02:13:28.660
Yeah.

02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:31.820
I mean, we should actually say that.

02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:34.220
Like literally the-

02:13:34.220 --> 02:13:35.060
Oh, we lost.

02:13:35.060 --> 02:13:35.900
You should say we lost.

02:13:35.900 --> 02:13:37.220
It wasn't just, you know-

02:13:37.220 --> 02:13:40.700
So the American military lost.

02:13:40.700 --> 02:13:43.620
Yeah, and I feel I have very mixed feelings.

02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:46.340
And it's, I don't know, a ton of veterans,

02:13:46.340 --> 02:13:48.140
but I've mentioned I've taught my share

02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:49.540
and have a student now.

02:13:49.540 --> 02:13:53.540
And they are suffering because they look at the sacrifices

02:13:53.540 --> 02:13:55.260
that they made that I didn't make.

02:13:55.740 --> 02:13:57.100
American society to make the sacrifices.

02:13:57.100 --> 02:14:00.140
I mean, men and women lost limbs, they lost eyes,

02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:01.740
they lost lives, you know.

02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:03.780
There's been this, of course,

02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:08.020
quiet epidemic of suicide among veterans.

02:14:08.020 --> 02:14:10.900
And I've heard some stories,

02:14:10.900 --> 02:14:12.340
the fact that the State Department

02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:14.780
is seeing a similar surge of suicides

02:14:14.780 --> 02:14:19.820
because they see their adult life's work collapse.

02:14:19.820 --> 02:14:20.780
They've seen their relationships.

02:14:20.780 --> 02:14:21.860
I mean, they've seen,

02:14:21.860 --> 02:14:23.540
they were seeing phone calls in the middle of the night

02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:26.460
from people who they trusted with their lives,

02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:28.340
who they know are gonna be targeted.

02:14:28.340 --> 02:14:30.820
I mean, some have already been killed.

02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:32.780
They've seen the, I mean, I think just,

02:14:32.780 --> 02:14:35.620
I'd imagine just ideologically and professionally

02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:36.460
what they believed in

02:14:36.460 --> 02:14:41.460
and what they sacrificed for has vanished.

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:44.700
And I think that's bad.

02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:45.540
I mean, historically,

02:14:45.540 --> 02:14:47.220
thinking of some of the precedents you were thinking of.

02:14:47.220 --> 02:14:51.300
I mean, if you think of, first of all, at a human level,

02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:52.380
I feel horrible for those people

02:14:52.380 --> 02:14:55.500
who may not have agreed with everything they had done

02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:56.620
and their choices in life.

02:14:56.620 --> 02:14:59.260
But I respect the fact that many good people

02:14:59.260 --> 02:15:03.540
went out of the best intentions as young people

02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:05.900
to do the right thing and make things right.

02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:07.180
And I respect that.

02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:09.980
And I've met enough to know that there were people

02:15:09.980 --> 02:15:12.180
who saw the gray in complexity

02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:14.460
and that's all you can hope for.

02:15:16.340 --> 02:15:19.340
But we don't want a generation of disillusioned veterans.

02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:23.460
If we look at the other post-war moments,

02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:24.540
and this is kind of a post-war moment

02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:27.060
where I think we need a conversation

02:15:27.060 --> 02:15:29.300
with American veterans about what they've gone through

02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:31.020
and what they're feeling.

02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:33.100
And they still have skin in the game

02:15:33.100 --> 02:15:33.940
because their personal connections

02:15:33.940 --> 02:15:35.500
and the end of their histories.

02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:37.260
And they're also gonna be future leaders.

02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:41.460
I mean, veterans, people who have served

02:15:41.460 --> 02:15:43.940
are often great men and women.

02:15:43.940 --> 02:15:45.060
That's true.

02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:50.100
And throughout history,

02:15:50.140 --> 02:15:54.540
whether you sacrifice, you served in fighting World War II,

02:15:54.540 --> 02:15:55.980
in fighting Vietnam,

02:15:55.980 --> 02:15:58.820
that's going to mold you in different ways.

02:15:58.820 --> 02:16:02.660
That's going to mold how you are as a leader

02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:04.780
that leads this country forward.

02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:07.220
And so you have to have an honest conversation

02:16:07.220 --> 02:16:12.220
about what was the role of the war in Afghanistan,

02:16:13.700 --> 02:16:15.020
the war in the Middle East,

02:16:16.020 --> 02:16:18.060
the war on terror in the history of America.

02:16:18.060 --> 02:16:20.140
If we just look at the full context

02:16:20.140 --> 02:16:22.380
at the end of this 21st century,

02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:24.420
how we're going to remember this

02:16:24.420 --> 02:16:27.820
and how that's going to result in our future interactions

02:16:27.820 --> 02:16:30.580
with small and large countries,

02:16:30.580 --> 02:16:32.900
with China or some proxy war with China,

02:16:32.900 --> 02:16:36.460
with Russia or some proxy war with Russia.

02:16:36.460 --> 02:16:39.220
What's the role of oil and natural resources and opium

02:16:39.220 --> 02:16:40.660
and all those kinds of things?

02:16:40.660 --> 02:16:45.260
What's the role of military power in the world?

02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:50.260
And now with COVID, it's almost like because of the many

02:16:54.500 --> 02:16:58.860
failures of the US government and many leaders

02:17:00.540 --> 02:17:04.740
in science and politics to respond effectively

02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:07.860
and quickly to COVID,

02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:12.340
we kind of forget that we fumbled this other thing too.

02:17:12.340 --> 02:17:15.380
And it's hard to know which is going to be more expensive.

02:17:17.380 --> 02:17:19.660
They seem to be symptoms of something

02:17:21.860 --> 02:17:26.860
of a same kind of source problem of leadership,

02:17:28.140 --> 02:17:32.860
of bureaucracy, of the way information and intelligence

02:17:32.860 --> 02:17:34.540
flows throughout the US government,

02:17:34.540 --> 02:17:35.700
all those kinds of things.

02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:39.340
And that hopefully motivates young leaders to fix things.

02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:40.180
Definitely.

02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:41.140
I mean, I think if there's one theme

02:17:41.140 --> 02:17:43.060
that jumps out to me and thinking about this moment,

02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:45.980
I mean, if we recognize that we live in a kind of crisis

02:17:45.980 --> 02:17:49.340
of democracy in the United States and in other countries

02:17:49.340 --> 02:17:51.820
that have long been proud of their democratic traditions,

02:17:51.820 --> 02:17:54.220
if we see them being under assault from certain quarters,

02:17:54.220 --> 02:17:57.700
I think military defeat is yet another addition

02:17:57.700 --> 02:18:00.020
to all the aspects of this that you mentioned.

02:18:00.020 --> 02:18:04.020
I mean, the fact of military defeat is a giant match

02:18:04.020 --> 02:18:05.020
that you're throwing on this fire,

02:18:05.020 --> 02:18:07.820
potentially, if we think of its legacies

02:18:07.820 --> 02:18:09.140
and other post-war environments,

02:18:09.140 --> 02:18:12.740
when the veteran angle is one,

02:18:12.740 --> 02:18:15.540
when you have people who feel betrayed.

02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:17.100
I mean, they have been fodder

02:18:17.100 --> 02:18:18.620
for the far right in other settings.

02:18:18.620 --> 02:18:19.860
I mean, Interwar Europe is very much

02:18:19.860 --> 02:18:23.060
about mobilizing disillusioned veterans

02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:25.300
in the name of right-wing fascist politics.

02:18:26.620 --> 02:18:28.980
If one thing's two at this moment,

02:18:28.980 --> 02:18:32.100
of really increasing xenophobia,

02:18:32.100 --> 02:18:34.620
our immigration debate is now talking about

02:18:34.620 --> 02:18:36.420
whether or not Afghans should be permitted at all

02:18:36.420 --> 02:18:39.020
in the United States after 20 years.

02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:41.540
And I think immediately the response in Europe,

02:18:41.540 --> 02:18:44.300
which I followed to some extent focusing on Germany,

02:18:45.220 --> 02:18:49.100
because it was really ramping up deportations of Afghans,

02:18:49.100 --> 02:18:50.820
leading up this collapse.

02:18:50.820 --> 02:18:52.140
And now they have been,

02:18:53.540 --> 02:18:57.060
a lot of right-wing center-right politicians in Germany

02:18:57.060 --> 02:19:01.220
have been watching all this with an eye to,

02:19:01.220 --> 02:19:02.500
I think using it to their advantage

02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:06.380
for a domestic German audience to say,

02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:07.700
in the context of recent elections,

02:19:07.700 --> 02:19:09.820
that we're the party who will defend you

02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:11.460
against these Afghans who are gonna be coming from this.

02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:13.420
So what I've tried to emphasize

02:19:13.420 --> 02:19:15.180
in talking to different groups about this moment

02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:17.740
is that it won't be confined to Afghanistan

02:19:17.740 --> 02:19:18.580
or even the region.

02:19:18.580 --> 02:19:20.700
I mean, obviously, malnutrition, hunger,

02:19:20.700 --> 02:19:23.140
will send Afghans to neighboring states.

02:19:23.140 --> 02:19:27.220
But where the European right is resurgent,

02:19:27.220 --> 02:19:28.660
this has been a gift, right?

02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:30.740
To say that the Afghans are coming,

02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:32.540
they're brown-skinned, they're Muslim,

02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:35.060
they're uneducated, they're gonna want your women.

02:19:35.060 --> 02:19:37.940
And they will take the odd sexual assault case

02:19:37.940 --> 02:19:41.540
or the odd, whatever, dramatic act of violence

02:19:41.540 --> 02:19:45.460
that happens numerically in any population,

02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:47.140
and they'll magnify that to say that

02:19:49.100 --> 02:19:51.820
our far-right group is gonna save the nation.

02:19:51.820 --> 02:19:54.740
And sorry, the main point I wanted to speak of leadership

02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:56.820
was that I think the serial,

02:19:56.820 --> 02:20:00.260
well, there are many, many carnal sins, if you like,

02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:02.660
but if you go back to our analogy of all the exits,

02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:04.820
I mean, what blocked some of those exits

02:20:04.820 --> 02:20:09.740
was an absence of truth and transparency and the lying.

02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:12.180
And so, I mean, this is no secret to anyone who's followed

02:20:12.180 --> 02:20:15.220
this, but we've allowed,

02:20:15.220 --> 02:20:17.540
and you think of the general mistrust of government,

02:20:17.540 --> 02:20:21.900
mistrust of authority across the board,

02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:26.820
of professors, of economists, of scientists, doctors, right?

02:20:26.820 --> 02:20:28.980
Well, I actually think that's the hopeful thing to me

02:20:28.980 --> 02:20:33.980
about the internet is the internet hates inauthenticity.

02:20:34.180 --> 02:20:36.220
They can smell bullshit much better,

02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:38.340
and I think that motivates young leaders

02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:40.620
to be transparent and authentic.

02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:45.300
So the very problems we've been seeing,

02:20:45.300 --> 02:20:49.220
this kind of attitude of authority where,

02:20:49.220 --> 02:20:53.260
oh, the populace, they're too busy with their own lives,

02:20:53.260 --> 02:20:56.140
they're not smart enough to understand the full complexities

02:20:56.140 --> 02:20:57.620
of the things we're dealing with,

02:20:57.620 --> 02:20:59.820
so we're not going to even communicate to them

02:20:59.820 --> 02:21:02.900
the full complexities, we're just going to decide

02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:05.340
and then tell them what we decided

02:21:05.340 --> 02:21:08.100
and conceive some kind of narrative

02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:12.340
that makes it easy for them to consume this decision.

02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:17.780
As opposed to that, I really believe I see there's a hunger

02:21:17.780 --> 02:21:21.780
for authenticity of when you're making decisions,

02:21:21.780 --> 02:21:23.780
when you're looking at the rest of the world

02:21:23.780 --> 02:21:27.540
and trying to decide, untangle this complexity,

02:21:27.540 --> 02:21:31.860
the internet, the public, the world wants to see you

02:21:31.860 --> 02:21:35.460
as a leader struggle with the tension of these ideas,

02:21:35.460 --> 02:21:40.380
to change your mind, to recognize your own flaws

02:21:40.380 --> 02:21:42.180
and your own thinking from a month ago,

02:21:42.180 --> 02:21:44.300
all that, the full complexity of it,

02:21:44.300 --> 02:21:47.660
also acknowledge the uncertainty as with COVID,

02:21:47.660 --> 02:21:51.820
also with the wars, I think there's a hunger for that,

02:21:51.820 --> 02:21:53.340
and I think that's just going to change

02:21:53.340 --> 02:21:56.300
the nature of leadership in the 21st century.

02:21:56.300 --> 02:21:58.580
I hope so, I think all the things you highlighted,

02:21:58.580 --> 02:22:00.820
I mean, accountability is part of that, right?

02:22:00.820 --> 02:22:04.700
I mean, we need honesty, openness,

02:22:04.700 --> 02:22:06.780
and then acknowledgement of mistakes,

02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:08.860
humility is the key to all learning, right?

02:22:08.860 --> 02:22:11.660
But also, I mean, you think just the headline from yesterday,

02:22:11.660 --> 02:22:15.500
the horrible drone strike, which was really the last

02:22:15.500 --> 02:22:19.540
kind of American military action on the day that the US

02:22:19.540 --> 02:22:22.620
was, I think, mostly departing from Kabul,

02:22:22.620 --> 02:22:25.460
wiped out an entire family, mostly children.

02:22:25.460 --> 02:22:26.980
You know, the US acknowledged that, yes,

02:22:26.980 --> 02:22:31.260
this was not the ISIS bombing outfit that they thought it was,

02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:33.620
but yesterday, they did a quick review.

02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:36.900
I'm not an expert on drone strikes and their aftermath,

02:22:36.900 --> 02:22:38.900
but those who looked at it more closely said

02:22:38.900 --> 02:22:42.580
it was basically whole cloth taken from

02:22:42.580 --> 02:22:44.860
what the US government has been saying

02:22:44.860 --> 02:22:46.940
after all these strikes, you know,

02:22:46.940 --> 02:22:49.420
reproducing the same language and basically pointing

02:22:49.420 --> 02:22:52.940
to tentacle errors, but denying that there were

02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:58.340
any procedural mistakes or flaws,

02:22:58.340 --> 02:23:00.380
or it was just kind of, yeah, they found little ways

02:23:00.380 --> 02:23:02.580
of acknowledging things that goes planned,

02:23:02.580 --> 02:23:06.300
but, you know, we follow the policies, essentially,

02:23:06.300 --> 02:23:08.020
and, yeah, that's it.

02:23:08.020 --> 02:23:09.660
It's not a crime.

02:23:09.660 --> 02:23:13.660
It's a way of not even saying, you know, we screwed up.

02:23:13.660 --> 02:23:17.820
And it's kind of the legalese that suddenly makes

02:23:17.860 --> 02:23:19.700
a war crime, not a war crime, you know,

02:23:19.700 --> 02:23:24.700
and that is a refusal to take accountability.

02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:26.700
I think people are really sick of that

02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:29.580
in a way where the opposite is true,

02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:33.660
which is they get excited for people who are not,

02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:35.540
for leaders who are not that,

02:23:35.540 --> 02:23:39.020
and so they're not going to punish you for saying,

02:23:39.020 --> 02:23:40.220
I made a mistake.

02:23:40.220 --> 02:23:41.620
Yeah, yeah.

02:23:41.620 --> 02:23:44.740
I just had a conversation with Francis Collins,

02:23:44.740 --> 02:23:48.060
the director of NIH, and part of my criticism

02:23:48.060 --> 02:23:53.060
towards Anthony Fauci has been that it's like such subtle,

02:23:54.180 --> 02:23:58.900
but such crucial communication of mistakes made.

02:23:58.900 --> 02:24:02.460
If you make a small mistake, it is so powerful

02:24:02.460 --> 02:24:05.500
to communicate, I think we messed up.

02:24:05.500 --> 02:24:08.620
We thought this was true, and it wasn't.

02:24:08.620 --> 02:24:11.180
So the obvious thing there was with masks

02:24:11.180 --> 02:24:13.220
early in the pandemic.

02:24:13.220 --> 02:24:14.620
There's so much uncertainty.

02:24:15.500 --> 02:24:17.020
It's so understandable to make mistakes

02:24:17.020 --> 02:24:21.140
or to also be concerned about what kind of hysteria,

02:24:21.140 --> 02:24:23.420
different statements you make lead to.

02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:25.780
Just being transparent about that and saying,

02:24:25.780 --> 02:24:28.100
we were not correct in saying the thing we said before.

02:24:28.100 --> 02:24:33.100
That's so powerful to communicate, to gain trust.

02:24:33.340 --> 02:24:35.180
And the opposite is true.

02:24:35.180 --> 02:24:38.580
When you do this legalese type of talk,

02:24:38.580 --> 02:24:40.780
it destroys trust.

02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:45.780
And again, I really think the lessons of recent history

02:24:47.220 --> 02:24:51.100
teach us how to be a leader

02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:54.420
and teach young leaders how to be leaders.

02:24:54.420 --> 02:24:56.180
So I have a lot of hope.

02:24:56.180 --> 02:24:57.020
Yeah, good.

02:24:57.020 --> 02:24:58.580
Partially thanks for the internet.

02:24:58.580 --> 02:25:00.140
Yeah, yeah, that's great, yeah.

02:25:00.140 --> 02:25:03.580
Humility, we need humility, accountability, honesty.

02:25:05.340 --> 02:25:07.660
And yes, studying the past is an important way to do that.

02:25:07.660 --> 02:25:09.700
I mean, to learn from past mistakes.

02:25:10.220 --> 02:25:11.860
Obviously, there's always inspiration and courage

02:25:11.860 --> 02:25:14.660
and we can take some kind of assistance from that too.

02:25:14.660 --> 02:25:19.060
But also learning how not to do things, right?

02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:23.100
And then analogies are never like one-to-one.

02:25:23.100 --> 02:25:24.220
I mean, we talk about Vietnam.

02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:27.260
I mean, I think many Vietnam veterans would say,

02:25:27.260 --> 02:25:28.460
this is like deja vu.

02:25:28.460 --> 02:25:31.700
I mean, the story, the visuals of the Kabul airport

02:25:31.700 --> 02:25:35.540
and of the Saigon embassy were not the same,

02:25:35.540 --> 02:25:38.180
but close enough that people would just expose them.

02:25:38.180 --> 02:25:39.580
All of this for now, but I would just ask people

02:25:40.580 --> 02:25:44.780
that over-analogizing is also a kind of path down,

02:25:44.780 --> 02:25:49.620
making errors of judgment and comparison and then sameness.

02:25:50.660 --> 02:25:52.380
But it's stretch, I mean, like 9-11 itself.

02:25:52.380 --> 02:25:56.580
I think the idea that people lack the imagination

02:25:56.580 --> 02:25:58.100
within our security apparatus

02:25:58.100 --> 02:26:00.540
to think this was even possible, right?

02:26:00.540 --> 02:26:03.380
And you think of the simplicity of having a $10 lock

02:26:03.380 --> 02:26:06.380
on a cockpit door could have wanted all this.

02:26:06.380 --> 02:26:09.500
And again, I'm not saying either the time

02:26:10.340 --> 02:26:11.780
or in hindsight that I am omission about all this,

02:26:11.780 --> 02:26:15.100
but I had just been living in Germany the year before

02:26:15.100 --> 02:26:16.980
and there was a plot there.

02:26:16.980 --> 02:26:18.780
This guy was hatching from Germany

02:26:18.780 --> 02:26:21.180
to blow up the mausoleum of Atatürk

02:26:21.180 --> 02:26:23.580
and Ankara with an airplane.

02:26:23.580 --> 02:26:27.460
And so if you kind of dig, it wasn't unimaginable

02:26:27.460 --> 02:26:29.700
that you would use an airplane as a weapon.

02:26:29.700 --> 02:26:31.580
And the Bush administration kept saying,

02:26:31.580 --> 02:26:32.900
no one had ever heard of this.

02:26:32.900 --> 02:26:33.740
Who would do this?

02:26:33.740 --> 02:26:35.540
Like, well, not a lot of people do this.

02:26:35.540 --> 02:26:37.180
And then at that very moment,

02:26:37.180 --> 02:26:39.820
my wife was teaching the Joseph Conrad novel,

02:26:39.820 --> 02:26:44.100
Secret Agent, which was about a conspiratorial organization

02:26:44.100 --> 02:26:47.500
that wanted to bomb, actually in retrospect,

02:26:47.500 --> 02:26:48.940
it was kind of suicide bombing

02:26:48.940 --> 02:26:50.660
because I think they tricked this guy into doing it,

02:26:50.660 --> 02:26:53.500
but they wanted to bomb the Greenwich Observatory

02:26:53.500 --> 02:26:55.340
for some obscure political purpose.

02:26:57.140 --> 02:27:00.860
So that's an instance in which the novel, right?

02:27:00.860 --> 02:27:03.140
To go back to our kind of humanities pitch, right?

02:27:03.140 --> 02:27:06.420
I guess my point was that as you mentioned,

02:27:06.420 --> 02:27:09.900
we need humanity, transparency, but also imagination, right?

02:27:09.900 --> 02:27:14.060
I think part of expanding our imagination is by,

02:27:14.060 --> 02:27:16.540
I mean, obviously delving into your fields

02:27:16.540 --> 02:27:18.980
of engineering and the sciences and robotics

02:27:18.980 --> 02:27:20.820
and artificial intelligence and all that rich landscape.

02:27:20.820 --> 02:27:24.700
And then, but also we find this in film, poetry, literature,

02:27:24.700 --> 02:27:28.460
I mean, just the kind of stretching that we need to do

02:27:28.460 --> 02:27:31.420
to really educate ourselves more fully, right?

02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:34.820
Across the spectrum of everything humans need

02:27:34.900 --> 02:27:37.700
to imagine, to reimagine security.

02:27:37.700 --> 02:27:39.820
So much of what we talk about today, I mean,

02:27:39.820 --> 02:27:43.860
so much of our security is affected by others' perception

02:27:43.860 --> 02:27:45.340
of their insecurity, right?

02:27:46.580 --> 02:27:49.620
Which unleashes a whole web of emotions.

02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:53.940
Can you tell me about the Afghan people,

02:27:53.940 --> 02:27:57.020
what they love, what they fear,

02:27:57.020 --> 02:28:00.100
what they dream of for themselves and for their nation?

02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:02.020
Is there something to say,

02:28:02.060 --> 02:28:04.860
to speak to, to the spirit of the people

02:28:04.860 --> 02:28:09.620
that may humanize them and maybe speak to the concerns

02:28:09.620 --> 02:28:10.820
and the hopes they have?

02:28:12.020 --> 02:28:13.940
Yeah, I think I, you know, as an outsider,

02:28:13.940 --> 02:28:16.340
I hesitate to make any grand statement,

02:28:16.340 --> 02:28:17.940
but I would say, listen, I mean,

02:28:19.020 --> 02:28:21.540
there are a number of documentary films

02:28:21.540 --> 02:28:23.420
that are incredibly rich

02:28:23.420 --> 02:28:26.180
that will offer your listeners a snapshot.

02:28:26.180 --> 02:28:29.460
So there is Afghan Star, you know,

02:28:29.460 --> 02:28:30.460
which really brings you in the homes

02:28:30.460 --> 02:28:34.260
of a set of people who, you know, they want stardom,

02:28:34.260 --> 02:28:36.660
they're artists, they want to express themselves.

02:28:36.660 --> 02:28:39.900
Some want to push political boundaries, cultural boundaries.

02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:42.620
There's a woman who gets into hot water for dancing.

02:28:42.620 --> 02:28:46.420
But, you know, you realize that, I mean, people,

02:28:46.420 --> 02:28:47.980
I mean, they love art, they love music,

02:28:47.980 --> 02:28:50.660
they love poetry, they love expression.

02:28:50.660 --> 02:28:52.780
You know, people want to care for their children.

02:28:52.780 --> 02:28:54.220
They want safety of their families.

02:28:54.220 --> 02:28:57.540
They want to enjoy what everyone enjoys, you know?

02:28:57.540 --> 02:29:00.580
I think it's a very humanizing portrait.

02:29:00.580 --> 02:29:02.580
There's another great documentary film called

02:29:04.500 --> 02:29:05.740
Love Crimes of Kabul,

02:29:06.660 --> 02:29:10.060
which is a great snapshot of the post-2000 world

02:29:10.060 --> 02:29:11.540
that the Americans shaped a lot of ways.

02:29:11.540 --> 02:29:13.620
And it's about a women's prison.

02:29:13.620 --> 02:29:15.540
And it's incredibly revealing

02:29:15.540 --> 02:29:19.860
because it's about young girls and what they want.

02:29:19.860 --> 02:29:22.260
Well, not just young, but young, teenage,

02:29:22.260 --> 02:29:23.420
and then some middle-aged people

02:29:23.420 --> 02:29:26.220
who are accused of moral crimes,

02:29:26.220 --> 02:29:29.940
ranging from homicide, which one woman admits to,

02:29:29.940 --> 02:29:33.740
to having sexual relations outside of marriage.

02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:35.740
And so it shows, in a way,

02:29:35.740 --> 02:29:38.660
continuity with the previous Taliban regime

02:29:38.660 --> 02:29:41.100
and that women are in prison for things

02:29:41.100 --> 02:29:42.340
that you wouldn't be in prison for elsewhere

02:29:42.340 --> 02:29:44.020
and that Islamic law operates

02:29:44.020 --> 02:29:49.020
as the kind of judicial logic for these punishments.

02:29:50.220 --> 02:29:52.740
But in letting these women kind of speak for themselves,

02:29:52.740 --> 02:29:53.580
I mean, it's fascinating.

02:29:53.580 --> 02:29:55.140
I mean, I don't want to get too much away,

02:29:55.140 --> 02:29:58.860
but women make ranging choices in this film

02:29:58.860 --> 02:30:00.340
that land them in this predicament.

02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:04.140
So they don't all profess innocence.

02:30:04.140 --> 02:30:05.180
Some are like, I'm guilty,

02:30:05.180 --> 02:30:07.020
but they're guilty for reasons.

02:30:07.020 --> 02:30:09.220
In one case, one woman is guilty, she's in prison,

02:30:09.220 --> 02:30:12.140
because it's a way to exert pressure on her fiance

02:30:12.140 --> 02:30:14.620
to finally marry her, you know?

02:30:14.620 --> 02:30:18.220
So you get ethnicity, you get kind of Romeo and Juliet

02:30:18.220 --> 02:30:19.060
things where their families

02:30:19.060 --> 02:30:20.620
don't like each other necessarily,

02:30:20.620 --> 02:30:22.060
but they find each other.

02:30:22.100 --> 02:30:26.380
You have questions of love, money, clothing, furniture.

02:30:27.780 --> 02:30:28.620
It's beautiful.

02:30:28.620 --> 02:30:31.060
I mean, the parts with it, I remember showing it in class.

02:30:31.060 --> 02:30:32.460
There was a wonderful Afghan student

02:30:32.460 --> 02:30:35.980
who was I think a Fulbright at the Ed School at Stanford,

02:30:35.980 --> 02:30:37.660
and she's a genius, she's amazing.

02:30:38.980 --> 02:30:39.820
You know, it was awkward for her

02:30:39.820 --> 02:30:42.380
because talking about young women having sex and stuff,

02:30:42.380 --> 02:30:46.860
and it wasn't the snapshot of Afghanistan that she wanted.

02:30:46.860 --> 02:30:47.780
And obviously there's so much more.

02:30:47.780 --> 02:30:50.460
They're great writers and musicians.

02:30:51.460 --> 02:30:52.300
Music is a huge thing.

02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:54.460
I mean, poetry, all these things are great.

02:30:55.420 --> 02:30:57.540
So she found it, you know, I hear you.

02:30:57.540 --> 02:30:59.140
I mean, it's kind of a taboo subject,

02:30:59.140 --> 02:31:02.260
but I thought the American students seeing it

02:31:02.260 --> 02:31:04.820
really identified with these women,

02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:05.740
because they're just so real.

02:31:05.740 --> 02:31:08.620
And so, you know, young people trying to find like,

02:31:08.620 --> 02:31:10.940
I mean, relationships that are universal,

02:31:11.860 --> 02:31:14.860
in circumstances that are very difficult.

02:31:14.860 --> 02:31:17.180
Love, love is universal.

02:31:17.180 --> 02:31:18.980
I mean, we do have resources to humanize.

02:31:18.980 --> 02:31:21.060
I mean, you know, some of your people will know

02:31:21.060 --> 02:31:23.820
Khaled Husseini, you know, he's an African American.

02:31:23.820 --> 02:31:28.220
He's done his stuff, but there are a number of novelists

02:31:28.220 --> 02:31:30.460
and short story writers who do cool things.

02:31:30.460 --> 02:31:33.380
And I think that another tragic aspect of this moment

02:31:33.380 --> 02:31:35.140
is that those people have now pretty much

02:31:35.140 --> 02:31:36.220
had to leave the country.

02:31:36.220 --> 02:31:40.020
So there's a visual artist I would highlight for you

02:31:40.020 --> 02:31:45.020
named Khadam Ali, who's a Hazara based in Australia.

02:31:45.860 --> 02:31:49.580
He does extraordinary work in blending a tradition

02:31:49.580 --> 02:31:53.900
of Persian miniatures with contemporary political commentary.

02:31:55.540 --> 02:31:57.060
His work is between Australia and Afghanistan,

02:31:57.060 --> 02:31:58.340
but he also, he had to flee.

02:31:58.340 --> 02:32:00.220
I mean, he was doing some work in Kabul,

02:32:00.220 --> 02:32:05.220
but it's a extraordinary kind of visual language

02:32:05.380 --> 02:32:07.660
that he's adapted that has been shown all over the planet now.

02:32:07.660 --> 02:32:09.340
He's got some of his work is in New York galleries,

02:32:09.340 --> 02:32:12.180
is in Europe, he's been shown in Australia,

02:32:12.180 --> 02:32:14.340
but he talks about migration in a way

02:32:14.340 --> 02:32:17.340
that puts Afghans and Hazaras at the center,

02:32:17.340 --> 02:32:21.260
but it's totally universal about, you know,

02:32:21.260 --> 02:32:24.300
our modern crisis of all the mainstream people

02:32:24.300 --> 02:32:25.820
who are displaced across our planet.

02:32:25.820 --> 02:32:29.460
And he attempts to kind of speak for some size of them

02:32:29.460 --> 02:32:32.300
in a way that like, I think everyone can get.

02:32:32.300 --> 02:32:33.740
I mean, the visual imagery experts will know

02:32:33.740 --> 02:32:36.940
that it's from, you know, like the Shahnameh,

02:32:36.940 --> 02:32:38.700
like an ancient Persian, you know, epic

02:32:38.700 --> 02:32:39.940
that Iranians were attached to,

02:32:39.940 --> 02:32:40.940
that Afghans are attached to,

02:32:40.940 --> 02:32:44.180
that people can quote, you know, at length.

02:32:44.180 --> 02:32:45.620
That has mythical figures of good and evil

02:32:45.620 --> 02:32:47.980
that kids grow up embodying.

02:32:47.980 --> 02:32:50.940
They're named, the names of the characters that are,

02:32:50.940 --> 02:32:53.100
it's called, you know, the book of kings.

02:32:53.100 --> 02:32:55.660
The heroes and villains are the staple of conversation

02:32:55.660 --> 02:33:00.180
and poetry and, you know, like Russians.

02:33:00.180 --> 02:33:02.020
I mean, the kind of,

02:33:02.020 --> 02:33:03.740
the resort to literary references and speak

02:33:03.740 --> 02:33:05.900
is something that, you know, Americans don't do,

02:33:05.900 --> 02:33:08.020
most West European countries don't do,

02:33:08.020 --> 02:33:10.020
but the fact that everyone's got to know this character,

02:33:10.020 --> 02:33:12.620
everyone knows this reference, the wordplay,

02:33:12.620 --> 02:33:16.180
the linguistic finesse in multiple languages

02:33:16.180 --> 02:33:20.620
is, you know, a major value of Afghan storytelling.

02:33:21.620 --> 02:33:24.140
As an outsider, I'm scratching it

02:33:24.140 --> 02:33:25.300
the surface of the surface.

02:33:25.300 --> 02:33:26.460
Yeah, but there's a depth to it.

02:33:26.460 --> 02:33:28.060
It's just like, it is fascinating.

02:33:28.060 --> 02:33:29.060
The layers, yeah.

02:33:29.060 --> 02:33:31.660
With the layers of Russian language that's-

02:33:31.660 --> 02:33:32.500
Exactly.

02:33:32.500 --> 02:33:36.060
The culture, it's a, I've been struggling

02:33:36.060 --> 02:33:40.300
and this is kind of the journey I'm embarking on

02:33:40.300 --> 02:33:43.180
to convey to an American audience

02:33:43.180 --> 02:33:46.220
what is lost in translation

02:33:46.220 --> 02:33:47.860
between Russian and English.

02:33:47.860 --> 02:33:49.820
And it's very challenging

02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:52.780
and some of the great translators of the CS gift,

02:33:52.780 --> 02:33:56.660
Tolstoy of Russian literature struggle with this deeply

02:33:56.660 --> 02:34:01.260
and they work, it's an art form just to convey that.

02:34:01.260 --> 02:34:03.780
And it's amazing to hear that Afghanistan

02:34:03.780 --> 02:34:06.700
with the full mix of cultures that are there

02:34:06.740 --> 02:34:10.980
have the same kind of wit and humor and depth of-

02:34:10.980 --> 02:34:13.140
I mean, the humor thing is, that's, you know,

02:34:13.140 --> 02:34:15.340
I'm so into our visual imagery is about like this sad place

02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:18.580
and Dower or whatever, but the, I mean, socially, again,

02:34:18.580 --> 02:34:19.820
I'm gonna engage in some stereotypes

02:34:19.820 --> 02:34:22.020
about generalization stuff, but just the,

02:34:22.980 --> 02:34:25.260
you know, the Afghan friends that I've come to

02:34:25.260 --> 02:34:28.420
be close with and really love, I mean, the humor,

02:34:28.420 --> 02:34:31.380
there's so much there of common stuff of like,

02:34:31.380 --> 02:34:33.380
when I go to Ireland, it's one of my favorite places

02:34:33.380 --> 02:34:36.300
and just like the, I feel a sense of pressure,

02:34:36.300 --> 02:34:38.100
like the humor all around me all the time.

02:34:38.100 --> 02:34:40.220
I feel like there's something between Ireland

02:34:40.220 --> 02:34:43.420
like Ireland and Russia with the humor stuff

02:34:43.420 --> 02:34:45.300
where it's like, you've got to be on your game

02:34:45.300 --> 02:34:47.100
if you want to be, you know, so it's-

02:34:47.100 --> 02:34:51.220
Yeah, I feel like the intensity of conversation

02:34:52.220 --> 02:34:54.300
in terms of, yeah, you have to be on your game

02:34:54.300 --> 02:34:56.060
in terms of wit and so on.

02:34:56.060 --> 02:34:58.420
I mean, you have to, there's certain people I have,

02:34:58.420 --> 02:35:01.140
like when I talk on this podcast, they're like that,

02:35:01.140 --> 02:35:03.420
certain people from the Jewish tradition have that.

02:35:03.420 --> 02:35:04.260
Totally.

02:35:04.260 --> 02:35:05.860
Like where the wit is just like, okay,

02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:09.380
I really have to pay attention.

02:35:09.380 --> 02:35:10.220
It's a game.

02:35:10.220 --> 02:35:12.420
It's like, you know what it feels like?

02:35:12.420 --> 02:35:14.700
It feels like speed chess or something like that.

02:35:14.700 --> 02:35:17.420
And you really have to focus and play.

02:35:17.420 --> 02:35:19.900
And at the same time, there's body language in the,

02:35:19.900 --> 02:35:22.260
and then there's a melancholy nature to it,

02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:23.540
at least in the Russian side.

02:35:23.540 --> 02:35:25.780
And the whole thing is just a beautiful mess.

02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:27.060
Yeah, I mean, there's a funny TikTok video

02:35:27.060 --> 02:35:29.660
that went around that I got from like some Afghan

02:35:29.660 --> 02:35:33.140
acquaintances that was, he's an Irish comedian

02:35:33.140 --> 02:35:35.860
kind of highlighting, you know,

02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:38.100
kind of Irish and German national stereotypes

02:35:38.100 --> 02:35:39.740
around hospitality.

02:35:39.740 --> 02:35:41.580
And this Afghan mom said, you know,

02:35:41.580 --> 02:35:44.980
I didn't know that the Irish were just white Afghans

02:35:44.980 --> 02:35:45.900
because the whole like, you know,

02:35:45.900 --> 02:35:48.420
the hospitality like politics of like, of refusal,

02:35:48.420 --> 02:35:51.140
you know, you don't take something

02:35:51.140 --> 02:35:52.180
that's offered to you the first time.

02:35:52.180 --> 02:35:56.820
You don't, I mean, it's the culture of receiving a guest.

02:35:56.820 --> 02:35:59.300
You know, that's, you know, Americans aren't,

02:35:59.300 --> 02:36:01.460
I mean, that's not, you know, that's not always,

02:36:01.460 --> 02:36:02.300
I mean, they're different,

02:36:02.300 --> 02:36:03.500
there's other regional cultures where that's a thing.

02:36:03.500 --> 02:36:05.220
There's whatever, but it's, I mean,

02:36:05.220 --> 02:36:08.580
the kind of like generosity and the kind of, you know,

02:36:08.580 --> 02:36:09.460
that's real.

02:36:09.460 --> 02:36:11.460
I mean, that's, and that's a cool thing.

02:36:11.460 --> 02:36:12.300
And that's amazing.

02:36:12.300 --> 02:36:13.620
That's, you know, the food, I mean,

02:36:13.620 --> 02:36:16.380
going on with just the superficial things,

02:36:16.380 --> 02:36:19.060
but all of that, the warmth of hospitality

02:36:19.060 --> 02:36:22.540
and of wit and humanity.

02:36:22.540 --> 02:36:25.860
I mean, it's, that's what we don't see viewing the place

02:36:25.860 --> 02:36:27.740
just through war and geopolitics

02:36:27.740 --> 02:36:29.140
and the moving pieces of the map and stuff.

02:36:29.140 --> 02:36:31.740
And that's hard to see when, you know,

02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:34.940
there are gaps in language and in religious tradition

02:36:34.940 --> 02:36:35.860
and all that stuff.

02:36:35.860 --> 02:36:38.420
And then, you know, being open to the fact

02:36:38.420 --> 02:36:41.020
that people do things differently, you know,

02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:43.540
and it's, and the gender dimension there is important,

02:36:43.540 --> 02:36:46.900
right, that they're kind of, you know,

02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:48.820
arguably each culture has a kind of gender dynamic

02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:49.660
that's different.

02:36:49.660 --> 02:36:50.980
And so I think it's helpful to have humility

02:36:50.980 --> 02:36:53.140
in thinking that some Afghans

02:36:53.140 --> 02:36:55.700
will do something differently, you know.

02:36:55.700 --> 02:36:57.660
But then you'll also have Afghans who say,

02:36:58.620 --> 02:36:59.860
every woman should be educated,

02:36:59.860 --> 02:37:01.300
every woman should work and so on and so on.

02:37:01.300 --> 02:37:03.500
So there's no, there's no single way of, yeah.

02:37:03.500 --> 02:37:06.100
And there is a gender dynamic in Russia too.

02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:08.260
We need to be respectful of that, like.

02:37:08.260 --> 02:37:09.100
And that's not, that's not always

02:37:09.100 --> 02:37:10.100
what it looks like at first.

02:37:10.100 --> 02:37:10.940
Yeah, exactly.

02:37:10.940 --> 02:37:11.780
There's layers.

02:37:11.780 --> 02:37:14.340
Where power is, I mean, that's definitely, I don't know, yeah.

02:37:14.340 --> 02:37:16.100
Yeah, that's a whole nother conversation

02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:17.220
where the power is.

02:37:17.220 --> 02:37:18.220
Yeah.

02:37:18.220 --> 02:37:20.620
Rumi, the 13th century Persian poet

02:37:20.620 --> 02:37:23.980
who was born on a land that is now Afghanistan.

02:37:23.980 --> 02:37:26.940
Is there something in his words that speaks to you

02:37:26.940 --> 02:37:29.420
about the spirit of the Afghan people?

02:37:31.380 --> 02:37:33.060
I mean, everyone owns Rumi, I guess I'd say.

02:37:33.060 --> 02:37:34.060
I mean, that's gonna get me in trouble

02:37:34.060 --> 02:37:36.060
with certain Afghan fans of Rumi

02:37:36.060 --> 02:37:38.740
who want to see him as an Afghan.

02:37:38.740 --> 02:37:39.580
I would say.

02:37:40.500 --> 02:37:42.020
Are they proud of Rumi?

02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:42.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:37:42.860 --> 02:37:44.020
Do they see him as an Afghan?

02:37:44.020 --> 02:37:44.860
Do they?

02:37:44.860 --> 02:37:46.180
Yeah, I mean, it depends.

02:37:46.180 --> 02:37:49.860
I mean, some people will be militant and say,

02:37:49.860 --> 02:37:52.460
you know, the Iranian's gonna have him, he's ours.

02:37:53.500 --> 02:37:55.940
But they're also say, you know, he's,

02:37:55.940 --> 02:37:58.020
I mean, you can say, again, he's like Rorschach blood.

02:37:58.020 --> 02:38:00.940
I mean, he's a Sufi, he's a Muslim.

02:38:00.940 --> 02:38:04.140
He's a Central Asian, he's Iranian, he's Afghan.

02:38:05.020 --> 02:38:05.980
He's a Turk.

02:38:05.980 --> 02:38:06.820
I'm trying to think of the analogy,

02:38:06.820 --> 02:38:08.980
but he's something special to everyone.

02:38:08.980 --> 02:38:11.100
So I guess I would not walk into that conversation

02:38:11.100 --> 02:38:12.700
and claim that he's one or another,

02:38:12.700 --> 02:38:13.540
but it's a cool thing.

02:38:13.540 --> 02:38:15.900
I mean, it's the, but I'm glad you brought that up

02:38:15.900 --> 02:38:19.540
because that's a good way of seeing a,

02:38:19.540 --> 02:38:20.700
seeing something that Afghans,

02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:22.300
I mean, we live in a country that's Afghanistan

02:38:22.300 --> 02:38:23.940
and say, okay, Rumi's everyone.

02:38:23.940 --> 02:38:26.460
You know, Madonna helped make him famous in the United States,

02:38:26.460 --> 02:38:27.900
you know, for better, for worse.

02:38:27.900 --> 02:38:29.220
They used to sell stuff at Starbucks

02:38:29.220 --> 02:38:32.020
and that's all complicated and embarrassing.

02:38:32.020 --> 02:38:35.180
And his, his translations are very much disputed

02:38:35.180 --> 02:38:36.460
where you have people be like,

02:38:36.460 --> 02:38:38.900
there's some awful Rumi translations and there are,

02:38:38.900 --> 02:38:40.940
there are also a lot of, speaking of the internet,

02:38:40.940 --> 02:38:44.420
there are lots of fake Rumi quotes, you know, like,

02:38:44.420 --> 02:38:46.140
Rumi said, always be your best.

02:38:46.140 --> 02:38:48.660
Like, you know, Rumi didn't say that, you know, that was,

02:38:48.660 --> 02:38:49.500
I mean, that's kind of so-so with that,

02:38:49.500 --> 02:38:52.220
but then the cool thing is like the,

02:38:52.220 --> 02:38:56.420
I mean, I think you can read Rumi as a religious thinker,

02:38:56.460 --> 02:38:59.140
but you can also, you know, read Rumi as a,

02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:01.420
you know, in an Islamic sense,

02:39:01.420 --> 02:39:03.340
but you can also read him as a kind of spiritualist, right?

02:39:03.340 --> 02:39:05.260
As someone who, or an ethicist or moralist.

02:39:05.260 --> 02:39:07.060
And so I think that's,

02:39:07.060 --> 02:39:12.060
I like the lens of Rumi as a gateway to Afghan ecumenicism

02:39:12.740 --> 02:39:14.100
and cosmopolitanism.

02:39:14.100 --> 02:39:16.420
You know, the theme I keep emphasizing of,

02:39:16.420 --> 02:39:19.220
of meeting actual Afghans who were actually,

02:39:20.500 --> 02:39:22.380
you know, fluent in Russian, fluent in German,

02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:23.980
fluent in Turkish.

02:39:23.980 --> 02:39:25.740
They know Dari, they know Pashto.

02:39:27.180 --> 02:39:29.580
They've gone to university or sometimes they haven't.

02:39:29.580 --> 02:39:31.380
And yet, I mean, they're,

02:39:31.380 --> 02:39:35.340
I like the category of the popular intellectual.

02:39:35.340 --> 02:39:37.220
You know, the intellectual who isn't,

02:39:37.220 --> 02:39:38.940
isn't formally educated necessarily,

02:39:38.940 --> 02:39:40.500
although of course that's represented too,

02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:42.060
especially increasingly now with this generation

02:39:42.060 --> 02:39:43.540
of going to university all over the world,

02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:45.340
you know, Stanford, MIT, everywhere.

02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:48.340
Afghans are well represented there,

02:39:48.340 --> 02:39:50.260
but just being, I don't know,

02:39:50.260 --> 02:39:51.460
having kind of worldly knowledge

02:39:51.460 --> 02:39:54.220
that is not limited to a province,

02:39:54.220 --> 02:39:56.260
to a village, to a hamlet, but,

02:39:57.100 --> 02:39:58.900
sometimes it is, but sometimes it's not.

02:39:58.900 --> 02:40:02.900
Because of, again, not because of some fairy tale story

02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:06.020
of curiosity wandering the globe out of,

02:40:06.980 --> 02:40:09.420
you know, some sense of privilege,

02:40:09.420 --> 02:40:11.700
but out of necessity, out of survival,

02:40:11.700 --> 02:40:12.540
of having to adapt.

02:40:12.540 --> 02:40:15.420
And it's really extraordinary that,

02:40:15.420 --> 02:40:16.900
I mean, also let me think about like professions,

02:40:16.900 --> 02:40:20.940
like, you know, ask an Afghan, you know,

02:40:20.940 --> 02:40:22.820
what does he or she do for a living?

02:40:22.820 --> 02:40:23.940
And what have they done in the past?

02:40:23.940 --> 02:40:25.540
I mean, the answers one gets.

02:40:25.540 --> 02:40:30.540
Shoe salesman, task up drivers, surgeons, all in one guy.

02:40:31.380 --> 02:40:32.220
Yeah.

02:40:32.220 --> 02:40:34.020
I mean, that's not just Afghan,

02:40:34.020 --> 02:40:35.820
but that's, you know, that's very common.

02:40:35.820 --> 02:40:37.900
But it's also Russia is the same.

02:40:37.900 --> 02:40:38.740
That's right.

02:40:38.740 --> 02:40:40.460
I think it's whenever there's complexities

02:40:40.460 --> 02:40:43.620
to the economic system and the short term

02:40:43.620 --> 02:40:46.380
and the long term history of how the country develops,

02:40:46.380 --> 02:40:50.020
and it's basically the people figuring out their way

02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:53.860
around a mess of a country politically.

02:40:54.740 --> 02:40:59.380
But a beautiful flourishing culture and humanity.

02:40:59.380 --> 02:41:01.540
And that creates super interesting people.

02:41:02.660 --> 02:41:05.700
So we can often see, okay, there's Taliban, there's war,

02:41:05.700 --> 02:41:09.660
there's economic malfunction,

02:41:09.660 --> 02:41:11.020
there's harboring of terrorists,

02:41:11.020 --> 02:41:12.820
there's opium trade, all that kind of stuff.

02:41:12.820 --> 02:41:16.780
But there's humans there with deep intellectual lies.

02:41:18.020 --> 02:41:21.220
And like, I love the movie, Love Crimes,

02:41:21.260 --> 02:41:23.980
and the same kind of hopes, fears,

02:41:23.980 --> 02:41:27.740
and desire to love the old Romeo and Juliet story.

02:41:27.740 --> 02:41:30.060
And I think, Rumi to me represents that,

02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:34.180
the wit, the intelligence,

02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:39.180
but also the just eloquent and just beautiful representation

02:41:39.420 --> 02:41:40.900
of humanity, of love.

02:41:40.900 --> 02:41:44.740
Some of the best quotes about love are from him,

02:41:44.740 --> 02:41:48.140
half of them fake, half of them real.

02:41:48.140 --> 02:41:48.980
But-

02:41:48.980 --> 02:41:49.820
The best ones are real, right?

02:41:49.820 --> 02:41:50.660
The best ones are real.

02:41:50.900 --> 02:41:52.020
The best ones are real.

02:41:52.020 --> 02:41:53.860
Robert, this was an incredible conversation.

02:41:53.860 --> 02:41:54.700
Oh, thank you for having me.

02:41:54.700 --> 02:41:59.380
Thank you for the tour of Afghanistan

02:41:59.380 --> 02:42:02.980
and making me, making us realize that

02:42:03.980 --> 02:42:08.980
there's much more to this country than what we may think.

02:42:09.020 --> 02:42:13.500
It's a beautiful country and it's full of beautiful people.

02:42:13.500 --> 02:42:15.020
You made me think about a lot of new things too,

02:42:15.020 --> 02:42:17.460
so it was definitely great to be on my end too.

02:42:17.460 --> 02:42:19.300
So thank you so much.

02:42:19.340 --> 02:42:20.820
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:42:20.820 --> 02:42:22.060
with Robert Cruz.

02:42:28.020 --> 02:42:29.900
from Winston Churchill.

02:42:29.900 --> 02:42:32.060
History will be kind to me,

02:42:32.060 --> 02:42:34.660
for I intend to write it.

02:42:35.620 --> 02:42:38.500
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
