WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.960
And the nozzle, so as you're saying,

00:01.960 --> 00:04.640
there's a bunch of different design options,

00:04.640 --> 00:06.680
but it's a critical part of this,

00:06.680 --> 00:08.240
how you do that conversion.

00:08.240 --> 00:11.680
Which is basically like how much can you convert

00:11.680 --> 00:13.240
is really like the ultimate game.

00:13.240 --> 00:17.440
How much pressure and heat can we convert into thrust?

00:17.440 --> 00:18.560
Like that's really at the end of the day,

00:18.560 --> 00:20.120
that's what a rocket engine is.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.840
The following is a conversation with Tim Dodd,

00:24.840 --> 00:28.160
host of the Everyday Astronaut YouTube channel,

00:28.240 --> 00:31.500
where he educates and inspires all of us

00:31.500 --> 00:34.080
with detailed but accessible explanations

00:34.080 --> 00:38.240
of rocket engines and all things space travel.

00:38.240 --> 00:40.240
This is Alex Fridman podcast.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.600

00:43.600 --> 00:47.360
And now, dear friends, here's Tim Dodd.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.720
Can you give a brief history of SpaceX rockets?

00:51.720 --> 00:54.120
So we've got Falcon 1, Falcon 9,

00:54.120 --> 00:56.520
there's different versions of those, Falcon Heavy,

00:56.640 --> 00:59.160
Starship, and also the Dragon Capsules and so on.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.760
Well, yeah, Falcon 1 is where it all started.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.800
The original intent and the original idea of SpaceX

01:04.800 --> 01:08.000
was Elon wanted to try to get something to Mars.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.120
He saw that NASA didn't have a current Mars plan,

01:12.120 --> 01:13.400
and he wanted to go to Mars,

01:13.400 --> 01:16.520
so he decided how do I best do this?

01:16.520 --> 01:19.720
He literally wanted to at first purchase a rocket

01:19.720 --> 01:24.720
from Russia, then after a foiled attempt at doing that,

01:25.720 --> 01:28.760
he decided that he was gonna try to develop his own rocket.

01:28.760 --> 01:31.120
And the Falcon 1 is what came out of that process.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.480
And he developed a pretty incredible team.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.440
Like, I don't know how exactly he stumbled upon the team

01:35.440 --> 01:37.040
that he stumbled upon that quickly,

01:37.040 --> 01:39.200
but the people that he assembled were amazing.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.400
And they built the Falcon 1,

01:41.400 --> 01:43.520
which was a single Merlin engine,

01:43.520 --> 01:46.520
followed by an upper stage engine called the Kestrel engine.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.960
Pretty small compared to the things they're working on today,

01:49.960 --> 01:52.200
but that Merlin engine continued to evolve

01:53.200 --> 01:55.520
into being the power plant for the Falcon 9.

01:55.520 --> 01:57.000
They went from a small lift launch vehicle

01:57.000 --> 01:58.720
up into the medium class launch vehicle,

01:58.720 --> 02:00.720
so they could provide services for NASA.

02:01.640 --> 02:03.920
That's one of the big things they first kind of hung their hat up

02:03.920 --> 02:05.720
was they got the opportunity to fly cargo

02:05.720 --> 02:07.440
to the International Space Station

02:07.440 --> 02:10.160
under originally what's called the COTS program,

02:10.160 --> 02:14.080
the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services for NASA,

02:14.080 --> 02:16.800
which evolved into the commercial resupply contracts.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.720
And that's when SpaceX developed both their Dragon capsule,

02:19.880 --> 02:24.040
which is an uncrewed at first spacecraft

02:24.040 --> 02:27.080
that can dock to the ISS and the Falcon 9 rocket

02:27.080 --> 02:29.320
that can take it to the International Space Station.

02:29.320 --> 02:32.920
The Dragon rides on, it's the thing up top

02:32.920 --> 02:38.920
that rides on the big booster thing that launches it into orbit.

02:38.920 --> 02:42.520
Exactly, yep. The Falcon 9 is the semi-truck.

02:42.520 --> 02:45.400
The Dragon capsule is the payload.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.720
You know, it's the thing being dropped off

02:46.720 --> 02:48.000
basically at its destination.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.960
In this case, the destination is the International Space Station.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.560
And yeah, so they developed those relatively quickly

02:57.200 --> 03:00.400
and became a commercial success before you know it.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.400
They're now the number one launch provider in the world,

03:03.400 --> 03:06.280
launching more mass to orbit than anybody else,

03:06.280 --> 03:09.000
launching more frequently than countries,

03:10.120 --> 03:11.880
like the entire country of China

03:11.880 --> 03:13.360
who's going crazy right now with launches.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.200
Granted, China beat them by two launches this last in 2022,

03:16.200 --> 03:20.320
but the prior year SpaceX beat the entire country of China.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.600
I mean, it's nuts.

03:21.600 --> 03:26.120
And just like you said, SpaceX still beats China even this year

03:26.800 --> 03:28.680
in terms of the amount of payload that was done.

03:28.680 --> 03:30.440
The mass to orbit.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.560
Yeah, the mass to orbit, right.

03:32.560 --> 03:38.480
That China had like 60 something, a couple more launches,

03:38.480 --> 03:42.160
but there was just like small CubeSat type of launches.

03:42.160 --> 03:45.280
Exactly, some of them were literally like 100 kilograms

03:45.280 --> 03:47.360
or something, you know, like not large payloads.

03:47.360 --> 03:51.600
And so SpaceX customers are different.

03:51.600 --> 03:55.160
So whoever wants to send payloads up into space.

03:55.160 --> 03:58.440
Yes, but right now their biggest customer is actually themselves

03:58.440 --> 04:00.040
with Starlink.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.600
One of the biggest reasons they've launched so much mass to orbit

04:02.600 --> 04:06.080
is because Starlink is designed around the payload fairing

04:06.080 --> 04:08.880
and the payload capabilities of the Falcon 9 rocket.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.720
So, you know, because they're vertically integrated,

04:10.720 --> 04:12.160
because they build their own satellites,

04:12.160 --> 04:13.880
because they're building their own rocket,

04:13.960 --> 04:16.240
they can literally design a system that's, you know,

04:16.240 --> 04:19.480
another manufacturer might have made a more square satellite

04:19.480 --> 04:20.760
that was heavier or something.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.280
But SpaceX looked at it from a blank slate and said,

04:23.280 --> 04:24.800
here's our constraints,

04:24.800 --> 04:26.600
our payload mass constraints, our volume constraints.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.120
And they made a funky looking satellite,

04:28.120 --> 04:29.400
things like the size of a, you know,

04:29.400 --> 04:32.320
it's like a table folded up, which isn't anything I've,

04:32.320 --> 04:33.680
you know, really ever seen before.

04:33.680 --> 04:37.360
But it's purpose built to fit as efficiently as possible

04:37.360 --> 04:40.120
inside their fairing and inside the capabilities of that rocket.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.960
So therefore, because they're launching those

04:43.000 --> 04:45.600
like an insane amount, you know, a dozen, you know,

04:45.600 --> 04:47.440
40, 50 times a year or whatever,

04:48.560 --> 04:51.920
they're just putting up insane amounts of mass

04:51.920 --> 04:52.880
like we've never seen before.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.800
What about the different versions of Falcon 9

04:54.800 --> 04:55.920
that you've shown can linger on?

04:55.920 --> 04:57.880
What are some interesting memories to you

04:57.880 --> 04:59.960
of the different developments in Falcon 9?

04:59.960 --> 05:03.760
The very first Falcon 9s had a square array of engines.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.840
It had like a three by three by three grid

05:05.840 --> 05:08.480
of their Merlin 1 engines, the 1Ds.

05:08.480 --> 05:11.160
And I think it only lasted,

05:11.160 --> 05:13.480
I don't remember if it was two or four flights

05:13.480 --> 05:15.520
before they went into this OctoWeb configuration

05:15.520 --> 05:17.920
where there's eight, like a ring of eight engines

05:17.920 --> 05:19.880
with a center engine in the middle.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.920
Still in the same diameter that the rocket was,

05:21.920 --> 05:23.320
the fuselage was more or less the same,

05:23.320 --> 05:25.280
3.7 meter wide diameter,

05:25.280 --> 05:27.280
but the actual thrust structure changed.

05:27.280 --> 05:29.600
And one of the big efficiency gains was

05:29.600 --> 05:31.480
you no longer have, you know, a corner engine

05:31.480 --> 05:34.560
and then like a edge engine and then another corner engine.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.320
You can just make eight of the same, you know,

05:37.320 --> 05:40.560
kind of part of the OctoWeb it's called,

05:40.560 --> 05:42.200
you know, the same shape.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.960
And then your interchangeability

05:43.960 --> 05:46.320
and your manufacturability becomes a lot simpler.

05:46.320 --> 05:49.080
So that was kind of one of the bigger upgrades at first.

05:49.080 --> 05:49.920
And they kept stretching it.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.000
Every time they like touch this thing,

05:51.000 --> 05:54.480
it got longer and like taller and taller technically.

05:54.480 --> 05:58.960
And then the next big feature that you saw in 2014

05:58.960 --> 06:00.920
would have been they added landing legs

06:00.920 --> 06:02.680
to a Falcon 9 rocket, which was,

06:02.680 --> 06:04.680
I was at, that was the first launch I ever went to,

06:04.680 --> 06:07.120
was actually to see, it was CRS-3,

06:07.120 --> 06:08.440
so commercial resupply mission three.

06:08.440 --> 06:09.520
And it was probably there.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.400
God, I don't remember what that was like

06:11.400 --> 06:13.360
their 14th or 15th launch or something,

06:13.360 --> 06:14.720
like pretty early on.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.920
And people were literally laughing at the idea

06:17.920 --> 06:19.600
of them putting landing legs on it.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.440
They just thought it was stupid.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.640
They're like, why are they wasting,

06:21.640 --> 06:24.840
why is this billionaire Elon Musk guy wasting his time

06:24.840 --> 06:26.840
trying to land a rocket?

06:26.840 --> 06:27.680
It's not gonna work.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.480
So you said the Mars plan was there in the beginning.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.680
What about the reusability of rockets?

06:33.680 --> 06:35.440
Was that there in the beginning?

06:35.440 --> 06:37.680
I think reusability definitely, you know,

06:38.000 --> 06:41.440
it's a necessary part of making any kind

06:41.440 --> 06:44.560
of interplanetary mission, you know,

06:44.560 --> 06:47.440
in order to actually do that just financially,

06:47.440 --> 06:48.560
you have to start reusing these things.

06:48.560 --> 06:51.480
In terms of the development of the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9,

06:52.520 --> 06:57.520
how early on did the goal of reusing the rocket,

06:58.200 --> 07:00.400
having the rocket actually land,

07:00.400 --> 07:02.200
how early did that goal creep in?

07:02.200 --> 07:04.680
I can't speak for Elon and SpaceX,

07:04.680 --> 07:06.440
but it was pretty, you know,

07:06.440 --> 07:07.920
immediately they wanted to try to recover.

07:07.920 --> 07:08.760
And as a matter of fact,

07:08.760 --> 07:11.680
I think the very first two Falcon 9 rockets and Falcon 1,

07:11.680 --> 07:14.280
I think they even wanted to try to recover

07:14.280 --> 07:16.520
using parachutes to recover the first stage.

07:17.400 --> 07:21.360
And now fast forward, you know, almost 20 years later,

07:21.360 --> 07:24.120
and Rocket Lab is actually doing a concept like that

07:24.120 --> 07:26.400
where they're pulling a parachute

07:26.400 --> 07:28.520
after the first stage is re-entering

07:28.520 --> 07:29.800
and they actually are trying to recover it

07:29.800 --> 07:30.640
with a helicopter.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.480
It's gonna try to snatch it out of the air.

07:32.480 --> 07:33.320
They've actually done it.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.000
They've actually done it successfully once.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.040
How does the helicopter grab the rocket?

07:37.040 --> 07:39.600
With this giant like drag line and a hook.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.440
Oh, wow.

07:40.440 --> 07:43.960
And then literally just like grab snags onto the parachute.

07:43.960 --> 07:44.800
Wow.

07:44.800 --> 07:45.760
And it's pretty amazing.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.200
But this is a small rocket.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.120
Their rocket's only about a metric ton.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.640
The booster is empty.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.360
So the rocket releases parachutes.

07:53.360 --> 07:54.200
Yep.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.800
Like really high up.

07:55.800 --> 07:56.720
I'd love to see this.

07:56.720 --> 07:57.560
Yeah.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.380
It's an interesting idea.

07:58.380 --> 08:00.480
There's so many interesting ideas and possibilities

08:00.480 --> 08:03.080
like SpaceX basically just innovated

08:04.040 --> 08:06.480
a lot of different weird ideas

08:06.480 --> 08:09.040
just in the pursuit of making things more efficient,

08:09.040 --> 08:11.320
reusable, all of that.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.960
So basically thinking from first principles

08:12.960 --> 08:14.080
how to solve this problem.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.440
And so what you find is like you'll get all these kind

08:16.440 --> 08:17.800
of crazy kind of solutions.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.400
And with SpaceX, they weren't even getting to the point

08:20.400 --> 08:22.720
of the booster surviving re-entry long enough

08:22.720 --> 08:23.960
to be able to pull the parachutes.

08:23.960 --> 08:24.800
Yeah.

08:24.800 --> 08:25.840
You know, they're mass fractions.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.600
You know, and that varies.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.960
Every single rocket's different.

08:28.960 --> 08:30.600
You know, all the, you know, for instance,

08:30.840 --> 08:35.240
Rocket Lab uses carbon composite fuselage and tanks

08:35.240 --> 08:36.320
or, you know, same thing.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.200
And that's very, very lightweight,

08:38.200 --> 08:40.560
has really good mass fractions and therefore

08:40.560 --> 08:42.480
their drag coefficients and things like that.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.720
They were able to survive re-entry of the first stage

08:45.720 --> 08:47.600
which is something that SpaceX wasn't able to do

08:47.600 --> 08:49.040
at the time.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.720
What's kind of the big, I think, breakthrough for SpaceX

08:51.720 --> 08:55.560
with reusing the booster is they realized

08:55.560 --> 08:58.240
we have to basically slow down before we hit the atmosphere.

08:58.280 --> 09:01.160
So they actually do what they used to call a re-entry burn

09:01.160 --> 09:02.600
which I still think is the correct term

09:02.600 --> 09:04.000
because it is re-entering the atmosphere

09:04.000 --> 09:05.880
but now they call it the entry burn

09:05.880 --> 09:08.760
and they light up three of the nine Merlin engines

09:08.760 --> 09:10.480
not only to slow it down, but actually even

09:10.480 --> 09:13.640
while those engines are firing, it creates like a literal

09:13.640 --> 09:17.480
like force field as it's falling through the atmosphere.

09:17.480 --> 09:18.680
Interesting.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.880
But it also decreases the velocity by almost half

09:21.880 --> 09:24.520
or around half and then that therefore decreases

09:24.520 --> 09:26.280
the amount of, you know, the biggest thing

09:26.280 --> 09:28.320
with the atmosphere is that as it gets compressed

09:28.320 --> 09:33.320
against the front of anything flying through the atmosphere

09:33.880 --> 09:36.120
the compressed atoms just get hot

09:36.120 --> 09:37.920
and they can get so hot they turn into a plasma

09:37.920 --> 09:40.960
and they get so hot they can just absolutely destroy anything.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.080
So they slow down enough that the air molecules

09:44.080 --> 09:48.120
don't end up, you know, destroying the vehicle on re-entry.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.880
And then they realized, I think at some point

09:49.880 --> 09:50.960
it's probably a similar crossover.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.560
They're like, well, if we're lighting the engines already

09:52.560 --> 09:53.960
that slow down in the atmosphere

09:53.960 --> 09:57.120
we can just use that same engine to land.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.240
And so like, well, what if we just stuck landing legs on it

09:59.240 --> 10:01.280
and just landed the thing vertically.

10:01.280 --> 10:04.640
And next thing you know is December 21st, 2015

10:04.640 --> 10:07.240
they did exactly that for the first time.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.240
So you were there before that then, right?

10:09.240 --> 10:10.080
Yeah.

10:10.080 --> 10:10.920
In 2014.

10:10.920 --> 10:11.760
Yep, early 2014.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.560
So that, and for me, like that was so fun watching, you know

10:14.560 --> 10:17.040
that was like the peak of me just becoming obsessed

10:17.040 --> 10:18.800
with this idea.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.200
I'm watching with like, and back in the day

10:21.200 --> 10:23.040
it was like months between launches, you know

10:23.040 --> 10:24.280
so a launch was like a big idea.

10:24.280 --> 10:27.160
I'd wake up at 3 a.m. to watch this landing attempt

10:27.160 --> 10:29.160
or whatever, you know, and every, you know

10:29.160 --> 10:33.720
there's CRS four almost landed, CRS five

10:33.720 --> 10:35.960
almost landed CRS six, CRS seven blew up.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.960
I was watching that on, I think it was like a Saturday

10:37.960 --> 10:39.600
morning or maybe a Sunday morning.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.800
And I remember watching that and watched it blow up

10:41.800 --> 10:43.720
and I'm just like, oh my God, now what?

10:43.720 --> 10:46.680
You know, and it blew up on ascent.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.600
It was their first failure.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.840
So it was their 18th flight, I believe.

10:50.840 --> 10:55.080
CRS seven, the upper stage had a, one of the bottles

10:55.080 --> 10:56.960
inside the tanks that are filled with helium.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.440
And one of those bottles broke off on ascent

10:59.440 --> 11:01.920
and actually just completely over-pressured

11:01.920 --> 11:03.320
the upper stage and the upper stage blew up

11:03.320 --> 11:07.120
and the whole rocket went kaboom in an uncontrolled manner.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.880
And so, so then they came back with vengeance.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.800
When they came back, the first mission back

11:12.800 --> 11:14.280
is the first time that they landed a rocket,

11:14.280 --> 11:15.120
which was awesome.

11:15.120 --> 11:18.920
So the return to flight after the anomaly was, was, yeah

11:19.200 --> 11:20.280
was landing a rocket.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.400
And stuck the landing.

11:21.400 --> 11:22.240
Yep.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.080
Well, actually the first time, so the first time

11:24.080 --> 11:25.920
you were there, what was that like?

11:25.920 --> 11:27.640
What do you remember from that, from that day?

11:27.640 --> 11:29.960
Just, I was surprised at how much bigger

11:29.960 --> 11:31.600
the rocket was than I imagined.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.120
I was, I originally, when I was going down

11:33.120 --> 11:34.820
to Kennedy Space Center, I was disappointed

11:34.820 --> 11:37.320
that I wasn't seeing like a, you know,

11:37.320 --> 11:38.760
I didn't know a ton about rockets.

11:38.760 --> 11:41.200
I knew enough to like know what a space shuttle was,

11:41.200 --> 11:43.120
what like the Saturn five was, you know,

11:43.120 --> 11:45.480
but that was probably about the end of my knowledge.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.200
I just remember being disappointed

11:47.200 --> 11:49.000
that I wasn't seeing a big quote unquote

11:49.000 --> 11:50.720
NASA rocket flying.

11:50.720 --> 11:51.760
You know, I was thinking in my head like,

11:51.760 --> 11:52.720
oh, I'm going to see this launch.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.400
It's probably going to be like, you know,

11:54.400 --> 11:55.960
three stories tall or something, you know,

11:55.960 --> 11:57.840
just some little skinny little stick

11:57.840 --> 12:00.880
and some little firecracker and yay, you know,

12:00.880 --> 12:02.680
and I think I'd almost been pitched that too.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.280
I think the, the people that I was working for at the time,

12:05.280 --> 12:06.520
I think they kind of were downplaying it.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.280
It's like, well, it's not a big rocket, sir.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.440
It's not going to be that exciting, you know,

12:10.440 --> 12:12.080
but we get out there to the pad and I'm like,

12:12.080 --> 12:13.480
this thing's huge.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.800
This is not a small rocket.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.600
Like this is it's, you know, it's 70 meters tall,

12:17.600 --> 12:19.040
220 feet tall.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.440
It's huge.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.800
And I think people forget like the scale of that, you know,

12:23.800 --> 12:26.200
it might look skinny and tall and all this stuff,

12:26.200 --> 12:29.240
but it's still a very, very large piece of machinery.

12:29.240 --> 12:31.840
It's physically about as large as you can ship.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.280
The booster is about as big as you can ship

12:33.280 --> 12:34.720
across the country period

12:34.720 --> 12:36.800
without like completely shutting down highways.

12:36.800 --> 12:39.120
You know, it is made within those exact specifications

12:39.120 --> 12:40.840
of, of like having, you know,

12:40.840 --> 12:42.840
lane privileges and bridges and everything.

12:42.840 --> 12:45.440
It's, you know, 12 feet wide, 3.7 meters wide,

12:45.440 --> 12:47.520
and it's 45 meters long.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.600
So it's like exactly what you can fit

12:50.520 --> 12:52.040
with a pretty standard, you know,

12:52.040 --> 12:53.840
like before we start getting into crazy amounts

12:53.840 --> 12:56.040
of problems shipping the rocket.

12:56.040 --> 12:56.880
And it's huge.

12:56.880 --> 12:57.720
It's huge.

12:57.720 --> 12:58.920
And people just don't understand that.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.440
And so when I saw it with my own eyes,

13:00.440 --> 13:01.760
I remember just being like,

13:01.760 --> 13:03.640
this is so much cooler than I thought.

13:03.640 --> 13:06.200
It's hard to believe that that thing is going to have to

13:06.200 --> 13:08.840
lift off the ground and launch up into the air.

13:08.840 --> 13:11.040
Maybe that's the most humbling aspect of it.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.680
That's something that size.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.600
Humans have come up with a way to take something that size

13:15.600 --> 13:18.040
and launching, launch it up into the air.

13:18.040 --> 13:18.880
Yeah.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.400
There's certainly a very humbling aspect

13:20.400 --> 13:21.960
when you watch it actually leave.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.560
Was, was there a sound to it?

13:23.560 --> 13:24.600
Was there like a feeling?

13:24.600 --> 13:26.720
What were the different experiences you first remember?

13:26.720 --> 13:27.560
Well, ironically,

13:27.560 --> 13:29.520
I didn't end up getting to see that one fly.

13:29.520 --> 13:30.360
Oh.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.200
I went home, my camera saw it.

13:31.200 --> 13:34.920
I left my camera out there, like a remote triggered camera.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.760
My first images as a launch photographer at the time was,

13:37.760 --> 13:39.560
it was CRS-3, but I went home.

13:39.560 --> 13:40.600
It scrubbed too many times.

13:40.640 --> 13:43.400
This is back in the day, they were scrubbing like often,

13:43.400 --> 13:45.400
and they'd be like a three day, five day, seven day.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.640
You just never knew.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.840
So I go home and I watched the live stream of it.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.640
So I didn't even get to experience my first launch.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.840
And anyone that's ever tried to, you know,

13:53.840 --> 13:56.720
go to a launch is, can probably empathize because yeah,

13:56.720 --> 13:59.400
scrubs are very common in the space flight world.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.040
So that one I didn't get to see,

14:02.040 --> 14:05.080
but since then obviously I've been able to attend

14:05.080 --> 14:06.280
very many launches.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.120
How much do you understand the control involved

14:08.120 --> 14:08.960
in the landing?

14:08.960 --> 14:09.960
How difficult is that problem?

14:09.960 --> 14:12.120
I couldn't tell you a single thing about like the code

14:12.120 --> 14:13.440
and like the avionics behind it,

14:13.440 --> 14:16.160
but I can tell you all the hardware that makes it happen,

14:16.160 --> 14:17.000
if that helps.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.120
Well that, I mean, to me, it seems like whenever I talk

14:20.120 --> 14:23.480
to people, they say it's not that big of a deal

14:23.480 --> 14:25.880
in terms of the level of intelligence in the control.

14:25.880 --> 14:28.680
But to me, it's just like when you observe it,

14:28.680 --> 14:30.080
it seems incredible.

14:30.080 --> 14:32.440
Cause all the variables evolved,

14:32.440 --> 14:34.920
all the uncertainties involved, all the,

14:36.440 --> 14:38.400
cause there's aerodynamics.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.560
There's different temperatures.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.960
There's so much going on with the fuel, the burning,

14:42.960 --> 14:46.280
the combustion, just everything that's going on

14:46.280 --> 14:49.480
to be able to perform control at such high stakes

14:49.480 --> 14:50.320
effectively.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.360
That code is probably not written in JavaScript,

14:54.360 --> 14:55.640
I guess is what I'm saying.

14:55.640 --> 14:58.840
Actually, no, I don't, if I remember, again,

14:58.840 --> 15:00.840
this is well outside of my domain,

15:00.840 --> 15:05.160
but they're coding in a common language.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.880
It's probably gonna be C.

15:08.360 --> 15:09.200
I'm pretty sure it is.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.560
And that was one of the things that was weird

15:10.560 --> 15:13.000
is that Elon, when he started SpaceX was like,

15:13.000 --> 15:14.520
we're just gonna code in the most common language

15:14.520 --> 15:17.080
so that we don't have to like have people

15:17.080 --> 15:19.560
learn this archaic, weird thing.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.320
And we can just literally pull people off the streets

15:21.320 --> 15:23.200
and be like, here, write it.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.400
Yeah, it's probably C++.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.720
I mean, it'd be epic if it was like Python or something,

15:26.720 --> 15:30.000
but I think like reliable systems have to be written

15:30.000 --> 15:32.840
in C, C++ probably, which is a common language,

15:32.840 --> 15:35.960
which is something I imagine like NASA engineers

15:35.960 --> 15:38.680
would probably have to use some kind of proprietary language

15:38.680 --> 15:42.360
in the olden days for security, for privacy,

15:42.360 --> 15:43.200
all that kind of stuff.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.240
Oh, in the olden, old, old days,

15:45.240 --> 15:48.920
like they were inventing code and language from scratch.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.440
It's still incredible that it's able to do that.

15:53.440 --> 15:57.080
Like just the feat of engineering involved is truly,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.480
it's like one of the marvels to observe

16:00.480 --> 16:03.360
about these rockets coming back to Earth,

16:03.360 --> 16:04.960
that they're able to land.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.760
Like the drama of it is just incredible to see.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.240
Yeah, well, one of the fun things to remember too,

16:10.240 --> 16:12.200
with specifically with the Falcon 9

16:12.200 --> 16:14.280
and the Falcon Heavy boosters,

16:14.280 --> 16:16.680
I mean, it's the same thing basically,

16:16.680 --> 16:19.360
they shut down all but one of the nine engines.

16:19.360 --> 16:22.640
And even with that one engine at its minimum throttle setting,

16:22.640 --> 16:25.240
it's still too much thrust to hover.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.280
So as this rocket's coming down,

16:27.280 --> 16:29.400
if they start a little bit too early,

16:29.400 --> 16:31.160
if they light that engine too early,

16:31.160 --> 16:33.240
it will actually stop above the ground

16:33.240 --> 16:35.840
and will not be able to lower itself.

16:35.840 --> 16:39.160
It will literally stop like, say stop 200 feet

16:39.160 --> 16:41.960
above the ground, their only option is to kill the engine

16:41.960 --> 16:43.960
and then it's just gonna fall those 200 feet.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.640
So it's what we call like a suicide burner,

16:46.640 --> 16:49.400
a hover slam, kind of interchangeable terms,

16:49.400 --> 16:52.240
because your thrust to weight ratio is never below one.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.520
So they have to actually literally be riding the throttle.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.200
So what you do is you kind of start,

16:56.200 --> 16:58.280
ideally, you kind of start like in the middle

16:58.280 --> 17:00.600
of your window of throttle range.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.800
So let's pretend your engine can throttle down to 40%

17:03.800 --> 17:05.440
of its maximum rated thrust.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.720
You might start at like 70% of thrust

17:07.720 --> 17:10.680
in the middle of that like window of where it could burn.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.480
So if all of a sudden it's kind of coming in too hot,

17:12.480 --> 17:13.920
you have room to throttle up.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.520
If you're actually a little too early,

17:16.520 --> 17:17.360
you throttle it down.

17:17.360 --> 17:18.680
You have a little bit of wiggle room.

17:18.680 --> 17:21.360
And it's just amazing how smoothly and how perfectly

17:21.360 --> 17:23.080
they're able to still control that thing,

17:23.080 --> 17:26.040
even though they're down to one engine out of the nine

17:26.040 --> 17:27.760
and they're still riding like the finest margin

17:27.760 --> 17:28.600
of what's possible.

17:28.600 --> 17:29.760
And they're continually playing with that

17:30.600 --> 17:32.840
because every bit of fuel they're using

17:32.840 --> 17:35.000
and propellant they're using to land

17:35.000 --> 17:36.320
is propellant they weren't using

17:36.320 --> 17:38.280
to put something into space.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.480
So they want that to be as efficient as possible.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.600
So they're really like watching them hone that in

17:42.600 --> 17:45.720
and just continue to evolve and edit that

17:45.720 --> 17:47.960
and just get it to be the workhorse.

17:47.960 --> 17:51.160
We're coming up on 100 consecutive landings,

17:51.160 --> 17:52.560
perfect landings, 100.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.000
I think they've done like 150 something landings altogether,

17:55.000 --> 17:58.320
160 altogether, but we're talking like in a row

17:58.360 --> 18:01.160
without blowing up, which five years ago

18:01.160 --> 18:03.360
was completely experimental and insane.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.760
And now we're coming up to the point where 100 in a row,

18:05.760 --> 18:09.160
it's like, this is becoming more reliable in the landing,

18:09.160 --> 18:10.840
which is not the primary mission.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.000
This is purely for SpaceX's like gain

18:13.000 --> 18:14.400
is to recover the booster.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.760
It has nothing to do with the effect

18:15.760 --> 18:18.640
of getting the payload on orbit most of the time.

18:18.640 --> 18:22.160
And the landing is really only for their benefit

18:22.160 --> 18:23.040
and their gain.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.920
Long-term gain, like it's a long-term investment

18:25.960 --> 18:29.360
in being able to recover the boosters.

18:29.360 --> 18:32.120
Can you believe all this was done in basically 10 years?

18:32.120 --> 18:36.040
So we've seen this development over a period of 10 years.

18:36.040 --> 18:39.600
So like where we started commercial space flight

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
at scale to today, where it's almost starting to be mundane

18:46.760 --> 18:49.440
what Falcon 9 is able to do.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.720
Yeah, I can't really believe it.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.520
I mean, obviously even just in the,

18:54.120 --> 18:55.800
I think I'm a fairly fair weather fan

18:55.800 --> 18:58.600
really didn't start paying attention to like 2014.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.840
And just seeing what it was like back then

19:00.840 --> 19:01.680
to what it's like,

19:01.680 --> 19:03.800
I don't watch every launch at all anymore.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.480
Like I'll catch the big ones.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.200
I'll stream some of the really big ones.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.960
But like back in the day, I, like I said,

19:08.960 --> 19:10.160
would wake up in the middle of the night

19:10.160 --> 19:12.280
to catch these streams or catch these launches

19:12.280 --> 19:14.360
and watch them because they were such a big deal.

19:14.360 --> 19:17.360
And there's maybe only five of them a year.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.240
And so it was a really big deal.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.560
Nowadays it's like, oh yeah.

19:19.560 --> 19:22.480
And there's literally like two a week on average now.

19:22.480 --> 19:23.320
It's insane.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.800
From SpaceX alone, let alone United Launch Alliance,

19:26.800 --> 19:29.520
Rocket Lab, any of the Chinese missions,

19:29.520 --> 19:31.840
I mean, there's countless, it's insane.

19:31.840 --> 19:34.480
It's really, really, really hard to keep up with.

19:34.480 --> 19:37.080
I wonder at which point in the future,

19:37.080 --> 19:40.800
the number of launches to orbit will exceed

19:40.800 --> 19:44.080
the number of launches of airplanes

19:44.080 --> 19:45.240
like on the surface of earth.

19:45.240 --> 19:46.080
Yeah, I have to admit,

19:46.080 --> 19:50.200
I kind of have a hard time extrapolating out that far.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.680
There's a lot of people that are like big futurists

19:51.680 --> 19:53.640
and really do think about like interplanetary stuff

19:53.640 --> 19:55.640
and think about colonizing Mars and stuff.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.480
I have a hard time predicting like

19:57.480 --> 19:59.720
when Starship's gonna fly, the orbital launch.

19:59.720 --> 20:00.920
You know, and that's like,

20:00.920 --> 20:03.800
imminent-ish like month or two scale timeframe.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.200
And yet I'm still like,

20:05.200 --> 20:06.160
I can't tell you when that's gonna,

20:06.160 --> 20:08.000
I can't tell you anything about like

20:08.000 --> 20:10.320
when we're gonna land on Mars or what that's,

20:10.320 --> 20:11.840
what that economy and what that, you know,

20:11.840 --> 20:13.960
the scale of launch operations is gonna look like

20:13.960 --> 20:15.840
in order to do that because it's just so hard.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.080
I wouldn't have predicted where we're at today

20:18.080 --> 20:20.400
five years ago, you know, it's insane.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.720
It's so hard to predict.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.840
And yeah, but it's funny because there's so many

20:24.840 --> 20:27.240
like new companies starting up trying to predict that.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.160
And it's a really exciting, you know,

20:29.160 --> 20:30.720
startup culture right now.

20:30.720 --> 20:34.360
I think when you make certain engineering decisions

20:34.360 --> 20:36.760
and hiring decisions and like what you focus on

20:36.760 --> 20:39.320
in terms of both business and engineering,

20:39.320 --> 20:42.800
it's good to think on the scale of 10, 20, 50, 100 years.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.560
It's one of the things that Elon is exceptionally good at,

20:45.560 --> 20:48.040
which is asking the question of,

20:48.040 --> 20:49.880
okay, this might seem impossible right now,

20:49.880 --> 20:53.000
but what's the obvious way to do this

20:53.000 --> 20:55.400
if we look out 20 years?

20:55.400 --> 20:58.000
And then you start to make decisions.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.840
You start to make decisions about robotics,

20:59.840 --> 21:01.320
about brain and computer interfaces,

21:01.320 --> 21:03.720
about space travel there.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.320
They make a lot of sense when you look at the scale

21:06.320 --> 21:09.560
of 10, 20, 50, 100 years and don't make any sense

21:09.560 --> 21:12.760
if you look at the scale of just months.

21:12.760 --> 21:16.080
So, but of course the actual work of day to day

21:16.080 --> 21:17.640
is focused on the next few months

21:17.640 --> 21:19.600
because there's deadlines, there's missions,

21:20.560 --> 21:23.320
anyway, we're turning back to the brief history

21:23.320 --> 21:27.400
of SpaceX rockets, the Falcon Heavy.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.440
So what else is there?

21:28.440 --> 21:32.080
So we talked about Falcon 9 and the rapid development there.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.400
What other flavors of Falcon is there

21:34.400 --> 21:36.000
and how does that take us to Starship?

21:36.000 --> 21:39.320
Yeah, realistically the Falcon 9 evolved more or less,

21:39.320 --> 21:41.080
kind of like just got more powerful

21:41.080 --> 21:43.520
and a little bit longer and more capable.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.880
But nowadays they fly what's called the Block 5,

21:45.880 --> 21:48.240
even though it's like the eighth or ninth iteration

21:48.240 --> 21:50.760
of the Falcon 9, but they call it Block 5.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.200
It's the one that has the black landing legs,

21:52.200 --> 21:53.560
the black inner stage.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.080
They have a fleet of roughly 10 or so

21:55.080 --> 21:57.520
that are doing the majority of the leg work these days

21:57.520 --> 22:00.000
and they're flying up to 15 times,

22:00.000 --> 22:03.120
I think right now is the current booster leader.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.600
They're also recovering the fairings

22:04.600 --> 22:08.040
to the nose cone of the rockets are frequently,

22:08.040 --> 22:09.880
if not every time being recovered.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.480
Same with the booster for the most part.

22:13.480 --> 22:15.360
And the only thing being expended is the upper stage.

22:15.360 --> 22:18.400
And that's kind of where the Falcon 9 is ending.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.520
It's really doesn't make sense

22:20.520 --> 22:22.640
to develop that infrastructure any longer.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.440
So they went with the next step,

22:24.440 --> 22:28.040
which is go even bigger physically.

22:28.040 --> 22:31.040
So they have more margin for upper stage reusability.

22:31.040 --> 22:34.000
And that's what we see with Starship and Super Heavy.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.960
So the Super Heavy booster,

22:35.960 --> 22:37.080
the whole system is confusing.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.200
The whole system is kind of considered Starship,

22:39.200 --> 22:41.720
but technically the Starship is just the upper stage,

22:41.720 --> 22:43.600
which is also like the spaceship,

22:43.600 --> 22:45.400
which is also the upper stage.

22:45.400 --> 22:46.640
And then the booster itself

22:46.640 --> 22:48.920
is considered the Super Heavy booster.

22:48.920 --> 22:51.000
And that's what they've been working on.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.240
Publicly it came out in 2016 as the,

22:54.240 --> 22:55.560
at the time it was the ITS,

22:55.560 --> 22:58.880
the Interplanetary Transportation System.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.840
Later, and I think about 20,

23:00.840 --> 23:02.200
by the end of that year, 2017,

23:02.200 --> 23:04.040
it kind of became known as the BFR,

23:04.040 --> 23:06.000
the big Falcon rocket.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.640
Yes. Yeah.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.960
And then I think it was about end of 2018,

23:09.960 --> 23:11.920
they started calling it Starship.

23:11.920 --> 23:14.280
But that is the, that is where we're at today.

23:14.280 --> 23:17.440
And that's what they're working full steam ahead on.

23:17.440 --> 23:18.840
And what about Dragon?

23:18.840 --> 23:21.640
You mentioned Dragon, Crew Dragon, Cargo Dragon.

23:21.640 --> 23:25.000
Yeah. So they went from the cargo version of Dragon

23:25.000 --> 23:27.680
that flew about 20 times,

23:27.680 --> 23:29.800
successfully to the International Space Station,

23:29.800 --> 23:31.080
except for that one CRS-7

23:31.080 --> 23:32.760
where the rocket blew up in the capsule.

23:32.760 --> 23:34.880
Obviously didn't make it to the ISS.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.280
Then they went into the Dragon 2,

23:37.280 --> 23:38.160
which has two variants.

23:38.160 --> 23:39.640
It has a crew variant.

23:39.640 --> 23:41.200
So we just call it Crew Dragon.

23:41.240 --> 23:45.400
And then there's the cargo version of Dragon 2.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.560
And that's just an updated, sleeker,

23:47.560 --> 23:49.040
sexier version of Dragon.

23:49.040 --> 23:51.880
And it's, ironically, it's heavier altogether.

23:51.880 --> 23:54.800
So it, you'll never see those cool

23:54.800 --> 23:55.920
return to launch site landing,

23:55.920 --> 23:57.200
the boosters coming back to land

23:57.200 --> 23:59.600
for CRS missions anymore like we used to,

23:59.600 --> 24:01.600
but they landed on the drone ship anyway.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.880
And yeah, that's been flying successfully.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.040
That's kind of the, so there's, yeah,

24:06.040 --> 24:08.240
Starlink, Dragon, Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy,

24:08.240 --> 24:10.960
and Starship system is kind of the whole,

24:11.640 --> 24:12.680
the whole SpaceX world really.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.720
In terms of the spaceships involved,

24:14.720 --> 24:17.560
what to you are some of the major milestones

24:17.560 --> 24:18.960
in that history?

24:18.960 --> 24:21.560
We kind of mentioned a few,

24:21.560 --> 24:22.400
Yeah.

24:22.400 --> 24:23.240
Sticking to landing.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.720
Is there something that kind of stands out?

24:24.720 --> 24:27.320
Yeah, I would say definitely the big ones,

24:27.320 --> 24:28.400
obviously like any of the first,

24:28.400 --> 24:29.640
like the first flight of Falcon 1,

24:29.640 --> 24:30.600
first flight of Falcon 9,

24:30.600 --> 24:33.480
first time they went to the International Space Station,

24:33.480 --> 24:35.800
the first time they landed a booster,

24:35.800 --> 24:37.200
the first time they reused a booster,

24:37.200 --> 24:39.600
which is I think about six months after,

24:39.600 --> 24:42.000
no, oh, it was a year after, it was SES 10,

24:43.280 --> 24:46.120
2017, it was the first time they reused

24:46.120 --> 24:48.000
one of those boosters, and that was a big milestone.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.080
Like, can we even, yeah, we recovered one,

24:50.080 --> 24:53.760
we caught one, it's like, we got one, now what?

24:53.760 --> 24:56.120
That was the first time they reflew one.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.120
Yeah, then flying humans was a huge one,

24:58.120 --> 25:01.240
DM-2, Bob and Doug for NASA.

25:01.240 --> 25:02.080
Bob and Doug, yeah.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.400
Bob and Doug, that was incredible.

25:04.400 --> 25:07.240
That was a huge, huge step, I think,

25:07.240 --> 25:08.920
for SpaceX was flying people.

25:08.920 --> 25:11.240
So it's the first major commercial

25:12.240 --> 25:14.280
launching of humans out into space.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.640
Yeah, and not just into space,

25:15.640 --> 25:18.440
because there's been people that have done

25:18.440 --> 25:20.840
space flights with suborbital hops,

25:20.840 --> 25:24.520
but going into orbit and especially docking

25:24.520 --> 25:26.000
and rendezvousing with the International Space Station

25:26.000 --> 25:28.320
is a big deal, it's a whole,

25:28.320 --> 25:31.200
until you really understand the physics involved

25:31.200 --> 25:33.600
and the scale involved of just crossing the Karman line,

25:33.600 --> 25:36.000
going straight up versus going into orbit,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.240
they're just completely different things almost.

25:38.280 --> 25:39.880
What about Starship?

25:41.400 --> 25:42.880
Are we in a place where we can talk

25:42.880 --> 25:44.680
about milestones with Starship?

25:44.680 --> 25:47.400
Has there been, or has it just been an epic journey

25:47.400 --> 25:51.200
of failure and successes, of testing and so on?

25:51.200 --> 25:54.240
Was there like, yeah, what would you classify

25:54.240 --> 25:58.560
at this point as a milestone that Starship or BFR,

25:58.560 --> 26:00.840
whatever the name is, was able to achieve?

26:00.840 --> 26:02.720
Well, so far, the milestones we've seen,

26:02.720 --> 26:04.920
I'd say the first one would be the hop of,

26:04.920 --> 26:05.960
they call it Starhopper,

26:05.960 --> 26:08.080
and it's basically a very rudimentary rocket,

26:08.920 --> 26:10.280
but it was the first time they utilized

26:10.280 --> 26:12.760
their new Raptor engine to produce thrusted

26:12.760 --> 26:14.360
to fly something.

26:14.360 --> 26:17.520
It first flew literally three meters off the ground

26:17.520 --> 26:19.000
or something tethered to the ground,

26:19.000 --> 26:22.800
then it flew 15, and then finally it flew 150 meters,

26:22.800 --> 26:26.040
and that was in 2019,

26:26.040 --> 26:28.240
and that was the first big milestone of Starship.

26:28.240 --> 26:32.320
And then after that, we saw SN5, SN6 do the similar

26:32.320 --> 26:35.760
150-meter hops with a little bit more elegant systems,

26:35.760 --> 26:37.800
proving out more of their tank building,

26:37.800 --> 26:39.560
proving out more of their, you know,

26:39.560 --> 26:42.680
a lot of just subsystems, and then the big ones,

26:42.680 --> 26:46.920
physically, were in end of 2020 and early 2021

26:46.920 --> 26:50.680
when they flew the SN8, 9, 10, 11, and 15.

26:50.680 --> 26:52.080
What does the N stand for in SN?

26:52.080 --> 26:54.080
I think just serial number, or Starship number.

26:54.080 --> 26:57.600
Yeah, so SN, these are just names, numbers,

26:57.600 --> 27:01.240
numerical representations of the different testing efforts.

27:01.240 --> 27:02.600
They skipped some numbers, right?

27:02.600 --> 27:03.440
Yeah.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.200
If they scratch a test.

27:05.200 --> 27:06.320
Yeah, and lots of times it'd be like,

27:06.320 --> 27:07.560
literally they're building, you know,

27:08.200 --> 27:10.520
at Starbase, and what SpaceX is working on,

27:10.520 --> 27:13.240
like the one foot is always in front of someone else's foot,

27:13.240 --> 27:14.360
and like the arm is not knowing

27:14.360 --> 27:16.720
what the leg is doing sometimes with it.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.520
They will have someone working on, you know,

27:19.520 --> 27:20.360
they'll just be like,

27:20.360 --> 27:22.560
hurry up and build 40 of these tank sections,

27:22.560 --> 27:24.640
and you build the bulkhead, and you build the down comer,

27:24.640 --> 27:26.480
and you build the header tank, blah, blah, blah.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.040
And all of a sudden like, oh, we actually evolved that.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.280
We don't use that header tank now.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.240
So it's gonna go onto this one.

27:30.240 --> 27:33.200
So they'll have like parts of certain rockets built,

27:33.200 --> 27:35.040
and it's like, ah, literally scrap it.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.640
Like not scrap it like in the, you know, joke term,

27:37.640 --> 27:39.600
but like literally just go scrap it.

27:39.600 --> 27:42.920
And they, so yeah, they just evolve and iterate so quickly.

27:42.920 --> 27:44.960
There were some epic explosions.

27:46.360 --> 27:49.360
I think Starship, something about it,

27:49.360 --> 27:51.200
probably just the amount of fuel

27:51.200 --> 27:55.160
just leads to some epic failures.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.680
Would you say Starship is the source

27:56.680 --> 28:00.160
of the most epic failures in terms of size of explosion?

28:00.160 --> 28:01.600
So you can literally measure it

28:01.600 --> 28:03.800
in like a yield of explosive power,

28:03.840 --> 28:05.600
you know, like you could TNT.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.920
Like you can take a look at how much propellant

28:07.920 --> 28:09.800
is left over at the time of the explosion.

28:09.800 --> 28:12.520
And, you know, Starship, what's flown so far,

28:12.520 --> 28:13.640
even though it's physically

28:13.640 --> 28:16.000
one of the largest flying objects ever,

28:16.000 --> 28:17.960
just with the upper stage alone,

28:17.960 --> 28:20.280
they've not filled it more than like 10 or 20%

28:20.280 --> 28:21.920
full of propellant.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.200
And so it actually hasn't been,

28:24.200 --> 28:27.680
the failures have been really epic looking,

28:27.680 --> 28:30.400
big visual fireballs, but in terms of space flight,

28:30.400 --> 28:33.360
they're still pretty small explosions, believe it or not.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.080
They could still go bigger.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.840
Oh yeah, a lot, a lot.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.880
Of course, the test payload of a Tesla Roadster

28:40.880 --> 28:42.280
was launched.

28:42.280 --> 28:43.480
I forget what year that was.

28:43.480 --> 28:44.640
Yeah, that was 2018.

28:44.640 --> 28:45.760
That was quite epic.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.280
Would you put that on the milestone?

28:47.280 --> 28:49.800
Oh yeah, Falcon Heavy demo was like

28:49.800 --> 28:52.840
definitely a big, big, big milestone, yeah.

28:52.840 --> 28:55.920
Is that funny to you that there's a Roadster

28:55.920 --> 28:57.080
floating out there?

28:57.080 --> 28:58.800
Do we know the location of that Roadster at this point?

28:58.800 --> 29:01.200
Oh yeah, where is roadster.com?

29:01.200 --> 29:02.160
Yeah? Oh yeah.

29:02.480 --> 29:03.480
Is it orbiting something?

29:03.480 --> 29:05.000
Yeah, it's orbiting the sun.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.880
So it's orbiting the sun,

29:06.880 --> 29:09.680
and its orbit is basically between the Earth's orbit

29:09.680 --> 29:11.000
and beyond Mars.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.400
So I think about 2.5 AU, if I remember right.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.560
So it's beyond Mars's orbit and its highest point,

29:16.560 --> 29:18.960
and it's back at Earth, kind of in its lowest point.

29:18.960 --> 29:22.000
I wonder if there's a mission where you're going to

29:22.000 --> 29:23.600
somehow connect with it once again

29:23.600 --> 29:25.560
and like place extra things into it.

29:25.560 --> 29:28.080
I wonder how challenging that is technically.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.080
Oh yeah, it could absolutely be done.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.800
You know, the hard thing at this point

29:32.800 --> 29:34.640
because it's on an eccentric orbit

29:34.640 --> 29:36.480
would be rendezvousing with it

29:36.480 --> 29:38.760
because you kind of have to be in alignment with its orbit

29:38.760 --> 29:40.600
to really line up well with it.

29:40.600 --> 29:41.440
Yeah.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.120
But yeah, I mean, someday I don't see any reason

29:43.120 --> 29:45.400
why we couldn't at least send for sure an uncrewed,

29:45.400 --> 29:48.520
you know, if Elon wanted to just fly a robot out there

29:48.520 --> 29:50.640
to check up on it and photograph it or something.

29:50.640 --> 29:53.520
Like we could, that could be well within the realm of things.

29:53.520 --> 29:56.160
Getting an optimist robot up there.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.760
So that was the story,

29:59.760 --> 30:03.040
brilliantly told by you of the rockets for SpaceX.

30:03.040 --> 30:05.640
What about through the lens of engines?

30:05.640 --> 30:08.600
Can you give a brief history of the SpaceX rocket engines

30:08.600 --> 30:11.520
that were used that we haven't covered?

30:11.520 --> 30:13.760
So you mentioned it all started with a Merlin engine

30:13.760 --> 30:14.680
and a Kestrel engine.

30:14.680 --> 30:19.040
What, yeah, through that lens, what's there?

30:19.040 --> 30:21.000
Engines are relatively small number,

30:21.000 --> 30:22.360
which is easy for us.

30:22.360 --> 30:23.200
There's the other Merlin,

30:23.200 --> 30:24.520
and Merlin's evolved throughout time

30:24.520 --> 30:26.720
to be from like the Merlin to the Merlin 1C

30:26.720 --> 30:28.880
to the Merlin 1D to the Merlin 1D full thrust

30:28.880 --> 30:32.000
and all these other kind of tweaks of the same architecture.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.640
Kestrel ended with Falcon 1.

30:34.520 --> 30:36.080
They also have the Merlin vacuum engine,

30:36.080 --> 30:38.200
which is the upper stage engine for Falcon 9.

30:38.200 --> 30:41.960
Same relative system, but just optimized for vacuum.

30:41.960 --> 30:44.000
So it has a much larger bell nozzle.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.440
There's the Draco thrusters,

30:45.440 --> 30:48.120
which you know, you kind of can consider engines.

30:48.120 --> 30:50.640
Well, they are rocket engines, but they're just small.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.560
They're not like the orbital engines.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.960
There's the Super Draco engines,

30:53.960 --> 30:58.360
which are the abort thrusters on Crew Dragon capsule.

30:58.360 --> 31:01.000
And then nowadays they have the Raptor engine

31:01.000 --> 31:03.720
and the Raptor vacuum variant,

31:03.720 --> 31:05.120
but they've already had two versions of Raptor.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.720
We've already seen kind of the Raptor development engine.

31:07.720 --> 31:09.320
We kind of see like a Raptor 1.5

31:09.320 --> 31:12.440
where it's kind of taking hints of the future Raptor,

31:12.440 --> 31:16.160
but now we're well within what you'd consider

31:16.160 --> 31:19.400
a Raptor 2 variant, and that's really it.

31:19.400 --> 31:22.880
Yeah, for the Raptor, maybe I'll ask you that separately,

31:22.880 --> 31:25.640
but I like in general and people,

31:26.560 --> 31:28.600
who doesn't know who Everyday Astronaut is,

31:28.600 --> 31:30.200
but if you don't somehow know,

31:30.200 --> 31:33.800
go check your YouTube channel out.

31:33.800 --> 31:37.600
You're an incredible educator about the super technical

31:37.600 --> 31:41.640
and the more sort of even the philosophical,

31:41.640 --> 31:43.900
the actual space travel.

31:43.900 --> 31:46.400
So you go down to the raw details of it

31:46.400 --> 31:48.840
and there's just great videos on the Raptor engine.

31:50.360 --> 31:52.680
I think you have one on Merlin

31:53.520 --> 31:54.920
and also the actual tours with Elon

31:54.920 --> 31:56.760
where he discusses some of those things.

31:56.760 --> 31:58.960
On one of the tours, he says,

31:58.960 --> 32:01.160
he's full of good lines, that guy.

32:01.160 --> 32:04.320
He says something about the number of fiddly bits

32:05.160 --> 32:09.040
and the number of fiddly bits was decreased

32:09.040 --> 32:12.160
between Raptor 2 and Raptor 1.

32:12.160 --> 32:14.920
And I think that's actually a really beautiful representation

32:14.920 --> 32:17.600
of the engineering efforts there,

32:17.600 --> 32:20.360
which is constantly trying to simplify,

32:20.360 --> 32:21.740
increase the efficiency of the engines,

32:21.740 --> 32:26.740
but also simplify the design so you can manufacture it.

32:26.820 --> 32:30.980
And in general, simplification leads to better performance

32:30.980 --> 32:32.380
and testing and everything.

32:32.380 --> 32:34.780
So the number of fiddly bits,

32:34.780 --> 32:36.500
sure there's a Wikipedia page on that now,

32:36.500 --> 32:38.760
as an index is actually a really good one.

32:38.760 --> 32:40.060
Well, and when you think about it,

32:40.060 --> 32:42.500
I don't know of any other company prior

32:42.500 --> 32:44.940
that had kind of tried to measure their performance

32:44.940 --> 32:47.260
of their engine, not in like thrust to weight ratio

32:47.260 --> 32:49.260
or like how efficient it is like in specific impulse,

32:49.260 --> 32:52.340
but literally in like dollar to thrust ratio,

32:52.340 --> 32:55.020
like how much does this engine cost?

32:55.020 --> 32:56.620
How much thrust can it produce?

32:56.620 --> 32:59.780
And like using that as a trade study instead of just like

32:59.780 --> 33:01.980
pure metrics of, you know, cause at the end of the day,

33:01.980 --> 33:05.780
like, okay, if it's cheaper and does X amount of work,

33:05.780 --> 33:06.860
even if it's less efficient,

33:06.860 --> 33:09.380
it can actually be better long-term.

33:09.380 --> 33:12.280
And so I guess another way, it's not even just thrust.

33:12.280 --> 33:13.620
I don't know if that metric is used,

33:13.620 --> 33:17.460
but basically the cost of getting one kilogram

33:17.460 --> 33:19.220
of thing up into space.

33:20.140 --> 33:21.620
That's basically what they're trying to minimize.

33:21.620 --> 33:22.780
Especially, yeah.

33:22.780 --> 33:24.180
At the end of the day,

33:24.180 --> 33:26.300
that is definitely the ultimate metric is how much

33:26.300 --> 33:29.660
does one kilogram cost to orbit eventually, you know?

33:29.660 --> 33:32.060
But there's, it's so funny cause space flight

33:32.060 --> 33:33.520
is just the ultimate, you know,

33:33.520 --> 33:36.640
it's the ultimate compromise, every little thing.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.980
Any variable can just change everything else.

33:38.980 --> 33:40.660
So you can tweak so many different things

33:40.660 --> 33:43.180
to get to different numbers and conclusions, you know,

33:43.180 --> 33:45.480
but even things like on your first stage,

33:45.480 --> 33:47.900
when you're, the rocket's pointing straight up

33:47.900 --> 33:49.720
and the engines are pointing straight down,

33:49.720 --> 33:52.120
you're dealing more with the thrust to weight ratio

33:52.120 --> 33:52.960
of the rocket.

33:52.960 --> 33:54.820
So how much thrust is it producing versus how much

33:54.820 --> 33:56.900
is gravity pulling down on it is actually

33:56.900 --> 33:59.280
a more important metric than how raw efficient

33:59.280 --> 34:00.460
the engine is.

34:00.460 --> 34:02.460
So it's funny then in space, it's kind of the opposite.

34:02.460 --> 34:04.980
Thrust to weight ratio doesn't really matter.

34:04.980 --> 34:06.700
What really matters is the actual,

34:06.700 --> 34:08.060
the specific impulse is called,

34:08.060 --> 34:11.180
or like the nozzle escape velocity of the,

34:11.180 --> 34:13.500
or the ejection velocity of the,

34:13.500 --> 34:16.300
how fast is the gas moving is like the more important

34:16.340 --> 34:19.180
number on orbit, but it's just so crazy

34:19.180 --> 34:20.020
because there's all these like,

34:20.020 --> 34:22.720
I would just love to see the trade studies, you know,

34:22.720 --> 34:24.040
when you're like trying to figure out like,

34:24.040 --> 34:25.580
is this more important than this or this or this?

34:25.580 --> 34:27.340
And it's like, you change this one little thing

34:27.340 --> 34:29.420
and all of a sudden, you know, like all the,

34:29.420 --> 34:30.420
everything changes.

34:30.420 --> 34:33.380
It's just, even the profile, like the launch profile,

34:33.380 --> 34:37.020
the trajectory of it, I mean, everything, everything.

34:37.020 --> 34:39.420
I wonder what that trade out discussions are like

34:39.420 --> 34:41.940
is you can't really perfectly plan everything.

34:41.940 --> 34:46.940
So, and you always have to have some spare leeway on,

34:48.060 --> 34:51.180
you know, especially as you're testing new vehicles

34:51.180 --> 34:52.300
like Starship.

34:52.300 --> 34:53.940
Yeah, margins are important.

34:53.940 --> 34:55.180
Yeah, having a margin,

34:55.180 --> 34:57.220
given all the uncertainty that's there.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.060
That's really interesting,

34:58.060 --> 34:59.460
like how they do those kinds of trade outs

34:59.460 --> 35:01.300
because they're also rapidly designing

35:01.300 --> 35:03.560
and redesigning and re-engineering.

35:04.580 --> 35:08.180
And the, ultimately you want to give yourself the freedom

35:08.180 --> 35:09.600
to constantly innovate,

35:09.600 --> 35:12.480
but then through the process of testing,

35:12.480 --> 35:15.000
you solidify the thing that can be relied upon,

35:15.000 --> 35:16.800
especially if it's a crude mission.

35:16.800 --> 35:17.960
Yeah.

35:17.960 --> 35:20.320
How to do that in a rapid cycle.

35:20.320 --> 35:23.300
I remember at some point that NASA,

35:23.300 --> 35:24.780
as they're leading up to flying humans

35:24.780 --> 35:26.240
for the first time for NASA,

35:27.080 --> 35:28.240
you know, there's some talk that like,

35:28.240 --> 35:29.920
we're going to do a design freeze

35:29.920 --> 35:33.080
because SpaceX does evolve and iterate so quickly.

35:33.080 --> 35:34.440
You know, they were saying that it was leading

35:34.440 --> 35:35.720
because especially at the time,

35:35.720 --> 35:39.200
it was a mission called AMOS-6 and they lost a rocket.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.800
They've only lost two rockets, like ever really,

35:41.800 --> 35:44.920
as far as, you know, trying to get something to space,

35:44.920 --> 35:46.660
for the Falcon 9, sorry.

35:48.160 --> 35:51.680
And the second one, AMOS-6, I mean, that was back in 2016.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.600
So it's been a long time.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.600
And, but at the time, you know,

35:55.600 --> 35:59.280
they're looking at flying humans in the near future.

35:59.280 --> 36:01.880
And it's like, if you guys keep tweaking this thing

36:01.880 --> 36:03.840
every time you take it out to the pad,

36:03.840 --> 36:05.460
really is going to be a problem, you know?

36:05.460 --> 36:08.240
And so there is some pressure from NASA

36:08.240 --> 36:10.760
to kind of slow down on that iterative process.

36:10.760 --> 36:13.860
And, but that is also why they were able to evolve

36:13.860 --> 36:15.160
the Falcon 9 to be what it is today

36:15.160 --> 36:17.800
is because they did just evolve it so quickly.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.360
Literally like one after another was never really the same.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.360
And we're definitely seeing that with Starship now.

36:22.360 --> 36:25.760
Like it's evolved so quickly

36:25.760 --> 36:28.000
that you just can't even keep up with it, you know?

36:28.000 --> 36:30.960
So there's a fascinating culture clash there.

36:30.960 --> 36:34.160
Have you just in observing and interacting with NASA folks,

36:34.160 --> 36:38.120
seen them sort of grow and change and evolve themselves

36:39.000 --> 36:40.320
sort of inspired by this new developments

36:40.320 --> 36:41.640
in commercial space flight?

36:41.640 --> 36:42.560
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:42.560 --> 36:44.840
There's a lot of, especially like around DM2,

36:44.840 --> 36:47.000
there's a lot of talks and the press conferences and stuff

36:47.000 --> 36:50.320
where you'd hear people say, you know, this was a big,

36:50.320 --> 36:51.920
this is well outside of our comfort zone

36:51.920 --> 36:53.320
to work with SpaceX in this manner,

36:53.320 --> 36:55.160
because we're, we take this approach to things

36:55.160 --> 36:57.320
where X, Y, and Z in this way,

36:57.320 --> 36:59.240
the way we normally certify things.

36:59.240 --> 37:02.560
And we're not used to SpaceX like, well, let's just try it,

37:02.560 --> 37:06.040
you know, like, and do something, you know, to a point.

37:06.040 --> 37:08.760
And so they said it ended up being fantastic.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.160
They loved working that way because it was just

37:11.160 --> 37:13.960
less paperwork almost and more just do.

37:13.960 --> 37:17.720
And, but at the same time, SpaceX, I think even expressed,

37:17.720 --> 37:19.320
I don't remember if it was Hans Koenigsman

37:19.320 --> 37:20.840
or someone in a press conference said,

37:20.840 --> 37:22.960
well, we really liked having someone just double check us

37:22.960 --> 37:24.560
so that we're not doing something super stupid

37:24.560 --> 37:26.960
right before we test something, you know?

37:26.960 --> 37:28.440
So there was a cool collaboration

37:28.440 --> 37:31.280
because it is two very different philosophies

37:31.280 --> 37:35.080
of development and managing, you know, space programs.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.240
I wanted to talk to you a lot about engines

37:38.240 --> 37:41.480
and maybe about Starship and maybe about your own

37:41.480 --> 37:42.960
becoming an actual astronaut.

37:42.960 --> 37:46.440
But like, let's just go there before all that

37:46.440 --> 37:50.520
and talk about the actual culture of SpaceX

37:50.520 --> 37:53.760
and your conversations with Elon.

37:53.760 --> 37:56.160
You've toured SpaceX facilities with him.

37:56.160 --> 37:57.200
You've interviewed him.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.520
You've interacted with him.

37:59.640 --> 38:02.320
What have you learned about rockets, about propulsion,

38:02.320 --> 38:03.880
about engineering, about design,

38:03.880 --> 38:06.560
about life from those interactions?

38:06.560 --> 38:09.560
He's pretty transparent, open human being

38:09.560 --> 38:13.320
as an engineer, as a leader, as a person.

38:14.520 --> 38:16.320
I would definitely say the biggest takeaway I've had

38:16.320 --> 38:21.320
from my times with Elon at SpaceX is really like the,

38:22.080 --> 38:23.760
the idea of questioning your constraints.

38:23.760 --> 38:27.200
He says that a lot, but he also does it a lot.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.760
Though, you know, there'll be times where like,

38:31.760 --> 38:33.240
you'll see him change on a dime

38:33.240 --> 38:34.920
because he's like rethinking of something

38:34.920 --> 38:36.240
in a newer, different way.

38:36.240 --> 38:39.440
And for me, you know, I think we all put constraints

38:39.440 --> 38:40.280
on ourselves.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.480
We think about our own limits, you know,

38:42.480 --> 38:45.240
on things that we can or cannot do.

38:45.240 --> 38:47.480
And I think it's made me kind of question like,

38:47.480 --> 38:50.960
well, why am I, why did I say, no, I can't do that?

38:50.960 --> 38:54.840
Or, you know, just off the top of my head.

38:54.840 --> 38:59.720
A good example, so in Iowa, I live in Iowa,

38:59.720 --> 39:01.320
half the time or whatever,

39:01.320 --> 39:03.120
there's a bike ride across the state of Iowa

39:03.960 --> 39:04.800
called Rag Bride.

39:04.800 --> 39:05.920
And every year you just, you know,

39:05.920 --> 39:07.280
like thousands of people get together

39:07.280 --> 39:09.120
and they ride across Iowa.

39:09.120 --> 39:12.400
And it was last summer, I met up with some friends

39:12.400 --> 39:13.720
and like, hey, do you want to go on Rag Bride this year?

39:13.720 --> 39:14.920
I'm like, it's like a week away.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.280
They're like, yeah, you want to go?

39:16.280 --> 39:18.160
I'm like, yeah.

39:18.160 --> 39:19.560
And so I did, you know, without,

39:19.560 --> 39:21.440
and it was one of those moments where I was proud of myself

39:21.440 --> 39:23.920
because it's like, I, it's easy to just be like, no,

39:23.920 --> 39:26.320
you know, I'm not ready or this is my constraint.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.200
It's like, I'm not in shape,

39:28.200 --> 39:29.720
but like just question that, you know?

39:29.720 --> 39:31.320
And so I think when it comes down

39:31.320 --> 39:32.600
to questioning your own constraints,

39:32.720 --> 39:34.400
yes, even to that level of like,

39:34.400 --> 39:37.120
why do you question yourself on what you can and cannot do?

39:37.120 --> 39:39.680
So that's, for your personal life is really powerful,

39:39.680 --> 39:41.480
but a little bit more intuitive.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.880
I think what's really hard is to question constraints

39:44.880 --> 39:49.280
in a place like aeronautics or robotics

39:49.280 --> 39:52.600
or autonomous vehicles or vehicles,

39:52.600 --> 39:56.160
because there's people, there's experts everywhere

39:56.160 --> 39:58.080
that have done it for decades.

39:58.080 --> 40:00.080
And everyone admires those experts

40:00.080 --> 40:01.280
and respects those experts.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.840
And for you to step into a room

40:03.840 --> 40:06.480
and knowing not much more than just

40:07.440 --> 40:09.840
what's in a Wikipedia article

40:09.840 --> 40:13.360
and to just use your intuition and first principles thinking

40:13.360 --> 40:15.840
to disagree with the experts,

40:15.840 --> 40:19.280
that takes some guts, I think.

40:19.280 --> 40:21.240
Well, you can't have everyone doing that either.

40:21.240 --> 40:23.240
You know, like there has to be some humility

40:23.240 --> 40:26.680
of knowing that something is a hardened concept

40:26.680 --> 40:27.800
and a hardened, you know, like especially,

40:27.800 --> 40:28.760
I'm not an engineer.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.800
I don't do this stuff, you know,

40:30.800 --> 40:34.080
but I can imagine you sitting there having spent six years

40:34.080 --> 40:36.880
on a type of valve that perfectly manages

40:36.880 --> 40:38.040
crowd-generated propellants or whatever.

40:38.040 --> 40:39.440
And someone walks in and says,

40:39.440 --> 40:40.920
why don't you just put a heater element in there?

40:40.920 --> 40:42.040
You know, or something that's, you know,

40:42.040 --> 40:44.640
something like because, you know,

40:44.640 --> 40:47.320
we've done that 40 times or whatever, you know, like,

40:47.320 --> 40:49.400
I'm sure there are things like that

40:49.400 --> 40:51.200
that are very frustrating,

40:51.200 --> 40:54.000
but I don't know what that's like, you know.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.360
The thing is with the experts,

40:55.360 --> 40:57.520
they're always going to be frustrated

40:57.520 --> 40:58.920
when the newbie comes in

40:58.960 --> 41:00.840
with their first principles thinking.

41:00.840 --> 41:03.120
But sometimes that frustration is justified

41:03.120 --> 41:04.720
and sometimes it's not.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.640
Sometimes it's just stubbornness

41:06.640 --> 41:08.960
for failing to acknowledge a better way.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.720
And I've seen it both directions,

41:10.720 --> 41:11.720
which is really interesting.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.240
So you need both,

41:13.240 --> 41:15.320
but that tension is always going to be there.

41:15.320 --> 41:19.600
And there has to be almost like a dictatorial imperative

41:19.600 --> 41:22.680
that breaks through the expertise

41:22.680 --> 41:25.320
of the way things have been done in the past

41:25.320 --> 41:27.200
to push forward like a new way of doing it.

41:27.280 --> 41:29.320
And Elon's done that.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.480
I've seen a lot of great engineers do that

41:32.480 --> 41:34.600
in the machine learning world

41:34.600 --> 41:36.560
because there's been so much development.

41:36.560 --> 41:37.480
I've seen that happen.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.680
Usually when there's like rapid development

41:39.680 --> 41:41.520
that starts to come into play.

41:41.520 --> 41:42.600
Yeah.

41:42.600 --> 41:46.520
And yeah, and I've seen that autonomous vehicle space,

41:46.520 --> 41:47.680
brain computer interfaces

41:47.680 --> 41:49.800
that Elon has evolved with, all of it.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.960
It's kind of fascinating to watch.

41:51.960 --> 41:54.560
What about the actual design and engineering of the engine?

41:54.560 --> 41:56.240
For instance, you've learned about

41:56.240 --> 42:01.000
so many different kinds of engines over the past few years.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.400
Just like what stands out to you

42:02.400 --> 42:05.480
about the way that engineering is done at SpaceX

42:05.480 --> 42:08.280
or that Elon does engineering?

42:08.280 --> 42:12.240
The hardest thing to kind of remember

42:12.240 --> 42:16.000
is like how much stuff was developed in the 50s and 60s.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.840
The concepts finally being utilized today

42:18.840 --> 42:21.640
were already literally done in the 60s.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.440
So a lot of the things that SpaceX is doing

42:23.480 --> 42:27.320
isn't a novel concept per se.

42:27.320 --> 42:29.560
For instance, the Raptor engine utilizes

42:29.560 --> 42:32.520
the full flow stage combustion cycle engine.

42:32.520 --> 42:36.040
And that was already developed by the Soviets in the 60s

42:36.040 --> 42:37.920
for an engine called the RD270.

42:37.920 --> 42:40.080
And it makes sense.

42:40.080 --> 42:41.840
Like on paper, 100% it makes sense

42:41.840 --> 42:44.240
because you're basically extracting

42:44.240 --> 42:47.280
the absolute maximum potential

42:47.280 --> 42:51.040
of the chemical energy in both propellants.

42:51.040 --> 42:53.560
And at the end of the day,

42:53.560 --> 42:54.880
you have to be dumb enough to say

42:54.880 --> 42:56.080
we're gonna try using this thing

42:56.080 --> 42:57.920
because it's actually really complicated

42:57.920 --> 42:59.760
to do what they're doing.

42:59.760 --> 43:01.760
But at the same time, so are rockets.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.800
Rocket engines are already stupid complicated.

43:03.800 --> 43:08.800
So adding 10, 20% more pain in the butt during the R&D

43:10.040 --> 43:14.160
if it's in the long, long, long 20, 30 year existence

43:14.160 --> 43:16.680
or whatever future of that engine,

43:16.680 --> 43:17.520
is that gonna be worth it?

43:17.520 --> 43:18.880
Obviously SpaceX said,

43:18.920 --> 43:22.400
yeah, I think we can actually develop this Raptor engine.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.080
So it's just interesting to see the things

43:24.080 --> 43:26.600
that have been looked at or even reusability.

43:26.600 --> 43:28.640
You know, like the space shuttle was reusable.

43:28.640 --> 43:31.520
It was fully the upper stage,

43:31.520 --> 43:33.840
the shuttle itself, the orbiter was,

43:33.840 --> 43:36.400
I mean, that thing was for all intents and purposes,

43:36.400 --> 43:38.280
a reusable rocket.

43:38.280 --> 43:40.480
Now did it live up to its expectations?

43:40.480 --> 43:41.840
Not necessarily.

43:41.840 --> 43:44.640
So it left a lot of bad taste in people's mouth

43:44.640 --> 43:46.960
on the ideas of reusability.

43:46.960 --> 43:48.720
So for SpaceX to kind of come back into the room

43:49.560 --> 43:51.440
and say, we're gonna use a reusable rocket,

43:51.440 --> 43:53.480
specifically, we're gonna do a fully reusable rocket.

43:53.480 --> 43:55.200
You know, a lot of people are even still today,

43:55.200 --> 43:57.000
a lot of people going,

43:57.000 --> 43:59.360
yeah, you're not gonna be able to do that.

43:59.360 --> 44:00.200
Even today.

44:00.200 --> 44:01.040
Even today?

44:01.040 --> 44:04.520
So long-term, you're not gonna be able to reuse at scale.

44:05.840 --> 44:06.680
Yeah.

44:06.680 --> 44:09.360
But definitely, I think the number of people

44:09.360 --> 44:12.840
that are saying that today is a small portion of those

44:12.840 --> 44:14.760
that were saying that type of thing five years ago.

44:14.760 --> 44:17.240
You know, when Elon did that announcement in 2016

44:18.040 --> 44:22.080
for the ITS, it was very, very aspirational.

44:22.080 --> 44:23.480
And people were just like, yeah, right.

44:23.480 --> 44:24.320
You know?

44:24.320 --> 44:25.400
And there was a large number of people

44:25.400 --> 44:29.600
that had the factual reasons to think that and do that.

44:29.600 --> 44:30.600
You know, at the time,

44:30.600 --> 44:32.800
they'd only landed like two rockets or something, you know,

44:32.800 --> 44:34.040
when they did that, or maybe three.

44:34.040 --> 44:35.760
It was a very small number.

44:35.760 --> 44:38.000
When they announced that actually they had just lost,

44:38.000 --> 44:40.280
a couple of months prior, they just lost MO6.

44:40.280 --> 44:43.000
So they were still this young, blossoming company.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.960
And to come in and be like, we've figured out reusability

44:44.960 --> 44:46.560
and now we're gonna go full scale

44:46.560 --> 44:48.360
and make the world's biggest, most heaviest,

44:48.360 --> 44:49.520
most powerful rocket ever.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.160
And we're going to fully reuse it

44:51.160 --> 44:52.240
and it's gonna go to Mars.

44:52.240 --> 44:54.560
It was just pretty out there.

44:54.560 --> 44:55.760
Like it really was.

44:55.760 --> 44:58.480
And you know, it's all about perspective.

44:58.480 --> 45:02.640
But now again, we're coming up on 100 consecutive landings

45:02.640 --> 45:05.200
of an orbital class rocket that's, you know,

45:05.200 --> 45:07.280
45 meters tall, 3.7 meters wide.

45:07.280 --> 45:08.760
Like this thing is huge,

45:08.760 --> 45:12.400
weighs 20 metric tons, even empty when it's landing.

45:12.400 --> 45:13.640
That thing's already huge.

45:13.640 --> 45:14.840
So seeing the success of that,

45:14.880 --> 45:17.200
I think people are now more like, well, okay.

45:17.200 --> 45:19.920
Maybe there is actually the opportunity

45:19.920 --> 45:20.800
to be fully reusable.

45:20.800 --> 45:23.000
That's definitely probably the biggest constraint

45:23.000 --> 45:24.560
that I think has been questioned.

45:24.560 --> 45:25.400
That is being-

45:25.400 --> 45:26.240
Reusability.

45:26.240 --> 45:28.400
And then of course, like the broader one of costs,

45:28.400 --> 45:31.680
of bringing down costs, that it's able to,

45:31.680 --> 45:34.920
you're able to kind of bring down costs so much.

45:34.920 --> 45:38.160
This, something like colonizing Mars

45:38.160 --> 45:40.600
or many trips to Mars will be a possibility.

45:40.600 --> 45:43.720
As people don't even, it seems so far out

45:43.760 --> 45:45.920
that they don't even have time

45:45.920 --> 45:47.960
or give effort to questioning it.

45:47.960 --> 45:49.760
But it's the implied questioning.

45:49.760 --> 45:52.840
Can you really do that many launches?

45:52.840 --> 45:53.960
Actually do it.

45:53.960 --> 45:54.880
Can you actually do it?

45:54.880 --> 45:55.720
Yeah.

45:55.720 --> 45:57.520
I think it's one of those things where you look at the curve.

45:57.520 --> 45:59.880
You know, you look at like 10 years ago,

45:59.880 --> 46:01.520
that was ridiculous.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.840
Following this curve, if SpaceX goes from,

46:03.840 --> 46:05.480
you know, two years ago launching,

46:05.480 --> 46:07.520
I don't remember what it was, 40 times to 60 times

46:07.520 --> 46:10.840
to a hundred times this year is their amount.

46:10.840 --> 46:12.840
And if we just keep extrapolating that out,

46:12.840 --> 46:14.960
if they, maybe not that exponential,

46:14.960 --> 46:17.320
maybe it goes more linear or whatever,

46:17.320 --> 46:19.880
what's 20, 30 years, like the amount of stuff

46:19.880 --> 46:22.880
we can put on orbit and the potential we have to do things?

46:22.880 --> 46:24.320
Like, absolutely.

46:24.320 --> 46:25.960
Now I don't wanna put a timeframe, like, you know,

46:25.960 --> 46:29.360
yeah, I think, but you gotta think it's,

46:29.360 --> 46:31.040
we're increasing the number of launches.

46:31.040 --> 46:33.040
We're increasing the amount of things in space.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.080
We're increasing the amount of payload on orbit.

46:35.080 --> 46:37.360
That's probably not going to decrease anytime soon.

46:37.360 --> 46:41.560
And therefore, eventually, like the idea of going to Mars

46:41.560 --> 46:43.960
is absolutely reasonable.

46:43.960 --> 46:46.960
Let me ask a difficult question that needs to be asked here.

46:48.120 --> 46:53.000
Can SpaceX continue its successes without Elon?

46:53.880 --> 46:56.160
This long-term mission to Mars?

46:57.600 --> 47:00.920
I think the discussion about Tesla and autopilot

47:00.920 --> 47:05.000
or robotics or neural-linked brain computer interfaces

47:05.000 --> 47:08.320
is a question wholly separate from the SpaceX question

47:09.320 --> 47:13.000
because there's a lot of other competitors doing

47:15.640 --> 47:20.080
some different but amazing engineering that Tesla is doing

47:20.080 --> 47:23.840
in both autonomous vehicles, semi-autonomy or full autonomy.

47:23.840 --> 47:27.600
And obviously in vehicle design and electric vehicles,

47:27.600 --> 47:28.920
there's a lot of people that are doing

47:28.920 --> 47:31.160
incredible brain computer interfaces.

47:31.160 --> 47:34.240
But while there is a lot of competitors to SpaceX,

47:34.240 --> 47:35.440
and we'll talk about many of them,

47:35.440 --> 47:36.680
they're doing amazing work,

47:36.720 --> 47:40.200
it seems like he's really driving progress here

47:40.200 --> 47:41.880
over the past 10 years.

47:41.880 --> 47:43.760
What do you think about that?

47:43.760 --> 47:47.320
Okay, the first thing I think to remind people

47:47.320 --> 47:49.840
is just how many brilliant people do work

47:49.840 --> 47:51.600
in each of these companies, obviously.

47:51.600 --> 47:55.840
Elon's had some of the best teams assembled ever,

47:55.840 --> 47:57.000
just incredible people.

47:57.000 --> 47:57.840
He knows this.

47:57.840 --> 48:01.160
He will gladly tell people, and he says it often,

48:01.160 --> 48:02.960
the amazing people, the amazing teams here.

48:02.960 --> 48:05.440
So it is important to remember that.

48:05.480 --> 48:08.280
That being said, there is something to Elon's

48:09.320 --> 48:11.680
just super far forward,

48:11.680 --> 48:15.000
not taking no for an answer on things approach.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.840
And almost to his dismay, I think,

48:19.840 --> 48:23.240
he is afraid of the sunk cost fallacy so much

48:23.240 --> 48:26.200
that it almost gets to the border of being,

48:27.280 --> 48:29.440
throw out everything before it's even,

48:29.440 --> 48:31.200
we've known or not, but at the same time,

48:31.200 --> 48:34.760
it moves the needle so fast, so far.

48:34.760 --> 48:37.480
So as far as the question of would SpaceX continue

48:37.480 --> 48:40.840
to succeeding and be able to ultimately go to Mars

48:40.840 --> 48:43.240
without Elon, the Mars thing I think

48:43.240 --> 48:45.600
would probably be hard to uphold without Elon.

48:45.600 --> 48:48.240
I think a lot of that drive for Mars is from Elon.

48:49.200 --> 48:51.800
It is maybe too fantastical for the average person

48:51.800 --> 48:53.800
and the average employee and maybe the average CEO

48:53.800 --> 48:56.760
that might step in to have a company's mission

48:56.760 --> 48:57.600
be to go to Mars.

48:57.600 --> 48:58.440
Like it's just-

48:58.440 --> 49:01.280
Or even governments, clearly, because like you said,

49:01.280 --> 49:03.840
the Mars plan was nonexistent for NASA.

49:03.840 --> 49:06.840
Yeah, still really, there isn't much, you know?

49:06.840 --> 49:10.000
So I think if-

49:10.000 --> 49:11.640
How many people, and sorry to interrupt,

49:11.640 --> 49:13.680
how many people are talking about,

49:13.680 --> 49:16.680
it's obvious that we need to become multi-planetary?

49:16.680 --> 49:20.720
Right, there's not, there's the Mars Society and-

49:20.720 --> 49:24.720
Like serious leaders of engineering efforts

49:24.720 --> 49:28.520
or nations and so on, which it does seem,

49:28.520 --> 49:31.680
if you think about it, that it's obvious.

49:31.680 --> 49:35.120
Yeah, and the grand eventuality, it is obvious.

49:35.120 --> 49:37.760
Of human civilization and this whole human experiment

49:37.760 --> 49:41.200
we have here, which should be expanding out

49:41.200 --> 49:42.200
into the cosmos.

49:42.200 --> 49:43.200
100%.

49:43.200 --> 49:45.920
So I think the big mission, if we're measuring

49:45.920 --> 49:49.520
SpaceX's success on getting to Mars or not,

49:49.520 --> 49:52.680
I think they'd have a really hard time continuing

49:52.680 --> 49:55.440
to fulfill that drive without Elon at the helm.

49:56.520 --> 49:59.840
Now, I think there's a certain balance and beauty

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
of Elon, specifically when it was Tesla and SpaceX,

50:03.000 --> 50:07.520
where Elon will go in, have mild tornadoes

50:07.520 --> 50:09.640
around the factory and the engineering,

50:09.640 --> 50:13.200
and like mix everything up and things get sometimes

50:13.200 --> 50:16.480
just totally thrown together and totally just like

50:16.480 --> 50:18.360
get it done just to get it done

50:18.360 --> 50:20.240
and start moving in that direction.

50:20.240 --> 50:21.800
And then he'll leave and go do that same thing

50:21.800 --> 50:23.920
at SpaceX or Tesla, vice versa.

50:23.920 --> 50:25.320
And then there's a little bit of a calm

50:25.320 --> 50:28.240
where people come back in and they fill in those gaps.

50:28.280 --> 50:30.440
I think that's kind of always been a pretty healthy thing,

50:30.440 --> 50:33.880
honestly, is like, I think if he is too focused

50:33.880 --> 50:37.640
on any one thing, it almost is like he'll spin too much,

50:37.640 --> 50:39.200
you know, like it's like.

50:39.200 --> 50:40.120
Too many tornadoes.

50:40.120 --> 50:41.600
Yeah, too many tornadoes.

50:41.600 --> 50:44.080
And I think it could almost be like,

50:44.080 --> 50:46.880
you need someone to come back in and like,

50:46.880 --> 50:48.000
you know, like backfill almost,

50:48.000 --> 50:50.120
because I've heard definitely stories of like,

50:50.120 --> 50:53.880
like, well, probably a good example would be last,

50:53.880 --> 50:55.800
last, what was that, last year or two years ago?

50:55.800 --> 50:58.640
2022, yeah, was that?

50:58.640 --> 51:02.760
Yeah, no, 2021, they did the first full stack

51:02.760 --> 51:05.120
of the Starship Super Heavy.

51:05.120 --> 51:06.760
And they call it the big surge.

51:06.760 --> 51:09.560
All of a sudden, like thousands of SpaceX employees,

51:09.560 --> 51:11.240
you know, came down to Starbase

51:11.240 --> 51:12.520
and they just started building,

51:12.520 --> 51:14.360
like you wouldn't freaking believe.

51:14.360 --> 51:16.680
I mean, it's just things going crazy.

51:16.680 --> 51:17.720
BP, it was actually in the middle,

51:17.720 --> 51:18.840
that first interview I did with him

51:18.840 --> 51:20.440
was in the middle of that surge.

51:20.440 --> 51:22.360
There was like commotion, like you wouldn't believe.

51:22.360 --> 51:23.240
You couldn't hardly talk

51:23.240 --> 51:24.920
because there's just so much going on.

51:24.920 --> 51:27.600
People just welding and blah, blah, blah, you know.

51:27.600 --> 51:29.080
Everything they did during that period

51:29.080 --> 51:30.200
was basically scrapped.

51:31.080 --> 51:34.560
Because it was just not done very well.

51:34.560 --> 51:38.440
But they got a fully stacked Starship rocket

51:38.440 --> 51:40.240
out on their launch pad.

51:40.240 --> 51:43.200
You know, and it set, I think at some point,

51:43.200 --> 51:45.920
you kind of have to stabilize some things enough

51:45.920 --> 51:48.080
and just say like, this is what we're doing

51:48.080 --> 51:50.480
to catalyze some things and say, now do this.

51:50.480 --> 51:52.280
It's almost like, do it for fake,

51:52.280 --> 51:53.480
now do it for real almost.

51:53.480 --> 51:55.280
It's funny because through that time,

51:55.280 --> 51:57.120
because I had a lot of conversation with him,

51:57.120 --> 52:00.720
I think that process was hugely stressful.

52:00.720 --> 52:03.120
There was a sense, I don't know where that sense is today,

52:03.120 --> 52:04.960
but there was a sense that Starship

52:04.960 --> 52:07.120
is going to be very hard to pull off.

52:07.120 --> 52:08.520
Yeah, but that's still.

52:08.520 --> 52:10.320
Borderline impossible to pull off.

52:10.320 --> 52:13.240
And that was really weighing heavy on him

52:13.240 --> 52:15.080
and the team and everybody.

52:15.080 --> 52:18.280
So like, to have this chaos of development is fascinating.

52:18.280 --> 52:19.720
Yeah, big time.

52:19.720 --> 52:22.960
And I think they really had to push,

52:22.960 --> 52:24.200
you know, if they hadn't done that,

52:24.200 --> 52:25.920
if they hadn't done that big push,

52:27.440 --> 52:30.560
you know, we might only be now seeing a rocket stacked

52:30.560 --> 52:31.720
for the first time.

52:32.600 --> 52:34.200
You know, it might be a lot more finished rocket,

52:34.200 --> 52:35.880
a lot more high fidelity,

52:35.880 --> 52:39.040
a lot more flight-worthy rocket finished and stacked,

52:39.040 --> 52:41.800
but, and they might not have to walk stuff backwards,

52:41.800 --> 52:44.280
but at the same time, like you do have to,

52:44.280 --> 52:47.520
in this world, you do have to push really hard

52:48.520 --> 52:51.600
to make rapid iteration and rapid change in progress.

52:51.600 --> 52:53.080
So it's, it's interesting.

52:53.080 --> 52:53.920
I don't know.

52:53.920 --> 52:55.520
So lingering on that,

52:55.520 --> 52:59.280
another question I really should ask you

52:59.280 --> 53:02.640
because of you've seen,

53:02.640 --> 53:06.080
you've been in awe of the amazing development

53:06.080 --> 53:10.760
of space travel technology over the past few years.

53:10.760 --> 53:14.640
What do you think about Elon buying Twitter?

53:14.640 --> 53:17.600
So in this perfect balance,

53:17.600 --> 53:20.920
optimized reallocation of tornadoes

53:20.920 --> 53:25.160
throughout the various efforts in human civilization,

53:25.160 --> 53:28.320
do you think, do you worry about his involvement on Twitter?

53:29.600 --> 53:30.840
I mean, personally, I just,

53:30.840 --> 53:34.480
I see that as a lot less important than,

53:34.480 --> 53:37.960
and personally for me, inspirational than Starship

53:37.960 --> 53:40.120
and, you know, the work done at SpaceX and Tesla.

53:40.120 --> 53:43.520
To me, those were two very impactful

53:43.520 --> 53:47.000
and really, really just generally like, you know,

53:47.000 --> 53:48.640
they're uniting, like, you know,

53:48.640 --> 53:49.680
something to rally around,

53:49.680 --> 53:51.160
get excited about rally

53:51.160 --> 53:54.480
and just like a future look forward to, you know,

53:54.480 --> 53:56.320
the idea of we're gonna be building

53:56.320 --> 53:58.480
the world's most powerful, biggest rocket ever.

53:58.480 --> 54:00.680
And it's eventually gonna be able to get humans on Mars

54:00.680 --> 54:01.720
for the first time.

54:01.720 --> 54:03.080
And we're gonna transition the world

54:03.080 --> 54:05.360
into fully sustainable, awesome,

54:05.360 --> 54:08.680
just totally bad-ass cars that do all these cool things.

54:08.680 --> 54:11.320
To me, those were like, that brought a sense of unity

54:11.320 --> 54:13.360
and a sense of like, we can do this.

54:14.240 --> 54:17.480
Personally, I just don't think that a social media,

54:17.480 --> 54:21.240
no matter what it is, I don't see that in a social media.

54:21.240 --> 54:24.880
And I don't see any sort of politicking

54:24.880 --> 54:27.880
as ever anything that's really ever uniting thing.

54:27.880 --> 54:28.720
I understand that.

54:28.720 --> 54:29.560
I totally agree with you,

54:29.560 --> 54:31.480
especially with space, how inspiring it is.

54:31.480 --> 54:32.320
I have to push back.

54:32.320 --> 54:36.240
I do think the impact of social media,

54:37.280 --> 54:42.280
the basic level of meaningful connections

54:43.880 --> 54:45.520
of this collective intelligence

54:45.960 --> 54:48.040
we call human civilization

54:48.040 --> 54:50.800
through the medium of digital communication,

54:50.800 --> 54:52.040
which is social media,

54:52.040 --> 54:53.960
I think that can have a huge impact.

54:53.960 --> 54:55.360
It could be the very vehicle

54:55.360 --> 54:58.520
that increases the inspiration that SpaceX doesn't.

54:58.520 --> 54:59.920
And all different.

55:00.800 --> 55:03.480
The thing I've criticized them a bunch for

55:03.480 --> 55:06.960
is like, why bring politics into this?

55:06.960 --> 55:10.600
So the political divisions that we see on Twitter,

55:10.600 --> 55:13.320
feeding them is tricky.

55:14.320 --> 55:17.280
It's tricky to sort of understand

55:17.280 --> 55:18.320
what is the value of that,

55:18.320 --> 55:20.160
what is the contribution of that

55:20.160 --> 55:23.720
to this whole effort with God going on.

55:23.720 --> 55:26.400
So that's been a big challenge.

55:26.400 --> 55:29.120
But that said, like, again, this tornado,

55:30.280 --> 55:32.440
the number of tornadoes in social media,

55:32.440 --> 55:33.520
I think is really important

55:33.520 --> 55:37.360
because social media has such a huge impact

55:37.360 --> 55:39.320
on us as a society.

55:39.360 --> 55:42.040
And to have a transparent,

55:43.600 --> 55:45.040
have a bit of turmoil.

55:46.200 --> 55:47.360
It's like Tom Way says,

55:47.360 --> 55:49.520
I like my town with a bit of drop of poison,

55:49.520 --> 55:51.200
with a little drop of poison.

55:51.200 --> 55:55.120
So like a little bit of that shake things up,

55:55.120 --> 55:56.160
I think might be really healthy.

55:56.160 --> 55:58.800
I just worry about the long-term impact

55:58.800 --> 56:01.800
on the whole Mars project through that.

56:01.800 --> 56:02.760
But you know what?

56:04.480 --> 56:06.560
This life, one of the reasons that's fun

56:06.560 --> 56:09.720
is through the chaos,

56:10.880 --> 56:12.800
like none of us know how it's gonna turn out

56:12.800 --> 56:15.600
and hopefully we try to help each other

56:15.600 --> 56:17.320
to make sure it turns out well.

56:17.320 --> 56:19.480
And this really isn't like anything

56:19.480 --> 56:22.200
about my personal like politics or anything like that,

56:22.200 --> 56:24.440
but really just generally,

56:24.440 --> 56:26.440
any of my friends that are like,

56:26.440 --> 56:28.680
the first thing you hear about them in their day

56:28.680 --> 56:30.360
is something that happened in politics

56:30.360 --> 56:32.320
or something that some world leaders doing

56:32.320 --> 56:34.840
or not doing or saying and not saying,

56:34.840 --> 56:39.240
I just don't find that to be the most important thing really.

56:39.240 --> 56:41.720
I know that obviously that can affect a lot of people

56:41.720 --> 56:45.360
that has big real world consequences, politics do.

56:45.360 --> 56:47.760
Well, like I just, and this is just me,

56:47.760 --> 56:51.920
I'm such a like, come together, cheerio kind of guy

56:51.920 --> 56:52.960
that I just really think like,

56:52.960 --> 56:54.840
you need something bigger than bickering

56:54.840 --> 56:58.480
about what people said and did

56:58.480 --> 57:00.880
and what they voted on and all this stuff

57:00.880 --> 57:03.240
to really push humanity forward.

57:04.160 --> 57:08.600
I know that politics and by extracting that social media

57:08.600 --> 57:10.760
can affect things like space flight

57:10.760 --> 57:12.440
and even our like planetary defense,

57:12.440 --> 57:14.080
like being able to defend ourselves against asteroids.

57:14.080 --> 57:17.760
Like if politics has their way and everything goes to crap

57:17.760 --> 57:19.480
and we don't even get to,

57:19.480 --> 57:22.920
yeah, we're not gonna be able to continue space flight

57:22.920 --> 57:24.160
and things like that.

57:24.160 --> 57:25.320
But like, I don't know,

57:25.320 --> 57:26.760
I just think there's better ways to do it

57:26.760 --> 57:28.240
and more uniting ways to do it

57:28.240 --> 57:33.160
than what feels like immature name calling sometimes.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.240
Yeah, I think the political bickering

57:35.240 --> 57:36.600
that most people talk about

57:36.600 --> 57:39.080
that's on top of most people's minds

57:39.080 --> 57:41.240
is the thing that will be completely forgotten by history.

57:41.240 --> 57:43.120
It has actually very little impact.

57:43.120 --> 57:45.840
Yes, politics matters, but like 1% of it.

57:45.840 --> 57:50.840
I think most of it is just political bickering,

57:50.920 --> 57:54.120
the push and pull of the red team and the blue team

57:54.120 --> 57:59.120
and then the news media that feeds off the division

57:59.200 --> 58:01.960
for the attention and it's just like a fun

58:01.960 --> 58:04.520
event almost with the blue team and the red team.

58:04.520 --> 58:06.640
So that you kind of have to have

58:06.640 --> 58:08.200
a historical perspective on it.

58:08.200 --> 58:13.200
Like most things will not really have a significant impact

58:13.200 --> 58:15.880
and we should focus on development of science,

58:15.880 --> 58:17.240
technology, engineering,

58:17.240 --> 58:19.600
which is the thing that grows the pie.

58:19.600 --> 58:20.440
100%.

58:20.440 --> 58:23.040
This is what the economists know well.

58:23.040 --> 58:24.840
Just the innovation, the engineering,

58:24.840 --> 58:26.920
that's what actually makes everybody richer.

58:26.920 --> 58:29.800
This kind of political bickering is just eating the pie.

58:29.800 --> 58:32.760
And not just richer, but it improves their lives.

58:32.760 --> 58:35.680
We can look at every modern technology

58:35.680 --> 58:37.720
that is bestowed upon us today.

58:37.720 --> 58:39.800
Air conditioning, electricity, internet access,

58:39.800 --> 58:43.080
fresh clean water, running water, blah, blah, blah.

58:43.080 --> 58:44.920
100 years ago, so many of the things that I listed

58:44.920 --> 58:47.120
either didn't exist or were only accessible

58:47.120 --> 58:49.080
by the ultra wealthy.

58:49.080 --> 58:50.760
And it's through the innovation of technology

58:50.760 --> 58:54.680
and engineering and education that we are able to

58:54.680 --> 58:57.120
have it be that even someone below the poverty line

58:57.120 --> 58:58.280
and the most of the developed world

58:58.280 --> 59:00.880
will have a good number of those things in their life.

59:00.880 --> 59:02.760
And that's just continuing to increase

59:02.760 --> 59:04.440
and continuing to get better.

59:04.440 --> 59:06.400
So I think, yeah, that's to me,

59:06.400 --> 59:09.400
that's in the grand scheme, more important,

59:09.400 --> 59:11.280
but to each their own.

59:12.200 --> 59:15.000
Speaking of amazing technological development,

59:15.880 --> 59:17.800
you have a few videos on this,

59:17.800 --> 59:19.880
but how does a rocket engine work?

59:21.680 --> 59:24.600
You're wearing some of the instruction manuals,

59:26.360 --> 59:27.560
for one type of it.

59:27.960 --> 59:28.800
What's the fuel?

59:28.800 --> 59:30.840
What are the types of different rockets

59:30.840 --> 59:33.200
that you can give an overview?

59:33.200 --> 59:37.280
Yeah, ultimately a rocket engine converts

59:37.280 --> 59:40.320
high pressure and heat into kinetic energy.

59:40.320 --> 59:42.600
That's the only real job of a rocket engine

59:42.600 --> 59:46.520
is to take high pressure gas, hot high pressure gas,

59:46.520 --> 59:49.040
very energized, there's a lot of energy involved,

59:49.040 --> 59:52.960
and then literally turning that into

59:52.960 --> 59:56.000
molecules shooting in one direction, into kinetic energy.

59:56.000 --> 59:59.080
So yeah, what you do, basically,

59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.880
I mean, the simplest version of it is,

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.480
of course, famously a balloon.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.200
You take a balloon, fill it up with air,

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:07.240
you've got a pressure, you let go of it,

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:10.720
some of the air shoots out in a general direction-ish,

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.560
you converted that pressure into kinetic energy.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.960
Now, if you start scaling that up,

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.440
you can continue to do something like that,

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:19.600
like a cold gas thruster would be the most simple

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.360
and easiest rocket engine to make,

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.120
would be a cold gas thruster.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.080
And all that is you literally just take air,

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.320
or specifically nitrogen,

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.480
because it's a little bit more dense than all the others,

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.440
or the majority of our atmosphere,

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.920
or sorry, it's more sparse.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.040
You can condense that down,

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.920
sort of really high pressure bottle,

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.360
and then just literally shoot it through

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.680
what's called a DeLavelle nozzle,

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.760
which is something that chokes the flow a little bit,

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:48.600
gets it to be, takes it and gets it into supersonic speeds.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.160
Once it's at supersonic speed,

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.640
you actually can't choke it down anymore,

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:54.280
you'll just constrict the flow of mass flow,

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.120
constrict the air flow.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.880
So you actually go opposite, you start making it wider.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.920
And once it's already at supersonic speeds,

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.560
if you expand it and make it wider,

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.280
it actually gets faster and faster.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.800
So at first, when it's subsonic gas,

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:10.040
you start shrinking, you constrict the flow,

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.160
it's actually speeding up, just like a highway,

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.360
if you go from, or any of these examples,

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.600
like a water hose, if you pinch it down,

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.920
and you wanna flow the same amount of water

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.040
from point A to point B through a smaller pipe,

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.440
you can flow more water,

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.200
or the same amount of water from point A to point B

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.720
with a smaller pipe, it just has to go faster.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.840
So obviously you can constrict it,

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.960
but at some point you actually get to a physical limitation

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.400
and that happens to be the speed of sound.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.400
Once it gets to the local speed of sound,

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.800
you can then actually do the opposite,

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.240
you actually expand it back out

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.040
and you're continuing to convert the pressure

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.240
into velocity at that point, but it's now supersonic.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.560
And what's interesting is, while you're doing that,

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.920
you're actually cooling it down to each bit of that pipe

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.600
that you're making wider and wider and wider,

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.960
you're cooling down.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.720
So the more heat energy you have to work with,

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.160
the more work you can actually do.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.960
So at some point, a hot high pressure rocket engine

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.200
is the best source of,

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.280
that's the ultimate amount of work you can do.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.240
And the nozzle, so as you're saying,

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.960
there's a bunch of different design options,

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.000
but it's a critical part of this,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.520
how you do that conversion,

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.360
which this is what the environment is.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.960
It's basically like how much can you convert

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.520
is really like the ultimate game.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.880
How much pressure and heat can we convert into thrust?

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:23.840
That's really at the end of the day,

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.560
that's what a rocket engine is.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.280
So you have to have a powerful enough rocket engine

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.320
to actually lift the rocket.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.840
And well, a rocket is mostly just fuel.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:35.440
It's like 90 plus percent just the weight of fuel.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:36.560
So you just have to lift the fuel

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.400
that's going to take it into orbit.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.200
And that's the thing specifically for rockets,

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.120
you're just saying generally rocket engines,

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.640
but for the task of going to orbit,

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:50.160
you're fighting gravity, earth gravity,

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.840
which is fundamentally different than moon gravity

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.440
or Mars gravity, or like you said,

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.520
traveling out into space,

01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:02.520
earth has a pretty intense gravity to overcome.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.800
We're lucky, because I think if it was 10% either way,

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:10.400
like 10% harder, it'd be like, oh, we could still do it.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.880
With our current technology,

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.160
we'd still be able to get stuff into orbit,

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.280
but man, things like reusability

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.760
and this commercialization,

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.280
the success that we've seen in the last 10 years,

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.800
we'd just be on two thin margins, I think.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.440
10% easier and we would have been like,

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.040
I mean, it's just like totally different.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.520
It's so much easier.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.680
It's like this big sliding scale

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.040
and 10% in either direction,

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.440
we'd be either screwed or really happy,

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.320
as far as getting into space.

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.600
So it's just hard enough

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.520
that things like fully reusable

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.680
becomes very, very, very difficult.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.880
I think it's completely achievable.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.800
We have all the pieces to make it achievable.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.520
It does not disobey any laws of physics.

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.000
It does not disobey any,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.200
there's no like hard stops to it.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.760
It's just very, very, very hard.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.120
And so ultimately, yeah,

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.680
like on Earth for the first bit of launch,

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:58.480
again, when the rocket's pointing straight up

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.360
and the engines are pointing straight down,

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.080
pointing up, flaming down,

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.480
you're fighting gravity.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.480
And so that's kind of your biggest enemy

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:07.320
outside of the Earth's atmosphere, too.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:10.560
So what kind of sources of fuel is there?

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.320
So there's chemical rockets,

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.440
liquid-solid gas, hybrid, there's electric.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:18.480
So what are the kinds of fuels we're talking about?

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.320
What are oxidizers?

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.120
Can you just explain your shirt, I guess?

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:22.960
Yeah.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.800
The components in the shirt.

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:30.800
So really, I mean, fuels, there's kind of two terms.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.720
Well, you'll generally hear the word propellant being used.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.040
It's anything that is used to propel a spacecraft

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.240
or used in a rocket engine.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.520
So you have to have, you can have a fuel.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.360
You have to have a fuel, you have to have an oxidizer,

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.480
and you have to have a spark

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.680
to actually get those things burning.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.680
And that's just a general law of like the universe.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.760
You have to have fuel, an oxidizer, and a spark.

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:55.080
Now, some fuels will by themselves spark,

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.760
like hypergolic fuels,

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.120
but ultimately you're always left

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.080
with some kind of fuel, oxidizer, and a spark.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:03.360
So the general ones used most often in rockets,

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.600
liquid oxygen is kind of the king of,

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.320
well, there's better oxidizers,

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.560
but they're extremely, extremely hard to work with,

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.380
like fluorine.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.560
But generally, liquid oxygen.

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:16.160
So you just chill oxygen down to its liquid state

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.000
minus 183 degrees Celsius.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.400
So it can be dense enough to store in tanks.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.880
You know, it's a thousand times more dense

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:26.120
when it's in a liquid than it is as a gas.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:31.120
RP1, which is basically kerosene, is a very common fuel.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:34.800
Another common fuel nowadays is methane, liquid methane.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.800
Liquid hydrogen is another,

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:40.180
it's the most efficient potential for the most efficient

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:42.480
since it's one of the lightest molecules.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.920
So I think, correct me if I'm wrong,

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:48.120
but Phalcon now uses kerosene,

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:51.400
and then Starship uses methane, liquid methane.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.280
Yep, for fuel, and they both use liquid oxygen

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.120
for their oxidizer.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:54.960
For their oxidizer, okay.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:56.440
Yep.

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.200
But then, you know, if you get into hypergolics,

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.560
you'll normally have nitrogen tetroxide,

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:01.800
which is your oxidizer,

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.880
and some form of hydrazine for your fuel.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.760
There's solid rocket propellants, like solid rocket boosters,

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.200
and those are actually pre-mixed.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.280
Your oxidizer is inherently like baked,

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:16.720
literally like kind of baked into the sludge of fuel.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:20.880
So like for SpaceX, it's all chemical liquid fuels.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:21.720
Yep, yep.

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:25.480
So how many solid-based fuels are there?

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.840
Are they still being used today as are most rockets?

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:30.440
Yeah, and the United States really is the only ones that,

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.680
well, the only ones that I guess early on,

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.880
because it was really just the Soviet Union

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.320
versus the United States,

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:38.200
the United States started to use solids pretty early on.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.240
They're simple and easy,

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.160
but these days, you'll still see them

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.480
kind of as traditionally like boosters,

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:47.040
like they're used to just help get something

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.720
off the ground or help give it a little extra boost.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:51.760
So the Space Shuttle famously had those two huge,

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.280
white solid rocket boosters attached to the orange fuel tank.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.760
Those are solid rocket propellants.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.600
Things like the Atlas V can have up to five

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.600
smaller solid rocket boosters.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.320
There's very few rockets that use a pure,

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:08.440
at least these days, that use a pure solid rocket motor

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.120
for its first stage.

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.560
There still are, especially in China,

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.200
there's a lot of startup rocket companies

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.080
that kind of use just missile technology.

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.040
You know, they might use like a,

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.800
there might just be a variant of an ICBM

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.200
that just use solid rocket fuel

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.880
because it is very relatively easy to develop,

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:25.840
you know, model rockets use solid rocket motors

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:26.660
and stuff like that.

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:29.440
So they're still around, but they're just not as elegant

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:33.000
and not as, yeah, not as used these days, I'd say.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.400
So what are rocket engine cycles getting?

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.040
I think getting more towards your shirt question.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.800
You have a really good video called,

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.880
that, I mean, a lot of your videos that are technical

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.840
are just exceptionally well done.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:50.840
So I just, I think you deserve all the props you get.

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:53.240
I mean, thank you for doing this work.

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:55.320
Really, really, really well done.

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.200
So it was called Rocket Engine Cycles.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.100
How do you power a rocket engine?

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.060
And you go through all the different options.

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:04.220
Is there something you could say about open cycle,

01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:07.380
closed cycle, full flow, all the different variants

01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:10.300
that you can use words to explain?

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:11.740
Yeah, without all the pretty pictures.

01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:13.060
Yeah, without the pretty pictures.

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:15.040
So ultimately, you know, like we said,

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:18.580
your ultimate goal is you want to get heat and pressure

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:19.860
into an engine.

01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:21.180
So obviously at some point,

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:24.020
you can either make really thick tanks of your rocket.

01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:26.880
You can like get it so thick that you store the propellants

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.580
in really, really high pressures.

01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:30.580
But obviously like that doesn't scale very well.

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:31.740
At some point, your rocket's so heavy,

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:33.500
you can't even leave the ground or, you know,

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:35.860
so much of your mass is just literally

01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:36.820
the walls of the rocket.

01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:38.620
So at some point, people realize,

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:41.260
hey, we could actually just pump the fuels

01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:43.540
and the oxidizer into the engine at a high pressure

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:46.180
and increase the pressure through a pump.

01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.260
Now, obviously a pump's going to require energy.

01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:50.940
You have to get that energy from somewhere.

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:52.740
And again, at some point, people were like,

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:56.100
well, rockets are, there's already rocket fuel here.

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:57.620
You know, we'll just use some of the energy

01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:00.180
from the rocket fuel to spin these pumps.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:02.740
So that would be considered like open cycle,

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:05.140
closed cycle, full flow stage combustion cycles

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.300
are ways to tap into the propellant.

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.900
Actually on them there's tap off, expander cycle.

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.900
I mean, all of them kind of do the same thing,

01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:14.740
but you end up at some point spinning a turbine.

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:18.140
You know, a turbine can take some of the heat energy

01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:21.980
and the pressure of an engine.

01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:25.140
And then that can be connected to a shaft to pumps.

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.760
And those pumps can, you know,

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:29.140
increase the pressure of the propellants

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:31.200
and force it into the combustion chamber.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.640
Now, the difference between open cycle, closed cycle,

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:38.360
full flow, all those is what happens after the gas

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.280
has flown through the turbine.

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:45.040
So after you've used the turbine and spun up the engine,

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.040
what happens to that gas?

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.720
So in an open cycle engine,

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:50.800
you basically have like a separate small rocket engine

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.400
in a sense, it's a gas generator, they call it.

01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:56.400
And that will be used to create some, you know,

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.560
take a little, we'll say 10% of your,

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.480
the propellant flowing to the engine.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.840
Instead you reroute it to like a smaller rocket engine

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.120
called the gas generator.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.020
You point that at your turbine

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.600
and that will spin your turbine up to, you know,

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.480
ridiculous speeds, 30,000 plus RPM.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:14.160
And then after it spins, it's wasted most of its energy,

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.720
you know, and it's just dumped overboard.

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:17.880
That would be open cycle.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.680
You're not worrying about it after that point,

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.960
but you are left with a lot of unburnt, you know,

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.260
unused fuel.

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:25.800
A good amount of that fuel is just completely,

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.080
and especially because the turbine,

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:30.380
you have to keep it from melting.

01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:34.300
So you can't run it at like optimal ratios.

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:35.540
Not necessarily stoichiometric.

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:37.700
In a rocket engine, you actually don't want it to be

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:40.940
near stoichiometric where you're releasing all the energy.

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:42.820
You actually want to release,

01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:44.800
you actually want to be throwing out the lighter molecules

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.740
so it can be shot out faster generally in the engine.

01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:50.700
So, but in order to have a turbine survive,

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:51.940
you have to actually cool,

01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:54.220
you have to have the gas going through it.

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:55.760
It can't be stupid, stupid hotter,

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.340
else they're just going to melt your turbine.

01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:59.720
So they normally, especially in the open cycle,

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.720
you just run it really fuel rich.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.960
So there's a lot of extra fuel being pumped into it

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.920
that will keep the temperatures at a reasonable,

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.440
you know, at a reasonable temperature.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.480
So you end up with this like dark, sooty smoke

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.400
pouring out of that gas generator.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.080
That's just unburnt fuel, just wasted fuel.

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.800
It never got a chance to be used, you know,

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.080
like in the combustion chamber.

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.760
It's not being used to propel the rocket.

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:25.140
You know, it's just being used to cool down the propellant

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:26.760
that's being used to spin the turbine,

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.320
that's being used to spin the pumps

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.800
to push a lot of propellant into the engine.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.960
So, you know, it doesn't take too long before, you know,

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:35.800
you're a greedy rocket scientist being like,

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:37.680
look at all this wasted propellant,

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.880
all this potential energy that's just literally being

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.720
spewed out the side of the rocket.

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:44.080
So that's where the closed cycle comes in.

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.880
So now you have to get that propellant,

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.900
take it from basically what was being wasted

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:49.880
through the turbine,

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:52.480
and you're going to try pumping it back into the engine.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:56.760
Now you don't literally just pump that, that gas that's,

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:59.040
you know, that hot, that gas into the engine

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.920
because it's actually way too low of pressure

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.000
compared to the main combustion chamber.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.840
By that point, by the time it's gone through the turbine,

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.440
it's lost most of its pressure and heat to the turbine.

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.640
So if you tried pumping it into the engine, you know,

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.000
just taking that pipe and sticking it right

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.360
into the combustion chamber,

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.800
that much higher pressure, hotter combustion chamber

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:18.840
would just go backwards and it'd stall out the engine

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.440
and blow up the engine and whatever, what have you.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.220
So what they actually do is they normally will send,

01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:25.820
there might be some variations of this,

01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:27.340
but the general concept is you actually flow

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:30.900
all of your fuel or all of your oxidizer

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:32.400
through the turbine.

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.220
So that would be closed cycle.

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:36.140
So there's fuel rich closed cycle,

01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:38.540
which would be you're flowing all of the fuel

01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:41.980
through the turbine, or there's oxidizer closed cycle,

01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:43.660
which is where you're flowing all of the oxidizer

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:45.780
that's going into the engine through the turbine.

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:49.620
Now the trick here is you have to have that turbine

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:50.780
after it's done its work.

01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:52.820
So after it's taken some of the potential energy,

01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:54.300
some of the heat energy from,

01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:55.700
we're not calling it a pre-burner by the way,

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.660
instead of it being a gas generator,

01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:01.260
you now call that device that's creating pressure

01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:03.220
to spin the turbine, you're now calling that a pre-burner

01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:05.980
because it's just going to pre-burn some of your fuel

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:07.680
or some of your oxidizer.

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:09.300
The trick is that has to be,

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:11.140
by the time it's gone through the turbine,

01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:14.780
it has to be higher pressure than the combustion chamber

01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:17.360
because otherwise it's gonna go backwards still.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.060
So you really have to get that pre-burner

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:22.220
up to ridiculously high pressures,

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:24.940
like at least 20% higher than your main combustion chamber.

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:26.380
And these combustion chambers,

01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:30.780
we're talking about engines that are at 200 to 200,

01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:32.820
even in SpaceX's Raptor engine,

01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:34.980
up to 300 bar in the main combustion chamber.

01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:38.940
So that's, what is that, 4,500 PSI basically.

01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:41.020
Insane amounts of pressure

01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:42.260
inside these combustion chambers.

01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:43.900
So your turbine has to be even above that

01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:46.460
or your gas generator or your pre-burner, sorry,

01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:48.820
has to be higher pressure than that even

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:50.840
in order to have the flow going the right direction

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.060
through the engine.

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.460
So now you'll have those closed cycles.

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:57.780
You'll have fuel rich, you have oxidizer rich.

01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:59.940
The tricks now, you're starting to get, it's crazy.

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:01.180
There's just so many compromises.

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:03.900
Every little decision you have of like, oh, I did this.

01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:06.560
Now I, oh no, crap, it's gonna do this.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.820
For instance, fuel rich.

01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:10.220
If you ran kerosene, fuel rich,

01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:11.260
you know how I mentioned soot

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:13.120
coming out of the gas generator.

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:18.120
Well, if you run soot through your engine like that

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.860
and had to go through your injectors,

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:21.260
like back into the engine,

01:14:21.260 --> 01:14:23.180
it'll clog the pores of the injectors

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:24.860
and it'll end up blowing up the engine.

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:27.380
The soot itself is so damaging

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:30.600
that you can't really run a fuel rich kerosene engine.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.260
What exactly is soot?

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.660
So it's like fuel somehow mixed up with the smoke.

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:37.660
Like what, I wonder what, what is it chemically?

01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:39.220
Is it some weird?

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.920
It's mostly just carbon.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:44.860
It's mostly just a carbon solid chunks of carbon

01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:48.420
and it can cake up and just literally like, you know,

01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:52.660
like it's like ash almost, you know, like at some point,

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:55.700
especially under those high pressures and high temperatures,

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.740
it can physically build up and, you know,

01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:01.400
turn into like stalagmites and stalactites of carbon,

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:05.940
really hard, you know, forged in a rocket engine carbon.

01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:07.420
I wonder how you figure all that out too,

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.460
is that to be experimented?

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.740
Some of that is chemist like theoretical,

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:13.780
but like you're gonna have to build the thing at scale

01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:16.700
and actually test it and to try and error.

01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:18.900
There's many decades of trial and error.

01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:20.860
And many pieces of engines

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:22.180
that you're trying to piece back together going like,

01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:23.140
what the hell happened here?

01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:23.980
Yeah, what happened?

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:24.820
Yeah.

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:27.060
Okay, so that's close cycle.

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:28.620
So how do we get to full flow?

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:30.180
So in either of those situations,

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:31.940
you're still actually just having the opposite.

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:33.060
So if you're fuel rich, you know,

01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:35.020
all the fuel is going through the turbine,

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:38.620
but only a tiny bit of oxygen is actually being put

01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:41.340
into that pre-burner to spin the pumps.

01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:44.100
And the rest of the oxygen is actually going

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.700
through the pump, the primary pump

01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:47.820
and straight into the combustion chamber.

01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:49.700
Now full flow, the idea is you're going to actually

01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:51.700
pre-burn both your propellants,

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.260
both your propellants are going to go through a pre-burner

01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:57.700
and they're both going to end up spinning one of the pumps.

01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:00.380
So you'll have a gas, a fuel rich pre-burner

01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:02.660
and you're going to have an oxygen rich pre-burner.

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:05.980
Each one of those is going to get just, you know,

01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:07.980
they're gonna heat it up just enough

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.100
and get it up to just enough pressure

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:12.260
to spin up that turbine as fast as they need to do

01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:14.380
to get the pumps up to the right pressure

01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:16.260
and still have enough pressure through the turbine

01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:19.100
to overcome the pressure inside the main combustion chamber.

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:20.540
And they're both going to arrive,

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:22.780
both your fuel and your oxidizer are going to arrive

01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:25.500
in the main combustion chamber as hot gases already.

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:28.500
So what was liquid oxygen is now gaseous oxygen.

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:31.220
What was liquid methane is now gaseous methane.

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:33.100
And they're meeting in this combustion chamber

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.500
at still ridiculously high pressures again.

01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:41.260
For SpaceX's Raptor engine, they're meeting at 300 bar.

01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:43.340
Insane amounts of pressure.

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:45.260
And then they combust from there on

01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:47.860
and because they're already a gas-gas interaction,

01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:48.940
they're happy to burn.

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:52.020
They're ready to burn, they're ready to mingle

01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:53.820
as opposed to having a gas-liquid interaction,

01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:55.660
which is what's a lot more normal.

01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:57.660
You know, you'll have two different states of matter

01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:58.580
and they just might not,

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:01.100
they might take a little more co-oxing to,

01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:02.020
what's that word?

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:04.860
Co-oxing?

01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:05.820
Co-oxing?

01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:06.660
That doesn't sound like a,

01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:07.940
that doesn't sound correct, right?

01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:08.780
Co-oxing.

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:09.620
Co-oxing, yeah.

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:10.860
Yeah?

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:11.700
All right.

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:12.520
I don't know.

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:13.360
We'll cut that in post.

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:16.300
We'll have Morgan Freeman overdub us.

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.940
Yeah, both of us, co-oxing.

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:23.580
The fascinating thing is they're coaxed as gases

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:25.420
in the combustion chamber.

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:28.340
But yeah, they just take a little bit more,

01:17:28.340 --> 01:17:30.180
it takes more time in the combustion chamber

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:33.300
to have a liquid-to-gas interaction mixed together

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:35.780
and unleash as much of their energy as you can

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:37.260
before it exits the system.

01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:39.540
Some of the trade-offs here in terms of efficiency,

01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:41.300
which is most efficient,

01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:44.440
and then also complexity of the design and the engineering

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:46.360
and the cost of the design and the engineering.

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.520
Like, what are the different trade-offs

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:50.140
between open cycle, closed cycle, and full flow?

01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:52.240
Yeah, it's a pretty, it's kind of like a,

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.480
what's the bears?

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:56.320
The Goldilocks, you know?

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:59.200
Like, it's like, you kind of generally,

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.880
the easiest is open cycle.

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.480
Because, you know, you're just expelling the exhaust gas,

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:05.440
the gas-generated exhaust.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:06.280
You're not having to worry about it.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.740
You just spin up that thing as much as you need

01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:09.960
and deal with it, right?

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:11.460
No big deal.

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:15.060
Closed cycles offers 10 to 15% greater performance,

01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:16.420
generally, because, you know,

01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:18.540
you're not wasting that propellant.

01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:20.380
And, but it's complicated.

01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:21.220
It's a lot more complicated,

01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:22.460
especially if you're doing oxygen-rich.

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:27.020
Now you're having hot gaseous oxygen in your engine,

01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:29.400
which just generally wants to react with everything.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:33.140
It's just a recipe, like, hot oxygen is just a recipe

01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:36.580
for things to catch on fire that shouldn't be on fire.

01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:39.620
So metals, you know, under those conditions,

01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:42.660
lots of times will just spontaneously start burning.

01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:44.280
You know, you'll actually turn your metal

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.900
and it will now become fuel.

01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:47.580
You'll be engine-rich before you know it,

01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:51.380
because your hot oxygen is eating

01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:52.900
and using that engine as fuel, basically.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:56.260
So oxygen-rich is generally very hard,

01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:58.200
but that is what the Soviet Union ended up doing

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.180
with almost their entire line of engines

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:02.740
was closed cycle oxygen-rich.

01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:05.480
But, you know, so those two are kind of generally hard,

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:08.780
but offer great performance benefits over open cycle.

01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:09.620
But at the end of the day, you know,

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:13.140
full flow is by far, it's the ultimate of all of them.

01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:14.760
It's the most difficult,

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:16.220
but it also has the most potential

01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:17.700
to be the most efficient.

01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:19.380
Starship, the Raptor 2,

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:22.020
why is that engine using full flow?

01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:22.900
Because it's the best.

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:24.780
I mean, it's just physics-wise,

01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:26.500
if you're trying to extract as much energy

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:27.460
out of your propellants,

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:29.020
there just isn't another cycle type

01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:31.620
that is better than it.

01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:34.020
But of course, it's very, very hard to develop.

01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:35.540
You know, so far to date,

01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:38.380
the RD-270 in the 60s was built.

01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:39.660
There was a power head demonstrator

01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:41.620
built in the United States in the 90s

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:42.860
and early 2000s, I think,

01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:45.060
maybe just the early 2000s.

01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:46.860
That was just the power,

01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:49.740
just the pumps and the turbines and the pre-burners,

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:51.260
no chamber, no nothing.

01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:52.420
That was a big deal.

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.760
Only United States took, you know,

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.900
millions of dollars to just develop that.

01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:57.700
And then there's SpaceX's Raptor engine.

01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:59.660
So you talked about the combustion chamber

01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:02.300
and how damn hot things get.

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:06.220
High pressure, a lot of heat.

01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:07.260
How do you keep the thing cool?

01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:09.540
You have a great video on this, too.

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:11.140
How do you get it from,

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:16.140
from what you call it, metal rich, engine rich,

01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:20.640
engine rich from like the metal from melting?

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.980
Well, one of the ways is to let it be engine rich.

01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:24.780
There's actually, you can use a blade of cooling.

01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:26.180
You can literally let,

01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:27.740
make the walls thicker than you normally make it,

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:29.520
make it out of a material that will blade away,

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:30.420
that will kind of chip away

01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:32.180
and take some of the heat away with it.

01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:33.740
It's very, again, primitive.

01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.580
And it's actually what SpaceX first used

01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:37.180
on their first Merlin engines.

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:39.260
They used a blade of cooling.

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:41.020
So it's basically a carbon nozzle

01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:43.380
and you just let it get either the carbon,

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:45.460
the inner layer of the engine was not,

01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:48.100
it was carbon and you just let it get chewed away

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:51.620
and eaten away and that's just something you factor in.

01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:54.500
It's not very elegant

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:57.340
and it's definitely not reusable in that sense.

01:20:57.340 --> 01:20:59.900
So there's probably really good models

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:01.480
about like how it melts away,

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:04.740
the rate at which it melts away to know what thickness.

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:05.580
Yeah.

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:07.260
This is dangerous.

01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:08.100
This is part of the design.

01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:09.860
It just seems so silly.

01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:12.620
So obviously you probably,

01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:13.740
again, it's not the most elegant.

01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:14.580
And the problem too,

01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:16.420
your geometry physically is changing too

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:18.260
because as you're eroding the walls,

01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:19.980
now things like your expansion ratio

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:21.300
or the ratio between your throat

01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:23.260
and the nozzle exit is changing

01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:24.380
because the thickness,

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.020
like the throat's diameter is actually,

01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:27.020
like everything's changing.

01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:28.620
So it's not great.

01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:31.300
It might not be melting away uniformly.

01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:33.620
There could be some like weird pockets for aerodynamics

01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:36.380
or just a bunch of chaos just can,

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.380
I can't imagine having to like figure

01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:40.660
all that stuff out, honestly.

01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:42.020
Yeah.

01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:44.660
So the more elegant thing to do,

01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:46.220
there's a couple other things you can do,

01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:47.580
but the kind of the most common one,

01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:49.980
especially when we're dealing with liquid fueled rockets

01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:52.220
is something called regeneratively cooling.

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:54.860
And the idea is you basically just flow fuel

01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:57.420
or fuel or oxidizer through the walls

01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:01.860
of the nozzle in the chamber before they go through,

01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:03.020
like into the injector

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.300
or into the actual combustion chamber.

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:08.660
By doing that, you're taking heat out of the,

01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:11.260
you know, you're taking heat out of the metal of the walls

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.540
and you're putting it into the propellant.

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:14.220
So you're typically heating the propellant up,

01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:16.540
which is remember when I said there's a gas interaction

01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.540
versus a liquid, like liquid gas.

01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:20.980
Lots of times, even if you pump them both at,

01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:23.300
you know, as they, you know,

01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:25.020
both being pumped as liquids,

01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:26.700
by the time it goes through the walls of the chamber,

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:29.460
lots of times one of them is phase changed into a gas.

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:32.180
So now you do have that gas liquid interaction.

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:33.500
That's because they're using that,

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:37.260
the fuel or the oxidizer to cool the walls of the engine.

01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:38.300
So when you look at a rocket engine,

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:39.300
although it looks like, you know,

01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:44.220
a nice, beautifully uniform cylinder, you know, smooth thing,

01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:46.740
there's either, there's oftentimes like a,

01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:49.940
the channels actually like milled into the walls

01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:50.820
that they run fuel through.

01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:51.820
And even though they're tight, you know,

01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:54.060
they can be like two, three millimeters thick,

01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:55.660
they'll actually still have a channel that goes down

01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:58.220
and U-turns and comes around and comes back

01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:00.260
all the way down to the tip of the nozzle and everything.

01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:02.020
So it's, it's just insane that, you know,

01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:06.180
that wasn't that's pre-designed and that that's like,

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:07.620
so they design those channels.

01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:08.460
Yeah.

01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:10.300
There's probably some optimization there,

01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:11.700
like how the flow happens.

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:12.620
Well, especially cause you,

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:14.140
you're thinking about a conical thing

01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:15.900
or like a semi-conical thing where the,

01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:18.380
the area is getting smaller and smaller and smaller,

01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:21.300
you're flowing the same amount of propellant through it

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:22.500
as you are down, you know what I mean?

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:23.980
Like the propellant has to,

01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:25.500
so they have all these unique things like, you know,

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:29.460
sometimes different manifolds where they'll inject more

01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.420
or less fuel in certain areas and.

01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:34.660
There must be like propellant simulation software

01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:37.820
cause they can't, surely can't like test this

01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:39.980
on the actual physical.

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:42.140
Well, back in the day, they had to just build it.

01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:44.900
Well, you mean back in the, back in the day,

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:47.820
walked uphill in both ways.

01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:50.620
It was like, I mean, like any,

01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:53.700
anything back in the day before computers,

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:55.220
where you like had, like.

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:57.660
You just had to do it.

01:23:57.660 --> 01:24:00.260
And like your simulation or modeling was like a sheet

01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:02.460
of paper where you're like calculating stuff.

01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:05.140
Well, but you can, heat flux, you know,

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:07.340
like you can literally see how much energy

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:09.260
and how much heat is inside the combustion chamber,

01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:12.340
how much, you know, and that is a measurable thing,

01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:13.300
even without a computer.

01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:14.900
Now I'm not near smart enough to do any of this.

01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:17.940
Like I've never tried measuring the heat flux of anything.

01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:19.020
I barely even know what that means.

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:19.860
I'm just smart enough to.

01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:21.900
You haven't lived my friend.

01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:22.900
You haven't lived.

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.940
But that is something that people would calculate

01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:27.740
and they find out, okay, copper, you know,

01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:30.180
does a better job of transferring the heat

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:31.820
between the walls of it and into the propellant,

01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:33.980
blah, blah, blah, blah, compared to X, Y, Z.

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.500
So, you know.

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:41.100
Materials, people, like I've met just in all walks of life,

01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:44.020
especially just through MIT, through everywhere,

01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:49.020
where there's some people are just like 100 X smarter

01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:53.860
than anyone you've ever met at a particular thing.

01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:54.860
Like you mentioned copper.

01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:58.340
They'll know the heat dissipation through different materials.

01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:00.500
They'll understand that like more than,

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.340
it's like, holy shit, it's possible for a human being

01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:05.060
to deeply understand a thing.

01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:07.300
Dude, aerospace is full of that.

01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:11.700
You'll have people that are so niche in some thing

01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:13.580
that no, like the average person

01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:15.140
has never even remotely thought of,

01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:18.260
yet this person has done it 40,000 different ways

01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:21.380
in an environment being like, well, we found out

01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:23.580
that if we turn it four degrees that way

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:26.420
and add 4% niobium, you know, like just things

01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:29.500
that you're like, what is your life

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:30.860
and how do you know this?

01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:32.060
And the funny thing about them,

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:34.900
they usually don't think it's a big deal.

01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:35.740
Yeah.

01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:37.860
They're usually like, they're so nausea on about it

01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:42.020
that if you don't actually, you have to know enough.

01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:43.420
You actually have to know quite a lot

01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:46.860
to appreciate how much more they know.

01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:47.700
Yeah.

01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:48.900
You won't even notice it.

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:51.780
Cause our popular culture doesn't celebrate

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:56.460
the intricacies of scientific or engineering mastery,

01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:57.300
which is interesting.

01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:59.460
There's all these people that lurk in the shadows.

01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:00.300
Oh, I know.

01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:01.120
They're just geniuses.

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:01.960
Yes.

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.700
Like you see, you'll have like the LeBrons

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:04.780
who are like good at basketball,

01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:06.900
so we understand that they're good at basketball.

01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:08.780
They do this thing with the ball and the hoop

01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:10.300
and they do like it really well,

01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:12.300
better than a lot of other people under pressure.

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.140
Like we celebrate and give them-

01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:14.660
It's this big public spectacle.

01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:15.500
Yeah.

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:16.340
Look at how great they are, yeah.

01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:19.860
The people like, yeah, at these aerospace companies

01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:23.220
and NASA, SpaceX, the kind of stuff they're doing,

01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:25.860
just the, I mean, there's geniuses there.

01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:26.900
And it's actually really inspiring.

01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:30.380
I mean, I've interacted with a lot of brilliant people

01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:32.380
in the software world.

01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:34.740
And maybe because I don't deeply understand

01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:37.460
a lot of hardware stuff, materials engineering,

01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:38.860
mechanical engineering,

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:41.420
those people seem like so much smarter.

01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:42.940
I mean, it's always like the grass is green

01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:44.520
or whatever the expression is,

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:47.560
but there's a depth of understanding

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:51.080
that engineers have that do like mechanical engineering

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:54.280
that's just awe-inspiring to me.

01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:58.080
Not to get too like, I don't know what the word would be,

01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.440
introverted or something or whatever,

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:00.840
but that's actually kind of the whole point

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.240
of Everyday Astronaut.

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:05.280
Like that's almost the whole point of what I do each year.

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.120
From the beginning,

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:08.200
I did a thing called the Astro Awards,

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:10.240
trying to be like an award show,

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:12.240
hoping to lift up and celebrate

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:14.160
and shine a spotlight on the people

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:15.560
that are actually doing the hard work

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:17.880
and try to treat them like the rock stars that they are

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:19.400
that we don't know about.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.880
And I think that's one of the things that for sure,

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:25.560
I think Elon definitely helped make space flight cool,

01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:27.920
helped make that like a celebration thing

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:30.960
where people are physically out cheering for rockets

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:33.600
and science and space exploration.

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:34.880
But I think that's just the beginning.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.600
I think like this should be a thing

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:40.040
where the general public looks to these people

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.960
as the coolest ones, as the coolest places to work,

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
as the most important things.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Sports are great and everything.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.880
I'm a big Formula One fan and things like that.

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:50.040
But at the same time,

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:54.480
we should be celebrating the people doing this crazy work,

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.960
clocking in countless hours,

01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:57.360
just trying to figure out this one little thing

01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.280
that's gonna help us further our understanding.

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:02.320
I mean, what's cooler than a giant thing

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.960
with a really hot fire that goes boom

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:08.440
and goes up into the air?

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:09.920
I mean, like there's no,

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:13.120
it's like to me like bridges are inspiring.

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:15.600
It's like incredible architecture design

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:20.200
and like the humans are able to work against nature,

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.920
build these gigantic metal things,

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:26.160
but like rockets with like a tiny little humans

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:28.640
on top of them flying out into space.

01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:31.320
It's the coolest possible thing.

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.240
Everything comes together.

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.280
All the different disciplines come together

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:37.920
for the high stakes drama of, you know,

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:41.800
riding that super powerful thing up away

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:43.520
from the thing we call home, Earth.

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.920
It's like, it's so amazing.

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.360
Exactly. So freaking amazing.

01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.960
Well, I think that's kind of part of my like story arc

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:52.000
is I just used to be a huge car and motorcycle guy.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.880
Like I just loved, you know, things that go fast

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.920
and, you know, are loud and go fast and make lots of power.

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:01.680
And at the end of the day, like at some point you realize

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:03.120
nothing goes faster and it's louder

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.480
and makes more power than a rocket.

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:07.640
You know, I think that's kind of where I eventually

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:09.360
just ended up, you know, wound up there

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.280
just because there is nothing cooler than that.

01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.520
Yeah, that's the ultimate level of reach as a car guy

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:14.800
is to become a rocket guy.

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:16.240
Yeah, a hundred percent.

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.520
And at some point some car guys literally become rocket guys

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.240
and strap rockets to cars and try and break

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:22.200
land speed records, you know, like it's,

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:25.560
it's the same universe here and yeah.

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:29.640
So Elon, with your conversation with him on the Raptor 2,

01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:32.160
was talking about, you were talking about

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:34.640
like there's an excessive amount of cooling

01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:37.160
to be on the safe side as you're developing the engine.

01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:38.520
What kind of cooling was that?

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.000
So that would be film cooling.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.160
So remember how a little bit ago we were talking about

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.840
like keeping the turbine from melting.

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:47.680
You can just run it off of like off nominal basically off,

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.240
you know, typically fuel rich,

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.960
just run more fuel through that so it's cool enough.

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:54.280
You can actually do that locally kind of in your engine.

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:56.040
So you can keep it so, you know,

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.880
imagine a combustion chamber

01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:01.400
and the top of it's just a flat, like imagine a shower head

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.520
and then you have like, you know,

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:04.440
the combustion chamber attached to it.

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:05.800
The outer perimeter there,

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.320
the part where the flame front would be touching the walls,

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:10.960
you can actually have just more fuel injectors.

01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:14.960
So you're injecting locally a more fuel rich zone

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:16.960
along the entire nozzle

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:18.680
and that would be called film cooling.

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.440
So it's less efficient though.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.920
Again, you're kind of wasting fuel.

01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:23.800
There's fuel that's running, you know,

01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:26.160
and your mixture ratio is off,

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:28.920
but only for a little portion of your, the big picture,

01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:30.640
you know, so that's one of those compromises.

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:33.000
Like you can do additional film cooling

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.560
to make sure you're not melting your engine, you know,

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:38.440
but at the cost of performance usually.

01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:40.640
But you can also be smart and use film cooling.

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:43.000
You know, there's fun little clever tricks.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
For instance, you'll notice on the F1 engine

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
that was on the Saturn V, you know,

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.120
the biggest rocket that had been built to date

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:52.720
prior now to Starship,

01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:56.760
the F1 has this huge, huge, huge engines.

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:59.040
There's five of them on the Saturn V

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:02.360
and you'll notice that like the gas generator

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:04.360
has a pipe that comes down

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:06.440
and then it actually splits off in a manifold

01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:09.240
and wraps around part of the nozzle.

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:14.240
And that manifold takes the hot gas from the turbine,

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:16.600
which is actually, I mean, it's not hot.

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:19.160
It's actually cold gas compared to the combustion chamber,

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:20.560
but it's, you know, in human terms,

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:22.120
it's still, you wouldn't want to put your hand in it,

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:23.320
you know, not live.

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:27.920
And it actually pipes that gas into the nozzle

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:30.040
so that it creates a film cooling,

01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:33.560
an actual boundary layer of cooler gas

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.920
against the hotter combustion chamber gas.

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:39.320
So basically repurposing that gas that was normally wasted

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:41.320
and they pump it back into the engine

01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:44.000
and then into the nozzle, like kind of further down.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.840
So the trick there is it has to be far enough down

01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:49.000
that the pressure in the nozzle,

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.400
because remember as the nozzle gets bigger and bigger

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.320
and bigger, the pressure is getting lower and lower

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.840
and the temperature is getting lower and lower.

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.320
So you have to find this trade-off point

01:31:55.320 --> 01:32:00.320
where the pressure is lower than that gas from the turbine

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:03.520
and then you pump it in and it's cooler

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:06.000
than the gas still is in the nozzle

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.840
and it can help not melt your nozzle.

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.080
So you'll notice that the F1 is actually a good example

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.040
of regen cooling.

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:13.880
So the chamber walls, you can physically see the pipes

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:16.160
actually on the F1 because it's so big

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.280
and they just literally used pipes and bent them

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:20.760
and you can see the coolant channels

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:22.040
all the way up and down the engine

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:23.960
until you get to that manifold.

01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:26.160
Then from there on, it just has what's called

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:29.200
a nozzle extension and it keeps going and going and going

01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:32.200
and that section of nozzle is cooled by the film cooling

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:34.040
of the gas generator.

01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:39.040
They mean the aerodynamics of cooler gas and the hot gas

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:43.480
because you have to have this kind of layer, right?

01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:45.360
To protect the layer of cooler gas,

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:48.320
like understanding that obviously probably has to do,

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:50.640
in modern times, there's probably really good simulation

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:54.360
of aerodynamics and to do that in terms of pressure too,

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:57.760
like to make sure it's in the right place

01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:59.280
that doesn't like go back up.

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:00.280
Go backwards, exactly.

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:03.600
If they have that manifold even six inches too high

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:07.520
on that nozzle, yeah, it's just gonna go upwards.

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:09.160
Pressure always wants to flow from high to low.

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:11.040
The number of options you have here

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:15.400
that result in it going boom is very large.

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.840
Near infinity, yeah.

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:20.160
Especially because you can't do like a small model of it.

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:21.280
Maybe you can.

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.120
No, you can't.

01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:23.360
It doesn't really scale very well.

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.720
No, you have to do the full testing

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:27.560
and that's why you have all the kind of,

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:31.840
that's why you have with Starship, all the tests that,

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:35.920
you think, why would you need to do so many static fires

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:36.760
and so many tests?

01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:38.200
Why is it failing so many times?

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:39.640
Can't you get it right?

01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:41.840
But like, it's very tough to get it right.

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:44.160
Well, and when you're pushing the boundaries,

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.760
you want to know where and how it's going to fail.

01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:47.600
That's right.

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:48.420
So you can engineer around them.

01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:50.920
So that's a luxury that SpaceX does have

01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.120
with the scale of Raptor.

01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:53.080
They're building Raptor cheaper

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.160
than probably almost any other engine,

01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:56.320
maybe besides some of their own,

01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:58.200
at least at that scale.

01:33:58.200 --> 01:33:59.720
Then before they're testing,

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:03.120
I think since last March or last April,

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:07.360
they've tested 1,000 Raptor, 1,000 engine fires,

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:08.360
I guess, not just Raptors,

01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:11.920
but that's just an insane amount of data

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:13.720
and an insane amount of edge cases to learn,

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.600
oh my God, we found out that we were actually

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.600
slightly overspinning our turbine to this degree

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:20.560
and this frequency is harmonic at this blah, blah, blah,

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:23.120
and all of a sudden realize it's rattling and it did this

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.760
and then you can engineer around that.

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:29.800
It's like, ultimately, I think Elon said something

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.480
like high production rate solves many ills

01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:35.080
or something along those lines.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.640
And it's just true, if you have an insane amount of engines

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:38.920
and an insane amount of data

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:41.680
and insane amount of failures to learn from,

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.360
you just know your system inside and out.

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.520
You know those margins,

01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:46.320
you know where the failure points are,

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.320
you know how to engineer around them.

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:49.800
That's how I approach dating.

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:50.720
No, I'm just kidding.

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:54.680
Because we're talking about engines.

01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:57.400
So most rockets, I think all rockets

01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:00.000
have multiple stages today.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.280
Maybe they'll take us in a discussion

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:03.640
of what ideas that could be for single stage

01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:04.480
to orbit rockets.

01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:06.360
But can you describe this whole thing

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:07.600
that you've been mentioning here and there

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:10.040
of multiple stages of a rocket?

01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:11.200
Yeah, no, that's a good question.

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:13.920
So ultimately, like I said,

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:16.680
you're kind of pushing about 90% of rockets,

01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:18.360
basically just fuel with some skin on it,

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.880
you know what I mean?

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:23.240
And so that skin weighs a lot of,

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.960
skin and the engines do weigh a lot.

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:28.360
Like I said, the Falcon 9 on its own is about 20 tons.

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:31.360
Just the booster is about 20 metric tons.

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:33.880
So it's not an insignificant amount of weight.

01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:36.200
So the idea is, with staging,

01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:38.880
is you ditch anything you don't need, more or less.

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:42.680
So Falcon 9 is a perfect rocket to think about this

01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:44.920
because you have an upper stage

01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:47.320
and you have a booster, our first stage.

01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.960
And the first stage burns through all of its fuel.

01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:52.240
Once it's out of fuel, you let go of the second stage

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:54.480
and ta-da, you actually just basically started

01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:57.640
and lit a brand new fresh rocket.

01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:00.080
This brand new fresh rocket now doesn't have all that,

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:01.800
that 20 tons attached to it.

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:02.720
So it's a lot lighter.

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:05.840
It doesn't need nearly as many engines to push it around.

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:07.880
It needs just one instead of nine.

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:11.320
Its engine can be optimized for the vacuum of space

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:13.560
as opposed to having to operate at sea level

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:16.600
with all of our, actually pretty thick atmosphere,

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:17.720
relatively.

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:21.360
So staging is basically the idea

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.480
that you get rid of things you don't need.

01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:27.640
On Earth, again, kind of that whole 10% harder, 10% easier.

01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:28.880
If it was 10% easier,

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:30.640
single stage orbit would be no big deal.

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:34.240
And it probably would have been the way to get to orbit

01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:37.360
by choice, just because it's not that hard.

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:41.360
But with our Earth as it is, with physics as it is,

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.960
it's just, it's doable.

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:46.920
And we've had, and we almost kind of,

01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:49.040
actually the first orbit to take humans,

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.240
or the first rocket to take humans into orbit

01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:56.240
from the United States, which was the Atlas rocket,

01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:58.680
was kind of a stage and a half.

01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:01.120
It actually only had like one big fuel tank.

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:01.960
And what that is,

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:04.320
they actually dropped off two of its three engines.

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.760
So it just ditched some of the engines.

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.040
But if it hadn't done that,

01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:09.160
so kind of people were like, well, that was single stage.

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:10.600
It's like, it still had a staging event.

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:12.920
It still had a ditch mass in order to even make it into orbit.

01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:14.240
Had it not done that,

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.520
it would have not been able to get into orbit.

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:19.040
So you pretty quickly look at your trade and say,

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:22.200
okay, well, if I wanna stick to single stage orbit,

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:24.760
my payload mass becomes tiny.

01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:28.640
You might be able to put a Falcon 9 booster on its own.

01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:30.480
Like if you just flew one of the side core boosters

01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:33.160
of a Falcon Heavy with a nose cone on it and everything,

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:35.600
just say, I'm just gonna fly this on its own.

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:40.480
You might be able to put 10 kilograms into space

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:42.880
or something, a very small amount.

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.160
Well, throw a second stage on that thing

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:50.160
and now you can put 17,000 kilograms into space.

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:54.040
So it's just an order, orders of magnitude more

01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:56.120
payload capacity because you did staging,

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:58.080
because you ditched the vestigial weight.

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:03.080
So the other thing that's hard about that too

01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:07.120
is that the engines, again, that operate at sea level

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:09.840
are often not great in space and vice versa.

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.920
Most optimized for space engines,

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.720
you can't even operate at sea level.

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:16.160
They'll destroy themselves

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:18.240
due to something called flow separation.

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:20.800
So not only are you getting the benefit

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:21.760
of ditching all the weight,

01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:24.080
but you're also able to use a much more efficient

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:27.200
and typically much less powerful engine in space.

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:31.680
So you mentioned on the multi-stage rockets

01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:35.280
that maybe the dream would be,

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:37.000
if we weren't living on earth,

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
but maybe we can on earth,

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:41.760
to have a single stage to orbit rocket

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:44.720
where it's all one package reusable.

01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.000
Reusable gets even harder.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:47.920
It gets even harder.

01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:51.160
So first of all, what is, just to linger on it,

01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:53.960
what is the single stage to orbit rocket

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:56.520
and why is it so hard to achieve on earth?

01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:58.520
You already kind of explained it a little bit,

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:01.920
but just if we were to say like, yeah, that's your assignment.

01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:02.760
Yeah.

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:04.880
Tim, you're supposed to get together with Elon

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:08.400
and other brilliant people and like, you have to do this.

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:09.440
Yeah.

01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:10.720
Why is it so hard?

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:11.960
Why is it so hard?

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:19.320
The payload fraction of a rocket is like three to five

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.080
or six or 7% would be like, you know,

01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:23.760
that's the amount of payload compared

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:24.920
to the total mass of the rocket.

01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:28.520
Like you're lucky to get into beyond 5%.

01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:30.640
So if you're now having to deal with the weight

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:32.600
of the rocket by the time you're in orbit,

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:34.400
like your payload fraction,

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:37.000
just you're talking about like margins.

01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:41.640
It's such, it's so small amount of leftover

01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.880
if you have to take all of it with you.

01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:45.880
So the sooner you can ditch weight, the better.

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:47.120
The sooner you can ditch weight, the better.

01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:48.280
The sooner you can, you know,

01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:49.120
and that's what you're doing,

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:51.760
a rocket the whole time is actually ditching weight.

01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:54.720
All of that fuel and all of that big giant flame you see

01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:57.560
is literally mass being thrown out the back of the rocket.

01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:59.320
But what typically is an expended, you know,

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:01.280
at least during nominal operations,

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:02.960
you're not seeing the engines being, you know,

01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:05.760
expelled out the thing until you get to staging, of course.

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:06.760
And that's where, you know,

01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:08.360
you're ditching all that dead weight.

01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:12.280
So single-stage orbit, your margins just become so small

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:15.600
that it's border, it's not impossible,

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.080
but it's just at the end of the day,

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.320
like almost no matter who you are,

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.320
you end up saying it's just simply not worth it.

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:22.560
Like it'd be, if you have two rockets

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:24.560
that are using the same amount of propellant,

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.080
you know, they're the same physical sizes

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:28.520
and one of them is cutting, you know, on a third

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:30.080
and has another little engine,

01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:32.080
it'll have a hundred or a thousand times

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.920
more payload capacity than the ones

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.400
sitting right next to it.

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.000
And now, so there's tricks you can do

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.240
to like try to offset that.

01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:39.760
Things like aerospike engines,

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:43.720
which operate as efficiently at sea level

01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:46.240
at kind of optimized efficiency at sea level.

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:48.560
And just by their, by the way,

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:49.840
they're designed, the physics of them,

01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:52.040
they're also efficient in a vacuum too.

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.200
You can do things like that.

01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:56.720
And at the end of the day though,

01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:58.480
you just end up with a worse rocket

01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:00.720
than if you had just done stage, like no matter what.

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:01.800
And people say like, well,

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:03.160
what if you develop the new technologies?

01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:04.480
Like, okay, we'll apply that technology

01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:07.640
to a multi-stage rocket and it's gonna do better.

01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:09.920
You know, like, no matter where you end up,

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.000
it's just always better to ditch that weight, you know.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.480
Is there a cost to having multi-stage?

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:16.760
Cause you can still reuse the different stages.

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.280
That's the dream is, you know,

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:21.080
it becomes easier to reuse multiple stages

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.520
because now, you know, like the booster

01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:26.080
doesn't have to survive orbital re-entry temperatures

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.920
and extreme environments.

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:29.320
And you only have to, you know,

01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:30.720
make survivable the upper stage.

01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:31.960
So you only have to put a big heat shield.

01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:34.440
I mean, Starship's the perfect thing of this.

01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:36.640
The upper stage has a big giant heat shield.

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:37.600
The booster doesn't need it.

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:39.400
Cause it's not going, the booster's not going to orbit.

01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:42.880
It's only going a fifth or a quarter of orbital velocity.

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:44.840
So it's heat that it experiences

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:46.800
is survivable just by the stainless steel.

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:49.040
You don't need an additional heat shield.

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:52.080
So all of a sudden, if you're trying to reuse,

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:54.280
pretend that you just welded the two stages of Starship

01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:56.400
together, remove those engines on Starship.

01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.880
That whole vehicle, if you're trying to reuse it,

01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:00.360
the whole vehicle now has to have a heat shield

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:01.440
on one side of it.

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:03.920
The whole thing has to have these big heavy wings.

01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:04.760
By the time you come down to it,

01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:07.560
there's probably just zero payload capacity.

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:09.680
You basically put your fuel tank in space, you know?

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:10.520
Good job.

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:14.920
So the dream of a single stage to orbit a rocket,

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:18.960
is that just even the wrong dream on earth?

01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:21.520
That's what most convention tells you.

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:25.280
You know, by the time, if your goal is cheap,

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:26.800
then you're going to spend,

01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:28.640
you're going to have a physically larger rocket

01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:31.480
that has more engines, that has more propellant,

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:33.360
blah, blah, blah, to put the same amount of thing,

01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:35.320
same amount of mass into orbit compared to something else.

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:37.400
You know, we're talking like Rocket Labs Electron,

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:38.920
a really small rocket.

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:41.280
It's like, I think 1.3 meters wide

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:43.240
and something like, you know, 18 meters tall

01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:46.040
or something, it's a small rocket.

01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:47.680
If you were to, you know,

01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:51.200
and it can put something like 300 or so kilograms

01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:54.520
into orbit, you could either launch something that size,

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:59.080
or again, like a full, like big old Falcon 9 booster,

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:00.880
the huge, huge thing.

01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:03.960
And that would be lucky to put 300 kilograms into orbit.

01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:05.680
You know, so it's like, which one's going to be cheaper

01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:08.880
to build, you know, ship around, all this stuff.

01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:10.560
And then you also look at, you have fixed costs.

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:15.080
Like the idea of flying a, but this, again,

01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:16.520
everything in rocket science is a compromise

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:19.600
because now you have things like people on console time,

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:21.720
all the people that are, you know, on comms

01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:24.480
and working on the rocket, going down to the pad,

01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:26.680
you know, filing paperwork, doing range control,

01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:29.480
making sure there's not planes and boats in the way,

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:31.920
flight termination, you have all these fixed costs

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:32.760
for any launch.

01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:34.400
I don't care how big the rocket is.

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:36.880
There's a relatively fixed cost.

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:39.320
So now you say like, okay, I'm going to be paying,

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:40.200
well, let's just make a win over.

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:43.480
I'm going to pay $5 million to fly a rocket

01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:45.360
between all the people going on site,

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:48.560
all the propellant, all the licenses, blah, blah, blah.

01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:50.320
If your fixed cost is $5 million,

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:52.200
you can put 300 kilograms in space

01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:55.560
versus you have a $5 million cost of operation,

01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:58.120
and you can put 5,000 kilograms into space.

01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:02.000
Like it's, the business case is going to send you

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.680
in one direction pretty quickly.

01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:06.320
So you mentioned aerospike engines.

01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:10.720
I think the internet informed me of your love affair

01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:12.200
with aerospike engines.

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:14.760
Find somebody that looks at you

01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:17.120
the way Tim Na looks at aerospike engines.

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:22.120
Can you explain what these are?

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:25.240
How do they work?

01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:26.400
What's beautiful to them?

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:27.400
How practical are they?

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:29.440
Why don't we use them?

01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:32.520
Does it just boil down to the design of the nozzle?

01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:34.240
So maybe can you explain how is it possible

01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:36.360
to achieve this thing for an engine

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:39.080
to be as efficient in a vacuum,

01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:41.360
and sea level, and all different conditions?

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.480
You know what I love about this

01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:44.040
is that every question you've asked me

01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:46.400
is like a one hour video on my YouTube channel.

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.840
I was like, now boil it down to 45 seconds.

01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:49.680
Go.

01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:53.600
So the aerospike engine basically

01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:56.040
is an inside out engine more or less.

01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:57.360
So with a traditional engine,

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.520
we've talked about the combustion chamber and the throat,

01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:02.440
and then it expands out into the nozzle.

01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:06.320
Those walls are containing the pressure, right?

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.400
Aerospike is the opposite.

01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:09.320
It's basically the pressure of the engine

01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:10.640
is on the outside of it,

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:14.080
and it's pushing inward against a spike.

01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:19.080
So it's almost like the difference of if you were,

01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:20.160
let me think about this,

01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:23.320
if you were standing in like a tent or a teepee, right?

01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:24.800
And you put your arms at the top

01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:26.000
and you pushed your arms out,

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.280
you could physically lift the tent

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:31.920
just by pushing outwards on the tent walls, right?

01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:33.640
Well, that would be like a traditional nozzle.

01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:36.200
Now, aerospike would be almost like squeezing an ice cube.

01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:37.280
You know, if you squeeze an ice cube,

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:38.120
you can push in on it,

01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:41.400
and kind of that wedge force will shoot that ice cube.

01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:42.600
So that's kind of what has happened.

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:43.840
We have the high pressure gases

01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:46.760
on the outside of the spike squeezing in on that spike,

01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:49.800
and then it's pushing up against the,

01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:51.680
because it's equal on both sides

01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:53.280
against the kind of the ramp

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:55.080
is pushing up against the rocket.

01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:56.360
So that's where that force comes in,

01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.720
is against the nozzle and against the chambers.

01:45:58.720 --> 01:45:59.960
The hard part with an aerospike,

01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.640
so the cool, okay, I guess the cool thing

01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:06.640
about an aerospike is that it can operate in space.

01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:10.400
You can have what's known as a really big expansion ratio.

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:12.400
So that's your ratio between the throat,

01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:16.800
the area of the throat versus the area of the nozzle exit.

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:19.360
And remember how the bigger the nozzle is,

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:22.320
it's continually just converting more and more,

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:25.920
it's converting that high energy, hot, high pressure gas

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:30.680
into cooler and cooler, lower pressure and faster gas.

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:33.120
So each little millimeter along that nozzle

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:37.360
is just getting it lower pressure and cooler, but faster.

01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:40.560
Now, if you take a big nozzle on earth at sea level

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:42.200
and you fire it, you can actually get,

01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:45.480
even though we're going from say 300 bar the Raptor engine,

01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:47.400
our atmosphere at sea level is about one bar,

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:51.000
it's pretty much exactly one bar, depending on conditions,

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.280
but you can actually get a nozzle

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.280
to get way below one bar of pressure.

01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:00.720
So every little, you can go from 300 bar

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:04.600
in just two meters down to one bar or below one bar.

01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:05.480
There's actually a limit.

01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:08.560
You can actually only expand it below,

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.520
we'll say something like 70%.

01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:14.000
So you can get down to like 0.7 bar at nozzle exit

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:15.960
before the pressure of the atmosphere

01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:18.800
is actually squeezing in on that exhaust

01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:21.520
and tearing it away from the walls of the engine,

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:23.680
the walls of the nozzle exit.

01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:25.920
And what happens is it's kind of unpredictable.

01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:28.040
You get these pockets, these oscillations,

01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.280
and they'll be so extreme

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:31.560
that they'll end up just destroying the nozzle.

01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:35.600
So you can't lower, you can't have a bigger expansion ratio

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:38.440
than again, relatively speaking, something like 0.7.

01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:42.160
Like you can't go below, you can't get that pressure exit

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:43.800
too much below ambient air pressure

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:46.200
before flow separation can destroy the engine.

01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:49.080
So how come this engine can do so well

01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:51.640
in different pressure conditions?

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:53.400
So because it's inside out,

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:56.160
the ambient pressure is pushing the exhaust gas

01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:59.160
into the wall as opposed to a conventional engine

01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:03.320
that the ambient air is actually squeezing the exhaust gas

01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:05.800
away from the walls of the engine.

01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:09.160
And that squeezing away from is what can be destructive.

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:11.560
So that since it's kind of inside out,

01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:13.440
the ambient air is pushing the exhaust gas

01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:14.880
into the engine walls.

01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:16.440
So you can't have flow separation.

01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:18.440
You won't have flow separation.

01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:21.080
Now what happens is so you can have this huge,

01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:23.280
amazingly like efficient vacuum engine

01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:26.280
that has a, we'll say a 200 to one expansion ratio,

01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:27.120
which is really big.

01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:30.000
Like a lot of sea level engines are like 35,

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.560
40, 50 to one expansion ratios.

01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:35.360
And then in space, you know, it's common to use like 150,

01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:38.240
180, 200 to one expansion ratios.

01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:40.920
So in aero spec can have something like 200 to one.

01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:43.240
It's just that the at sea level is kind of just getting

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:45.200
pushed and it's kind of getting cut off early almost,

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:46.020
but it doesn't matter.

01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:46.860
It's not like destructive.

01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:49.680
It's just not running at its maximum efficiency.

01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:50.820
As it climbs in altitude,

01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:53.700
as the ambient air gets thinner and thinner and thinner,

01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:56.120
it just inherently is pushing less and less and less

01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:59.340
against the walls of that aerospike engine.

01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:03.000
So it actually continually gets more efficient at,

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.160
you know, as it climbs in altitude.

01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:06.320
As does the normal engine,

01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:08.240
but the difference is that you can use

01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:10.520
that huge expansion ratio at sea level

01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:13.840
and you can't use a huge expansion ratio at sea level

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:16.120
with a traditional, traditional nozzle.

01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:18.880
Has that anyone actually flown an aerospike engine?

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:21.320
No aerospike engine to date has ever been flown

01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:22.480
on an orbital rocket.

01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:23.320
Why not?

01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:26.240
And would you like to see a future where they're used?

01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:28.760
Purely, purely because I think they're cool.

01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:29.600
Yeah.

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:30.420
You know, in the same way.

01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:31.640
That's the core of your love affair

01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:33.720
with aerospike engines is just.

01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:34.880
And I said this in my video,

01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:37.520
actually they're outside before I came in here.

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:41.600
I saw an RX-7 in the streets that I just love

01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:43.480
and that uses a rotary engine.

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:46.160
On paper, the rotary engine is like more efficient,

01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:48.260
does, you know, smaller, more efficient, all these things.

01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:49.600
But in practice, it's like,

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:52.020
the thing is actually just like unreliable, hot.

01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:54.520
And it, you know, it blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:55.440
Burns oil.

01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:56.920
It's kind of the same thing with the aerospike engine.

01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:59.200
Like, yes, on paper, it's more efficient,

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:01.560
but now you have a lot more surface area

01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:04.760
of your throat area,

01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:07.280
no matter what is going to have,

01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:08.840
the throat of the rocket engine

01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:09.920
is always where it's the hottest.

01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:11.480
You know, it's the hardest thing to cool.

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:14.800
And with an aerospike, if, you know, if it's inside out,

01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:18.440
now your throat is no matter what, like way bigger.

01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:19.740
You know, it's almost like the size

01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:21.360
of the nozzle exit normally,

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:22.880
but now it's your hardest thing to cool

01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:24.400
and you have a ton of it.

01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:26.520
And you also have two edges of it, no matter what.

01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:28.040
So even if you have like a, you know,

01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:29.860
a circle inside a circle,

01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:34.160
you have like a just insane amount more surface area

01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:36.000
to cool with a limited amount of fuel.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.840
Don't forget using your fuel as your, as your coolant.

01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:41.960
So if you also now take your throat area

01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:46.120
and you have X amount of space that you need to cool,

01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:48.200
you only have, you have a limited supply.

01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:51.000
It's like, sorry, this is the stuff that just-

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.880
Are there ideas of for cooling,

01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:56.320
for cooling aerospike engines?

01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:59.420
It's the same physics apply for an aerospike as they would.

01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:01.360
So you just run into, you just run into a limitation.

01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:03.880
Like at some point, I'm not flowing enough propellant.

01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:07.400
It scales, it scales kind of poorly.

01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:08.240
You know what I mean?

01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:09.880
Like you can increase the thrust of an aerospike

01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:12.000
by making it bigger and increase the mass flow

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.320
and the fuel going through the throats or the throat.

01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:17.000
But at the same time, like it just,

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.680
it's at the end of the day, it's physically possible.

01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:22.300
It's a lot more complex.

01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:24.240
You have a lot of issues with cooling

01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:25.680
and it just, you end up kind of right back

01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:26.920
where you started.

01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:29.420
So it's like, is it worth it to just keep going down

01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:31.120
this rabbit hole, you know,

01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:33.040
trying to engineer this thing to work

01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:34.440
when like you could have probably spent

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:35.560
a 10th of the amount of time

01:51:35.560 --> 01:51:36.880
just slightly increasing the performance

01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:39.720
of your normal engine in the first place, you know?

01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:44.000
Again, I'm going to anthropomorphize that lesson

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.800
and apply it to my dating life.

01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:47.320
And once again, just kidding.

01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:51.280
Okay, actually just on a small tangent,

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:53.520
since you are also a car guy,

01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:57.920
what's the greatest combustion engine car ever made to you?

01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:01.600
If you had to pick something, what's the like the coolest,

01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:06.120
the sexiest, the most powerful, the classiest,

01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:07.680
the most elegant, well-designed,

01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:08.520
I don't know what's the category.

01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:09.960
A lot of those things are different for me,

01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:11.440
but I'd say. They are.

01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:12.640
I still, it's funny,

01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:14.480
because now maybe it's just because it's fresh on mind,

01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:19.480
but I love that mid-90s RX-7, which, you know,

01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:24.600
especially in Japan, they had the 20B, a tri-rotor,

01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:26.600
that is like the coolest engine ever to me.

01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:30.400
The FD RX-7.

01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:33.240
It's just too darn cool, honestly.

01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:40.800
Well, what about the mid-90s that makes it special?

01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:41.640
Just, that's the only time.

01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:42.480
Everything was.

01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:43.800
It's more that I love the engine

01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:45.440
and I like the car it's attached to.

01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:47.880
And I'm not actually a big fan of like 90s styling,

01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:49.280
you know, personally,

01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:52.800
but just that the 20B is just such a cool, cool engine.

01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:55.040
And it's twin-turbo sequential turbos.

01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:58.960
So they used, a bigger turbo takes longer to spool up.

01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:02.680
It's using that same, like a turbine and a compressor.

01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:04.640
And it just, if it's a large turbine,

01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:07.400
it takes more exhaust gas to get it spooled up.

01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:09.600
So if you have an engine that revs to 9,000 RPM

01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:12.160
and you wanna get a lot of pressure out of that turbo,

01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:14.160
you have a big turbo it's gonna take forever.

01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:15.440
Like you're gonna have, you know, your floor,

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:17.960
and then like, it's gonna take a long time

01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:19.360
for that turbo to get spooled up.

01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:22.200
So they actually did a small turbo on it and a big turbo.

01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:24.000
So the small turbo would spool up first,

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.440
get some boost going through the engine,

01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:28.200
get that engine operating, get it up to speed,

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:29.880
get some power to the wheels.

01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:31.720
And then once that kind of reaches its limit,

01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:34.680
you'd flow it into the, divert the exhaust gas

01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:37.520
into the bigger turbo, it's this sequential turbo.

01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:40.080
And then that now can supplement and actually increase

01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:42.920
the overall performance of the vehicle by a lot.

01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:44.960
And I just, I think that's just so cool.

01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:47.000
It's just like the ultimate like,

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.840
brute force out of the box thinking,

01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:51.320
and it actually made it into production.

01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:52.560
You know what I mean?

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:55.120
Can you, what's the sound like?

01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:56.900
Can you tell an engine by its sound?

01:53:56.940 --> 01:54:00.800
It sounds like a really, really, really angry lawnmower.

01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:02.860
It sounds horrible.

01:54:02.860 --> 01:54:04.420
It's actually a terrible sounding car.

01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:07.100
In my opinion, like it sounds just raspy

01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:10.020
and like the opposite of like a big muscle car.

01:54:10.020 --> 01:54:11.060
You know, like a big muscle car,

01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:14.180
it's just deep, gotta roll like, oh, it just hits you.

01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:16.460
This is like the, it's just gonna annoy the hell out of you

01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:17.300
and all your neighbors.

01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:19.180
Like it's, but you love the engineering.

01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:20.700
I love the engineering of it.

01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:23.260
I said, so to you, the car is the engine.

01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:25.780
It's not, all the surface stuff,

01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:29.380
all the design stuff, all the, you know,

01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:32.460
yeah, the elegance, the curves, whatever it is.

01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:33.800
Well, those come and go.

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:35.500
You know, to me, styles change.

01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:36.340
It's forever.

01:54:36.340 --> 01:54:37.160
Yeah.

01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:40.420
I'm gonna apply that to my dating life once again.

01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:42.220
Metaphors, just keep on coming.

01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:43.500
Well, if you think about it,

01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:45.300
like my taste has changed throughout the years.

01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:48.340
When I first saw a model three Tesla,

01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:50.020
I thought it was the most hideous car

01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:51.340
ever and then without the grille,

01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:52.980
I was like, this is so stupid.

01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:55.180
It took me all but two months to think

01:54:55.180 --> 01:54:56.620
that it was one of the coolest looking cars.

01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:57.460
Same with Cybertruck.

01:54:57.460 --> 01:54:59.020
I mourned Cybertruck.

01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:00.220
When I first saw that thing,

01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:02.380
I was at that thing with,

01:55:02.380 --> 01:55:04.380
and I went with, we used to do a podcast

01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:06.340
called Our Literature's Future.

01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:07.660
So we talked a lot about like, you know,

01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:09.260
cars and EVs and stuff.

01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:11.380
We went to that unveiling and literally like,

01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:14.260
we had like almost a non-alcohol induced hangover

01:55:14.260 --> 01:55:16.520
the next morning of like mourning

01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:18.980
the hideousness of Cybertruck.

01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:20.860
Come six months later, a year later,

01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:23.140
and I'm like, damn it, that thing's actually kind of cool.

01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:23.980
Yeah.

01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:26.020
I wanted to also teach you just something about,

01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:28.580
again, it's the thing you said earlier,

01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:33.580
sort of going against the current of the experts

01:55:34.860 --> 01:55:36.460
of the beliefs or whatever is,

01:55:36.460 --> 01:55:38.740
and making a decision from first principles.

01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:41.020
Some of that also applies to design and styling

01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:42.380
and fashion and culture and all that.

01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:43.300
Big time.

01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:46.700
Some of that, you know, fashion especially,

01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:47.540
it's so interesting.

01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:48.380
So subjective.

01:55:48.380 --> 01:55:53.380
Being rebellious against the current fads,

01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:58.460
actually is the way to pave the new fads.

01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:01.300
Well, it didn't take long for others to follow.

01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:03.460
You look at like currently like what Hyundai's doing

01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:05.380
with their, I forget which one,

01:56:05.380 --> 01:56:07.380
like the IONIQ or something like that.

01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:08.300
It's square.

01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:09.420
It's like, it's boxy.

01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:10.820
You know, it's a throwback.

01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:11.640
It's 80s.

01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:13.180
It's got these beautiful retro taillights.

01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:15.300
It's got these square headlights.

01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:19.140
It's very inspired by Cybertruck in my opinion,

01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:19.980
and it might not be.

01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:21.820
It might be coincidental that we're all kind of getting

01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:23.420
this retro future vibe.

01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:26.540
I personally like the boxy.

01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:31.540
So I never, I still haven't understood Porsche's.

01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:37.220
I still can't quite understand the small size,

01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:38.940
the curves.

01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:41.100
I don't quite get it.

01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:43.820
See, like I said, I don't love the look of the RX-7.

01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:44.660
I don't love it,

01:56:44.660 --> 01:56:46.940
but I love it because of the engineering,

01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:49.040
I guess that it represents, you know what I mean?

01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:51.500
Yeah, it's not the surface stuff.

01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:52.900
It's the deep down stuff.

01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:56.420
It's that 50-50 weight distribution that matters.

01:56:57.320 --> 01:56:59.540
All right, let's talk about Starship a little bit.

01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:01.740
We've been sneaking up to it

01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:04.140
from a bunch of different directions.

01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:05.380
Can you just say,

01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:11.460
what is Starship and what is the most impressive thing

01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:12.300
to you about it?

01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:14.980
I mean, you've talked about the sort of the engines involved.

01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:18.460
Maybe you haven't really kind of like dancing around it,

01:57:18.460 --> 01:57:22.780
but because this is such a crucial thing

01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:25.500
in terms of the next few years,

01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:27.500
in terms of your own life personally,

01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:31.780
and also just human civilization reaching out to the stars,

01:57:31.780 --> 01:57:34.860
it seems like Starship is a really important vehicle

01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:35.700
to making that happen.

01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:37.940
So what is this thing that we're talking about?

01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:42.940
Yeah, so Starship is currently in development,

01:57:43.420 --> 01:57:47.060
the world's largest, most powerful rocket ever built,

01:57:47.060 --> 01:57:50.100
fully reusable rocket, a two-stage rocket.

01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:52.380
So the booster is landed,

01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:56.260
and all this is currently aspirational until it's working.

01:57:56.260 --> 01:58:00.300
So I'll say what it's aspirationally going to be,

01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:01.820
and obviously I have faith that that will happen,

01:58:01.820 --> 01:58:03.340
but just factually.

01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:05.220
So the booster will be reused,

01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:06.960
landed and refueled and reused.

01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:10.020
The upper stage will be landed, refueled and reused,

01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:12.700
and ideally rapidly, in a sense,

01:58:12.700 --> 01:58:15.340
not talking about months or weeks of refurbishment,

01:58:15.340 --> 01:58:18.180
but literally talking about mild inspections,

01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:21.500
and ideally under 24-hour reuse,

01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:24.600
where you literally land it and fly it like an airplane.

01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:27.860
So it utilizes liquid methane and liquid oxygen

01:58:27.860 --> 01:58:29.860
as its propellants.

01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:32.420
It utilizes, the current iterations of it

01:58:32.420 --> 01:58:36.180
are 33 Raptor engines on the booster engine,

01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:40.060
on the booster, and six Raptors on the second stage.

01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:42.400
So there'll be three that are vacuum optimized,

01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:45.140
and three that are sea level optimized on the upper stage

01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:46.560
that are primarily, they'll be used,

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:49.320
I think, at stage separation anyway, in space,

01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:51.600
but their main reason that they use them

01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:53.520
is so they can use them for landing too,

01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:56.220
the three sea level engines,

01:58:56.220 --> 01:58:59.120
to be able to propulsively land the upper stage as well.

01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:01.320
So the three Raptor engines are the ones

01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:03.160
that generate the thrust

01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:05.680
that makes it the most powerful rocket ever built?

01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:08.480
By almost double.

01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:10.000
Compared to the Saturn V, really?

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.440
The N1 had 45 mega Newtons of thrust,

01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:16.640
Saturn V had, I think, 35 or 40 mega Newtons of thrust,

01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:18.440
and this has 75 mega Newtons.

01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:20.760
So we're talking almost double.

01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:26.960
It's a lot of power.

01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:30.360
That could be the sexiest thing I've ever heard.

01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:34.360
Okay, so what are the different testing that's happening?

01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:37.920
So what's the static fire

01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:39.320
with some of these Raptors look like,

01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:40.160
and where do we stand?

01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:42.320
You were just talking about offline.

01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:46.600
The thing that happened yesterday was impressive.

01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:48.480
Everything in this is iterations,

01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:51.400
and so the milestones that we're seeing,

01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:53.800
we actually have on everydayastronaut.com,

01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:55.000
we have a milestone checklist

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:56.800
of all the things we're hoping to see

01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:59.440
that we need to see before the first orbital flight

01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:00.640
of this rocket.

02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:02.980
So a big milestone that got checked off yesterday

02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:04.700
was a wet dress rehearsal.

02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:07.880
So it's literally fueling the rocket up,

02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:09.600
getting ready to do everything,

02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:11.040
but lighting the engines, basically.

02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:12.680
So we're talking about loading it with propellant

02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:14.720
all the way, and this is the first time.

02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:15.560
Yep, right there.

02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:16.380
Where's the milestones?

02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:17.220
Right there at the top.

02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:19.000
Click that big picture.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.800
Yep, just anywhere, that big picture, yep.

02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:23.720
So there's the wet dress rehearsal.

02:00:23.720 --> 02:00:25.680
So what's the wet dress rehearsal?

02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:28.440
Yep, so that's where they, for the first time,

02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:30.240
they filled it completely to the brim

02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:32.680
with both liquid oxygen and liquid methane.

02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:34.380
Now they had done component level testing

02:00:34.380 --> 02:00:36.280
where they fill it with liquid nitrogen,

02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:38.320
which is, you know, it's an inert gas,

02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:39.800
so it's not gonna, like say it leaks out,

02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:41.400
it's not gonna explode.

02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:43.680
You could just have a big giant pool of liquid nitrogen,

02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:45.440
like flooding the area,

02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:47.080
but it's not gonna be an explosion.

02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:48.680
So they've done that for cryo testing

02:00:48.680 --> 02:00:51.040
to make sure all the components and stuff can handle,

02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:53.440
you know, being at cryogenic temperatures.

02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:54.640
It's kind of a good analog

02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:56.480
before you start putting your fuel

02:00:56.480 --> 02:00:57.680
and your oxidizer in there.

02:00:57.680 --> 02:01:00.200
But now, as of yesterday,

02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:02.820
they fully fueled the rocket with propellant,

02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:04.840
both stages, the first stage and the second stage,

02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:06.560
while fully stacked on the pad.

02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:08.680
Like basically, I mean, it was the first sense

02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:09.520
that we really got off like,

02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:12.160
this is what it's gonna look like right before it takes off.

02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:13.640
You know, kind of breathing,

02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:15.500
coming to life for the first time.

02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:16.800
What does the pad look like?

02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:18.960
So there's a few interesting aspects of this.

02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:21.860
What's up with the chopsticks and all of that?

02:01:21.860 --> 02:01:25.200
Yeah, so the launch pad is unique.

02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:27.360
I've never seen anything like it

02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:30.960
in the prior history of space flight,

02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:33.000
but it's a really simple launch stand.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:33.840
They basically have like this,

02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:35.560
it almost looks like a stool,

02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:38.640
like a milking a cow stool thing,

02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:40.360
with a big giant.

02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:41.680
Now I know you're from Iowa, but yeah.

02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:44.560
Yes, we all know what that stool looks like.

02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:47.120
Oh yeah, we all been sitting on that stool milking a cow.

02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:50.080
Yeah, in there, on there.

02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:51.440
With a giant hole in the middle,

02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:52.920
and that hole in the middle of that stool

02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:54.020
is where the rocket sits,

02:01:54.020 --> 02:01:56.440
and it sits on these launch clamps.

02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:58.920
And then next to it is the,

02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:00.560
so that's the orbital launch mount,

02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:03.280
and then next to it there are the OLM, some people will say.

02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:06.560
Next to it is the Orbital Launch Tower, or the OLT.

02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:09.880
And that is not only integral

02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:11.760
to fueling up the upper stage.

02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:14.460
The upper stage has to have propellant lines run to it,

02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:17.800
so that they can fill it with propellant and all that.

02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:20.280
But it also, they ended up making it so,

02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:22.020
instead of having a big crane on site

02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:23.860
to stack the two on top of each other,

02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:26.720
they literally just use that tower as a crane.

02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:28.160
So the crane has these giant arms,

02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:29.480
lovingly called the chopsticks,

02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:32.480
or the whole system can be called Mechazilla.

02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:33.440
And that will grab onto,

02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:35.320
first it'll grab onto the booster,

02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:37.480
pick it up off of its transporter

02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:40.000
that transports it from the production site,

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.480
lifts it up, puts it down onto the launch mount,

02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:44.860
and then it will pick up the second stage,

02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:46.320
or the upper stage starship,

02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:49.700
and plop it down on top of the booster.

02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:51.640
And they did that for the first time last year.

02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:53.260
Actually, I think it was like Valentine's last year,

02:02:53.260 --> 02:02:55.720
was the first time they used the chopsticks to stack it.

02:02:55.720 --> 02:02:58.320
And now they're doing it quite frequently, you know?

02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:00.000
But ultimately, those chopsticks

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.320
have to serve a second purpose.

02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:03.160
They're actually going to utilize,

02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:04.980
if you say catch,

02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:07.000
it's not so much they're going to catch the booster

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:07.840
with these chopsticks,

02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:10.520
it's not like it's a dad trying to catch a falling child,

02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:11.340
you know?

02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:13.920
It's more that the booster and the starship

02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:17.320
will someday land on those arms.

02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:18.240
Yeah.

02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:20.760
So they're more or less stationary.

02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:23.200
I'm sure there's some bit of adjustment

02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:24.040
that the arms will do,

02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:26.640
but more or less the rocket's gonna propulsively land

02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:29.000
and get picked up by what's essentially

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.480
like two relatively small ball joints

02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:34.320
that hold the entire thing.

02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:38.720
And so it has to land very precisely on these mounts,

02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:40.600
then onto the launch mount.

02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:42.200
And then that's what's going to just place it back

02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:46.280
onto the stand and allow it to be refueled and fly again.

02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:48.180
What's the idea of using the arms

02:03:48.180 --> 02:03:50.880
versus having a launch pad to land on?

02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:52.480
What's the benefit?

02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:54.520
You are basically removing the mass

02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:56.280
of what would be heavy landing legs,

02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:58.640
and you're putting kind of that landing infrastructure

02:03:58.640 --> 02:03:59.720
onto a ground system.

02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:01.560
So you're not having to carry those landing legs

02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:02.760
into orbit.

02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:04.640
But it's also elevated off the ground.

02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:05.800
Is there some aspect to that

02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:08.680
where you don't have to balance the thrust and all the...

02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:11.040
You can negate some of those,

02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:12.320
there's plume-plume interactions,

02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:14.440
there's the exhaust hitting concrete,

02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:15.880
and especially with a rocket this big,

02:04:15.880 --> 02:04:19.440
it's gonna use three Raptor engines firing.

02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:22.160
If you have them firing really close to the ground,

02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:24.280
you're just gonna absolutely destroy and crater the ground,

02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:26.240
and you're gonna have to refurbish the ground

02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:28.440
and the landing pad every time,

02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:33.320
or have huge landing legs that are super long and tall

02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:36.680
to make it so it's elevated enough to not do that.

02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:39.720
So yeah, you're avoiding that whole mess

02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:41.800
by catching it high enough off the ground

02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:43.120
that you don't have to factor that in.

02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:45.120
And that's how many engines are involved

02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:47.280
in the landing parts, the three Raptor engines?

02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:48.440
Well, we haven't actually,

02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:52.360
we haven't to date seen the exact landing sequence.

02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:53.920
So it might be something like at first,

02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:56.480
they might light up seven or something,

02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:57.560
or nine or something,

02:04:57.560 --> 02:05:00.080
some number to accelerate quickly,

02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:01.880
or decelerate quickly, same thing,

02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:05.560
and then shut it down to three or something

02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:07.760
for a little bit more granular control.

02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:09.120
Because unlike Falcon 9,

02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:11.480
Starship has enough engines and variability

02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:13.200
to actually, if it needed to hover,

02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:15.880
to maybe more precisely align itself with the pad,

02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:17.520
it would have that capability.

02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:19.400
And especially having multiple engines,

02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:21.160
if you only have a single engine running,

02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:24.320
you can't really roll, your roll axis,

02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:26.520
you can do pitch and yaw because the engine

02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:30.120
is kind of like a rudder, it can move in two axes.

02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:32.440
So you can easily pitch and yaw the vehicle.

02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:35.640
But to actually induce roll along its vertical axis,

02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:38.380
you would either need like auxiliary engines to roll it,

02:05:38.380 --> 02:05:39.840
or you'd need a pair of engines

02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:42.720
so they can be opposed and induce roll.

02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:44.800
So by having two or three running,

02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:47.480
they have all three axes of control that they would need,

02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:48.640
kind of like a broomstick, you know,

02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:51.000
and balancing a broomstick on your hand,

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.080
they can just move it over.

02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:55.240
And if they need to align it to those landing nubs,

02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:56.680
on the landing arms and stuff like that,

02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:58.780
then they can do that.

02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:02.640
Speaking of pitching yaw, the thing,

02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:05.800
so Starship flips on its belly flops,

02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:10.120
there's a interesting kind of maneuver

02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:12.240
on the way down to land.

02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:13.360
Can you describe that maneuver?

02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:14.200
What's involved with that?

02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:16.320
Yeah, so this is definitely a first.

02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:18.360
I don't think anything's tried landing like this before,

02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:21.860
but the idea is when you're falling through the atmosphere,

02:06:21.860 --> 02:06:24.080
the atmosphere could actually do a lot of work for you.

02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:25.520
You're moving quickly.

02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:27.720
Something is falling from space.

02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:29.040
There's a lot of energy involved.

02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:31.040
You have a really good video on this as well.

02:06:31.040 --> 02:06:36.040
And, thank you, as it's falling, you know,

02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:40.700
you want to let the atmosphere do as much work as it can.

02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:44.520
And so if you have a unsymmetric, you know,

02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:46.120
it's not a ball that's falling.

02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:48.600
This is some kind of object with shape.

02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:50.800
Some, you know, at one face of it

02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:53.160
is going to have more surface area than the other face.

02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:55.640
So, you know, in the shape of like a cylinder,

02:06:55.640 --> 02:06:58.260
if you're falling, you know, like a soda can,

02:06:58.260 --> 02:07:00.600
if you're falling top or bottom first,

02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:02.720
it's a certain amount of surface area.

02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:03.840
If you flip that on its side,

02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:05.800
you actually have a lot more surface area.

02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:07.960
So with the same exact vehicle,

02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:09.400
you can actually have a lot more drag.

02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:11.280
You can actually slow it down a lot more

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:15.480
using the exact same like, same atmosphere, same vehicle,

02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:17.400
just by turning it 90 degrees,

02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:18.700
you can slow it down substantially,

02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:21.440
like three or four times slower.

02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:24.400
So that's energy that you don't have to use anywhere else.

02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:26.040
You know, you don't have to use an engine to slow you down.

02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:27.080
You don't have to do anything else.

02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:29.220
So SpaceX realized, okay, if we flip this thing on its side

02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:31.360
and let it fall like a skydiver almost, you know,

02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:32.800
instead of like pencil diving into the pool,

02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:33.840
you're belly flopping.

02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:37.520
You're maximizing the amount of surface area

02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:39.920
that's in the wind stream that's being slowed down.

02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:42.680
But obviously like in order to land,

02:07:42.680 --> 02:07:44.960
especially if you're SpaceX and, you know,

02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:48.320
Elon's obsessed with like not having different parts,

02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:50.880
you know, he wants, the best part is no part.

02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:53.240
So if you're going to land with the engines,

02:07:53.240 --> 02:07:56.040
you might as well use engines that you've already have,

02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:57.440
the engines that are, you know,

02:07:57.440 --> 02:07:59.400
used for the other portions of flight.

02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:01.480
So you kick those on and you use those engines

02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:03.040
to actually turn it 90 degrees

02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:05.660
from belly flopping to feet first.

02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:09.120
And that way you can use those same engines to land

02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:11.600
and you don't have to have like auxiliary landing engines.

02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:13.280
You don't have to have forces, you know,

02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:15.600
even if you were to land like on its belly

02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:17.080
with a separate set of engines,

02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:19.200
not only would those engines weigh a lot, you know,

02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:21.760
and be extra complexity, et cetera, et cetera.

02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:23.400
But you also don't have to make the ship

02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:26.080
be able to handle landing, you know, like on its belly,

02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:28.640
as opposed to having the forces be vertical through it.

02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:30.640
But it's a giant thing.

02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:33.680
You have to rotate in the air.

02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:34.520
Huge.

02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:36.360
And as you also highlight, you know,

02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:41.120
there's liquid fuel slushing around in the tank.

02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:44.880
So like you can't, I guess, use that fuel directly.

02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:46.120
You have to have another kind of fuel.

02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:48.360
Like there's just complexities there

02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:53.640
plus the actual maneuver is difficult from that.

02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:57.080
Like what are the thrusts that actually make that,

02:08:57.080 --> 02:08:58.360
make all that happen?

02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:02.920
You're adding a lot of complexity, not a lot,

02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:06.000
but your complexity to the maneuver

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.960
and possibility where failure could happen

02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:10.840
in order to sort of save,

02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:14.240
in order for the air to do some of the work.

02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:16.360
So what is some of that complexity?

02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:18.160
Just, you can linger on it.

02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:19.960
If you think about what it's gonna take

02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:22.560
to go from horizontal to vertical,

02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:24.680
this rocket in particular,

02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:26.960
Starship has these big flaps.

02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:30.760
So it has kind of two nose flaps and two rearward flaps.

02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:31.960
The rearward flaps are a lot bigger

02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:33.600
because the majority of the mass,

02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:35.800
the engines and stuff are in the back of the vehicle.

02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:37.920
So in order to kind of be stable

02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:40.160
and they just fold themselves inwards,

02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:43.440
like on their dihedral angle at a dihedral angle

02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:46.640
in order to increase or decrease the drag.

02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:49.320
So you can control it's all three axes of control

02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:52.200
while it's falling on its belly,

02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:53.240
you can control it that way

02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:55.400
using these four different fins.

02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:57.560
So you have these giant moving surfaces

02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:00.240
that take thousands of horsepower,

02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:01.440
it's just insane amount of torque

02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:02.920
in order to move these quickly enough

02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:05.400
to be a valid control surface.

02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:07.560
So that's a huge complication is moving these fins

02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:09.800
and developing that landing algorithm

02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:13.280
and the control for a huge vehicle

02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:15.720
with flaps going in and out, in and out, in and out

02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:17.440
to stay stable.

02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:19.760
Then right as you light the engines,

02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:22.160
now all of a sudden you want the top,

02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:23.600
you wanna flip the rock at 90 degrees

02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:26.440
so the rearward flaps, the bottom flaps fold in,

02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:28.240
they tuck all the way in to minimize drag,

02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:30.480
that's gonna make it wanna swing down,

02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:31.680
you extend the upper flaps,

02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:34.000
that makes it so the nose wants it to pitch up,

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
you kick on the engines,

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.760
they're now lighting all three engines

02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:40.160
at least as of the last successful attempts,

02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:42.080
they light all three of the sea level Raptor engines

02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:45.400
and they're pitched all the way like 10 or 15 degrees

02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:47.880
or whatever the maximum pitch is on them

02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:51.080
and that induces, it does that kick maneuver

02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:53.880
to kick it over from horizontal to vertical.

02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:55.680
Now the problem is you lit your engines

02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:57.080
while you're horizontal,

02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:00.520
so they put some horizontal velocity into the rocket,

02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:03.080
they push the rocket, at the time the nose is,

02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:04.440
at the time of lighting those engines,

02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:06.360
the nose is facing the horizon

02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:09.040
and the engines are facing the opposite horizon,

02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:11.240
so you now shot it a decent amount

02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:14.840
in the direction that you're not falling.

02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:19.040
So you have to factor that in to where you're landing

02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:20.240
because you're gonna land on this precise,

02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:22.440
in this case you're gonna land on the inside the arm,

02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:24.000
the loving arms of the chopsticks,

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.960
the Creed arms wide open,

02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:27.240
you're gonna try to land inside this.

02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:29.080
Zach, this song that you're playing through my head

02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:31.600
as I watch this now, thank you,

02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:34.000
thank you for forever joining those two,

02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:36.480
I appreciate this.

02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:38.200
And you have to very precisely control,

02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:40.280
so what you have to do is now that it's done that kick,

02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:43.000
you also have to cancel out that horizontal velocity,

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:46.200
so it's actually gonna rotate beyond 90 degrees

02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:49.200
to cancel out that horizontal velocity

02:11:49.200 --> 02:11:52.520
and then modulate the engines to make it so the thrust

02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:55.720
is perfect so that it can control itself

02:11:55.720 --> 02:11:57.400
into a controlled landing.

02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:01.280
And all this is done in like 500 meters, like 1500 feet,

02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:03.600
you're doing all of those things

02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:06.280
stupidly close to the ground, it looks absurd,

02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:08.520
so far they've done five of these tests,

02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:11.480
the first four all blew up,

02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:14.640
they're all coming in from about 10 kilometers

02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:18.600
or 33,000 feet, falling, flipping,

02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:20.520
again, this thing is huge that just the booster

02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:24.640
or just the upper stage of this is like 50 meters tall,

02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:27.160
so it's 150, it's like 45 meters,

02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:30.520
about 50 meters tall, about 165 feet tall,

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:32.240
nine meters wide, so 30 feet wide,

02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:34.160
it weighs something like,

02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:35.440
God, I don't remember if it's something

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:38.760
like 120 metric tons, so 120,000 kilograms,

02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:42.080
a quarter of a million pounds empty

02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:43.880
and it's doing this flip maneuver

02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:45.560
and it has to do all this perfectly,

02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:47.120
so the first four attempts of this

02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:49.280
were pretty spectacular failures.

02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:51.760
So just to clarify, which stage is doing this maneuver?

02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:54.760
It's the upper stage is doing this belly flop maneuver.

02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:59.040
So this is the stage that would presumably

02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:02.760
have humans on board if we were to use.

02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:05.440
And if things continue to plan,

02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:08.480
now here's something I would love to see,

02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:10.840
just saying this, if you already have

02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:13.480
these big arrow surfaces, the flaps,

02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:15.840
they also have to move, they're on heavy motors

02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:18.120
and hinges and flaps and all that stuff,

02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:20.760
I'm actually surprised that for Earth,

02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:22.560
they aren't just looking at landing it horizontally

02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:24.080
on a runway like Space Shuttle.

02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:29.000
I mean, that worked, the blonde did it,

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.840
the Soviet Union's blonde, I rolled my R real hard there,

02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:32.680
sorry.

02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:33.600
Thank you, wow.

02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:34.440
Wow.

02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:35.280
Really gets spicy.

02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:37.120
I'm very impressed, I'm very impressed.

02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:39.920
And the blonde did it, we have other space planes

02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:42.240
like the X-37B, we have the upcoming

02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:44.400
Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser,

02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:46.920
it's, yeah, you have some extra mass in the wings,

02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:49.280
but so does Starship, Starship has the extra mass

02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:53.320
of those flaps and the motors and the hinges

02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:56.160
and all that stuff, I would like to see the trade on,

02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:59.600
is it actually lighter weight to do that

02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:01.920
versus doing what SpaceX is doing?

02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:04.800
So yeah, I mean, that's the funny thing,

02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:07.360
I think realistically, if Elon walks in the door tomorrow

02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:09.520
and says, guys, we did some simulations

02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:12.600
and actually it's like, we can get another 5,000 kilograms

02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:14.520
in the space if we just land it horizontally,

02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:16.800
if we kind of give up on our ego and land horizontally,

02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:21.240
at least on Earth, then I think they could be doing that

02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:23.480
pretty quickly, because that's the thing is,

02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:25.560
that's ultimate thing has been to land on Mars

02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:28.360
and other planets and Mars doesn't have a runway,

02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:31.120
doesn't have a thick enough atmosphere

02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:32.920
to utilize aerodynamic flight like that,

02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:36.000
so you have to do propulsive landing for Mars,

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.120
you're gonna land on an unprepared surface,

02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:41.360
so it has to be able to do this at some point,

02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:45.000
the ultimate, it sounds ridiculous and it is,

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.400
but the ultimate goal of it is to land on Mars.

02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:49.680
There's not much of an atmosphere to like,

02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:53.320
to help you with the, for the belly flop to be useful.

02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:55.560
There's only 1% the atmosphere on Mars

02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:58.040
as there is on Earth, but you still wanna utilize

02:14:58.040 --> 02:14:59.520
as much of that atmosphere as possible.

02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:02.280
So in the upper atmosphere, it's still going to be

02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:05.360
coming in more or less kind of perpendicular

02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:07.720
to the airstream, I guess it's probably more like,

02:15:07.720 --> 02:15:10.840
you know, 60 degrees, 70 degrees to the airstream,

02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:12.600
like where it's belly flopping,

02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:14.360
and it's gonna especially do that on Mars,

02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:17.480
it's gonna need to, you know, use up as,

02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:19.400
let the little bit of atmosphere there is,

02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:21.880
you know, you're coming in at insane velocities,

02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:23.720
and so even that 1% thin atmosphere

02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:25.560
is still going to do a lot of work.

02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:30.240
Now on Mars, there's only 38% of Earth's gravity on Mars.

02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:32.720
So the belly flop maneuver is a lot,

02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:34.160
it could be a lot more conservative.

02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:37.280
You could do that at like 5,000 feet up,

02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:38.960
and it just wouldn't matter as much

02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:41.480
because there's not as much gravity loss or gravity drag.

02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:43.760
So you can kind of just more slowly, gently,

02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:46.080
you know, you don't have to do this crazy extravagant

02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:49.640
like belly flop, you know, flip maneuver,

02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:51.200
but it would still, something at some point,

02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:53.220
you would transition from more or less

02:15:53.260 --> 02:15:54.820
perpendicular to the airstream to,

02:15:54.820 --> 02:15:58.060
you know, and horizontal to landing vertically.

02:15:58.060 --> 02:16:00.860
I like how we're having this old, boring conversation

02:16:00.860 --> 02:16:04.220
about the differences of landing on Earth versus on Mars.

02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:10.820
This is surreal that this is actually a real conversation,

02:16:10.820 --> 02:16:13.860
that this is something that we're discussing

02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:15.660
because it has to do both.

02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:18.580
Yeah, but in my opinion,

02:16:18.580 --> 02:16:21.020
I think we'll pretty quickly see an evolution of Starship

02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:24.820
that's like dedicated versions for certain tasks.

02:16:24.820 --> 02:16:26.260
And at the end of the day,

02:16:26.260 --> 02:16:29.340
again, if someone runs a simulation says

02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:30.540
it's actually more efficient

02:16:30.540 --> 02:16:34.140
and it's better just to land horizontally on a runway,

02:16:34.140 --> 02:16:35.820
then that's what's gonna happen.

02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:39.340
You know, it doesn't matter, but they still will develop,

02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:41.140
you know, if the ultimate goal is to land on Mars,

02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:44.060
then they'll have a dedicated Mars variant, you know,

02:16:44.060 --> 02:16:46.740
which will likely look different than the Earth variant,

02:16:46.740 --> 02:16:48.460
you know, and they'll still probably be launched

02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:50.620
on the same booster, you know what I mean?

02:16:51.180 --> 02:16:53.420
Oh, you mean like that particular vehicle

02:16:53.420 --> 02:16:55.020
will not be returning back to Earth.

02:16:55.020 --> 02:16:56.980
It'll need to be modified

02:16:56.980 --> 02:16:59.540
because the ultimate is to have one Starship

02:16:59.540 --> 02:17:02.460
that goes to Mars, lands on Mars, then takes off of Mars,

02:17:02.460 --> 02:17:05.180
lands back on Earth and is reused again

02:17:05.180 --> 02:17:06.140
over and over and over.

02:17:06.140 --> 02:17:09.260
And there's a chance that you have just a cycler,

02:17:09.260 --> 02:17:12.460
just, you know, if you're, at the end of the day,

02:17:12.460 --> 02:17:14.340
you're just really trying to see what is most feasible,

02:17:14.340 --> 02:17:15.660
what's the most efficient.

02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:17.460
You literally have a vehicle dedicated to Mars.

02:17:17.460 --> 02:17:19.740
Mars is easy to do a single-stage orbit.

02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:22.460
It's a lot lower gravity, a lot thinner atmosphere.

02:17:22.460 --> 02:17:23.820
You can easily do a single-stage orbit.

02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:24.980
You'd get into orbit.

02:17:24.980 --> 02:17:27.380
You'd park to a dedicated, you know,

02:17:27.380 --> 02:17:29.380
transfer vehicle that goes between Earth and Mars.

02:17:29.380 --> 02:17:30.300
It only stays in space.

02:17:30.300 --> 02:17:31.140
You don't have heat shields.

02:17:31.140 --> 02:17:31.980
You don't have landing legs.

02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:34.060
You don't have all these things that you need.

02:17:34.060 --> 02:17:35.620
And ideally it's nuclear powered,

02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:37.460
so it's super efficient.

02:17:37.460 --> 02:17:38.620
That gets you back to Earth.

02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:40.500
Once you're at Earth, you rendezvous again

02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:42.460
with another landing Starship.

02:17:42.460 --> 02:17:45.860
And that Starship might be a horizontal runway Starship,

02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:48.660
you know, like there's no, I don't see the,

02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:50.700
and I think ultimately it'll win out

02:17:50.700 --> 02:17:52.380
where we don't have a one-size-fits-all.

02:17:52.380 --> 02:17:55.140
I think that's the flaw of the space shuttle really

02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:56.940
is that it was trying to do everything

02:17:56.940 --> 02:17:59.020
and ended up kind of doing nothing well.

02:17:59.020 --> 02:18:01.060
But that's, I think what SpaceX has proven,

02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:02.700
I mean, SpaceX already has variants coming.

02:18:02.700 --> 02:18:04.620
There's already going to be a dedicated lunar lander

02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:06.780
for NASA for the Artemis program.

02:18:06.780 --> 02:18:08.860
There's already going to be a tanker variant.

02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:10.580
There's already going to be likely

02:18:10.580 --> 02:18:11.860
just a pure cargo version.

02:18:11.860 --> 02:18:13.820
There's likely going to be a human version.

02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:16.660
We'll likely see evolutions of this thing happen,

02:18:16.700 --> 02:18:18.780
you know, relatively quickly.

02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:20.540
And once it's all working,

02:18:20.540 --> 02:18:23.940
it's only a matter of weeks before people riding on it

02:18:23.940 --> 02:18:26.620
will be complaining about the speed of the Wi-Fi.

02:18:26.620 --> 02:18:31.300
As the old like Lucy K joke with like,

02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:35.020
you're flying on a chair through the air.

02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:36.340
It's incredible.

02:18:36.340 --> 02:18:37.780
You didn't even know this existed

02:18:37.780 --> 02:18:39.980
and now you're complaining about it.

02:18:39.980 --> 02:18:41.500
It's great. Exactly.

02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:44.500
So you tweeted fun fact about Starship

02:18:44.540 --> 02:18:48.620
by doing the flip around 500 meters versus higher up,

02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:50.540
like 2000 meters.

02:18:50.540 --> 02:18:55.540
The difference in Delta V is 500 meters per second.

02:18:56.140 --> 02:18:58.100
That's a 20 ton fuel saving,

02:18:58.100 --> 02:19:01.460
which means basically 20 tons more you can put into orbit.

02:19:01.460 --> 02:19:04.900
That's more than Falcon 9 has ever launched

02:19:04.900 --> 02:19:07.140
just by flipping later.

02:19:07.140 --> 02:19:08.060
That's really interesting.

02:19:08.060 --> 02:19:11.140
So that was the decision too, to flip close to the ground.

02:19:11.140 --> 02:19:12.140
Yeah, yeah.

02:19:12.140 --> 02:19:13.220
The closer to the ground, the better.

02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:16.260
Again, the more the atmosphere is doing work

02:19:16.260 --> 02:19:19.180
and we get into that video really dives

02:19:19.180 --> 02:19:21.060
into like gravity losses and gravity drag.

02:19:21.060 --> 02:19:22.700
The more time you're spent,

02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:25.500
every second that your rocket engine is running,

02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:27.580
Earth is stealing 9.8 meters per second

02:19:27.580 --> 02:19:29.100
of acceleration against you.

02:19:29.100 --> 02:19:31.100
There's just inherently 9.8 meters per second

02:19:31.100 --> 02:19:32.740
squared of acceleration.

02:19:32.740 --> 02:19:35.300
So every second that engine is running,

02:19:35.300 --> 02:19:38.300
the first big majority of your thrust

02:19:38.300 --> 02:19:41.020
is actually being just stolen by Earth's gravity well.

02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:43.420
So the longer you're fighting that,

02:19:43.420 --> 02:19:44.820
the more inefficient it is.

02:19:44.820 --> 02:19:47.540
So I mean, the best thing would be you flip

02:19:47.540 --> 02:19:49.860
at 100 meters off the ground,

02:19:49.860 --> 02:19:51.780
you light all your engines to maximum thrust

02:19:51.780 --> 02:19:55.860
and you pull 50 Gs, you land on a dime basically.

02:19:55.860 --> 02:19:57.220
Obviously there's no margin there

02:19:57.220 --> 02:20:00.860
and there's diminishing returns on that gravity loss thing

02:20:00.860 --> 02:20:02.580
in your high thrust to weight ratios.

02:20:02.580 --> 02:20:04.580
So that's a pretty good compromise.

02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:05.420
Yes, it looks scary,

02:20:05.420 --> 02:20:07.380
but they could be a lot more aggressive with that yet

02:20:07.380 --> 02:20:09.860
and squeeze out even a little bit better performance,

02:20:09.860 --> 02:20:11.060
but there are diminishing returns.

02:20:11.060 --> 02:20:14.460
So that's kind of the magic number we've seen so far today,

02:20:14.460 --> 02:20:16.620
but we'll likely see that be played with.

02:20:17.540 --> 02:20:19.300
You've attended some of these,

02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:21.380
what does it feel like to see Starship in person?

02:20:21.380 --> 02:20:23.980
First of all, one is just sitting there stacked

02:20:23.980 --> 02:20:27.740
and second of all, one is doing some of these tests,

02:20:27.740 --> 02:20:29.540
some of these maneuvers.

02:20:29.540 --> 02:20:32.340
Well, first off, if you have the freedom of traveling

02:20:32.340 --> 02:20:35.380
and happen to live within a reasonable,

02:20:35.380 --> 02:20:37.460
either by plane or car,

02:20:37.460 --> 02:20:39.700
it's worth going down to South Texas.

02:20:40.540 --> 02:20:42.500
So Starbase is right on the border of Mexico

02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:45.180
and the United States and very southern tip of Texas,

02:20:45.180 --> 02:20:47.140
right along the Rio Grande

02:20:47.140 --> 02:20:51.820
and it's insane because it's right along a public highway.

02:20:51.820 --> 02:20:53.820
You can literally, anyone can drive down this,

02:20:53.820 --> 02:20:55.420
assuming it's not closed for testing

02:20:55.420 --> 02:20:57.820
because they do close the highways during the week,

02:20:57.820 --> 02:20:59.820
a decent amount while they're doing tests,

02:20:59.820 --> 02:21:02.660
but sans any of those days,

02:21:02.660 --> 02:21:04.780
anyone can just drive down and see these things

02:21:04.780 --> 02:21:06.140
up close and personal with their own eyes.

02:21:06.180 --> 02:21:10.820
Like we're talking from 100, 200 meters away,

02:21:10.820 --> 02:21:12.060
so two football fields away

02:21:12.060 --> 02:21:14.260
from the world's biggest, most powerful rocket.

02:21:14.260 --> 02:21:17.700
Imagine being able to do that during the Soviet Union

02:21:17.700 --> 02:21:21.220
and during the N1 and the Saturn V.

02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:22.580
Imagine just being able to drive up

02:21:22.580 --> 02:21:24.140
right next to the launch pad.

02:21:24.140 --> 02:21:25.340
There's no way.

02:21:27.580 --> 02:21:31.580
To have this kind of access to this program is so incredible.

02:21:31.580 --> 02:21:33.780
The craziest thing is when you're driving out

02:21:34.340 --> 02:21:39.100
on Highway 4, it's bumpy, it's riddled with potholes now

02:21:39.100 --> 02:21:41.220
because of all the insane amount of trucks

02:21:41.220 --> 02:21:42.580
having to go out there and traffic

02:21:42.580 --> 02:21:45.020
and you're going through this, it's just this weird,

02:21:45.020 --> 02:21:46.260
you're like, where am I?

02:21:46.260 --> 02:21:48.580
Occasionally you're seeing, like you can kind of see the,

02:21:48.580 --> 02:21:50.260
I mean, you can see Mexico at your right window

02:21:50.260 --> 02:21:51.620
as you're driving down this highway.

02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:53.260
You're just sitting there like, where am I?

02:21:53.260 --> 02:21:55.420
And then all of a sudden you kind of turn this corner

02:21:55.420 --> 02:21:57.140
and the trees and the brush kind of clear out

02:21:57.140 --> 02:21:58.140
and all of a sudden you get a sense

02:21:58.140 --> 02:21:59.780
of everything on the horizon.

02:21:59.780 --> 02:22:02.180
At that point, you're pretty much five miles on the nose

02:22:02.180 --> 02:22:03.740
or eight kilometers away.

02:22:04.700 --> 02:22:08.300
And from there, you can just see through the heat haze,

02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:11.100
through the atmospheric distortion

02:22:11.100 --> 02:22:12.700
and you just see this weird,

02:22:12.700 --> 02:22:15.700
like it looks like a city almost on the horizon.

02:22:15.700 --> 02:22:18.220
There's tons of these tall buildings.

02:22:18.220 --> 02:22:21.540
There's a weird ominous launch tower thing

02:22:21.540 --> 02:22:24.620
with arms wide open and sometimes,

02:22:24.620 --> 02:22:27.300
and a giant metal rocket.

02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:31.420
And it just looks so, so weird.

02:22:31.940 --> 02:22:34.620
It's, the word surreal, I think by definition,

02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:37.820
I think if you are expecting it, it's not surreal.

02:22:37.820 --> 02:22:40.340
I think surreal kind of means like unexpected surprise

02:22:40.340 --> 02:22:41.580
or whatever, you know?

02:22:41.580 --> 02:22:43.940
Even if you're expecting it, even if you've seen pictures,

02:22:43.940 --> 02:22:46.540
even if everything, it is surreal.

02:22:46.540 --> 02:22:47.380
Yeah.

02:22:47.380 --> 02:22:50.980
You stand there and you just go, what is this?

02:22:50.980 --> 02:22:55.980
And also, I mean, there's a kind of magical aspect

02:22:56.220 --> 02:22:59.540
to the, this is the place where over the next few years

02:22:59.540 --> 02:23:04.220
we'll start as a human species reaching out there

02:23:04.220 --> 02:23:05.740
and traveling out there.

02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:09.020
We'll for sure see the development of the rockets

02:23:09.020 --> 02:23:11.620
that I think will take us further than ever before

02:23:11.620 --> 02:23:13.260
be born right there.

02:23:13.260 --> 02:23:18.260
What's it like to witness the actual testing of Starship?

02:23:19.580 --> 02:23:24.580
So far, it's been high stakes, like it's been insane

02:23:24.820 --> 02:23:26.900
because the first site kind of mentioned earlier,

02:23:26.900 --> 02:23:29.140
there's been SN8, nine, 10, 11 and 15

02:23:29.140 --> 02:23:30.980
that have all done these suborbital hops.

02:23:30.980 --> 02:23:33.020
The highest one went 12.5 kilometers

02:23:33.020 --> 02:23:36.540
and the rest of the four went 10 kilometers in altitude

02:23:36.540 --> 02:23:38.980
and then turned off the engines and just fell.

02:23:38.980 --> 02:23:41.660
Now, the cool thing about that is the general public

02:23:41.660 --> 02:23:43.660
could be about five miles away.

02:23:43.660 --> 02:23:45.660
So again, like eight kilometers away.

02:23:45.660 --> 02:23:50.140
And the weird thing is this rocket's slowly accelerating.

02:23:50.140 --> 02:23:52.100
They didn't want to exceed a certain speed.

02:23:52.100 --> 02:23:53.820
So they didn't have to worry about the aerodynamics of it.

02:23:53.820 --> 02:23:55.180
They just slowly climbed.

02:23:55.180 --> 02:23:56.980
And it probably also appeased the FAA.

02:23:57.020 --> 02:23:58.620
They were like, here, we'll just limit

02:23:58.620 --> 02:24:01.340
the thrust to weight ratio and just make it

02:24:01.340 --> 02:24:03.740
so it's slow and controlled, no big deal.

02:24:03.740 --> 02:24:06.380
So it's basically more or less like slightly above a hover,

02:24:06.380 --> 02:24:10.340
just climbing for minutes, for like four or five minutes,

02:24:10.340 --> 02:24:12.820
you just hear and feel the roar of this thing.

02:24:12.820 --> 02:24:16.340
Normal rockets, like after the first 30 seconds or minute,

02:24:16.340 --> 02:24:19.820
you know, they're so far away that you're just diminishing.

02:24:19.820 --> 02:24:21.780
You know, it's just fading, fading, fading, fading.

02:24:21.780 --> 02:24:23.300
You still get that rumble, that sense,

02:24:23.300 --> 02:24:25.700
but those first five flights,

02:24:25.700 --> 02:24:29.140
the suborbital hops were just, I'll cherish them forever.

02:24:29.140 --> 02:24:31.460
Cause you just, you're watching this thing

02:24:31.460 --> 02:24:33.260
that you've driven up next to.

02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:34.860
You've seen it with your own eyes.

02:24:34.860 --> 02:24:38.020
That's bigger than most buildings in a, you know,

02:24:38.020 --> 02:24:40.020
fairly dense urban area.

02:24:40.020 --> 02:24:41.900
You know, it's this massive thing.

02:24:41.900 --> 02:24:43.620
You stand there, you stood there, you look at it.

02:24:43.620 --> 02:24:44.900
You're like, wow, that's crazy.

02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:45.900
You've seen people working on it,

02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:47.860
their little ants compared to it.

02:24:47.860 --> 02:24:49.740
Then you drive away and you see it on the horizon.

02:24:49.740 --> 02:24:51.300
And all of a sudden that thing leaves.

02:24:51.300 --> 02:24:52.420
It starts moving.

02:24:52.420 --> 02:24:53.260
Hovering.

02:24:53.260 --> 02:24:54.100
Hovering.

02:24:54.100 --> 02:24:54.940
Essentially.

02:24:54.940 --> 02:24:58.300
The first time, I mean, you know, you put,

02:24:58.300 --> 02:25:01.020
for me at least, I put my hands on my head when I,

02:25:01.020 --> 02:25:02.700
I just, I can't help it.

02:25:02.700 --> 02:25:04.100
I'm not, it's not, I don't know what it is.

02:25:04.100 --> 02:25:06.020
It's surreal, like you said.

02:25:06.020 --> 02:25:08.180
I don't know what in human nature decides

02:25:08.180 --> 02:25:10.220
this is what to do when you can't believe something,

02:25:10.220 --> 02:25:11.820
but that's what happens.

02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:13.300
And when that thing first took off,

02:25:13.300 --> 02:25:17.900
it was just like, my brain couldn't process seeing,

02:25:17.900 --> 02:25:20.620
you know, cause I had spent so much time driving around

02:25:20.620 --> 02:25:21.980
and seeing it and all of a sudden you're watching it

02:25:21.980 --> 02:25:24.580
just take off and you're like, it's moving.

02:25:24.740 --> 02:25:25.740
And all these, you know,

02:25:25.740 --> 02:25:27.580
the most complicated rocket engines ever made

02:25:27.580 --> 02:25:29.500
are all firing simultaneously.

02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:31.220
And it didn't blow up on the launch pad

02:25:31.220 --> 02:25:33.140
and it's slowly increasing.

02:25:33.140 --> 02:25:34.460
And it's just crazy.

02:25:34.460 --> 02:25:37.140
And the sound, the, everything about it.

02:25:37.140 --> 02:25:40.100
And so by the time the first one is specifically,

02:25:40.100 --> 02:25:45.100
it was December, 2020 was the first SN8.

02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:50.260
It went up and I actually, we all lost it in the sky.

02:25:50.260 --> 02:25:52.100
We couldn't quite see it, but our, our,

02:25:52.100 --> 02:25:54.220
we had telescopes and, you know,

02:25:54.220 --> 02:25:56.700
high telephoto lenses tracking it.

02:25:56.700 --> 02:25:59.020
And what's funny is there is a pretty strong wind

02:25:59.020 --> 02:26:01.020
up there at altitude.

02:26:01.020 --> 02:26:04.980
And it was moving, there's a lot of gaseous oxygen

02:26:04.980 --> 02:26:06.500
being vented out of the rocket.

02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:08.500
And it's, you know, being blown by this air.

02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:11.180
So it looks like it's moving actually quite quickly,

02:26:11.180 --> 02:26:14.980
like away from us, like it was strafing to one side.

02:26:14.980 --> 02:26:16.140
So I'm watching the monitor.

02:26:16.140 --> 02:26:18.700
I'm going, oh my God, they're moving it like

02:26:18.700 --> 02:26:21.620
over Brownsville and we're all, all of us,

02:26:21.700 --> 02:26:25.420
everyone on this, this hotel balcony is looking out down

02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:28.580
like way out over, you know, and we can't find it.

02:26:28.580 --> 02:26:30.340
And we're like, where do they lose it?

02:26:30.340 --> 02:26:32.060
Like we're thinking like, oh my God,

02:26:32.060 --> 02:26:34.660
this is going to crash down in Brownsville.

02:26:34.660 --> 02:26:37.380
And, and finally they shut the engines off

02:26:37.380 --> 02:26:38.220
and we're watching it fall.

02:26:38.220 --> 02:26:39.060
And again, we're tracking it.

02:26:39.060 --> 02:26:41.540
We know it's falling and it's falling, falling, falling.

02:26:41.540 --> 02:26:42.740
It's falling super controlled.

02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:44.980
And we're like, oh my God, this is perfect.

02:26:44.980 --> 02:26:47.580
And all of a sudden it clicked and I see it with my,

02:26:47.580 --> 02:26:49.180
you know, my eyes, I finally like tracked it.

02:26:49.700 --> 02:26:51.900
It's straight out, like straight in front of us.

02:26:51.900 --> 02:26:54.300
And it looks like, it looks like it was a blimp,

02:26:54.300 --> 02:26:57.660
just barely moving because it is falling slowly

02:26:57.660 --> 02:27:00.100
thanks to all of its drag.

02:27:00.100 --> 02:27:02.700
And again, that's one of those moments I'm like,

02:27:02.700 --> 02:27:05.780
it's falling so slow, you know, cause it's so big.

02:27:05.780 --> 02:27:06.620
It's so massive.

02:27:06.620 --> 02:27:08.100
It's falling sideways.

02:27:08.100 --> 02:27:09.980
You know, I've seen Falcon nine boosters

02:27:09.980 --> 02:27:11.700
and Falcon heavy boosters and they scream,

02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:15.180
they come in so fast and you can barely even see them.

02:27:15.180 --> 02:27:16.020
You can just barely track them.

02:27:16.020 --> 02:27:16.860
All of a sudden they light their engines

02:27:16.860 --> 02:27:18.660
and they decelerate so quickly.

02:27:18.660 --> 02:27:19.540
This was like the opposite.

02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:22.580
It was like, is that thing ever coming down?

02:27:22.580 --> 02:27:25.420
It was just falling so slowly and so right there.

02:27:25.420 --> 02:27:27.180
Just felt like it was so close.

02:27:27.180 --> 02:27:29.140
And so when it finally lit its engine and it flipped,

02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:30.980
I was losing my mind.

02:27:30.980 --> 02:27:33.700
Cause I'm like, it's working, you know, this crazy plan,

02:27:33.700 --> 02:27:38.100
this huge massive thing is doing this absurd feat.

02:27:38.100 --> 02:27:39.980
And the first one, well, the first four again,

02:27:39.980 --> 02:27:41.300
didn't work out as planned,

02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:43.100
but getting to that point already,

02:27:43.100 --> 02:27:45.540
getting to that flip maneuver was a huge milestone.

02:27:45.540 --> 02:27:48.260
And it was so exciting just going through those,

02:27:48.260 --> 02:27:49.740
those firsts were amazing.

02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:52.140
And I think, you know, we're coming up now on them

02:27:52.140 --> 02:27:55.940
doing the full stacks of the booster and the upper stage.

02:27:55.940 --> 02:27:57.340
I think when we see that fly,

02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:00.260
when that leaves earth for the first time,

02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:01.100
it'll be, like I said,

02:28:01.100 --> 02:28:02.580
almost twice the amount of thrust as anything else.

02:28:02.580 --> 02:28:05.940
It'll be the biggest, heaviest, largest thing to ever fly.

02:28:05.940 --> 02:28:08.980
It's going to shake everything.

02:28:08.980 --> 02:28:11.140
I can't wait.

02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:15.220
I have all 33 Raptor engines been active at once.

02:28:15.220 --> 02:28:16.500
Have they tested that?

02:28:16.500 --> 02:28:17.740
No, that's coming up.

02:28:17.780 --> 02:28:19.300
That's kind of the next milestone.

02:28:19.300 --> 02:28:20.620
I don't know, you know, when this will come out,

02:28:20.620 --> 02:28:22.740
but we're, that's like the next.

02:28:22.740 --> 02:28:24.820
Just a few days very quickly here.

02:28:24.820 --> 02:28:26.580
Then, but if people listening to this,

02:28:26.580 --> 02:28:27.900
if they're listening to it early on,

02:28:27.900 --> 02:28:29.740
they'll likely be able to catch, you know,

02:28:29.740 --> 02:28:31.540
I think at this point it seems like next week.

02:28:31.540 --> 02:28:33.500
So step one would be static fire.

02:28:33.500 --> 02:28:34.580
Yep.

02:28:34.580 --> 02:28:37.540
Holding onto the rocket and lighting up the engines.

02:28:37.540 --> 02:28:39.420
And so, so far they've lit at most,

02:28:39.420 --> 02:28:41.140
they kind of, they went for like a

02:28:41.140 --> 02:28:43.020
more than 14 engine static fire.

02:28:43.020 --> 02:28:44.620
I don't recall if it was like, you know,

02:28:44.620 --> 02:28:46.820
16 or something engines lit at once.

02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:50.140
And they ended up going down to 14 engines.

02:28:50.140 --> 02:28:52.500
That's the most engines they've ever lit.

02:28:53.420 --> 02:28:55.540
So the next step and the final kind of step

02:28:55.540 --> 02:28:56.780
before they fly this thing is they're actually

02:28:56.780 --> 02:28:59.900
going to light all 33 engines simultaneously.

02:28:59.900 --> 02:29:02.340
And although that sounds scary,

02:29:02.340 --> 02:29:03.820
let's not forget the Falcon Heavy

02:29:03.820 --> 02:29:06.860
that's now flown five times completely flawlessly

02:29:07.940 --> 02:29:10.940
has 27 engines running simultaneously.

02:29:10.940 --> 02:29:12.020
So they definitely have, you know,

02:29:12.020 --> 02:29:14.500
SpaceX has experience with a high number of engines

02:29:14.500 --> 02:29:16.340
running at the same time,

02:29:16.340 --> 02:29:18.060
but it is still like,

02:29:18.060 --> 02:29:20.580
this is going to be a lot of moving parts

02:29:20.580 --> 02:29:22.500
and a lot of potential and a lot,

02:29:22.500 --> 02:29:24.700
just a lot of everything.

02:29:24.700 --> 02:29:28.620
What are the upcoming milestones,

02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:30.420
expected milestones?

02:29:30.420 --> 02:29:32.580
And I think there's one in particular

02:29:32.580 --> 02:29:33.740
I'd like to talk to you more about,

02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:35.860
but leading up to that, of course,

02:29:35.860 --> 02:29:38.340
is like, what are some of the tests here on the way?

02:29:38.340 --> 02:29:40.260
So is this the static fire,

02:29:41.300 --> 02:29:44.180
the fully stack with the two stages?

02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:48.260
Will there be, and then all that leading

02:29:48.260 --> 02:29:52.300
to an orbital launch test?

02:29:52.300 --> 02:29:54.340
What, so what are the things that you know about?

02:29:54.340 --> 02:29:55.980
And what do you think, like,

02:29:55.980 --> 02:29:57.780
what do you think the timeline will be

02:29:57.780 --> 02:29:59.340
with like the orbital test?

02:29:59.340 --> 02:30:02.220
Timeline, the reason that we have this website,

02:30:02.220 --> 02:30:04.100
the expected milestones is because I always tell people

02:30:04.100 --> 02:30:07.340
to ignore any time you ever hear for any of this stuff,

02:30:07.340 --> 02:30:08.740
just pay attention to milestones

02:30:08.740 --> 02:30:11.380
because when you're doing stuff for the first time,

02:30:11.380 --> 02:30:13.100
you know, you just have no idea.

02:30:13.540 --> 02:30:16.340
So just to understand the expected milestones here,

02:30:16.340 --> 02:30:18.100
the first column is the event,

02:30:18.100 --> 02:30:22.380
the second column is the date and status TBD complete.

02:30:22.380 --> 02:30:23.900
Green means what?

02:30:23.900 --> 02:30:25.620
Green means it's been completed

02:30:25.620 --> 02:30:27.020
and it shows the completion date there.

02:30:27.020 --> 02:30:28.140
And the completion date.

02:30:28.140 --> 02:30:28.980
Yeah.

02:30:28.980 --> 02:30:31.740
And then the other is maybe more,

02:30:31.740 --> 02:30:34.340
maybe not for the full stack testing,

02:30:34.340 --> 02:30:37.380
the destack and there's a 33 engine.

02:30:37.380 --> 02:30:39.980
So realistically, we're expecting them to destack

02:30:39.980 --> 02:30:41.740
and SpaceX, I think, just tweeted that actually

02:30:41.740 --> 02:30:44.100
that they're going to be destacking.

02:30:44.100 --> 02:30:45.940
The second stage from the first stage,

02:30:45.940 --> 02:30:48.460
kind of get the ship safe while they test

02:30:48.460 --> 02:30:49.700
because they don't want to, you know,

02:30:49.700 --> 02:30:51.380
33 engines is pretty high risk

02:30:51.380 --> 02:30:54.100
if they do blow up the rocket.

02:30:54.100 --> 02:30:55.020
When they test it for the first time,

02:30:55.020 --> 02:30:56.700
it's not going to be fully fueled.

02:30:56.700 --> 02:30:58.660
I don't think at least, but there is a limit

02:30:58.660 --> 02:31:01.140
to how they do have to have it weighed down enough

02:31:01.140 --> 02:31:03.220
that the launch clamps can hold onto it.

02:31:03.220 --> 02:31:04.620
Because if you think about it, like,

02:31:04.620 --> 02:31:06.300
normally the launch clamps are holding

02:31:06.300 --> 02:31:11.300
onto an entire rocket weighing 5 million kilograms,

02:31:11.380 --> 02:31:14.260
5 million, you know, it's weighing an insane amount.

02:31:14.260 --> 02:31:16.420
So those clamps don't actually have to hold

02:31:16.420 --> 02:31:18.180
75 mega Newtons of thrust.

02:31:18.180 --> 02:31:21.460
They really only have to hold down 25 mega Newtons of thrust.

02:31:21.460 --> 02:31:22.300
You know what I mean?

02:31:22.300 --> 02:31:24.980
They're not designed to hold down all 75.

02:31:24.980 --> 02:31:27.460
They do have to have enough weight on the rocket.

02:31:27.460 --> 02:31:30.140
So even when they do the testing of the 33 engines,

02:31:30.140 --> 02:31:31.340
it'll have to have enough propellant in there

02:31:31.340 --> 02:31:32.780
that they don't exceed the clamping

02:31:32.780 --> 02:31:34.300
and the holding force of the stand.

02:31:34.300 --> 02:31:36.860
Otherwise it'll break free from the launch stand

02:31:36.860 --> 02:31:39.260
and that booster will go flying off uncontrolled.

02:31:39.300 --> 02:31:41.740
So it's a difficult thing to figure out in the test

02:31:41.740 --> 02:31:45.540
how many simultaneous things you test, right?

02:31:45.540 --> 02:31:47.100
So they're kind of mitigating risks,

02:31:47.100 --> 02:31:48.660
which is why like they're destacking.

02:31:48.660 --> 02:31:49.540
You know, they don't want to have,

02:31:49.540 --> 02:31:50.940
although the ship could be on top of it

02:31:50.940 --> 02:31:53.420
to help weigh it down and simulate the, you know,

02:31:53.420 --> 02:31:55.220
the launch environment better.

02:31:55.220 --> 02:31:57.340
At some point that's a risk they're just going to take

02:31:57.340 --> 02:31:58.700
when they go for launch.

02:31:58.700 --> 02:32:00.340
And so for now they're taking the ship off

02:32:00.340 --> 02:32:03.220
in case something goes wrong during the 33 engine test.

02:32:03.220 --> 02:32:05.820
And then once we see if the 33 engine test goes well,

02:32:05.820 --> 02:32:09.220
hopefully we see the second stage get stacked back on it.

02:32:10.180 --> 02:32:11.020
We'll see them get closer,

02:32:11.020 --> 02:32:12.420
like closing out all the items and hope.

02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:15.020
The big one too is the FAA launch license.

02:32:15.020 --> 02:32:16.940
That'll be publicly filed.

02:32:16.940 --> 02:32:19.580
We'll see that, you know, in the system

02:32:19.580 --> 02:32:20.500
having a launch license.

02:32:20.500 --> 02:32:23.060
And I have no sense of that type of thing.

02:32:23.060 --> 02:32:26.020
You know, that's outside of, but that is a big milestone.

02:32:26.020 --> 02:32:28.900
And it might be something that could potentially hinder,

02:32:28.900 --> 02:32:30.100
you know, hold up the launch date

02:32:30.100 --> 02:32:32.340
or just be waiting for a launch license.

02:32:32.340 --> 02:32:35.100
Yeah, I'm sure there's a lot of fascinating bureaucracy

02:32:35.100 --> 02:32:38.740
and politics and legal stuff

02:32:38.740 --> 02:32:40.820
and all that kind of beautiful magical thing

02:32:40.820 --> 02:32:42.460
when you live in reality.

02:32:42.460 --> 02:32:46.980
Because it is, I mean, it is a big rocket.

02:32:46.980 --> 02:32:50.380
Yeah, well, and the biggest thing is not so much,

02:32:50.380 --> 02:32:52.020
the FAA doesn't necessarily care

02:32:52.020 --> 02:32:53.660
about the success of the rocket.

02:32:53.660 --> 02:32:55.460
They did really just care about the safety

02:32:55.460 --> 02:32:58.340
of public and public property, you know.

02:32:58.340 --> 02:33:00.980
So it's a matter of being convinced

02:33:00.980 --> 02:33:03.700
and having the data to prove, okay,

02:33:03.700 --> 02:33:06.380
if this thing blows up, we have a control

02:33:06.380 --> 02:33:07.700
of how and when it blows up.

02:33:07.700 --> 02:33:10.100
We have control of, you know, X, Y, and Z.

02:33:10.100 --> 02:33:11.300
Here's the potential damage.

02:33:11.300 --> 02:33:12.820
Here's the blast radius.

02:33:12.820 --> 02:33:16.500
You know, this again is over twice as powerful

02:33:16.500 --> 02:33:18.260
and twice as much potential.

02:33:18.260 --> 02:33:20.220
Actually, it's a lot more potential

02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:22.940
for an explosive energy if it, you know,

02:33:22.940 --> 02:33:24.220
where it happened to.

02:33:24.220 --> 02:33:26.020
Well, let me walk back a little bit

02:33:26.020 --> 02:33:27.700
because in order to have a real detonation,

02:33:27.700 --> 02:33:29.060
you have to have a perfect mixture ratio

02:33:29.060 --> 02:33:30.540
of your fuel and oxidizer.

02:33:31.700 --> 02:33:33.260
When a rocket blows up, typically, you know,

02:33:33.780 --> 02:33:35.340
it kind of unzips and some of the fuel

02:33:35.340 --> 02:33:36.700
will mix into some of the oxidizer

02:33:36.700 --> 02:33:39.060
and you could have some explosive energy,

02:33:39.060 --> 02:33:41.300
but a lot of it's actually just a deflagration.

02:33:41.300 --> 02:33:42.780
It's just, you know, flames.

02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:46.060
And there will, there would be explosive energy,

02:33:46.060 --> 02:33:48.500
but it's not like you're lighting all of it simultaneously

02:33:48.500 --> 02:33:50.300
as this giant bomb.

02:33:50.300 --> 02:33:51.140
It's just really not.

02:33:51.140 --> 02:33:53.540
So that's good, but at the same time,

02:33:53.540 --> 02:33:55.580
even in those circumstances,

02:33:55.580 --> 02:33:57.540
the amount of energy is still absurd,

02:33:57.540 --> 02:33:59.460
enough to likely blow out windows, you know,

02:33:59.460 --> 02:34:01.980
for miles and miles and miles,

02:34:01.980 --> 02:34:03.380
including my studio space.

02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:08.380
Well, if the cameras hold up,

02:34:09.420 --> 02:34:11.300
it would be one heck of a show.

02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:13.740
Hopefully, of course, would not happen.

02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:15.780
So how does that take us to an orbital launch?

02:34:15.780 --> 02:34:17.700
When do you think that would happen?

02:34:17.700 --> 02:34:20.660
In my opinion, this is a very fluid

02:34:20.660 --> 02:34:22.460
and this will change literally by the hour.

02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:24.300
So you really think that it's very difficult

02:34:24.300 --> 02:34:26.580
to really say like, even for something

02:34:26.580 --> 02:34:28.700
that could very well happen this year,

02:34:28.700 --> 02:34:30.340
even just a few months away,

02:34:31.220 --> 02:34:33.700
you should be making a prediction.

02:34:33.700 --> 02:34:35.220
By the way, are you like superstitious

02:34:35.220 --> 02:34:36.580
on this kind of stuff a little bit?

02:34:36.580 --> 02:34:38.300
Like you don't, you're worried about jinxing it

02:34:38.300 --> 02:34:39.140
and that kind of stuff?

02:34:39.140 --> 02:34:40.700
No, not at all, no.

02:34:40.700 --> 02:34:43.140
I would imagine you would be like waiting

02:34:43.140 --> 02:34:45.980
for all of these launches that keep getting delayed

02:34:45.980 --> 02:34:48.180
where you start thinking that there's certain things

02:34:48.180 --> 02:34:49.540
you do will control the weather.

02:34:49.540 --> 02:34:52.700
My socks, I am wearing these socks just scrubbed again,

02:34:52.700 --> 02:34:53.660
you know, like, yeah.

02:34:53.660 --> 02:34:55.820
You're lucky, you have to wear the same lucky socks,

02:34:55.820 --> 02:34:59.180
otherwise it's going to, there's going to be bad weather.

02:34:59.180 --> 02:35:01.220
So the reason that I say this and why it's so difficult

02:35:01.220 --> 02:35:05.940
is they did a first full stack test in July of 2021

02:35:05.940 --> 02:35:08.220
and the expectation was we're a month or two away

02:35:08.220 --> 02:35:09.060
from a launch.

02:35:09.060 --> 02:35:09.900
Yeah.

02:35:09.900 --> 02:35:11.860
So like realistically for 18 months

02:35:11.860 --> 02:35:13.340
have been in a purgatory thinking

02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:15.860
that we're a month or two away of an orbital launch.

02:35:15.860 --> 02:35:19.140
Now I did say for the record, when that thing stacked

02:35:19.140 --> 02:35:21.780
and when a lot of speculation was saying, you know,

02:35:21.780 --> 02:35:22.620
a month or two, I was saying,

02:35:22.620 --> 02:35:24.820
I don't expect it to fly in 2021.

02:35:24.820 --> 02:35:27.060
You know, and I've been just saying,

02:35:27.060 --> 02:35:28.260
I just saw the amount of work

02:35:28.260 --> 02:35:30.220
that still needed to be done like on the ground systems,

02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:32.420
the tanks, the launch mount, all the stuff.

02:35:32.420 --> 02:35:34.100
I'm sitting there like, there's still a lot of stuff.

02:35:34.100 --> 02:35:34.980
They're going to have to validate it.

02:35:34.980 --> 02:35:37.380
They're going to have to test everything, every component.

02:35:37.380 --> 02:35:39.660
And, you know, people were like, how dare you say that?

02:35:39.660 --> 02:35:42.180
Even Gwen Shotwell, the president of SpaceX

02:35:42.180 --> 02:35:43.460
is saying Q3 of 2021.

02:35:43.460 --> 02:35:46.380
I'm like, okay, but like, I'm just,

02:35:46.380 --> 02:35:49.100
I'm not going to be surprised if it slips into 2022.

02:35:49.100 --> 02:35:51.220
And here we are at the beginning of 2023.

02:35:51.220 --> 02:35:55.100
And I think we're finally within like two months.

02:35:55.100 --> 02:35:57.660
I'm expecting, like I'm trying to keep my March

02:35:57.700 --> 02:35:59.020
and April as free as I can.

02:35:59.980 --> 02:36:01.860
We'll put it that way.

02:36:01.860 --> 02:36:03.420
I love it.

02:36:03.420 --> 02:36:06.220
Actually, just in a small tangent on Gwen Shotwell,

02:36:06.220 --> 02:36:10.580
like, what do you, from everything I know,

02:36:10.580 --> 02:36:12.980
she's an instrumental, a really crucial person

02:36:12.980 --> 02:36:15.820
to the success of SpaceX in running the show.

02:36:15.820 --> 02:36:18.020
She's the president, the COO.

02:36:19.300 --> 02:36:23.860
What do you know about her, that sort of,

02:36:23.860 --> 02:36:26.300
the genius of Gwen Shotwell?

02:36:26.300 --> 02:36:29.060
Man, my understanding is she's really the glue.

02:36:29.060 --> 02:36:31.060
You know, she's the glue to the tornado.

02:36:32.100 --> 02:36:34.780
Tornado comes in, and then she comes around

02:36:34.780 --> 02:36:38.820
and just really executes on, and helps.

02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:42.140
You know, a famous story is that at some point,

02:36:42.140 --> 02:36:45.180
Elon walked in, or she sprinted into a meeting

02:36:45.180 --> 02:36:48.420
because Elon was actively trying to cancel Falcon Heavy,

02:36:48.420 --> 02:36:50.980
saying it's too far, like it's too much development,

02:36:50.980 --> 02:36:51.820
it's still too far away.

02:36:51.820 --> 02:36:54.100
And this is like, you know, this might've been like

02:36:54.100 --> 02:36:55.340
end of 2017 or something.

02:36:55.380 --> 02:36:56.860
And it flew for the first time in 2018.

02:36:56.860 --> 02:37:00.100
So we're talking like, it's close to the end of development.

02:37:00.100 --> 02:37:02.020
You know, there's hardware being built, all this stuff,

02:37:02.020 --> 02:37:04.340
and Elon's literally in a meeting telling people

02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:06.860
they're gonna cancel it, and we're gonna move on to BFR,

02:37:06.860 --> 02:37:10.140
or now Starship, and just go full steam ahead on that.

02:37:10.140 --> 02:37:12.420
And she runs into the meeting and reminds Elon,

02:37:12.420 --> 02:37:14.900
we have X amount of customers

02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:17.340
that have already purchased a ride on Falcon Heavy.

02:37:17.340 --> 02:37:18.900
We can't delay that.

02:37:18.900 --> 02:37:22.140
You know, so it's that business sense of like,

02:37:22.140 --> 02:37:24.900
yes, it's great to innovate, but we also have to pay our dues

02:37:25.620 --> 02:37:28.100
and make the money to continue our operations.

02:37:28.100 --> 02:37:30.580
And I think she's just a lot better at,

02:37:30.580 --> 02:37:33.420
she has, I think she has such a great perspective

02:37:33.420 --> 02:37:34.260
on everything.

02:37:34.260 --> 02:37:36.700
It really seems like everything, she doesn't,

02:37:36.700 --> 02:37:37.780
I wish she did more interviews

02:37:37.780 --> 02:37:40.140
because I would love to hear more from her.

02:37:40.140 --> 02:37:41.620
But man, like it just seems-

02:37:41.620 --> 02:37:43.460
Hear that, Gwen?

02:37:43.460 --> 02:37:44.460
For both of us.

02:37:44.460 --> 02:37:47.060
Yeah, she hasn't actually done that many interviews, right?

02:37:47.060 --> 02:37:47.900
Not really, no.

02:37:47.900 --> 02:37:49.380
She's done like a Ted Talk,

02:37:49.380 --> 02:37:51.020
a couple of little things here and there,

02:37:51.020 --> 02:37:53.580
but not really many interviews.

02:37:53.580 --> 02:37:55.620
And I would just love to hear like what,

02:37:55.620 --> 02:37:57.340
you know, what on a daily basis,

02:37:57.340 --> 02:38:00.620
like what is she doing to keep her head on

02:38:00.620 --> 02:38:02.500
and keep everything so organized?

02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:05.180
You know, it's, you know, yeah.

02:38:06.140 --> 02:38:08.660
My understanding is that she is absolutely integral

02:38:08.660 --> 02:38:11.700
and does just an insane amount of work at SpaceX.

02:38:11.700 --> 02:38:14.420
Yeah, I mean, so it's the project planning,

02:38:14.420 --> 02:38:17.420
but also how the teams integrate together

02:38:17.420 --> 02:38:20.620
and the hiring, and this is the management of the whole thing.

02:38:20.620 --> 02:38:22.020
I think it's a lot of it, honestly,

02:38:22.020 --> 02:38:25.100
even just the business, making sure the money's flowing

02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:26.980
in a positive trend, more or less, you know,

02:38:26.980 --> 02:38:28.980
that yes, Elon's obviously a money guy,

02:38:28.980 --> 02:38:32.500
but he thinks he's so, I think Elon is so risky.

02:38:32.500 --> 02:38:34.780
You know, he just loves to throw it all in

02:38:34.780 --> 02:38:37.140
that he leaves little margin for error.

02:38:37.140 --> 02:38:40.180
You know, he's been really lucky with rolling his dice,

02:38:40.180 --> 02:38:43.380
you know, especially like when he started SpaceX and Tesla,

02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:44.700
that was the ultimate roll of the dice.

02:38:44.700 --> 02:38:48.260
But I think she's a healthy balance to be like,

02:38:48.260 --> 02:38:50.980
well, here's our, you know, operations

02:38:51.140 --> 02:38:53.180
and now we can continue to do this

02:38:53.180 --> 02:38:54.580
without risking everything, you know.

02:38:54.580 --> 02:38:56.980
And Starship's close, let me be clear.

02:38:56.980 --> 02:38:59.580
Starship is close to risking everything already.

02:38:59.580 --> 02:39:02.140
It's just such a big, fast-moving,

02:39:02.140 --> 02:39:04.260
high-risk developmental program that like,

02:39:05.220 --> 02:39:07.820
I personally think, you know, SpaceX would probably be fine

02:39:07.820 --> 02:39:09.540
if they shut the doors on Starship

02:39:09.540 --> 02:39:11.180
and just flew Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy

02:39:11.180 --> 02:39:12.220
for the next 10 years,

02:39:12.220 --> 02:39:13.620
they would still be commercially valid.

02:39:13.620 --> 02:39:15.380
They could not spend another dollar

02:39:15.380 --> 02:39:16.220
on research and development.

02:39:16.220 --> 02:39:18.060
They could fire, I don't want them to,

02:39:18.060 --> 02:39:19.860
fire everyone involved in anything,

02:39:19.860 --> 02:39:21.540
research and development and just ran operations

02:39:21.540 --> 02:39:22.980
on Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy

02:39:22.980 --> 02:39:25.060
and they would still be dominant for 10 years

02:39:25.060 --> 02:39:26.380
and they would still have a business case

02:39:26.380 --> 02:39:27.980
and they'd still be fine.

02:39:27.980 --> 02:39:32.060
But they're all in, like all chips are pretty much,

02:39:32.060 --> 02:39:35.140
as many chips as possible are in for Starship.

02:39:35.140 --> 02:39:40.140
I mean, this, I don't know what else I could say

02:39:40.220 --> 02:39:44.900
is there's not, I've talked to a lot of great leaders.

02:39:44.900 --> 02:39:46.740
There's just not many people like Elon

02:39:46.740 --> 02:39:48.220
that would push for Starship.

02:39:49.220 --> 02:39:51.420
When they're already as far ahead.

02:39:51.420 --> 02:39:52.900
Very successful company.

02:39:52.900 --> 02:39:54.020
Yeah.

02:39:54.020 --> 02:39:55.940
Sort of everyone doubted

02:39:55.940 --> 02:39:57.460
that it could be a successful company.

02:39:57.460 --> 02:40:00.100
It was so close to bankruptcy and failing

02:40:00.100 --> 02:40:03.060
and then to take it into a financially viable,

02:40:03.060 --> 02:40:06.940
successful company and just when you do,

02:40:06.940 --> 02:40:10.020
you take on a project that again risks everything.

02:40:11.060 --> 02:40:13.500
When he already did this with Falcon 1 to Falcon 9,

02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:16.420
like literally people were like, what are you doing?

02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:17.860
They basically signed over

02:40:17.860 --> 02:40:20.460
and were fully ramping up Falcon 9

02:40:20.460 --> 02:40:23.380
by the time they finally had their first Falcon 1 success.

02:40:23.380 --> 02:40:24.380
They had one more flight.

02:40:24.380 --> 02:40:26.620
They only flew Falcon 1 successfully twice.

02:40:26.620 --> 02:40:27.740
They flew it five times altogether.

02:40:27.740 --> 02:40:30.020
The fourth one was successful and they flew one more time.

02:40:30.020 --> 02:40:33.020
And anyone else out there would have been like,

02:40:33.020 --> 02:40:34.940
let's keep flying the Falcon 1.

02:40:34.940 --> 02:40:36.740
We have a working rocket.

02:40:36.740 --> 02:40:39.660
We can start making money and profiting.

02:40:39.660 --> 02:40:42.140
And already he was risking it all and saying,

02:40:42.140 --> 02:40:44.260
nope, we're going from Falcon 1 to Falcon 9

02:40:44.260 --> 02:40:47.020
was a huge, huge leap.

02:40:48.540 --> 02:40:51.220
I think it's at least as big as a leap from Falcon 1 to 9

02:40:51.220 --> 02:40:52.740
as it is from Falcon 9 to Starship

02:40:52.740 --> 02:40:55.500
or around relatively a similar leap.

02:40:55.500 --> 02:40:56.780
So it's just that same thing again.

02:40:56.780 --> 02:40:59.540
People are going, why are you leaping into this

02:40:59.540 --> 02:41:03.180
insane program and system and risk

02:41:03.180 --> 02:41:06.620
when you finally have this workhorse of a rocket

02:41:06.620 --> 02:41:09.220
that's so dominant in the industry?

02:41:09.220 --> 02:41:12.700
Yet they're going 10X, you know?

02:41:12.700 --> 02:41:15.780
It so happens that you've been selected

02:41:15.780 --> 02:41:19.220
for the Dear Moon mission that will fly Starship

02:41:19.220 --> 02:41:22.300
once around the moon with nine people on board.

02:41:23.260 --> 02:41:25.380
You are one of those people.

02:41:25.380 --> 02:41:29.580
So just pause to take that in.

02:41:31.900 --> 02:41:34.180
Everything that we've been talking about,

02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:35.980
you will not just be reporting on.

02:41:35.980 --> 02:41:37.500
You will be a part of it.

02:41:38.860 --> 02:41:41.420
So tell me about the objective of this mission

02:41:41.420 --> 02:41:43.740
and how does it feel to be a part of it?

02:41:45.500 --> 02:41:46.340
Well.

02:41:49.700 --> 02:41:50.540
Man.

02:41:53.900 --> 02:41:58.340
Basically, it's the Willy Wonka of space.

02:41:58.340 --> 02:42:03.340
Like a generous individual purchased a ride from SpaceX

02:42:05.100 --> 02:42:07.820
as early, at least as far as I know,

02:42:07.820 --> 02:42:11.100
the earliest I knew about it was February 27th, 2017.

02:42:11.780 --> 02:42:12.620
Who's the individual?

02:42:12.620 --> 02:42:14.660
Yusaku Maezawa, but at the time, I'm telling you a story,

02:42:14.660 --> 02:42:16.340
at the time we didn't know.

02:42:16.340 --> 02:42:17.860
Okay, great, great.

02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:20.500
So February 27th, 2017, a press release comes out

02:42:20.500 --> 02:42:24.300
from SpaceX saying someone purchased a ride

02:42:24.300 --> 02:42:26.700
through us around the moon.

02:42:26.700 --> 02:42:27.820
We're gonna fly someone around the moon

02:42:27.820 --> 02:42:29.420
and at the time it was on a Crew Dragon capsule

02:42:29.420 --> 02:42:30.900
and a Falcon Heavy.

02:42:30.900 --> 02:42:32.820
It's like, wow, and that was enough.

02:42:32.820 --> 02:42:34.940
That little moment right there, that press release.

02:42:34.940 --> 02:42:36.140
It's the first time I'm like,

02:42:36.140 --> 02:42:37.980
I'm gonna make a YouTube video about this.

02:42:37.980 --> 02:42:40.820
I stood up, turned on my camera, put on my,

02:42:41.500 --> 02:42:42.740
at the time, space suit,

02:42:42.740 --> 02:42:45.540
and I basically yelled at the camera for three minutes

02:42:45.540 --> 02:42:48.460
about someone's going around the moon, you know?

02:42:48.460 --> 02:42:52.100
Fast forward to 2018, end of 2018 and near the end.

02:42:52.100 --> 02:42:54.980
They introduced, there's a SpaceX press conference.

02:42:54.980 --> 02:42:57.780
I'm there as a member of the press.

02:42:57.780 --> 02:43:00.340
I'm reporting on, we're going to meet this person

02:43:00.340 --> 02:43:02.660
that's going around the moon and come to find out,

02:43:02.660 --> 02:43:04.860
boom, they're going to be riding on Starship now.

02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:06.700
They changed from Falcon Heavy and Dragon.

02:43:06.700 --> 02:43:08.100
SpaceX is no longer going to do that.

02:43:08.100 --> 02:43:10.500
They're going to upgrade them basically to Starship.

02:43:11.180 --> 02:43:12.740
Instead of being in a small tin can,

02:43:12.740 --> 02:43:16.060
they're in this giant, luxurious mega rocket

02:43:16.060 --> 02:43:17.540
around the moon.

02:43:17.540 --> 02:43:20.260
And it comes out that this individual named Yusaku Maezawa,

02:43:20.260 --> 02:43:24.620
who is a Japanese billionaire, purchased this ride.

02:43:24.620 --> 02:43:28.340
And instead of inviting his friends and colleagues

02:43:28.340 --> 02:43:31.260
and whatever, whoever, his family members or whatever,

02:43:31.260 --> 02:43:34.020
he decided the most impactful thing he could do

02:43:34.020 --> 02:43:38.620
with this opportunity is invite more or less artists.

02:43:38.660 --> 02:43:41.140
In the original thing, it was like artists, journalists,

02:43:41.140 --> 02:43:46.140
a painter, an athlete, a photographer, videographer,

02:43:47.420 --> 02:43:48.620
all walks of life basically.

02:43:48.620 --> 02:43:50.940
When they said athlete, they thought of you.

02:43:50.940 --> 02:43:52.420
They're like, I know a guy.

02:43:53.460 --> 02:43:55.100
This guy rode rag by once.

02:43:58.980 --> 02:44:02.060
And at the time, he was like, this is crazy.

02:44:02.060 --> 02:44:03.260
I can't believe this is going to happen.

02:44:03.260 --> 02:44:05.620
And he had this vision of we're going to find people

02:44:05.620 --> 02:44:06.460
from all around the world.

02:44:06.460 --> 02:44:08.860
I'm going to invite people from all around the world

02:44:08.860 --> 02:44:12.260
from different walks of life, different trades.

02:44:12.260 --> 02:44:14.100
And I'm going to share this experience

02:44:14.100 --> 02:44:15.620
so that they can share it with the world

02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:18.220
and really have an impact much greater than

02:44:18.220 --> 02:44:20.340
any one country or any one individual

02:44:20.340 --> 02:44:25.340
or any set of military trained astronauts could do.

02:44:25.380 --> 02:44:27.460
I'll offer up a new perspective.

02:44:27.460 --> 02:44:28.300
Beautiful.

02:44:28.300 --> 02:44:30.460
I literally, I mean, at the press conference, I cried.

02:44:30.460 --> 02:44:31.660
I had a couple of tears in my eyes.

02:44:31.660 --> 02:44:32.860
I was like, this is so cool.

02:44:32.860 --> 02:44:33.980
If we could just pause on that.

02:44:33.980 --> 02:44:35.580
So he goes by MZ?

02:44:35.580 --> 02:44:36.420
MZ, yep.

02:44:37.820 --> 02:44:39.140
How incredible is that?

02:44:41.140 --> 02:44:45.500
I think it's, you often don't realize

02:44:45.500 --> 02:44:48.220
the importance of individuals in human history.

02:44:48.220 --> 02:44:51.300
Like they define, because this could be,

02:44:51.300 --> 02:44:54.180
we talked about the importance of Elon in particular.

02:44:54.180 --> 02:44:57.180
Most of the work is done by large groups of people

02:44:57.180 --> 02:44:59.820
that are collective intelligence that we band together.

02:44:59.820 --> 02:45:04.460
But like these individuals can be the spark

02:45:04.500 --> 02:45:07.420
of the catalyst of that progress.

02:45:07.420 --> 02:45:11.220
And I mean, just this idea of getting,

02:45:11.220 --> 02:45:14.020
not just civilians, which is already incredible,

02:45:14.020 --> 02:45:16.860
but civilians with a sort of an artistic flame

02:45:16.860 --> 02:45:17.860
that burns inside them.

02:45:17.860 --> 02:45:20.580
They're able to communicate whatever they do,

02:45:20.580 --> 02:45:23.380
are able to communicate something about that experience.

02:45:23.380 --> 02:45:27.100
It's just a genius idea to spend quite probably

02:45:27.100 --> 02:45:30.420
a very large amount of money for that.

02:45:30.420 --> 02:45:35.340
I mean, and that will be part of history.

02:45:35.340 --> 02:45:39.380
Yeah, and it's easy these days for people to be cynical,

02:45:39.380 --> 02:45:43.660
especially about like space flight and wealthy individuals.

02:45:43.660 --> 02:45:47.460
But really, in my opinion, and maybe just the time

02:45:47.460 --> 02:45:50.340
I was just so couldn't believe this idea,

02:45:51.820 --> 02:45:55.060
I'm someone that has studied a lot about the Apollo program

02:45:55.060 --> 02:45:56.180
and the people that have been to the moon

02:45:56.180 --> 02:45:58.020
and they're incredible individuals,

02:45:58.020 --> 02:46:00.140
incredible individuals, but they're so saturated

02:46:00.860 --> 02:46:04.620
with the tasks and they're military trained and often,

02:46:04.620 --> 02:46:06.620
that they didn't really have the luxury

02:46:06.620 --> 02:46:09.100
of just being able to soak in the experience

02:46:09.100 --> 02:46:12.660
of going around or to the moon

02:46:12.660 --> 02:46:15.420
and seeing the moon up close with your own eyes.

02:46:15.420 --> 02:46:19.140
That just psychologically has to be insane.

02:46:19.140 --> 02:46:23.020
And so to have this opportunity to be able to observe

02:46:23.020 --> 02:46:25.980
our closest celestial neighbor with your own eyes

02:46:25.980 --> 02:46:28.700
and your sole purpose is to soak it in and share it

02:46:28.740 --> 02:46:32.340
and communicate and create with the rest of our planet,

02:46:32.340 --> 02:46:34.860
like that to me is just beautiful.

02:46:37.420 --> 02:46:39.660
So that is the objective of the mission.

02:46:39.660 --> 02:46:41.700
That right there is the objective of the mission.

02:46:41.700 --> 02:46:45.660
And how does it feel to be selected

02:46:45.660 --> 02:46:48.060
as one of the nine to do it?

02:46:48.060 --> 02:46:53.060
It's a gradient, it's slowly, it's doing a few things.

02:46:53.580 --> 02:46:55.380
Since I've known it's become,

02:46:56.220 --> 02:46:58.060
I think the closer it gets,

02:46:58.060 --> 02:47:00.260
the more excited and the more nervous I get.

02:47:01.380 --> 02:47:02.220
It's a-

02:47:02.220 --> 02:47:03.060
And the more real it becomes.

02:47:03.060 --> 02:47:04.140
The more real it becomes.

02:47:04.140 --> 02:47:05.740
The announcement was a big,

02:47:05.740 --> 02:47:08.900
it just got announced at the end of 2022 publicly,

02:47:08.900 --> 02:47:09.740
who's involved.

02:47:09.740 --> 02:47:11.820
And so prior to that,

02:47:11.820 --> 02:47:14.740
I had each step of the selection process,

02:47:14.740 --> 02:47:17.420
there's a pretty comprehensive selection process

02:47:17.420 --> 02:47:18.260
with interviews and stuff.

02:47:18.260 --> 02:47:21.020
Each step I'd try not to get my hopes up.

02:47:21.020 --> 02:47:22.780
And frankly, let me be clear,

02:47:22.780 --> 02:47:25.660
this was not something that I've always wanted to do.

02:47:25.660 --> 02:47:26.820
It's not like I'm out there,

02:47:26.820 --> 02:47:28.300
I didn't start doing YouTube videos

02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:31.260
because I wanted to even go to space, none of that.

02:47:31.260 --> 02:47:32.540
And I've said, hilariously,

02:47:32.540 --> 02:47:35.740
I've probably said dozens or hundreds of times on air,

02:47:35.740 --> 02:47:37.100
yeah, I don't ever want to go to space.

02:47:37.100 --> 02:47:39.020
Because it's not like my, it's not a driving force.

02:47:39.020 --> 02:47:41.300
It's not really a thing I even really truly pictured

02:47:41.300 --> 02:47:44.020
or let myself fantasize about, frankly.

02:47:44.020 --> 02:47:46.180
So each step of the selection process,

02:47:46.180 --> 02:47:49.380
I didn't really let myself dream about it too much,

02:47:49.380 --> 02:47:51.860
or, but I'd kind of chip away,

02:47:51.860 --> 02:47:54.060
oh my God, this is actually becoming more real.

02:47:54.060 --> 02:47:55.460
This is actually more and more of an opportunity.

02:47:55.460 --> 02:47:57.660
And I get equally more nervous too.

02:47:57.660 --> 02:48:02.660
Like, frankly, I've seen space flight stuff go wrong.

02:48:04.700 --> 02:48:06.060
I think about this stuff a lot.

02:48:06.060 --> 02:48:07.940
So like, yeah, I get more nervous,

02:48:07.940 --> 02:48:09.780
but I also get more excited about that opportunity.

02:48:09.780 --> 02:48:12.100
Like, it's an opportunity that how can you pass?

02:48:12.100 --> 02:48:16.140
And I still have to actually stop, pause, think,

02:48:16.140 --> 02:48:18.380
and actually realize the reality

02:48:18.380 --> 02:48:21.260
that I am going to the moon.

02:48:21.260 --> 02:48:23.740
I'm going to see the moon up close,

02:48:23.740 --> 02:48:25.100
flying around the moon, I'm sorry,

02:48:25.100 --> 02:48:26.860
some people get mad when I say going to the moon

02:48:26.860 --> 02:48:28.260
since I'm not landing on it.

02:48:29.220 --> 02:48:30.340
But flying around the moon,

02:48:30.340 --> 02:48:32.460
seeing the far side of the moon with my own eyes.

02:48:32.460 --> 02:48:34.060
And seeing earth.

02:48:34.060 --> 02:48:36.420
And seeing the earth rise behind it.

02:48:36.420 --> 02:48:38.860
Yeah, it's going to, I just, I can't,

02:48:38.860 --> 02:48:40.820
I can't tell you what it's going to be like

02:48:40.820 --> 02:48:42.780
and feel like. It's so epic.

02:48:42.780 --> 02:48:44.300
But it's insane to me that like,

02:48:44.300 --> 02:48:45.620
we're having this conversation

02:48:45.620 --> 02:48:47.860
and that that is my reality, you know?

02:48:47.860 --> 02:48:49.980
Like, and that someone was generous enough

02:48:49.980 --> 02:48:52.260
to consider the option of sharing this

02:48:52.260 --> 02:48:55.220
with frankly strangers.

02:48:55.220 --> 02:48:58.300
And the process that they had for selecting,

02:48:58.300 --> 02:49:01.660
like how much thought and time

02:49:01.660 --> 02:49:03.780
went into the selection process is incredible.

02:49:03.780 --> 02:49:07.300
You know, they did a public call at the beginning of 2021.

02:49:07.300 --> 02:49:10.380
And so the team's involved in whittling it down

02:49:10.380 --> 02:49:11.740
from a million applicants.

02:49:11.740 --> 02:49:14.020
There's a million applicants that whittled it.

02:49:14.020 --> 02:49:17.380
And they got it down to eight crew members and two backups.

02:49:17.420 --> 02:49:19.060
Yeah.

02:49:19.060 --> 02:49:19.900
Amazing people.

02:49:19.900 --> 02:49:21.580
I would have, you know,

02:49:21.580 --> 02:49:23.500
I don't know how they wound up where they did,

02:49:23.500 --> 02:49:24.860
but it's incredible.

02:49:24.860 --> 02:49:27.420
I feel a very deep connection to everyone

02:49:27.420 --> 02:49:28.780
that's already involved in.

02:49:28.780 --> 02:49:30.180
What can you say about the crew?

02:49:30.180 --> 02:49:32.340
You've gotten a chance to meet them and talk to them.

02:49:32.340 --> 02:49:34.260
And Steve Ioki is on the crew.

02:49:34.260 --> 02:49:36.620
Like, well, who else is there?

02:49:36.620 --> 02:49:39.900
So you're obviously the star athlete.

02:49:39.900 --> 02:49:42.940
Who else in terms of the artists that are there?

02:49:42.940 --> 02:49:45.060
So, oh man, we might just want to pull up

02:49:45.060 --> 02:49:47.340
just so I don't totally butcher and forget anybody.

02:49:48.180 --> 02:49:49.660
Because so far I haven't actually had the chance

02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:50.740
to meet everyone in person.

02:49:50.740 --> 02:49:53.660
You know, so far a lot of this was done during the pandemic,

02:49:53.660 --> 02:49:55.420
but we've met through a couple different things.

02:49:55.420 --> 02:49:57.900
We've had a couple different times to get together.

02:49:57.900 --> 02:50:01.580
But so, so far I've not met Steve Ioki yet or Top.

02:50:02.780 --> 02:50:04.180
We've been on calls and stuff.

02:50:04.180 --> 02:50:07.180
I also have not yet met Dev Joshi,

02:50:07.180 --> 02:50:08.980
who is an actor from India.

02:50:08.980 --> 02:50:13.900
So yeah, Steve Ioki, American DJ and producer and musician.

02:50:13.900 --> 02:50:16.420
Top from South Korea is also

02:50:17.460 --> 02:50:18.900
a musician and a producer.

02:50:18.900 --> 02:50:20.180
So this is all across the world.

02:50:20.180 --> 02:50:21.940
It's like truly global,

02:50:21.940 --> 02:50:23.780
all different kinds of walks of life.

02:50:23.780 --> 02:50:24.620
Yes.

02:50:24.620 --> 02:50:25.620
All artists of different forms.

02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:28.300
And Steve is Japanese.

02:50:28.300 --> 02:50:29.220
His parents are Japanese,

02:50:29.220 --> 02:50:32.220
but he, you know, born and raised in the United States.

02:50:32.220 --> 02:50:35.220
Yemi is a dancer and choreographer

02:50:35.220 --> 02:50:36.940
from the Czech Republic.

02:50:36.940 --> 02:50:39.620
Rhiannon is a fine art photographer from,

02:50:39.620 --> 02:50:41.220
well, England and Ireland.

02:50:41.220 --> 02:50:44.060
I guess she lives in both and kind of a bit of a,

02:50:44.060 --> 02:50:45.580
she's all over the place.

02:50:45.580 --> 02:50:48.020
Technically, she's Irish, I guess.

02:50:48.020 --> 02:50:51.380
I, Tim Dodd, yep, that's me from the United States.

02:50:52.500 --> 02:50:54.940
Then you have Kareem who is from England

02:50:54.940 --> 02:50:58.660
and does also as a photographer and documentarian,

02:50:58.660 --> 02:51:02.780
does a lot of work with oceanography and volcanoes.

02:51:02.780 --> 02:51:04.940
So he does really incredible work.

02:51:04.940 --> 02:51:08.420
Brendan Hall is a documentarian and filmmaker.

02:51:08.420 --> 02:51:11.700
Dev Joshi, sorry, Brendan is also from the United States.

02:51:11.700 --> 02:51:15.260
Dev Joshi is an Indian actor.

02:51:16.100 --> 02:51:18.380
I believe he's also already been producing and things.

02:51:18.380 --> 02:51:19.220
He's very young.

02:51:19.220 --> 02:51:21.340
I think he's only like 19 or 20.

02:51:21.340 --> 02:51:22.700
And he's, I mean, he's been acting

02:51:22.700 --> 02:51:24.900
since he was like five years old or something.

02:51:24.900 --> 02:51:26.780
He's a Bollywood star.

02:51:26.780 --> 02:51:29.260
Like he is a star in India, which is really cool.

02:51:29.260 --> 02:51:30.300
Right.

02:51:30.300 --> 02:51:31.900
Caitlin Farrington from the United States

02:51:31.900 --> 02:51:35.860
is an Olympic gold medalist snowboarder.

02:51:35.860 --> 02:51:39.020
So she, believe it or not, is the athlete, not me.

02:51:39.020 --> 02:51:39.860
All right.

02:51:39.860 --> 02:51:42.220
And then, and she's one of the backup crew members

02:51:42.220 --> 02:51:47.220
as so is Miyu from Japan, who's a dancer.

02:51:47.260 --> 02:51:48.100
That's amazing.

02:51:48.100 --> 02:51:49.660
I mean, it's such an interesting group.

02:51:49.660 --> 02:51:52.740
I mean, is there something else you could say about MZ,

02:51:52.740 --> 02:51:54.060
about Yusaka Maezawa?

02:51:54.060 --> 02:51:54.900
Yusaka Maezawa.

02:51:54.900 --> 02:51:57.660
So he's also a musician.

02:51:57.660 --> 02:52:00.140
So he was actually in like some kind of punk hardcore

02:52:00.140 --> 02:52:02.380
Japanese bands in the early, in the 90s and stuff

02:52:02.380 --> 02:52:03.820
in early 2000s.

02:52:03.820 --> 02:52:08.820
He started a record company and distribution and sales

02:52:09.700 --> 02:52:11.500
ended up in fashion.

02:52:11.500 --> 02:52:15.340
And owns one of the biggest fashion companies in Japan.

02:52:15.340 --> 02:52:17.180
And has become a fine art collector

02:52:17.180 --> 02:52:19.140
and just kind of a philanthropist.

02:52:19.140 --> 02:52:20.820
And he's been out to space already.

02:52:20.820 --> 02:52:23.380
He's already not only been to space, like, you know,

02:52:23.380 --> 02:52:25.420
he's been to the international space station.

02:52:25.420 --> 02:52:27.420
He's been on orbit and on the ISS.

02:52:27.420 --> 02:52:30.100
And so he, what's cool is like, you know,

02:52:30.100 --> 02:52:33.460
there's talks of, frankly, to be honest,

02:52:33.460 --> 02:52:35.220
like we still don't, I still don't know all of the details

02:52:35.220 --> 02:52:38.060
about this, you know, we're not yet into training.

02:52:38.060 --> 02:52:40.220
I kind of always assumed prior that there'd be some

02:52:40.220 --> 02:52:41.380
professional astronaut, you know,

02:52:41.380 --> 02:52:43.380
when they talked about it in 2018, there's talks of,

02:52:43.380 --> 02:52:46.100
we'll have a professional astronaut on board.

02:52:46.100 --> 02:52:49.740
But realistically now like MZ is a trained astronaut,

02:52:49.740 --> 02:52:54.060
you know, he has trained a lot, like six months, you know,

02:52:54.060 --> 02:52:56.740
plus to be able to fly on Soyuz.

02:52:56.740 --> 02:52:59.780
So as far as like, it's good to know for me that I have

02:52:59.780 --> 02:53:04.100
someone on the crew that has experience with space flight,

02:53:04.100 --> 02:53:06.780
has trained and has some knowledge on space flight as well.

02:53:06.780 --> 02:53:09.020
You know, that's, that is an important aspect for sure.

02:53:09.020 --> 02:53:12.900
So you made an excellent video about flying in a fighter jet

02:53:12.900 --> 02:53:16.780
that I think you mentioned may be relevant to the training.

02:53:16.780 --> 02:53:19.420
Is there some high level aspects to training

02:53:19.420 --> 02:53:22.420
that you anticipate that you might be able to speak to?

02:53:22.420 --> 02:53:25.620
Yeah, so, you know, so far, I think we can really lean on

02:53:25.620 --> 02:53:28.260
what has happened with the other, you know,

02:53:28.260 --> 02:53:31.460
commercial crew missions and in private missions,

02:53:31.460 --> 02:53:33.860
like the Inspiration 4 mission or Axiom,

02:53:33.860 --> 02:53:35.340
where SpaceX flew individually.

02:53:35.340 --> 02:53:37.180
They trained for about six months,

02:53:37.180 --> 02:53:40.980
a lot of like reading manuals and learning the spacecraft.

02:53:40.980 --> 02:53:44.900
Are you going to do like a Rocky 4 montage or something?

02:53:44.900 --> 02:53:46.020
I hope it just gets shredded.

02:53:46.020 --> 02:53:48.300
I hope it's physical, a lot of physical training.

02:53:48.300 --> 02:53:50.340
And they're like, we didn't tell them to do it.

02:53:50.340 --> 02:53:55.140
He just seems to want to fill himself shirtless in the snow.

02:53:55.140 --> 02:53:56.820
It doesn't make any, how is this relevant?

02:53:56.820 --> 02:53:58.060
Why is he always doing this?

02:53:58.060 --> 02:54:00.020
I can't get him to stop punching meat.

02:54:01.340 --> 02:54:06.100
So yeah, hopefully, realistically, I...

02:54:06.100 --> 02:54:09.020
That's a manual reading, I like it.

02:54:09.020 --> 02:54:10.900
There's a physical component to all of this.

02:54:10.900 --> 02:54:13.860
And that's really, I mean, that's fascinating.

02:54:13.860 --> 02:54:17.420
It's also inspiring the sort of civilians can do this.

02:54:17.420 --> 02:54:18.980
That's really interesting.

02:54:18.980 --> 02:54:22.740
Yeah, I mean, this is, and to me, this represents this

02:54:22.740 --> 02:54:24.860
and the other commercial space, you know,

02:54:24.860 --> 02:54:26.900
private space flight missions like this represent

02:54:26.900 --> 02:54:29.380
really a turning point, like truly an inflection.

02:54:29.380 --> 02:54:32.100
And again, it's easy for people to be cynical that,

02:54:32.100 --> 02:54:34.740
oh, you know, why are people wasting all this money

02:54:34.740 --> 02:54:35.700
doing space flight stuff?

02:54:36.580 --> 02:54:38.500
Well, I'm sure some people were saying that same thing

02:54:38.500 --> 02:54:42.380
about airplanes and early aviation going like,

02:54:42.380 --> 02:54:44.900
why are we, I can't believe those people are wasting

02:54:44.900 --> 02:54:48.140
the government's funding these stupid planes and stuff.

02:54:48.140 --> 02:54:49.220
How is this ever going to benefit me?

02:54:49.220 --> 02:54:52.500
And nowadays, imagine if all the planes just stopped working.

02:54:52.500 --> 02:54:55.460
Like we'd freak out, it's like our economy would collapse.

02:54:55.460 --> 02:54:56.700
It would suck.

02:54:56.700 --> 02:54:59.900
And it might be a long time before we get to that reality

02:54:59.900 --> 02:55:00.720
with space flight.

02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:04.020
Well, no, if space flight halted today,

02:55:04.060 --> 02:55:07.540
space assets, all of our, you know, on orbit assets,

02:55:07.540 --> 02:55:09.260
our life would be crippled.

02:55:09.260 --> 02:55:11.180
And I don't think people realize that.

02:55:11.180 --> 02:55:13.260
So it's already, we're already reliant on it,

02:55:13.260 --> 02:55:14.780
but now we're getting to the point where it's,

02:55:14.780 --> 02:55:16.620
we're really turning that corner where it's

02:55:16.620 --> 02:55:19.300
the average person alive today.

02:55:19.300 --> 02:55:22.700
You know, if you're born, you know, now, from now on,

02:55:22.700 --> 02:55:25.200
I think there's a real decent chance that by the time

02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:28.900
you pass, there's an opportunity to have flown in space.

02:55:28.900 --> 02:55:31.380
Yeah, I mean, I, if I'm being honest,

02:55:31.380 --> 02:55:34.020
I still haven't lost the feeling of magic

02:55:34.020 --> 02:55:35.660
of flying in an airplane.

02:55:35.660 --> 02:55:38.940
I often catch myself thinking like, how is this real?

02:55:39.940 --> 02:55:44.940
How is, and like the contrast of this incredible thing

02:55:45.300 --> 02:55:48.540
that's incredibly safe, flying through the air,

02:55:48.540 --> 02:55:53.540
taking off and landing, while everyone else just looks bored,

02:55:53.740 --> 02:55:58.260
watching like, I don't know, some romantic comedy

02:55:58.260 --> 02:56:01.460
on their phone with wifi.

02:56:01.460 --> 02:56:02.300
Yeah.

02:56:02.300 --> 02:56:06.740
So it's just, it's like, the contrast of that is like,

02:56:06.740 --> 02:56:11.540
wow, we're incredible, we're incredible as a society.

02:56:11.540 --> 02:56:15.900
And it's like, we develop some amazing technology

02:56:15.900 --> 02:56:19.800
that improves almost immeasurably our quality of life.

02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:23.040
And then we take it for granted and now still reach

02:56:23.040 --> 02:56:25.740
for the next thing and the next thing and life becomes

02:56:25.740 --> 02:56:28.020
more beautiful and complex and interesting.

02:56:28.780 --> 02:56:32.100
And yeah, it's just, the same stuff will be happening

02:56:33.340 --> 02:56:34.580
with space travel.

02:56:34.580 --> 02:56:37.340
Oh, it'll become mundane and boring at some point.

02:56:37.340 --> 02:56:39.700
The tough thing about space travel, of course,

02:56:41.580 --> 02:56:44.340
I don't even know if it's such a giant leap over airplanes

02:56:44.340 --> 02:56:47.500
because airplanes are already incredible,

02:56:47.500 --> 02:56:50.580
but the tough thing with space travel is the destination,

02:56:50.580 --> 02:56:54.900
right, is the landing on whole other worlds,

02:56:54.940 --> 02:56:58.040
whether it's docking with different transport vehicles

02:56:58.040 --> 02:57:00.860
or the space station or it's landing elsewhere.

02:57:00.860 --> 02:57:03.500
It really is incredible.

02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:07.380
I think you mentioned, since there's artists,

02:57:07.380 --> 02:57:09.060
there's filmmakers and so on,

02:57:09.900 --> 02:57:14.900
and you're all of those on top of being a great athlete.

02:57:15.020 --> 02:57:17.900
I don't know, I'll just stop the running joke at this point.

02:57:17.900 --> 02:57:22.900
But is there, have you thought about, just in general,

02:57:23.020 --> 02:57:24.980
we've offline talked about microphones

02:57:24.980 --> 02:57:29.420
and all the different ways to film space launch,

02:57:29.420 --> 02:57:31.300
yeah, rocket launches.

02:57:31.300 --> 02:57:32.980
Have you thought about the different options

02:57:32.980 --> 02:57:36.780
of how to capture this?

02:57:37.620 --> 02:57:39.900
Have you, have the team, have been brainstorming

02:57:39.900 --> 02:57:41.140
and thinking about this?

02:57:41.140 --> 02:57:43.660
Do you anticipate it being super challenging?

02:57:43.660 --> 02:57:44.820
Because there's so many opportunities

02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:47.640
to think of how to do this.

02:57:47.640 --> 02:57:50.020
So one of the fun things to remember is

02:57:50.020 --> 02:57:52.380
that Starship is huge.

02:57:52.380 --> 02:57:55.260
It's internal volume is, the pressurized volume

02:57:55.260 --> 02:57:59.060
on Starship is bigger than a 747's pressurized volume.

02:57:59.060 --> 02:58:02.380
And it can take 100 metric tons to anywhere

02:58:02.380 --> 02:58:04.100
with enough refueling.

02:58:04.100 --> 02:58:07.460
So we have, in theory, very little mass

02:58:07.460 --> 02:58:08.940
and volume constraints.

02:58:08.940 --> 02:58:12.060
Unlike prior, all other spaceflight missions ever,

02:58:12.060 --> 02:58:16.660
you're counting grams down to,

02:58:16.660 --> 02:58:18.660
just really can't risk,

02:58:18.660 --> 02:58:21.540
so you have very defined parameters

02:58:21.540 --> 02:58:23.580
on what you can and cannot do.

02:58:23.580 --> 02:58:25.620
We're going to likely have the luxury

02:58:25.620 --> 02:58:27.060
of being able to film and capture this

02:58:27.060 --> 02:58:28.820
in a way that's just never been done before.

02:58:28.820 --> 02:58:33.300
We won't be inhibited by mass and volume constraints

02:58:33.300 --> 02:58:34.740
like prior.

02:58:34.740 --> 02:58:39.020
So all that said and done, I'm hoping that we'll be able

02:58:39.020 --> 02:58:40.860
to just arm ourselves to the teeth

02:58:40.860 --> 02:58:44.500
with the absolute best cameras and equipment possible,

02:58:44.500 --> 02:58:48.260
backups on backups, and pre-wire,

02:58:48.260 --> 02:58:49.740
pre-rig things.

02:58:49.740 --> 02:58:52.940
Starship is going to be a transportation system

02:58:52.940 --> 02:58:56.300
and it has, you know, it's being built from the ground up.

02:58:56.300 --> 02:58:59.180
There's no reason why they can't put infrastructure

02:58:59.180 --> 02:59:01.580
in for cameras that are just housed in the vehicle.

02:59:01.580 --> 02:59:04.700
You know, these are talks that I'm excited to have

02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:07.940
because I really, ideally, one of the things I'd love to do,

02:59:07.940 --> 02:59:09.100
I'm going to be pushing really hard

02:59:09.100 --> 02:59:12.940
to actually try live streaming from inside

02:59:12.940 --> 02:59:13.860
during the launch.

02:59:14.860 --> 02:59:17.700
During the launch, live streaming from the inside,

02:59:17.740 --> 02:59:22.540
that would be incredible if it's possible to pull off.

02:59:22.540 --> 02:59:23.980
That's really, really incredible.

02:59:23.980 --> 02:59:25.740
There is the magic to the live stream

02:59:25.740 --> 02:59:28.780
because that's real, that's right there.

02:59:28.780 --> 02:59:32.020
The world would tune in, that would be truly inspiring, yes.

02:59:32.020 --> 02:59:34.700
To me, that's one of those things a lot of people ask

02:59:34.700 --> 02:59:36.140
why they aren't doing it.

02:59:36.140 --> 02:59:38.860
Of course, NASA and other individuals have their reasons

02:59:38.860 --> 02:59:39.780
of why not.

02:59:39.780 --> 02:59:41.460
You know, there's obviously some technical hurdles,

02:59:41.460 --> 02:59:44.540
but now with Starlink and other capabilities,

02:59:44.540 --> 02:59:46.580
there's less hurdles.

02:59:46.580 --> 02:59:48.420
There's obviously some transparency reasons,

02:59:48.420 --> 02:59:50.100
why, you know, and safety reasons,

02:59:50.100 --> 02:59:51.660
why it might not be a great idea

02:59:51.660 --> 02:59:54.780
to live stream a risky rocket launch.

02:59:54.780 --> 02:59:55.700
You know, the Challenger, I think,

02:59:55.700 --> 02:59:57.860
put a pretty bad taste in our mouth

02:59:57.860 --> 02:59:59.980
as far as publicizing an event

02:59:59.980 --> 03:00:02.460
and having every student in the United States

03:00:02.460 --> 03:00:05.900
tune in to, you know, a tragedy.

03:00:05.900 --> 03:00:08.500
But that's something I'm pushing for really hard

03:00:08.500 --> 03:00:10.340
just because I think it could be magical.

03:00:10.340 --> 03:00:12.020
I think it could really connect with people

03:00:12.020 --> 03:00:14.300
in a way that hasn't been done before.

03:00:14.780 --> 03:00:16.140
Speaking of Challenger,

03:00:18.060 --> 03:00:22.100
have you thought about the fact that you're riding

03:00:22.100 --> 03:00:24.940
a thing, as we've been talking about,

03:00:24.940 --> 03:00:29.940
that's a giant, explosive, powerful rocket?

03:00:32.820 --> 03:00:36.260
Have you thought about the risk of that,

03:00:36.260 --> 03:00:37.900
the danger of that?

03:00:37.900 --> 03:00:41.140
Have you contemplated your own mortality?

03:00:41.140 --> 03:00:42.300
How could I not?

03:00:42.300 --> 03:00:45.780
You know, I've seen and felt

03:00:45.780 --> 03:00:48.220
four of these prototype vehicles blow up,

03:00:48.220 --> 03:00:49.860
you know, with my own eyes.

03:00:51.340 --> 03:00:53.900
I don't know if there's anyone else,

03:00:53.900 --> 03:00:56.580
you know, early days, some of the, you know,

03:00:57.780 --> 03:01:00.780
Mercury and Gemini astronauts watched failures of rockets

03:01:00.780 --> 03:01:02.580
and then got on them.

03:01:02.580 --> 03:01:04.100
I don't know of too many people that are dumb enough

03:01:04.100 --> 03:01:06.620
to do that though, this day and age.

03:01:08.300 --> 03:01:11.260
It's obviously, I will have to see

03:01:11.260 --> 03:01:12.900
a lot of successful launches

03:01:12.900 --> 03:01:15.780
and have to have a lot of confidence

03:01:15.780 --> 03:01:17.980
in the engineering, the data,

03:01:17.980 --> 03:01:20.500
that they've developed a safe system,

03:01:20.500 --> 03:01:22.780
because currently, the current iteration of Starship

03:01:22.780 --> 03:01:26.660
has no abort system, has no escape tower.

03:01:26.660 --> 03:01:28.580
So, you know, Dragon capsule,

03:01:28.580 --> 03:01:29.780
which is currently flying people,

03:01:29.780 --> 03:01:31.340
has a launch abort system.

03:01:31.340 --> 03:01:33.620
It has super Draco engines that,

03:01:33.620 --> 03:01:34.580
either by the push of a button

03:01:34.580 --> 03:01:37.020
or by the automatic triggering of the flight computer,

03:01:37.020 --> 03:01:40.860
can shoot the capsule off of the rocket in milliseconds

03:01:40.860 --> 03:01:43.220
and pull it safely away, get it far enough away

03:01:43.220 --> 03:01:46.020
that it can pull the parachutes and safely splash down.

03:01:47.260 --> 03:01:50.060
Starship, by all iterations I've ever seen,

03:01:50.060 --> 03:01:52.180
does not have that.

03:01:52.180 --> 03:01:53.700
The space shuttle also did not have that.

03:01:53.700 --> 03:01:56.340
So it's not absurd to not have an abort system.

03:01:56.340 --> 03:01:59.740
Like it is, there is, you know,

03:01:59.740 --> 03:02:02.140
certain engineering principles that prove

03:02:02.140 --> 03:02:04.180
that that could be a completely valid thing.

03:02:04.180 --> 03:02:07.340
You know, the space shuttle flew 133 times

03:02:07.340 --> 03:02:09.660
fully successfully, it did have two failures,

03:02:09.660 --> 03:02:11.380
resulting in the loss of 14 lives.

03:02:12.500 --> 03:02:16.460
85, or, sorry, 98.5% success rate.

03:02:17.860 --> 03:02:20.700
Pretty, I mean, yeah, there's other,

03:02:20.700 --> 03:02:22.220
I've probably done things that are a lot riskier.

03:02:22.220 --> 03:02:24.660
I have raced motorcycles, drag raced motorcycles,

03:02:24.660 --> 03:02:26.500
and, you know, ridden like an absolute jerk

03:02:26.500 --> 03:02:27.620
on the streets on a motorcycle.

03:02:27.620 --> 03:02:31.980
I'm sure I've had a higher than a 98.5% survival rate,

03:02:31.980 --> 03:02:34.180
or lower than that, I mean, at some point.

03:02:35.740 --> 03:02:38.220
So it's, you know, yes, it's risky.

03:02:38.220 --> 03:02:39.900
It's scary.

03:02:39.900 --> 03:02:43.300
And I think about it a lot, a lot.

03:02:43.300 --> 03:02:46.340
It definitely is one of those things that I, you know,

03:02:46.340 --> 03:02:49.380
I will have to see, and I'm in no hurry

03:02:49.380 --> 03:02:50.500
for this to happen either.

03:02:50.500 --> 03:02:52.140
You know, personally, I'm in no hurry,

03:02:52.140 --> 03:02:54.780
because it's like, I would rather see this thing

03:02:54.780 --> 03:02:57.860
be developed and iterated and see 10, you know,

03:02:57.860 --> 03:02:59.660
or I was gonna say 10 dozen,

03:02:59.660 --> 03:03:02.460
but I'd be happy with a dozen fully successful,

03:03:02.460 --> 03:03:05.420
like, oh, we've got this thing totally nailed down,

03:03:05.420 --> 03:03:07.700
you know, before I get on it.

03:03:08.580 --> 03:03:09.900
And that likely is the reality.

03:03:09.900 --> 03:03:12.380
There will likely be a dozen or two or three launches,

03:03:12.380 --> 03:03:14.300
because just even to get to the moon on Starship,

03:03:14.300 --> 03:03:16.260
they have to refuel it in orbit.

03:03:17.380 --> 03:03:19.260
So it will get to Earth orbit,

03:03:19.260 --> 03:03:20.660
basically empty and out of fuel.

03:03:20.660 --> 03:03:23.580
So I'll have to dock with a fuel depot,

03:03:23.580 --> 03:03:25.780
fill up, and then go to the moon.

03:03:25.780 --> 03:03:28.580
So just to even get that full, you know,

03:03:28.580 --> 03:03:30.620
we're already talking about, you know,

03:03:30.620 --> 03:03:31.620
a handful of launches.

03:03:31.620 --> 03:03:34.900
So there will be a lot of launches before we fly.

03:03:34.900 --> 03:03:39.100
Would they do a test flight without humans on board

03:03:39.100 --> 03:03:40.940
that goes to the moon or no?

03:03:40.940 --> 03:03:41.780
I'm not sure.

03:03:41.780 --> 03:03:43.620
I'm not sure if they'll do that exact flight profile,

03:03:43.620 --> 03:03:45.780
but by then they will have already flown,

03:03:45.780 --> 03:03:49.700
most likely the Artemis III program will have flown

03:03:49.700 --> 03:03:53.020
a Starship variant to the moon that lands on the moon.

03:03:54.980 --> 03:03:57.140
So doing, at that point, you're pretty much,

03:03:57.140 --> 03:03:58.860
I would like them to test the heat shield

03:03:58.860 --> 03:04:00.020
at that entry velocity, though,

03:04:00.020 --> 03:04:04.020
because it is, you know, it takes another,

03:04:04.020 --> 03:04:06.660
it's about 30% faster to get,

03:04:06.660 --> 03:04:08.300
I get to go 30% faster than the lower Earth orbit

03:04:08.300 --> 03:04:10.300
to get out to a translunar injection.

03:04:10.300 --> 03:04:12.900
And although that only sounds like, oh, it's 30% faster.

03:04:12.900 --> 03:04:16.140
It's, you know, the reentry heating experienced

03:04:16.140 --> 03:04:20.420
by a vehicle goes up by velocity cubed, not squared.

03:04:20.420 --> 03:04:21.700
So, and not even, not linear.

03:04:21.700 --> 03:04:23.340
So it's not like if you go twice as fast to get,

03:04:23.340 --> 03:04:24.500
you see twice as much heat, you know,

03:04:24.500 --> 03:04:26.580
30% faster, 30% more heat.

03:04:26.580 --> 03:04:27.940
It's, and it's not squared.

03:04:27.940 --> 03:04:30.340
It's not go twice as fast to get four times as much heat.

03:04:30.340 --> 03:04:33.820
It's go twice as fast, get eight times as much heat

03:04:33.820 --> 03:04:34.860
on reentry.

03:04:34.860 --> 03:04:37.900
So 30% faster on reentry is actually a really,

03:04:37.900 --> 03:04:38.740
really big deal.

03:04:40.100 --> 03:04:41.900
So I would love to see that be tested.

03:04:41.900 --> 03:04:42.980
You know, there's certain things that I would love

03:04:42.980 --> 03:04:44.860
to see milestones that I would love to see tested out

03:04:44.860 --> 03:04:47.180
and proven before I get on board.

03:04:47.180 --> 03:04:50.540
But at the end of the day, I really do believe

03:04:50.540 --> 03:04:52.900
that just like Falcon 9 and the success of that,

03:04:52.900 --> 03:04:56.980
that they're going to push it and get all the kinks out

03:04:56.980 --> 03:04:58.500
well before anyone's on top of it.

03:04:58.500 --> 03:05:00.660
Nowadays, Falcon 9 and Dragon is, you know,

03:05:00.700 --> 03:05:04.500
arguably one of the safest, most reliable

03:05:04.500 --> 03:05:07.940
and best rides you could take to space.

03:05:07.940 --> 03:05:09.180
Are you afraid of dying?

03:05:10.500 --> 03:05:11.580
Yeah, yeah.

03:05:11.580 --> 03:05:14.340
Is this one of the first times you get to, you're young?

03:05:14.340 --> 03:05:15.180
Yeah.

03:05:15.180 --> 03:05:17.060
Have you gotten a chance to think about death

03:05:17.060 --> 03:05:21.780
as one of the first times you've really contemplated it?

03:05:22.820 --> 03:05:26.020
I mean, yeah, I mean, like I said,

03:05:26.020 --> 03:05:29.980
I've had dumb moments on motorcycles where I kind of saw,

03:05:30.860 --> 03:05:34.460
I'm going to smash into this thing at 120 mile an hour.

03:05:34.460 --> 03:05:36.180
So you've had moments when you realized

03:05:36.180 --> 03:05:38.180
it could end just like this.

03:05:38.180 --> 03:05:41.940
Where you literally, and I have, for most of my adult life,

03:05:41.940 --> 03:05:46.660
had dreams of falling and hitting the ground

03:05:46.660 --> 03:05:48.660
and it just all, you get it ringing in your ears,

03:05:48.660 --> 03:05:50.020
it all goes black, and in my head I go,

03:05:50.020 --> 03:05:51.460
oh shit, that was it.

03:05:51.460 --> 03:05:53.500
Have you seen a therapist about this or?

03:05:53.500 --> 03:05:54.340
Uh-uh.

03:05:54.340 --> 03:05:55.380
I wonder what it means.

03:05:56.260 --> 03:05:57.980
So I've, and-

03:05:57.980 --> 03:05:59.780
I'm sure there's a Freudian interpretation

03:05:59.780 --> 03:06:02.900
somewhere in there that I'm going to also apply

03:06:02.900 --> 03:06:04.620
to my dating life, no.

03:06:04.620 --> 03:06:07.020
The joke is, the running joke continues.

03:06:07.020 --> 03:06:12.020
Okay, so I mean, it's fascinating in general,

03:06:12.420 --> 03:06:15.100
as I hope we'll talk about in the early days of space flight

03:06:15.100 --> 03:06:20.100
that there is, the task of reaching out to the stars

03:06:20.100 --> 03:06:22.260
is a fundamentally risky one.

03:06:22.260 --> 03:06:23.660
You have to take risks, and of course,

03:06:23.660 --> 03:06:26.620
there's really rigorous safety precautions and so on,

03:06:26.620 --> 03:06:28.340
but it's still a risk.

03:06:28.340 --> 03:06:31.220
And I think like most people, for me,

03:06:31.220 --> 03:06:33.940
the idea of dying isn't so much about myself,

03:06:33.940 --> 03:06:36.220
it's about those affected by it.

03:06:36.220 --> 03:06:40.620
My loved ones, my family, my girlfriend, my friends.

03:06:40.620 --> 03:06:43.220
Obviously, I don't want to have this be

03:06:43.220 --> 03:06:45.700
a traumatic experience for anybody.

03:06:45.700 --> 03:06:47.500
It's already going to be hard.

03:06:47.500 --> 03:06:50.940
I know my mom gets, my parents and family and friends

03:06:50.940 --> 03:06:52.060
are very supportive.

03:06:53.380 --> 03:06:56.540
And my parents are all about it, of course,

03:06:56.540 --> 03:06:59.060
but my mom is also very emotional too.

03:06:59.060 --> 03:07:02.580
So, speaking of athletes, my brother-in-law

03:07:02.580 --> 03:07:06.100
has actually been on American Ninja Warrior two seasons,

03:07:06.100 --> 03:07:07.140
phenomenal athlete.

03:07:07.140 --> 03:07:10.100
And even just when he competes, my mom gets so emotional.

03:07:10.100 --> 03:07:12.420
She can't even hold it together seeing that.

03:07:12.420 --> 03:07:14.100
So what's it going to be like when she sees her son

03:07:14.100 --> 03:07:15.860
get on top of a skyscraper

03:07:15.860 --> 03:07:19.260
and ascend on a column of flames into the heavens?

03:07:19.260 --> 03:07:22.540
That's going to be very difficult, you know?

03:07:23.860 --> 03:07:27.340
And I've taken them out, they've seen Starbase

03:07:27.340 --> 03:07:29.860
and they've seen Starship, they've seen a couple launches.

03:07:29.860 --> 03:07:31.660
I don't know if that's gonna make him feel better.

03:07:31.660 --> 03:07:34.580
Hey, exposure therapy, I guess.

03:07:34.580 --> 03:07:36.100
Exposure therapy, okay.

03:07:36.980 --> 03:07:39.980
Have you had that conversation with them about this,

03:07:39.980 --> 03:07:44.140
like before agreeing to join?

03:07:44.140 --> 03:07:48.540
I mean, was that, or is it one of those things like,

03:07:50.100 --> 03:07:53.940
you just, you don't have that conversation.

03:07:53.940 --> 03:07:55.940
I suppose it's understood that there's a love,

03:07:55.940 --> 03:07:57.500
there's a passion here.

03:07:57.500 --> 03:07:59.780
And realistically, I'm not,

03:08:00.900 --> 03:08:05.060
I'm going to be convinced and statistically convinced

03:08:05.060 --> 03:08:07.300
that this is relatively safe.

03:08:07.300 --> 03:08:10.860
You know, like, again, in the 99s, percent safe.

03:08:10.860 --> 03:08:11.860
Yeah.

03:08:11.860 --> 03:08:14.260
Again, there's things that people do every day

03:08:14.260 --> 03:08:16.620
that are less safe than this, you know?

03:08:16.620 --> 03:08:18.260
Like you ride in a motorcycle.

03:08:19.220 --> 03:08:20.220
Again, yeah, riding a motorcycle,

03:08:20.220 --> 03:08:21.900
doing wheelies at over 100 mile an hour,

03:08:21.900 --> 03:08:22.740
not the smartest thing.

03:08:22.740 --> 03:08:25.860
You did wheelies over 100, what?

03:08:27.620 --> 03:08:28.460
All right.

03:08:28.460 --> 03:08:29.980
I'm not a smart guy always, okay?

03:08:31.820 --> 03:08:33.380
Formation flying in the fighter jets

03:08:33.380 --> 03:08:35.860
was likely a more dangerous thing

03:08:35.860 --> 03:08:39.220
than what I'll be doing in space flight.

03:08:42.420 --> 03:08:46.060
So as surreal as it is, we're talking about you

03:08:47.060 --> 03:08:49.340
flying around the moon.

03:08:49.340 --> 03:08:53.620
Let's rewind and talk about the origin story.

03:08:53.620 --> 03:08:56.180
What's the origin story of Everyday Astronaut?

03:08:57.020 --> 03:08:59.020
I used to be a professional photographer.

03:08:59.020 --> 03:09:02.140
So from 2008 until the end of 2016,

03:09:02.140 --> 03:09:05.300
that was my income, was photography, full-time.

03:09:05.300 --> 03:09:06.500
Like you were an Instagram model

03:09:06.500 --> 03:09:08.380
and took butt pictures of yourself?

03:09:08.380 --> 03:09:10.420
Instagram fitness model, obviously.

03:09:10.420 --> 03:09:11.460
Fitness model, obviously.

03:09:13.340 --> 03:09:14.860
I did a lot of weddings.

03:09:14.900 --> 03:09:17.700
I shot 150 weddings all around the world.

03:09:17.700 --> 03:09:19.340
So subjects, all kinds of material,

03:09:19.340 --> 03:09:21.380
like did you do portrait also?

03:09:21.380 --> 03:09:22.220
A lot of portrait work

03:09:22.220 --> 03:09:24.100
and then just random commercial things

03:09:24.100 --> 03:09:26.540
like food and beverages for businesses

03:09:26.540 --> 03:09:29.780
or like wheelchair ramp company,

03:09:29.780 --> 03:09:30.860
I shot their product.

03:09:30.860 --> 03:09:32.020
You know, it's random,

03:09:32.020 --> 03:09:33.860
whatever a professional photographer does

03:09:33.860 --> 03:09:35.380
in Cedar Falls, Iowa.

03:09:35.380 --> 03:09:37.700
When did you fall in love with photography?

03:09:37.700 --> 03:09:39.140
Was it visual medium?

03:09:39.140 --> 03:09:39.960
Do you remember?

03:09:39.960 --> 03:09:41.740
Yeah, I do actually remember.

03:09:41.740 --> 03:09:45.140
So I grew up drawing constantly.

03:09:45.140 --> 03:09:47.340
I was the weird kid that my,

03:09:47.340 --> 03:09:50.060
I would bring a sketch pad to the restaurants.

03:09:50.060 --> 03:09:51.940
Like every restaurant when I was growing up,

03:09:51.940 --> 03:09:53.460
until I was like 18, 19,

03:09:53.460 --> 03:09:54.500
I literally would just sit there

03:09:54.500 --> 03:09:55.660
and draw or waiting for food.

03:09:55.660 --> 03:09:56.860
And my parents like fostered that.

03:09:56.860 --> 03:09:58.580
They would, you know,

03:09:58.580 --> 03:09:59.900
and I'd be the weird kid,

03:09:59.900 --> 03:10:01.100
but I'd be engaging and talking,

03:10:01.100 --> 03:10:02.780
but I'd be sitting there drawing.

03:10:02.780 --> 03:10:05.140
And I was always obsessed with realism

03:10:05.140 --> 03:10:08.700
and like recreating and, you know, visualizing things.

03:10:08.700 --> 03:10:10.900
And so when I got my hands on a camera,

03:10:10.900 --> 03:10:12.340
actually my dad's old Pentax

03:10:12.340 --> 03:10:15.020
that I first shot on a film camera

03:10:15.020 --> 03:10:16.260
and developing the film,

03:10:16.260 --> 03:10:17.220
I didn't personally develop it,

03:10:17.220 --> 03:10:18.540
like, you know, getting the film back,

03:10:18.540 --> 03:10:19.460
back in those days.

03:10:20.860 --> 03:10:22.940
You know, I just was like so excited

03:10:22.940 --> 03:10:25.900
about the idea that I had this visual thing

03:10:25.900 --> 03:10:27.700
that I saw with my own eyes

03:10:27.700 --> 03:10:30.540
and now I can stop time and capture it

03:10:30.540 --> 03:10:32.020
and show it to other people.

03:10:32.020 --> 03:10:32.860
Just kind of like, to me,

03:10:32.860 --> 03:10:34.820
that was like the ultimate form of realism

03:10:34.820 --> 03:10:38.340
was like literally showing you the photons basically

03:10:38.340 --> 03:10:40.060
that affected this film.

03:10:41.140 --> 03:10:45.340
And so, I mean, I was 19 when I got my first digital SLR

03:10:45.340 --> 03:10:48.820
at Canon 20D and started shooting.

03:10:50.260 --> 03:10:51.980
And yeah, I just, I fell in love with it.

03:10:51.980 --> 03:10:54.060
It became like, I got a job at a camera store

03:10:54.060 --> 03:10:56.100
and, you know, basically all my extra money

03:10:56.100 --> 03:10:58.740
went into buying everything that I could at the time.

03:10:58.740 --> 03:11:00.980
And I only worked there for about exactly a year

03:11:00.980 --> 03:11:03.260
before I went into pursuing photography full time.

03:11:03.260 --> 03:11:05.660
And I basically was shooting weddings

03:11:05.660 --> 03:11:07.420
so that I could travel and pay,

03:11:07.980 --> 03:11:11.380
afford to be able to do some big trips every year

03:11:11.380 --> 03:11:14.660
and develop some kind of portfolio of traveling

03:11:14.660 --> 03:11:18.340
and not necessarily like, not for, you know,

03:11:18.340 --> 03:11:19.980
I guess Instagram wasn't much of a thing at the time.

03:11:19.980 --> 03:11:22.060
It's really just, I liked making big prints

03:11:22.060 --> 03:11:25.860
and having them displayed and that kind of stuff.

03:11:25.860 --> 03:11:27.060
And pretty soon-

03:11:27.060 --> 03:11:28.740
Are you still a Canon guy?

03:11:28.740 --> 03:11:30.420
Are you still a Canon elitist?

03:11:30.420 --> 03:11:32.860
No, no, I moved around.

03:11:32.860 --> 03:11:34.340
I did Sony for a bit.

03:11:34.340 --> 03:11:36.620
I still kind of shoot mostly Canon glass,

03:11:36.620 --> 03:11:39.900
but adapted to either Sony, like lenses,

03:11:39.900 --> 03:11:41.460
sorry, like Canon lenses.

03:11:41.460 --> 03:11:42.420
Look at you.

03:11:43.540 --> 03:11:45.860
What do you think about these things

03:11:45.860 --> 03:11:48.580
that I'm using Sony a7 IV?

03:11:48.580 --> 03:11:49.460
Great.

03:11:49.460 --> 03:11:50.300
It's great.

03:11:50.300 --> 03:11:53.740
See, yeah, it's, I've been, you know,

03:11:53.740 --> 03:11:56.460
I Googled around just trying to find a camera

03:11:56.460 --> 03:11:59.700
that can do video and photography pretty well.

03:11:59.700 --> 03:12:01.980
And obviously going with just like,

03:12:01.980 --> 03:12:06.100
generic lenses, primary, I resisted everything.

03:12:06.100 --> 03:12:07.700
My whole journey with these camera thing,

03:12:07.700 --> 03:12:09.220
I'm trying to figure stuff out,

03:12:09.220 --> 03:12:11.980
is like prime lens, it seems so stupid.

03:12:11.980 --> 03:12:14.740
So prime lens is like a fixed zoom thing.

03:12:14.740 --> 03:12:16.380
It's like, why?

03:12:16.380 --> 03:12:18.620
Cause I remember I was going to like Ukraine

03:12:19.740 --> 03:12:23.060
and thinking it's similar, like, yeah,

03:12:23.060 --> 03:12:24.500
very similar to space flight,

03:12:24.500 --> 03:12:25.980
but you're very constrained

03:12:25.980 --> 03:12:28.180
because you're going into an unknown environment.

03:12:28.180 --> 03:12:30.660
You go into a war zone, you go into a front,

03:12:30.660 --> 03:12:32.980
you don't know what, like you don't know anything.

03:12:32.980 --> 03:12:35.020
And there's like a little suitcase you have to like see,

03:12:35.020 --> 03:12:36.580
figure out like, how do you film this?

03:12:36.580 --> 03:12:39.140
What's robust?

03:12:39.140 --> 03:12:42.060
What gives you like a good image versus the flexibility

03:12:42.060 --> 03:12:43.460
versus the weight?

03:12:43.460 --> 03:12:44.500
Cause weight is important there.

03:12:44.500 --> 03:12:46.060
You have to think about like,

03:12:46.060 --> 03:12:48.140
can you really bring like a bunch of zoom lenses

03:12:48.140 --> 03:12:49.300
and all that kind of stuff?

03:12:49.300 --> 03:12:51.340
So I had to learn really quickly, but yeah.

03:12:52.980 --> 03:12:54.740
It's a whole journey that you've already been on,

03:12:54.740 --> 03:12:56.980
but it's nice to have a beginner like me,

03:12:56.980 --> 03:12:59.660
like to explore that.

03:12:59.660 --> 03:13:00.500
I think there is,

03:13:02.140 --> 03:13:03.260
there's a nice thing just like,

03:13:03.260 --> 03:13:06.100
as we've been talking about with a beginner's mind,

03:13:06.100 --> 03:13:11.100
to not let equipment get in the way

03:13:11.620 --> 03:13:13.100
of like what your vision is

03:13:13.100 --> 03:13:14.980
of what a thing should look like.

03:13:14.980 --> 03:13:18.260
Sometimes like, especially if you're a professional

03:13:18.260 --> 03:13:21.500
videographer, a photographer, a cinematographer,

03:13:21.500 --> 03:13:22.900
whatever you call it,

03:13:22.900 --> 03:13:25.900
you can like fetishize equipment too much.

03:13:25.900 --> 03:13:27.700
You could get so much equipment.

03:13:27.700 --> 03:13:28.660
And I've interacted with that

03:13:28.660 --> 03:13:30.340
cause I've been trying to learn from other people

03:13:30.340 --> 03:13:33.060
that have so much more experience than me.

03:13:33.900 --> 03:13:37.820
And I think their advice is often like very pushing

03:13:37.820 --> 03:13:42.220
a lot of equipment versus like the final thing.

03:13:42.220 --> 03:13:44.620
Like how do you create the art of it?

03:13:46.340 --> 03:13:49.420
Cause to me, even photography is just like storytelling.

03:13:49.420 --> 03:13:54.420
And so like a lot of the discussion to me that I enjoy,

03:13:54.620 --> 03:13:56.460
especially talking to creative people,

03:13:56.460 --> 03:13:58.860
is like the final story.

03:13:58.860 --> 03:14:02.980
Like how, and I've learned, like light, light,

03:14:03.860 --> 03:14:04.940
light is a weird thing.

03:14:04.940 --> 03:14:07.100
Like it's so interesting.

03:14:07.100 --> 03:14:10.860
It's so interesting how you can create emotion with light.

03:14:10.860 --> 03:14:14.940
Like with a little, you can take like a phone

03:14:14.940 --> 03:14:17.660
and like you light your face in different ways

03:14:17.660 --> 03:14:19.780
and like it changes the emotion.

03:14:19.780 --> 03:14:21.060
It's so weird.

03:14:22.380 --> 03:14:23.820
I'm like, holy shit.

03:14:24.740 --> 03:14:26.460
Cause like that's the conversation I wanna have

03:14:26.460 --> 03:14:28.460
because people give me advice how to light a scene

03:14:28.460 --> 03:14:30.060
and all that kind of stuff is great.

03:14:30.060 --> 03:14:33.620
But the reality is that a little bit of light

03:14:33.620 --> 03:14:35.580
in a different direction that you have to understand

03:14:35.580 --> 03:14:37.100
how that changes.

03:14:37.100 --> 03:14:39.660
The contour on your face and everything.

03:14:39.660 --> 03:14:41.820
And the expression that your face can,

03:14:41.820 --> 03:14:46.820
like the expression that could be effectively communicate

03:14:47.020 --> 03:14:49.340
under different lighting conditions.

03:14:49.340 --> 03:14:53.660
And then like the mystery of like having some of your face

03:14:53.660 --> 03:14:57.580
in darkness and some not when you can only see the eyes

03:14:57.580 --> 03:15:00.860
and not the face when the background is visible or not.

03:15:00.860 --> 03:15:05.860
I mean, yeah, it's all just like this interesting art form

03:15:06.060 --> 03:15:09.100
that can be so powerful when you're telling a story.

03:15:09.100 --> 03:15:12.100
Well, and what's fun with me with photography and rockets

03:15:12.100 --> 03:15:14.860
they're both like the ultimate story of compromise.

03:15:14.860 --> 03:15:16.100
Cause when you start learning about photography,

03:15:16.100 --> 03:15:18.980
learn about how the aperture affects both your exposure

03:15:18.980 --> 03:15:21.060
but also your depth of field, higher shutter speed

03:15:21.060 --> 03:15:23.100
affects both your exposure, your depth of field,

03:15:23.100 --> 03:15:27.060
how the, a medium format camera versus a crop camera

03:15:27.100 --> 03:15:29.020
affects, you know, everything is a compromise

03:15:29.020 --> 03:15:30.700
and price versus performance.

03:15:30.700 --> 03:15:32.780
You're like, there's always a compromise.

03:15:32.780 --> 03:15:34.740
You're always literally doing like a trade study

03:15:34.740 --> 03:15:36.020
of what can I afford?

03:15:36.020 --> 03:15:36.940
What's my outcome?

03:15:36.940 --> 03:15:38.180
Like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

03:15:38.180 --> 03:15:40.740
How fast is he out of focus or whatever.

03:15:40.740 --> 03:15:41.580
Same with rockets.

03:15:41.580 --> 03:15:44.060
Like there's a million choices

03:15:44.060 --> 03:15:46.500
and every single one of them affects every single thing.

03:15:46.500 --> 03:15:47.780
So there's always all these trades

03:15:47.780 --> 03:15:51.380
and it's so cool that you can see the same,

03:15:51.380 --> 03:15:53.260
totally different outcomes based on the same like

03:15:53.260 --> 03:15:55.820
requirements, you know, like do X

03:15:55.820 --> 03:15:56.980
and here's how we're gonna do it.

03:15:57.900 --> 03:15:58.900
Two teams of people will come up

03:15:58.900 --> 03:16:00.780
with wildly different things.

03:16:00.780 --> 03:16:04.060
When did you fall in love with rockets?

03:16:04.060 --> 03:16:07.020
So yeah, so the story kind of keeps going for me.

03:16:07.020 --> 03:16:07.860
So I was doing-

03:16:07.860 --> 03:16:10.620
I'm sorry to interrupt you really.

03:16:10.620 --> 03:16:11.740
Can't talk photography, man.

03:16:11.740 --> 03:16:14.380
We'll go down a deep rabbit hole there.

03:16:14.380 --> 03:16:18.780
So it ended, you know, through all this doing

03:16:18.780 --> 03:16:20.540
a lot of weddings, I was already getting saturated

03:16:20.540 --> 03:16:23.180
and feeling like I'm not being as creative.

03:16:23.180 --> 03:16:24.460
You know, you can only shoot them

03:16:24.460 --> 03:16:25.660
so many weddings before you're like,

03:16:25.660 --> 03:16:27.740
well, now we do this pose, this pose, this pose.

03:16:27.740 --> 03:16:29.460
You know, even if like they're amazing places

03:16:29.460 --> 03:16:31.700
like, you know, in front of a castle in Germany

03:16:31.700 --> 03:16:32.540
or something, I'm still like,

03:16:32.540 --> 03:16:36.380
well, at the end of the day, I'm not being very creative.

03:16:36.380 --> 03:16:41.380
You know, so I remember craving like some projects.

03:16:41.540 --> 03:16:45.580
And so I was sitting at my friend's coffee shop

03:16:45.580 --> 03:16:48.780
in my hometown in Cedar Falls, a sidecar coffee

03:16:48.780 --> 03:16:50.300
and I'm sitting on this red couch

03:16:50.300 --> 03:16:53.020
and I see this article from I think Gizmodo

03:16:53.020 --> 03:16:56.540
and it said, you could own the flight stick

03:16:56.540 --> 03:16:58.180
of an Apollo command module.

03:16:59.060 --> 03:17:00.740
And I knew enough to know what that meant

03:17:00.740 --> 03:17:03.300
but that's really about the end of my space knowledge.

03:17:03.300 --> 03:17:04.940
And so I clicked on it, the click bait got me.

03:17:04.940 --> 03:17:07.380
Like I'm like, oh yeah, I'm gonna see if, you know,

03:17:07.380 --> 03:17:10.020
and I see that the minimum bid was like $250,000.

03:17:10.020 --> 03:17:12.940
I'm like, okay, no, I can't own the Apollo joystick,

03:17:12.940 --> 03:17:16.140
you know, but it got me on this website called RR Auction.

03:17:16.140 --> 03:17:17.460
And so I started scrolling through that,

03:17:17.460 --> 03:17:19.500
looking for things that hadn't been bid on.

03:17:19.500 --> 03:17:20.540
And they had that, you know, at the time

03:17:20.540 --> 03:17:22.780
they're doing a huge space auction.

03:17:22.780 --> 03:17:25.020
And so I'm looking for things just out of curiosity,

03:17:25.020 --> 03:17:27.260
fun, these are cool, like it's starting to really,

03:17:27.260 --> 03:17:28.860
you know, like I said, I liked space

03:17:28.860 --> 03:17:30.700
but I wasn't like in love with it or anything.

03:17:30.700 --> 03:17:34.540
But I'm very just seeing all the stuff like,

03:17:34.540 --> 03:17:37.540
it's so cool, look at all this old history stuff.

03:17:37.540 --> 03:17:40.180
And I ended up seeing, there's an article

03:17:40.180 --> 03:17:45.180
for a VMSTK-44 flight suit,

03:17:45.700 --> 03:17:48.940
high altitude flight suit that came from the Soviet Union

03:17:48.940 --> 03:17:52.140
and looks, you know, it's like a MIG fighter jet,

03:17:52.140 --> 03:17:54.860
fighter pilot suit, very similar to like the SR-71,

03:17:54.860 --> 03:17:58.180
like kind of pumpkin suit, semi-pressure suit

03:17:58.180 --> 03:18:00.100
with a, you know, full helmet.

03:18:00.100 --> 03:18:01.900
I mean, a full, it looks like a space suit,

03:18:01.900 --> 03:18:03.060
you know, for all intents and purposes,

03:18:03.060 --> 03:18:05.540
it's kind of like a space suit.

03:18:05.540 --> 03:18:07.780
And I just bid on it, you know, I bid like,

03:18:07.780 --> 03:18:10.900
I think $325 and next thing you know,

03:18:10.900 --> 03:18:12.340
like it arrives at my door.

03:18:13.340 --> 03:18:14.180
Yeah.

03:18:14.180 --> 03:18:17.100
And from that point on, like literally I got it out,

03:18:17.100 --> 03:18:18.980
I immediately tried to put it on.

03:18:18.980 --> 03:18:21.300
And the first thing that I do is almost die in it

03:18:21.300 --> 03:18:25.220
because I closed the helmet down on myself and locked it

03:18:25.220 --> 03:18:27.140
and didn't know how to unlock it.

03:18:27.140 --> 03:18:31.020
So I'm literally, and so as soon as I seal it up,

03:18:31.020 --> 03:18:32.860
I'm realizing I can't breathe.

03:18:32.860 --> 03:18:33.820
I'm going to run out of air.

03:18:33.820 --> 03:18:35.900
So luckily like there's a hose, you know,

03:18:35.900 --> 03:18:37.460
kind of that long hose thing that would normally plug

03:18:37.460 --> 03:18:39.660
into an air supply, had a little plug on the end of it.

03:18:39.660 --> 03:18:42.060
So I just unplugged it and was able to temporarily breathe

03:18:42.060 --> 03:18:45.020
through the hose until I figured out the locking mechanism.

03:18:45.020 --> 03:18:46.420
So there was my almost,

03:18:46.420 --> 03:18:48.340
that was my mortality rate thing right there.

03:18:48.340 --> 03:18:51.420
So that was probably above a 98 or below a 90.

03:18:51.420 --> 03:18:55.340
So you're there panicking inside for a few seconds.

03:18:55.340 --> 03:18:57.860
Already reading like my premature obituary,

03:18:57.860 --> 03:19:00.460
like idiot dies alone in spacesuit in his living room.

03:19:00.460 --> 03:19:02.620
You know, like just imagine,

03:19:02.620 --> 03:19:05.820
that would be like Darwin award for sure, for sure.

03:19:06.820 --> 03:19:10.860
So I get the spacesuit and it kind of-

03:19:10.860 --> 03:19:13.020
Literally take my breath away.

03:19:16.100 --> 03:19:17.420
You should feel bad for that one.

03:19:17.420 --> 03:19:19.580
You introduced creed to me,

03:19:19.580 --> 03:19:22.500
so you should feel bad about that one.

03:19:22.500 --> 03:19:23.500
Stars wide open.

03:19:25.060 --> 03:19:29.260
Okay, so I ended up like the spacesuit kind of like

03:19:29.260 --> 03:19:31.060
more or less haunted me because it kind of just,

03:19:31.060 --> 03:19:33.020
it sat in like my living room for a long time

03:19:33.020 --> 03:19:34.660
and I didn't know what to do with it.

03:19:34.660 --> 03:19:37.180
And I actually had a friend who is also a photographer,

03:19:37.180 --> 03:19:38.580
wanted to do like a photo.

03:19:38.580 --> 03:19:39.860
He was just kind of taking pictures randomly.

03:19:39.860 --> 03:19:41.140
He's like, hey, bring your spacesuit over.

03:19:41.140 --> 03:19:42.380
We'll do a picture.

03:19:42.380 --> 03:19:44.100
It's like, all right, you know, I walk across the street,

03:19:44.100 --> 03:19:46.260
literally lived across the street, Taylor.

03:19:46.260 --> 03:19:48.540
And I put the spacesuit on, I took this funny picture

03:19:48.540 --> 03:19:49.540
and I'm like, this is awesome.

03:19:49.540 --> 03:19:52.020
And I got a lot of like fun out of like creating a character,

03:19:52.020 --> 03:19:53.180
you know, of everyday astronaut,

03:19:53.180 --> 03:19:56.300
or at the time I guess I didn't know, an astronaut.

03:19:56.300 --> 03:19:57.820
And then that kind of just continued.

03:19:57.820 --> 03:20:00.460
I was like thinking of more and more funny situations

03:20:00.460 --> 03:20:02.580
where I could have this astronaut on earth

03:20:02.580 --> 03:20:04.980
doing mundane everyday things

03:20:04.980 --> 03:20:06.860
and came up with the name Everyday Astronaut.

03:20:06.860 --> 03:20:09.220
And originally it was just literally a photo project,

03:20:09.220 --> 03:20:12.300
like this whole art series of an astronaut

03:20:12.300 --> 03:20:15.740
doing these things, these funny whimsical, you know,

03:20:15.740 --> 03:20:16.580
silly mundane things.

03:20:16.580 --> 03:20:18.580
But I was researching a lot about like,

03:20:18.580 --> 03:20:19.740
you know, I was trying to hide Easter eggs.

03:20:19.740 --> 03:20:21.940
Like I was gonna hide in like the, you know,

03:20:21.940 --> 03:20:26.020
the echocardiogram of Alan Shepard, you know,

03:20:26.020 --> 03:20:27.740
like his first flight into space

03:20:27.740 --> 03:20:29.500
and Photoshopping that into pictures.

03:20:29.500 --> 03:20:31.700
And like, you know, doing all these little like facts

03:20:31.700 --> 03:20:32.620
about space flight,

03:20:32.620 --> 03:20:35.060
but there's just hidden little elements in these photos.

03:20:35.060 --> 03:20:37.260
And man, doing that, I just fell in love with it.

03:20:37.260 --> 03:20:39.500
I just was going over every little detail

03:20:39.500 --> 03:20:40.420
that I could learn.

03:20:40.420 --> 03:20:42.460
I just couldn't stop learning.

03:20:42.460 --> 03:20:44.260
And I was getting excited because I was like,

03:20:44.260 --> 03:20:46.980
I could be teaching people about all this exciting stuff

03:20:46.980 --> 03:20:48.820
and all the cool things people figured out,

03:20:48.820 --> 03:20:51.300
you know, 40 years ago, 50 years ago,

03:20:51.300 --> 03:20:54.180
and was trying to portray that through images on Instagram.

03:20:54.180 --> 03:20:56.020
And, you know, it took me a little while,

03:20:56.020 --> 03:20:57.700
but eventually I realized, you know,

03:20:57.700 --> 03:20:58.820
on Instagram, your retention rate,

03:20:58.820 --> 03:21:01.420
you're lucky if you get like two seconds

03:21:01.420 --> 03:21:03.060
of someone looking at an image, you know,

03:21:03.060 --> 03:21:04.660
or maybe nowadays 60 seconds

03:21:04.660 --> 03:21:07.500
of a quick little Instagram short or something.

03:21:07.500 --> 03:21:10.620
But, yeah.

03:21:10.620 --> 03:21:12.580
It doesn't give you a chance to really teach,

03:21:12.580 --> 03:21:15.380
to explore a little topic that you felt,

03:21:15.380 --> 03:21:16.940
like you felt the curiosity about the thing.

03:21:16.940 --> 03:21:17.940
There's so much to learn here.

03:21:17.940 --> 03:21:19.060
This is so beautiful.

03:21:19.060 --> 03:21:21.260
There's so many opportunities to have a light bulb go off

03:21:21.260 --> 03:21:23.700
for someone to be like, this is awesome.

03:21:23.700 --> 03:21:26.060
And so, yeah, I think I started.

03:21:26.060 --> 03:21:28.460
So at the, by the end of 2016, like throughout 2016,

03:21:28.460 --> 03:21:31.300
I realized I want to be done doing photography

03:21:31.300 --> 03:21:34.020
as a profession and I want to pursue everyday astronaut.

03:21:34.020 --> 03:21:35.380
But I didn't know what it meant yet.

03:21:35.380 --> 03:21:37.620
I just knew like I had this thing, you know,

03:21:37.620 --> 03:21:40.020
and at that time I'd been doing it for roughly two years

03:21:40.180 --> 03:21:41.900
and had, you know, seen, I don't know,

03:21:41.900 --> 03:21:43.980
like 50,000 Instagram followers or something.

03:21:43.980 --> 03:21:46.540
I thought like I could just be a full-time influencer now,

03:21:46.540 --> 03:21:49.500
you know, like just go around taking pictures of myself

03:21:49.500 --> 03:21:52.140
in a spacesuit and doing public appearances

03:21:52.140 --> 03:21:53.420
and write a children's book or something.

03:21:53.420 --> 03:21:54.260
I don't know.

03:21:54.260 --> 03:21:55.540
I don't know what this thing is.

03:21:55.540 --> 03:21:57.140
I'll figure it out, you know.

03:21:57.140 --> 03:22:00.820
And so it basically, I gave myself like a runway

03:22:00.820 --> 03:22:03.260
of one year of 2017 of like,

03:22:03.260 --> 03:22:05.940
I'm gonna throw stuff off the wall and see what sticks.

03:22:05.940 --> 03:22:07.340
So I was doing like Twitch streams.

03:22:07.340 --> 03:22:09.460
I was playing Kerbal Space Program,

03:22:09.700 --> 03:22:11.340
which is like a video game,

03:22:11.340 --> 03:22:14.900
like a physics-based rocket building simulation game.

03:22:14.900 --> 03:22:16.380
But it's also like, it's fun and silly

03:22:16.380 --> 03:22:18.020
because you're not playing with like humans.

03:22:18.020 --> 03:22:19.700
You're playing with these little Kerbal,

03:22:19.700 --> 03:22:23.300
like little alien guys and it's fun and silly.

03:22:23.300 --> 03:22:25.700
You know, streaming that on Twitch and doing things

03:22:25.700 --> 03:22:28.620
and doing, posting some of those things onto YouTube.

03:22:28.620 --> 03:22:29.460
But finally, like I said,

03:22:29.460 --> 03:22:32.740
it actually happened to be February 27th, 2017

03:22:32.740 --> 03:22:34.460
when SpaceX had that announcement

03:22:34.460 --> 03:22:35.420
that they're flying someone around the moon,

03:22:35.420 --> 03:22:38.180
that I'm, I gotta tell people about this

03:22:38.620 --> 03:22:42.380
and stood there and made my first like produced YouTube video

03:22:42.380 --> 03:22:44.980
and I didn't want it to be over three minutes.

03:22:44.980 --> 03:22:47.460
I was afraid that'd be way too long for YouTube.

03:22:47.460 --> 03:22:49.100
And I got it down to like, I don't know,

03:22:49.100 --> 03:22:51.140
two minutes and 40 seconds or something.

03:22:51.140 --> 03:22:51.980
And that video-

03:22:51.980 --> 03:22:53.340
Were you wearing the-

03:22:53.340 --> 03:22:54.700
I was wearing the spacesuit.

03:22:54.700 --> 03:22:55.540
The spacesuit.

03:22:55.540 --> 03:22:58.220
Yeah, and very like horrible audio.

03:22:58.220 --> 03:23:00.660
It looks like it was color graded by a seven-year-old

03:23:00.660 --> 03:23:02.300
with a tan marker or something.

03:23:02.300 --> 03:23:04.500
Like it just looks terrible, sounds horrible.

03:23:04.500 --> 03:23:07.220
I'm yelling, no one's happy.

03:23:07.300 --> 03:23:11.060
But the video, you know, did relatively well.

03:23:11.060 --> 03:23:12.660
Like I had no followers on YouTube.

03:23:12.660 --> 03:23:15.300
Like I had, you know, maybe 102 or something.

03:23:15.300 --> 03:23:16.420
Is the video still up?

03:23:16.420 --> 03:23:17.260
Yeah.

03:23:17.260 --> 03:23:18.100
That's great.

03:23:18.100 --> 03:23:18.940
That's a watch.

03:23:18.940 --> 03:23:20.740
It's so cringy.

03:23:20.740 --> 03:23:22.060
And as it should be, you know,

03:23:22.060 --> 03:23:23.780
your first video should be terrible.

03:23:23.780 --> 03:23:24.620
If it's not terrible,

03:23:24.620 --> 03:23:26.420
then you spent too long trying to make it.

03:23:26.420 --> 03:23:29.780
So the thing that clicked for me

03:23:29.780 --> 03:23:32.180
is I had very little audience

03:23:32.180 --> 03:23:34.300
and all of a sudden that video kind of took off,

03:23:34.300 --> 03:23:35.140
you know, relatively.

03:23:35.140 --> 03:23:37.020
I think it got like 10,000 or 12,000 views.

03:23:37.820 --> 03:23:38.660
I was like, holy crap.

03:23:38.660 --> 03:23:40.180
That's way more engagement than I would have.

03:23:40.180 --> 03:23:41.020
I'm famous.

03:23:41.020 --> 03:23:42.260
I'm famous now.

03:23:42.260 --> 03:23:43.500
10,000 people?

03:23:43.500 --> 03:23:45.020
That's almost my whole town.

03:23:45.020 --> 03:23:46.540
First of all, that is kind of crazy.

03:23:46.540 --> 03:23:48.300
Like 10,000 people is crazy.

03:23:48.300 --> 03:23:49.140
It's crazy.

03:23:49.140 --> 03:23:53.020
Like if you had 500 people attend a thing that you do,

03:23:53.020 --> 03:23:56.300
that would be like, you're like a rock star.

03:23:56.300 --> 03:23:57.500
It's crazy.

03:23:57.500 --> 03:23:58.540
We lose perspective.

03:23:58.540 --> 03:24:00.460
Yeah, we really lose perspective very quickly.

03:24:00.460 --> 03:24:01.300
Very quickly.

03:24:01.300 --> 03:24:03.620
So I'd made another video.

03:24:03.620 --> 03:24:04.940
This one I spent more time on.

03:24:05.900 --> 03:24:07.540
Before photography, actually,

03:24:07.540 --> 03:24:09.500
I used to do like wedding videography too.

03:24:09.500 --> 03:24:11.700
So I had done my woes with videography

03:24:11.700 --> 03:24:12.780
and weddings and stuff.

03:24:12.780 --> 03:24:13.980
I hated video.

03:24:13.980 --> 03:24:15.820
Like I thought video was the worst.

03:24:15.820 --> 03:24:17.180
Took so long to edit.

03:24:17.180 --> 03:24:18.020
You know, and I love photography.

03:24:18.020 --> 03:24:19.740
It's like, boom, you snap it.

03:24:19.740 --> 03:24:21.620
Post, you're done in an hour, you know?

03:24:21.620 --> 03:24:23.460
And video, it's like this whole cumbersome thing.

03:24:23.460 --> 03:24:25.580
So I thought I'll never do video.

03:24:25.580 --> 03:24:27.100
And here I was making this long,

03:24:27.100 --> 03:24:29.500
what the time seemed like a long seven minute long

03:24:29.500 --> 03:24:32.420
YouTube video about how the Falcon 9 lands.

03:24:32.420 --> 03:24:34.100
And again, like that one I posted

03:24:34.100 --> 03:24:35.420
and actually it did really bad.

03:24:35.420 --> 03:24:36.260
And I was really upset.

03:24:36.260 --> 03:24:39.460
I'm like, I spent two weeks on the stupid video.

03:24:39.460 --> 03:24:42.380
You know, worked really hard scripting and blah, blah, blah.

03:24:42.380 --> 03:24:44.580
And then, you know, I had like a thousand views or something.

03:24:44.580 --> 03:24:46.420
It did much worse than the first video.

03:24:46.420 --> 03:24:47.820
And I was so upset.

03:24:47.820 --> 03:24:50.220
And I kind of like was ready to keep throwing more spaghetti

03:24:50.220 --> 03:24:51.500
at the wall to see what's gonna stick

03:24:51.500 --> 03:24:52.700
for Everyday Astronaut.

03:24:52.700 --> 03:24:54.380
And I think it was like a month or two later,

03:24:54.380 --> 03:24:55.460
I happened to like, you know,

03:24:55.460 --> 03:24:58.380
check the analytics on YouTube and all of a sudden.

03:24:58.380 --> 03:25:00.420
That video like kind of took off.

03:25:00.420 --> 03:25:02.900
And it got like 40 or 50 or 60,000 views or something.

03:25:02.900 --> 03:25:04.660
I was like, no way.

03:25:04.660 --> 03:25:06.500
And it just kept, you know, that just honed it in more.

03:25:06.500 --> 03:25:09.060
They're like, okay, YouTube will bring a bigger,

03:25:09.060 --> 03:25:10.860
like it will bring an audience to me

03:25:10.860 --> 03:25:11.780
as opposed to like Instagram.

03:25:11.780 --> 03:25:14.180
I had to find and, you know,

03:25:14.180 --> 03:25:15.580
try to get the audience to come to me.

03:25:15.580 --> 03:25:17.700
And this was like, they were gonna do the legwork.

03:25:17.700 --> 03:25:20.340
So if I make decent videos.

03:25:20.340 --> 03:25:22.300
And I realized like really the fun thing for me

03:25:22.300 --> 03:25:25.500
was explaining a topic that was scary and intimidating

03:25:25.500 --> 03:25:27.980
and try to make it, you know, fun and engaging.

03:25:27.980 --> 03:25:29.660
What were some of the struggles

03:25:29.660 --> 03:25:31.940
of building up a YouTube channel?

03:25:31.940 --> 03:25:33.940
So for people who don't know, once again,

03:25:33.940 --> 03:25:38.220
you have a YouTube channel called Everyday Astronaut

03:25:38.220 --> 03:25:39.580
and there's some incredible videos on it.

03:25:39.580 --> 03:25:41.180
So what was the, what was the,

03:25:41.180 --> 03:25:43.460
some of the challenges and the struggles

03:25:43.460 --> 03:25:44.420
in the early days?

03:25:44.420 --> 03:25:45.660
Definitely like at first,

03:25:45.660 --> 03:25:47.020
you're not gonna find your own voice.

03:25:47.020 --> 03:25:48.140
And I know like even, you know,

03:25:48.140 --> 03:25:50.140
Jimmy talked to you about that,

03:25:50.140 --> 03:25:51.540
like how your first video is gonna suck.

03:25:51.540 --> 03:25:52.780
You don't, you're not gonna be yourself.

03:25:52.780 --> 03:25:53.620
You're gonna be nervous.

03:25:53.620 --> 03:25:55.300
You're gonna be, you're not gonna know the tone,

03:25:55.300 --> 03:25:57.780
the pace, the things that are interesting.

03:25:57.780 --> 03:26:00.300
And actually originally I had constraints.

03:26:00.380 --> 03:26:02.580
I was really worried about making a short video

03:26:02.580 --> 03:26:03.500
because I thought there's no,

03:26:03.500 --> 03:26:04.940
anyone's gonna watch a three minute video

03:26:04.940 --> 03:26:06.620
and then a seven minute video.

03:26:06.620 --> 03:26:09.140
And pretty quickly I realized like YouTube as a whole

03:26:09.140 --> 03:26:10.380
was kind of changing,

03:26:10.380 --> 03:26:13.340
but also there's always that historic backbone

03:26:13.340 --> 03:26:16.420
of like 22 minutes of programming

03:26:16.420 --> 03:26:18.540
for a 30 minute spot on TV.

03:26:18.540 --> 03:26:21.180
Like no one goes over 22 or 44 minutes, you know,

03:26:21.180 --> 03:26:22.660
if you have the full hour special or whatever.

03:26:22.660 --> 03:26:24.780
Like that is the absolute limit

03:26:24.780 --> 03:26:27.980
of what a human being can watch, you know,

03:26:27.980 --> 03:26:29.860
basically it was what I thought.

03:26:29.860 --> 03:26:32.380
And slowly I just kept playing and getting longer

03:26:32.380 --> 03:26:35.420
and actually more and more in depth into the topics.

03:26:35.420 --> 03:26:36.940
And instead of getting like pushback, you know,

03:26:36.940 --> 03:26:38.700
and being like, this is so boring.

03:26:38.700 --> 03:26:40.060
I realized as long as it's like,

03:26:40.060 --> 03:26:42.620
as I was walking people through the whole step, you know,

03:26:42.620 --> 03:26:44.660
giving them all the context they need,

03:26:44.660 --> 03:26:46.620
they're happy to get as deep into the weeds

03:26:46.620 --> 03:26:47.900
as I can get them.

03:26:47.900 --> 03:26:49.300
And so that just kind of fed the,

03:26:49.300 --> 03:26:50.540
the snowball just kept rolling.

03:26:50.540 --> 03:26:52.540
And I'm like, all right, and you know,

03:26:52.540 --> 03:26:54.660
before you know it, I'm making hour long videos.

03:26:54.660 --> 03:26:57.500
Like an hour long is more or less a normal length

03:26:57.500 --> 03:27:00.140
on my channel for a produced video.

03:27:00.140 --> 03:27:03.180
And they're really, really in depth,

03:27:03.180 --> 03:27:06.300
but I love like that process of trying to preemptively

03:27:06.300 --> 03:27:08.700
kind of guess what the questions might be.

03:27:08.700 --> 03:27:10.540
And, you know, part of that is like,

03:27:10.540 --> 03:27:13.700
we do like script read throughs with like our supporters

03:27:13.700 --> 03:27:16.180
and do like cuts of videos and people,

03:27:16.180 --> 03:27:18.700
a decent amount of people see it before it goes public.

03:27:18.700 --> 03:27:20.340
And we get those questions out of the way, you know,

03:27:20.340 --> 03:27:22.260
we get those people asking the questions.

03:27:22.260 --> 03:27:25.740
And then I love nothing more than trying to, you know,

03:27:25.740 --> 03:27:28.540
get all those questions answered by the end of the video.

03:27:28.540 --> 03:27:32.500
A question about being a creator on YouTube,

03:27:32.500 --> 03:27:35.420
that could be a challenging psychological aspect to it,

03:27:35.420 --> 03:27:39.300
which is like, you might invest a huge amount of your effort

03:27:39.300 --> 03:27:44.220
into a thing and it doesn't receive much attention at all.

03:27:44.220 --> 03:27:46.780
And, you know, there's something about YouTube

03:27:46.780 --> 03:27:49.020
and in general social media

03:27:49.020 --> 03:27:51.340
that makes you feel really crappy about that.

03:27:51.340 --> 03:27:54.980
If you let it, if you really look at the numbers,

03:27:55.020 --> 03:27:57.660
it's very, very difficult not to pay attention to that.

03:27:57.660 --> 03:27:59.700
I mean, that's the reason why I turn off numbers

03:27:59.700 --> 03:28:04.220
on my interface for stuff that I've created,

03:28:04.220 --> 03:28:07.180
because I just see it having a negative effect on your mind.

03:28:07.180 --> 03:28:10.100
But even then you still, it still has an effect.

03:28:10.100 --> 03:28:15.100
That mean your epic video on the history of Soviet rockets

03:28:17.580 --> 03:28:19.900
comes to mind and we'll talk about that in a second,

03:28:19.900 --> 03:28:22.820
but it's called, people should check it out,

03:28:22.860 --> 03:28:25.540
the entire Soviet rocket engine family tree.

03:28:25.540 --> 03:28:27.980
So that's something you've researched for two years.

03:28:27.980 --> 03:28:29.180
Yeah.

03:28:29.180 --> 03:28:30.980
All right, you put your heart and soul into it.

03:28:30.980 --> 03:28:33.460
There's a lot of passion and there's a long journey.

03:28:33.460 --> 03:28:36.380
It's, I think about like an hour and a half video.

03:28:38.420 --> 03:28:41.140
Is there like, is there challenges?

03:28:41.140 --> 03:28:44.300
Is there like, how difficult is that

03:28:44.300 --> 03:28:46.780
to put so much of yourself into a video

03:28:46.780 --> 03:28:49.180
and it maybe not do so well?

03:28:49.180 --> 03:28:53.700
Yeah, that's the struggle for sure, honestly,

03:28:53.700 --> 03:28:55.620
especially as like, as we grow,

03:28:55.620 --> 03:28:58.260
I try to make better and better videos,

03:28:58.260 --> 03:29:00.620
which means hiring more and more people to do,

03:29:00.620 --> 03:29:03.220
you know, higher end animations and spend more time editing

03:29:03.220 --> 03:29:06.340
and shooting and scripting and just,

03:29:06.340 --> 03:29:07.180
but at the end of the day,

03:29:07.180 --> 03:29:10.140
like it still can't be just losing money.

03:29:10.140 --> 03:29:13.180
And I have videos that definitely lose a lot of money

03:29:13.180 --> 03:29:16.180
because I, you know, hire 3D artists and stuff.

03:29:16.700 --> 03:29:21.460
And I was so certain the Soviet rocket engine video

03:29:21.460 --> 03:29:24.060
I thought was just purely gonna be a passion project.

03:29:24.060 --> 03:29:25.260
I did, I honestly was like,

03:29:25.260 --> 03:29:28.260
if it ever crosses a million, it's a home run.

03:29:28.260 --> 03:29:29.100
Because it's such-

03:29:29.100 --> 03:29:30.780
And does it cross like a couple of million?

03:29:30.780 --> 03:29:34.260
I think it's a little over two, which is insane to me.

03:29:34.260 --> 03:29:36.900
Like I just really thought this was more something

03:29:36.900 --> 03:29:39.260
just to put on the shelf as a resource almost for myself,

03:29:39.260 --> 03:29:41.300
you know, like just to kind of have that knowledge bank

03:29:41.300 --> 03:29:43.180
and something I've always wanted to straighten out

03:29:43.180 --> 03:29:45.820
in my own head and kind of know the history

03:29:46.500 --> 03:29:48.540
and just kind of get a little bit better,

03:29:48.540 --> 03:29:50.580
but come to find out, like it took a while,

03:29:50.580 --> 03:29:51.780
you know, it was a slow turn.

03:29:51.780 --> 03:29:54.220
Well, I remember when you first released it

03:29:54.220 --> 03:29:55.780
and that's when I watched it,

03:29:56.740 --> 03:29:59.900
I remember like, this has so few views.

03:29:59.900 --> 03:30:00.740
Yeah.

03:30:00.740 --> 03:30:01.980
I remember being just sad.

03:30:02.940 --> 03:30:05.620
Like I was like sad about the state of the world

03:30:05.620 --> 03:30:07.460
because I know how much love you put into it,

03:30:07.460 --> 03:30:09.900
how like, how much, I don't know.

03:30:09.900 --> 03:30:12.620
To me, for some reason, that somehow would

03:30:12.620 --> 03:30:15.620
directly connect to huge views.

03:30:16.620 --> 03:30:18.940
If you use a different thumbnail or a different title

03:30:18.940 --> 03:30:21.100
that could affect the popularity.

03:30:21.100 --> 03:30:21.940
I know.

03:30:21.940 --> 03:30:23.820
And then I just could imagine the torment

03:30:23.820 --> 03:30:24.820
you're going through.

03:30:24.820 --> 03:30:27.340
What if I used a different thumbnail?

03:30:27.340 --> 03:30:30.620
It's that Jimmy, the Mr. Beast torment,

03:30:30.620 --> 03:30:34.020
like just a slightly different title

03:30:34.020 --> 03:30:35.980
or a slightly different,

03:30:35.980 --> 03:30:36.980
it could change everything.

03:30:36.980 --> 03:30:40.260
I have videos, ironically, the last like,

03:30:40.260 --> 03:30:41.860
I don't know, five videos I've produced

03:30:41.860 --> 03:30:43.780
are horribly flopping.

03:30:43.780 --> 03:30:45.740
Like some of my worst videos I've ever made,

03:30:45.740 --> 03:30:46.860
statistically.

03:30:46.860 --> 03:30:48.900
The interesting one is like the,

03:30:48.900 --> 03:30:51.260
you summarized incredible video.

03:30:51.260 --> 03:30:53.740
You summarizing that people should go watch

03:30:53.740 --> 03:30:57.100
about all the awards video for 2022,

03:30:57.100 --> 03:30:59.420
like all the cool stuff that happened in 2022.

03:30:59.420 --> 03:31:00.900
I remember that not being that popular.

03:31:00.900 --> 03:31:03.140
There's a few ones recently that are not that popular.

03:31:03.140 --> 03:31:04.340
Like riding in a fighter jet.

03:31:04.340 --> 03:31:06.500
I thought that was gonna be easy,

03:31:06.500 --> 03:31:08.380
like one or two million.

03:31:08.380 --> 03:31:11.660
I don't know if I've paid the flights off to go there.

03:31:11.660 --> 03:31:12.500
You know what I mean?

03:31:12.500 --> 03:31:13.420
In that video.

03:31:13.420 --> 03:31:15.180
It makes no sense.

03:31:15.180 --> 03:31:17.620
And frankly, here's at the end of the day.

03:31:17.620 --> 03:31:18.460
Yeah.

03:31:18.460 --> 03:31:20.940
I realized like I have lately,

03:31:20.940 --> 03:31:22.060
especially the last year or two,

03:31:22.060 --> 03:31:24.220
kind of disconnected from that aspect of it.

03:31:24.220 --> 03:31:25.260
I'm super fortunate.

03:31:25.260 --> 03:31:27.500
I have very generous like Patreon support

03:31:27.500 --> 03:31:29.500
and people that can help me sustain to produce.

03:31:29.500 --> 03:31:30.900
People go support.

03:31:30.900 --> 03:31:32.780
Support Tim on Patreon.

03:31:32.780 --> 03:31:34.260
Well, it's that,

03:31:34.260 --> 03:31:35.620
but as you know, as a creator,

03:31:35.620 --> 03:31:37.460
like that is what keeps the lights on it

03:31:37.460 --> 03:31:38.820
and makes it so it,

03:31:38.820 --> 03:31:39.660
I can go this deep.

03:31:39.660 --> 03:31:40.580
Like if I didn't have that,

03:31:40.580 --> 03:31:43.980
if I had to rely solely on like YouTube ad revenue,

03:31:43.980 --> 03:31:45.460
I mean, I would just,

03:31:45.460 --> 03:31:46.740
they'd be super different videos.

03:31:46.740 --> 03:31:48.660
I wouldn't spend as much time researching

03:31:48.660 --> 03:31:49.500
because I just, you know,

03:31:49.500 --> 03:31:50.940
they'd just be more glossed over.

03:31:50.940 --> 03:31:52.620
It's like a hurry to turn them out

03:31:52.620 --> 03:31:54.500
so I can keep the machine going.

03:31:54.500 --> 03:31:57.460
And I have this incredible freedom

03:31:57.460 --> 03:31:59.420
to really dive into a topic.

03:31:59.420 --> 03:32:00.620
Like a video that I've been working on now

03:32:00.620 --> 03:32:03.620
for almost three months is how to start a rocket engine.

03:32:03.620 --> 03:32:04.460
And let me tell you,

03:32:04.460 --> 03:32:06.980
it's not as easy as one might think,

03:32:06.980 --> 03:32:09.780
or I guess it is as difficult as you might think.

03:32:09.780 --> 03:32:12.140
I mean, it's an insane topic.

03:32:12.140 --> 03:32:12.980
What do you mean by start?

03:32:12.980 --> 03:32:13.940
You mean like the ignition?

03:32:13.940 --> 03:32:15.780
Yeah, like how do you physically get them running?

03:32:15.780 --> 03:32:17.820
You know, like there's all these,

03:32:17.820 --> 03:32:20.500
you know, the valves and the turbine,

03:32:20.500 --> 03:32:21.340
the turbine, you know,

03:32:21.340 --> 03:32:22.220
that we were talking about earlier,

03:32:22.220 --> 03:32:23.620
like that has to run on the pumps,

03:32:23.620 --> 03:32:25.820
but it itself is powering the pumps.

03:32:25.820 --> 03:32:27.420
So how do you get that like chicken and egg?

03:32:27.420 --> 03:32:29.300
How do you get that thing started?

03:32:29.300 --> 03:32:30.700
You know, there's tons of,

03:32:30.700 --> 03:32:31.540
it's so cool.

03:32:31.540 --> 03:32:33.020
There's so many ways.

03:32:33.020 --> 03:32:34.020
And so for me, you know,

03:32:34.020 --> 03:32:35.780
that required reading a lot

03:32:35.780 --> 03:32:38.580
and talking to people that know a lot more than me

03:32:39.060 --> 03:32:41.020
and just really trying to make sure

03:32:41.020 --> 03:32:43.220
I understand enough of it to explain it

03:32:43.220 --> 03:32:44.860
and try to weave a narrative, you know.

03:32:44.860 --> 03:32:47.180
And so that video is three months in the making.

03:32:47.180 --> 03:32:50.060
We're still probably another two or three weeks out.

03:32:50.060 --> 03:32:51.060
And it's, I don't expect,

03:32:51.060 --> 03:32:53.740
I mean, I think this one will do relatively well, you know,

03:32:53.740 --> 03:32:55.180
but in the grand scheme of YouTube,

03:32:55.180 --> 03:32:57.700
like still child's play, you know.

03:32:57.700 --> 03:33:01.020
But I'm okay and I'm okay with that.

03:33:01.020 --> 03:33:04.460
I'm at that point actually where I am okay with that.

03:33:04.460 --> 03:33:07.300
It still stings and I'm more worried about just like,

03:33:07.340 --> 03:33:09.580
can I continue to do it at this quality

03:33:09.580 --> 03:33:12.540
and at this level if it's losing money?

03:33:12.540 --> 03:33:13.380
You know what I mean?

03:33:13.380 --> 03:33:14.940
So it's, there is a trade-off

03:33:14.940 --> 03:33:17.420
and I am kind of having to navigate that.

03:33:17.420 --> 03:33:22.420
But you have sort of the depth of the impact you have

03:33:23.500 --> 03:33:27.300
is a thing that YouTube can't give you numbers on,

03:33:27.300 --> 03:33:30.660
but it's a really important thing to sort of remember

03:33:30.660 --> 03:33:32.940
that it's really not just about the YouTube numbers

03:33:32.940 --> 03:33:35.700
or it's for people like you,

03:33:35.700 --> 03:33:39.300
that are basically educating

03:33:39.300 --> 03:33:43.780
and revealing the brilliance in a technology

03:33:43.780 --> 03:33:47.940
that will make humans a multi-planetary species

03:33:47.940 --> 03:33:51.420
and give hope to millions of young minds

03:33:51.420 --> 03:33:53.220
that will build that future.

03:33:53.220 --> 03:33:54.700
I mean, that's immeasurable.

03:33:54.700 --> 03:33:56.140
That's not just the views.

03:33:56.140 --> 03:34:01.140
That's really important to sort of remember

03:34:02.580 --> 03:34:03.540
as you're creating it.

03:34:03.540 --> 03:34:06.980
That's something I try to think about as well.

03:34:06.980 --> 03:34:08.060
So like views.

03:34:09.140 --> 03:34:11.220
Yeah, and that becomes more.

03:34:11.220 --> 03:34:12.500
Don't matter.

03:34:12.500 --> 03:34:14.940
I realize that more and more like every day,

03:34:14.940 --> 03:34:16.820
the more the channel matures,

03:34:16.820 --> 03:34:18.900
the more I realize the importance of it

03:34:18.900 --> 03:34:21.740
as an overall mission as opposed to like,

03:34:21.740 --> 03:34:22.580
in the first year or two,

03:34:22.580 --> 03:34:25.900
it's a rat race of growth and of popularity

03:34:25.900 --> 03:34:27.060
and all that kind of stuff.

03:34:27.060 --> 03:34:29.420
And you feel that, you feel that it's a driving force.

03:34:29.420 --> 03:34:30.900
These days, not so much,

03:34:30.900 --> 03:34:33.860
just because that will wear you out very quickly.

03:34:33.860 --> 03:34:37.420
So back to the Soviet rocket video, the epic video,

03:34:37.420 --> 03:34:40.940
probably the most epically researched video you've done.

03:34:40.940 --> 03:34:44.340
I mean, it's like, it's truly an epic video.

03:34:45.340 --> 03:34:47.820
So what, again, called

03:34:47.820 --> 03:34:51.220
the entire Soviet rocket engine family tree

03:34:51.220 --> 03:34:53.380
took you two years to research.

03:34:53.380 --> 03:34:55.820
What are some fascinating things you've learned

03:34:55.820 --> 03:34:57.740
about the history of rocket engines

03:34:58.740 --> 03:35:02.220
in the Soviet Union and in general

03:35:02.220 --> 03:35:04.300
through the process of making that video?

03:35:05.260 --> 03:35:10.260
The coolest thing to me is how it's this weird blend

03:35:10.980 --> 03:35:12.780
for the Soviet Union went through

03:35:12.780 --> 03:35:17.780
an insane iteration process and made so many engines.

03:35:17.860 --> 03:35:20.340
Like I didn't even touch, you know,

03:35:20.340 --> 03:35:22.420
any like maneuvering thrusters or missile engines.

03:35:22.420 --> 03:35:24.980
Like I only really dealt with main propulsion engines

03:35:24.980 --> 03:35:27.460
on orbital rockets and there's still way too many

03:35:27.460 --> 03:35:28.300
to talk about.

03:35:28.300 --> 03:35:30.460
I mean, it's still dozens and dozens of engines.

03:35:30.460 --> 03:35:33.460
And I could have gone deeper into this, which is hilarious.

03:35:34.740 --> 03:35:37.220
They iterated so much, made a new engine for,

03:35:37.220 --> 03:35:39.060
just at the drop of a hat,

03:35:40.060 --> 03:35:43.380
yet they still also like did super primitive things.

03:35:43.380 --> 03:35:46.700
You know, they physically are still today lighting

03:35:46.700 --> 03:35:48.820
the main combustion chambers of the Soyuz engines

03:35:48.820 --> 03:35:52.140
of the RD-107 and RD-108 with essentially matchsticks.

03:35:52.140 --> 03:35:55.060
Like they'd literally stick a T-shaped thing

03:35:55.060 --> 03:35:57.340
up into the chamber and have a pyrotechnic

03:35:58.100 --> 03:36:00.980
in it that ignites the actual propellants

03:36:00.980 --> 03:36:02.220
in the combustion chamber.

03:36:02.220 --> 03:36:04.660
It's not the most elegant solution in the world.

03:36:04.660 --> 03:36:05.620
They're still using that.

03:36:05.620 --> 03:36:08.980
So they went from like the whole spectrum of like,

03:36:08.980 --> 03:36:11.260
it's a mixture of like make it better, faster,

03:36:11.260 --> 03:36:13.860
harder, stronger, gooder all the way around

03:36:13.860 --> 03:36:15.860
to also if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

03:36:15.860 --> 03:36:18.700
It's like, it employs all of the above.

03:36:18.700 --> 03:36:21.500
So it's like, it's a lot of innovation

03:36:21.500 --> 03:36:23.140
but also they use duct tape.

03:36:23.140 --> 03:36:24.980
It's like all of it together.

03:36:24.980 --> 03:36:28.540
Yes, that's exactly like, that's exactly the way to put it.

03:36:28.540 --> 03:36:30.740
And they did things that are insane.

03:36:30.740 --> 03:36:33.420
They developed a full flow stage combustion cycle engine.

03:36:33.420 --> 03:36:35.540
This engine had it been used.

03:36:35.540 --> 03:36:36.540
I mean, it would have put the F,

03:36:36.540 --> 03:36:39.580
it was same relative size as the F1 engine

03:36:39.580 --> 03:36:41.980
on the Saturn V, like in that same category,

03:36:41.980 --> 03:36:44.820
way up there of like, you know, 6.7

03:36:44.820 --> 03:36:46.460
like mega Newtons of thrust or something around.

03:36:46.460 --> 03:36:48.620
And then the F1 is like seven or something.

03:36:48.620 --> 03:36:53.620
It's huge, yet way more complicated, way more efficient,

03:36:53.620 --> 03:36:56.780
way just better engine in that sense,

03:36:56.780 --> 03:36:58.540
as far as performance goes.

03:36:58.540 --> 03:36:59.660
Yet it never flew.

03:36:59.660 --> 03:37:01.180
It never left the stand.

03:37:01.180 --> 03:37:03.700
You know, they never built the rocket around it.

03:37:03.700 --> 03:37:05.700
The N1, which was the, you know,

03:37:05.700 --> 03:37:08.780
the most powerful rocket to have flown so far to date,

03:37:10.020 --> 03:37:13.700
like it never made it through its first stage burn.

03:37:13.700 --> 03:37:15.700
All four attempts failed spectacularly.

03:37:15.700 --> 03:37:18.060
And yet it had so much technology on it

03:37:18.060 --> 03:37:20.660
that was still unrivaled today almost.

03:37:20.660 --> 03:37:22.700
Like finally now we're beating it.

03:37:22.700 --> 03:37:24.940
The NK-33s that they developed for that rocket.

03:37:24.940 --> 03:37:27.580
Like finally today we're to the point

03:37:27.580 --> 03:37:30.740
of like having better engines than they built in the 60s.

03:37:30.740 --> 03:37:32.380
Yeah, what stands out to you

03:37:32.380 --> 03:37:35.780
from the N1 family of rocket engines?

03:37:35.780 --> 03:37:38.220
Well, it's interesting because the N1

03:37:38.220 --> 03:37:40.620
was the Kudsnetsov Design Bureau,

03:37:40.620 --> 03:37:42.580
and he was actually an aircraft manufacturer.

03:37:42.580 --> 03:37:45.300
So he was one of the first people outside of kind of the,

03:37:45.300 --> 03:37:47.020
the missile and rocket program.

03:37:47.020 --> 03:37:49.100
You know, he had all these other big wigs

03:37:49.100 --> 03:37:50.900
kind of in the other OKBs

03:37:50.900 --> 03:37:52.620
that were developing missiles and rockets.

03:37:53.580 --> 03:37:55.700
And then all of a sudden here comes Nikolai Kudsnetsov

03:37:55.700 --> 03:37:59.100
who had never developed a rocket engine.

03:37:59.100 --> 03:38:01.140
And so his first attempt at rocket engines

03:38:01.140 --> 03:38:03.900
was the NK series, NK-15, NK-33.

03:38:03.900 --> 03:38:05.060
And they were amazing.

03:38:05.060 --> 03:38:06.020
They were brilliant.

03:38:06.020 --> 03:38:09.180
They were these wonderful closed cycle oxygen rich engines

03:38:10.220 --> 03:38:11.820
that were awesome.

03:38:11.820 --> 03:38:12.940
They were awesome engines.

03:38:12.940 --> 03:38:15.100
And that were, you know, because,

03:38:16.140 --> 03:38:19.900
I love that because he, his direct boss,

03:38:19.940 --> 03:38:21.860
he wasn't necessarily in the, in the aerospace,

03:38:21.860 --> 03:38:23.340
you know, or in the, I guess,

03:38:23.340 --> 03:38:25.500
the rocket missile defense world.

03:38:25.500 --> 03:38:29.100
He didn't have to, at the fall of the Soviet Union,

03:38:29.100 --> 03:38:31.140
he didn't have to give away all of his things

03:38:31.140 --> 03:38:33.460
to the same people as the other people.

03:38:33.460 --> 03:38:37.340
So he hid, you know, like 80 of his engines in a hanger.

03:38:38.180 --> 03:38:42.340
And then we still literally use them in the United States.

03:38:42.340 --> 03:38:46.180
We used altogether, I think it was like eight or 10 of them,

03:38:46.180 --> 03:38:49.220
repurpose them as they're called AJ-26s in the United States.

03:38:49.380 --> 03:38:51.980
Like we still were flying Soviet rocket engines

03:38:51.980 --> 03:38:54.860
in the 2000s because they were better

03:38:54.860 --> 03:38:57.500
than engines we are building today.

03:38:57.500 --> 03:39:00.740
Like that's, to me, that's my favorite fact

03:39:00.740 --> 03:39:03.420
about the N-1 rocket engines is that they're still

03:39:03.420 --> 03:39:06.460
that good, that they were the best choice for,

03:39:06.460 --> 03:39:08.540
at the time, orbital sciences.

03:39:08.540 --> 03:39:12.460
Some of the culture that engineering has led

03:39:12.460 --> 03:39:15.700
to these things that still work, it's incredible.

03:39:15.700 --> 03:39:18.060
You said that the RD-171 is one

03:39:18.060 --> 03:39:20.740
of the coolest engines ever made, why is that?

03:39:20.740 --> 03:39:24.780
Yeah, so one of the fun things about the Soviet engines

03:39:24.780 --> 03:39:26.420
is it'll look like, a lot of their engines

03:39:26.420 --> 03:39:29.220
look like multiple engines because you see multiple nozzles,

03:39:29.220 --> 03:39:30.540
you see multiple combustion chambers,

03:39:30.540 --> 03:39:32.780
and you would think, well, obviously, you know,

03:39:32.780 --> 03:39:35.420
the nozzle is the engine, right?

03:39:35.420 --> 03:39:39.620
But what they actually would do, the real heart

03:39:39.620 --> 03:39:42.580
and the real power of the rocket engine actually comes

03:39:42.580 --> 03:39:45.460
from the turbo pumps, comes from the pumps themselves.

03:39:45.460 --> 03:39:46.780
And, you know, as we talked about earlier,

03:39:47.100 --> 03:39:50.580
that includes the turbine and the actual pumps

03:39:50.580 --> 03:39:53.340
that flow the propellant into the chambers.

03:39:53.340 --> 03:39:57.020
And so, the Soviet Union was incredible

03:39:57.020 --> 03:39:58.620
at developing these closed-cycle,

03:39:58.620 --> 03:40:00.580
high-powered turbo pumps.

03:40:00.580 --> 03:40:04.020
But if you try to scale the combustion chamber too big,

03:40:04.020 --> 03:40:07.300
you end up with what's called combustion instability.

03:40:07.300 --> 03:40:11.140
You're having, you have such a large surface area

03:40:11.140 --> 03:40:14.980
of crazy flames, you know, and combustion happening,

03:40:14.980 --> 03:40:16.980
they can get these weird pockets and oscillations

03:40:16.980 --> 03:40:19.660
and frequencies, and they just couldn't make

03:40:19.660 --> 03:40:21.420
big combustion chambers, they never figured it out.

03:40:21.420 --> 03:40:23.540
They never quite, well, they did actually kind of figure it

03:40:23.540 --> 03:40:25.700
out, but they didn't like it.

03:40:25.700 --> 03:40:28.140
So they ended up just shrinking down

03:40:28.140 --> 03:40:29.820
and having small combustion chambers

03:40:29.820 --> 03:40:32.140
and just sending, splitting the pipes, basically.

03:40:32.140 --> 03:40:34.660
Instead of one fuel pump going into,

03:40:34.660 --> 03:40:36.980
or one pipe going into one combustion chamber

03:40:36.980 --> 03:40:40.260
and one oxidizer pipe going into one combustion chamber,

03:40:40.260 --> 03:40:42.540
they'd split it off into two or four engine,

03:40:42.540 --> 03:40:44.740
into two or four combustion chambers.

03:40:45.500 --> 03:40:47.420
And it's kind of spread that work around

03:40:47.420 --> 03:40:50.420
so that they didn't experience this combustion instability.

03:40:50.420 --> 03:40:53.100
So the RD-171 is like still to date,

03:40:53.100 --> 03:40:55.900
the most powerful rocket engine ever built.

03:40:55.900 --> 03:40:57.340
The turbo pump is insane.

03:40:57.340 --> 03:40:59.140
I don't even remember how many, you know,

03:40:59.140 --> 03:41:00.940
like 200,000 horsepower or something

03:41:00.940 --> 03:41:02.700
comes out of that turbo pump,

03:41:02.700 --> 03:41:05.020
in order to flow the amount of propellant necessary

03:41:05.020 --> 03:41:06.700
at those rates and at those pressures

03:41:06.700 --> 03:41:07.540
into the combustion chamber.

03:41:07.540 --> 03:41:10.020
So it has four chambers, and it's just,

03:41:10.020 --> 03:41:12.340
it's just an absolute marvel of engineering.

03:41:13.140 --> 03:41:14.180
Yeah, and then the cool thing too,

03:41:14.180 --> 03:41:16.420
is specifically with the RD-171,

03:41:16.420 --> 03:41:18.940
its engine, all four of those nozzles

03:41:18.940 --> 03:41:22.180
can actually pivot and rotate.

03:41:22.180 --> 03:41:25.740
I just now, as I'm explaining this realized,

03:41:25.740 --> 03:41:29.620
that has to mean that they have joints,

03:41:29.620 --> 03:41:34.020
like flexible joints in the high pressure pump lines

03:41:34.020 --> 03:41:36.100
in order to, like I never,

03:41:36.100 --> 03:41:37.900
this is the realization I'm having right now,

03:41:37.900 --> 03:41:41.100
because normally you put the gimbal above the turbo pump,

03:41:41.100 --> 03:41:43.500
like the mount where the engine swivels,

03:41:43.500 --> 03:41:46.060
so that you have low pressure coming from the tanks

03:41:46.060 --> 03:41:47.220
into the pumps.

03:41:47.220 --> 03:41:48.900
And then you just have a straight, you know,

03:41:48.900 --> 03:41:51.060
fixed pipe flowing into the engine.

03:41:51.060 --> 03:41:53.740
So you'd have to bend that pipe and have it be dynamic.

03:41:53.740 --> 03:41:56.140
If they had the four chambers moving

03:41:56.140 --> 03:41:57.900
independently from each other,

03:41:57.900 --> 03:42:00.100
that means those four chambers all had to have

03:42:00.100 --> 03:42:02.300
a flexible high pressure pipe going,

03:42:02.300 --> 03:42:04.940
which I don't even, I don't know if that's,

03:42:04.940 --> 03:42:06.380
why am I just now realizing this?

03:42:06.380 --> 03:42:08.860
Yeah, so there's engineering challenges with that.

03:42:08.860 --> 03:42:10.300
Insane.

03:42:10.300 --> 03:42:11.700
I never even thought that was a thing

03:42:11.700 --> 03:42:13.860
you would ever could do, honestly.

03:42:13.860 --> 03:42:16.220
I would, I got to look into why and how and what.

03:42:16.220 --> 03:42:19.300
Yeah, I wonder why that design decision was made.

03:42:19.300 --> 03:42:21.060
So the easier thing to do normally

03:42:21.060 --> 03:42:23.020
is you would keep those nozzles fixed,

03:42:23.020 --> 03:42:25.380
then a fixed, like say the Soyuz engine,

03:42:25.380 --> 03:42:26.700
the RD107 and 108,

03:42:26.700 --> 03:42:28.940
they have a fixed main combustion chambers

03:42:28.940 --> 03:42:30.940
and they use these little vernier,

03:42:30.940 --> 03:42:33.260
or some people got mad at me for saying vernier

03:42:33.260 --> 03:42:35.940
and verner engines that swivel themselves

03:42:35.940 --> 03:42:38.420
and those provide your control authority.

03:42:38.420 --> 03:42:40.140
So that the main chambers stay fixed

03:42:40.980 --> 03:42:41.820
and then you get your roll and your pitch

03:42:41.820 --> 03:42:44.460
and your yaw out of auxiliary thrusters.

03:42:44.460 --> 03:42:47.140
By the way, did you get anything wrong in that video

03:42:47.140 --> 03:42:48.340
that people told you about?

03:42:48.340 --> 03:42:50.340
Yeah, I had a few things, yep.

03:42:51.260 --> 03:42:53.740
First off, we had a graphic error where we actually,

03:42:53.740 --> 03:42:56.700
we copied and pasted a lot of our like After Effects projects.

03:42:56.700 --> 03:42:59.180
So our nuclear engines, one of them on screen

03:42:59.180 --> 03:43:01.260
says that it runs on RP-1, it does not.

03:43:01.260 --> 03:43:03.060
It has basically all the wrong stats.

03:43:03.060 --> 03:43:04.420
We just didn't catch it in the edit,

03:43:04.420 --> 03:43:06.020
that we literally copy and paste it.

03:43:06.020 --> 03:43:08.580
And I say it right on screen, but the,

03:43:08.620 --> 03:43:11.340
like on the voiceover, but on screen it's wrong.

03:43:11.340 --> 03:43:13.940
The other thing, and I'm excited to ask you about this.

03:43:13.940 --> 03:43:15.740
I watched, and I spoke with a lot

03:43:15.740 --> 03:43:17.380
of Russian speaking individuals.

03:43:17.380 --> 03:43:18.820
We had a lot of research assistants

03:43:18.820 --> 03:43:20.660
that were reading and blah, blah, blah.

03:43:20.660 --> 03:43:23.100
I tried really hard to learn how to pronounce

03:43:23.100 --> 03:43:26.140
Sergei Korolyov's name.

03:43:27.700 --> 03:43:29.340
And I'm still gonna say it wrong no matter what.

03:43:29.340 --> 03:43:33.260
But my understanding, and from listening to native speakers,

03:43:33.260 --> 03:43:37.180
is closer to Korolyov than it is Korolev.

03:43:37.180 --> 03:43:40.700
Yeah, definitely, Sergei Pavlovich Korolyov.

03:43:40.700 --> 03:43:42.380
See, I will never say it that perfectly,

03:43:42.380 --> 03:43:44.180
but I know it's not just Korolev.

03:43:44.180 --> 03:43:47.860
I mean, again, the English translation of it likely,

03:43:47.860 --> 03:43:50.780
I should have just said Korolev and said I'm saying it

03:43:50.780 --> 03:43:53.340
the dumb America way, but.

03:43:53.340 --> 03:43:55.300
But you rolled your R.

03:43:55.300 --> 03:43:56.140
Kumrad.

03:43:58.180 --> 03:44:01.460
Excellent, so let me just ask you

03:44:01.460 --> 03:44:02.860
in a difference in culture,

03:44:02.860 --> 03:44:04.580
because you've researched so many rockets

03:44:04.580 --> 03:44:06.780
from so many different eras, the Saturn V,

03:44:07.380 --> 03:44:09.420
and just everything you're seeing now.

03:44:09.420 --> 03:44:11.540
Are there some interesting differences,

03:44:11.540 --> 03:44:13.580
especially when you look at the space race,

03:44:13.580 --> 03:44:18.580
between the Soviet rocket engineers and efforts

03:44:19.020 --> 03:44:20.580
versus the American?

03:44:23.820 --> 03:44:25.540
The others, I mean, there's definitely

03:44:25.540 --> 03:44:27.380
huge, huge cultural changes.

03:44:27.380 --> 03:44:30.260
And the fun thing is that they kind of spawned

03:44:30.260 --> 03:44:32.860
from the same, they have the same starting place.

03:44:32.860 --> 03:44:36.180
Both the Soviet rocket engines and Americans

03:44:36.180 --> 03:44:40.220
all came from the Nazi V2 rocket and the A4 engine.

03:44:40.220 --> 03:44:42.020
Literally, physically spawned from that,

03:44:42.020 --> 03:44:45.060
because at the fall of, at the end of World War II,

03:44:45.060 --> 03:44:46.780
we took a handful of German scientists,

03:44:46.780 --> 03:44:49.180
and the Soviets took a handful of German scientists,

03:44:49.180 --> 03:44:51.420
and they both got their own a little bit,

03:44:51.420 --> 03:44:52.700
some blueprints here and there,

03:44:52.700 --> 03:44:53.780
and the others got some blueprints.

03:44:53.780 --> 03:44:55.940
So we literally have the same, it's a weird thing,

03:44:55.940 --> 03:44:58.020
where we're starting from the same thing

03:44:58.020 --> 03:45:02.380
and letting two divergent paths go crazy

03:45:02.380 --> 03:45:03.220
on their own development.

03:45:03.220 --> 03:45:05.740
So it's really fun to see the cultural differences.

03:45:05.740 --> 03:45:07.020
One of the things the United States did

03:45:07.020 --> 03:45:10.100
is they really would kind of take an engine

03:45:10.100 --> 03:45:12.940
and just perfect it more or less,

03:45:12.940 --> 03:45:15.620
and then, and not really evolve that much.

03:45:15.620 --> 03:45:18.700
Like they, I don't know, and I don't know why.

03:45:18.700 --> 03:45:20.300
I actually need to do a history lesson

03:45:20.300 --> 03:45:23.060
on all of the US engines, but it's literally like,

03:45:23.060 --> 03:45:26.700
as far as orbital class engines before now,

03:45:26.700 --> 03:45:28.660
I mean, it's like a dozen or two.

03:45:28.660 --> 03:45:32.820
You know, it's a 10th the amount of the Soviets,

03:45:32.820 --> 03:45:35.620
and the Soviets just literally made up a new engine

03:45:36.460 --> 03:45:38.860
every time they had a new, like they wouldn't,

03:45:38.860 --> 03:45:40.900
and it was like a completely different engine.

03:45:40.900 --> 03:45:42.980
So I just, yeah.

03:45:42.980 --> 03:45:44.980
I wonder if there's some aspect to the culture,

03:45:44.980 --> 03:45:46.380
and I don't want to overstate it,

03:45:46.380 --> 03:45:49.100
but there is more of a safety culture,

03:45:49.100 --> 03:45:51.140
I think, in the United States.

03:45:51.140 --> 03:45:53.380
And I think if you care about safety,

03:45:53.380 --> 03:45:58.380
or rather like you have, you're more risk averse,

03:45:59.060 --> 03:46:00.500
so you care about safety more,

03:46:00.500 --> 03:46:03.060
about the value of human life and the risks taken there,

03:46:03.100 --> 03:46:06.380
that you will iterate less.

03:46:06.380 --> 03:46:07.940
So I think the Soviets,

03:46:07.940 --> 03:46:09.980
especially in the early aspects of the program,

03:46:09.980 --> 03:46:12.140
I don't want to overstate this is,

03:46:12.140 --> 03:46:16.660
some of it is just through stories, you just hear anecdotes.

03:46:16.660 --> 03:46:19.700
There are more willing to take risks.

03:46:19.700 --> 03:46:22.300
Risks with human life, risks with spacecraft.

03:46:22.300 --> 03:46:25.820
For example, the first orbital space flights

03:46:25.820 --> 03:46:28.980
from the Soviet Union, the cosmonaut had to eject

03:46:28.980 --> 03:46:31.660
out of the capsule and parachute to a landing.

03:46:31.700 --> 03:46:33.740
That's not very well known,

03:46:33.740 --> 03:46:36.780
and it wasn't, they hid that even from history,

03:46:36.780 --> 03:46:37.700
as best they could at first,

03:46:37.700 --> 03:46:39.220
because they were slightly ashamed

03:46:39.220 --> 03:46:40.780
that they couldn't have a full recovery system

03:46:40.780 --> 03:46:41.940
with their spacecraft.

03:46:41.940 --> 03:46:43.140
They could physically recover it,

03:46:43.140 --> 03:46:44.180
but they wouldn't have been able to recover

03:46:44.180 --> 03:46:46.100
the cosmonaut in one piece.

03:46:46.100 --> 03:46:49.420
So instead they had them just eject out of the thing

03:46:49.420 --> 03:46:52.340
and parachute to safety, like that's insane.

03:46:52.340 --> 03:46:55.740
And so there definitely was some extra risks,

03:46:55.740 --> 03:46:59.380
but also a freedom to just push things to the limits

03:46:59.380 --> 03:47:00.580
and try everything.

03:47:00.580 --> 03:47:03.460
They threw all the spaghetti on the wall.

03:47:03.460 --> 03:47:05.860
It's funny that most people probably don't even know

03:47:05.860 --> 03:47:07.940
the first person in the space in America,

03:47:07.940 --> 03:47:09.820
and obviously everybody knows that.

03:47:13.580 --> 03:47:17.500
It's kind of interesting how the space race,

03:47:17.500 --> 03:47:22.260
and even World War II, even like the history books,

03:47:22.260 --> 03:47:23.940
you ask most Americans,

03:47:24.780 --> 03:47:28.580
they think that America won World War II.

03:47:29.300 --> 03:47:34.300
Without America, the real heroes of World War II

03:47:34.300 --> 03:47:35.140
is America.

03:47:35.140 --> 03:47:37.940
You ask British people, they say,

03:47:37.940 --> 03:47:40.540
and everybody has a pretty good justification,

03:47:40.540 --> 03:47:44.220
like without Britain, without Churchill,

03:47:44.220 --> 03:47:46.260
Hitler would have taken over the world.

03:47:46.260 --> 03:47:49.900
And I think probably the strongest case

03:47:49.900 --> 03:47:51.500
is the Soviet Union case,

03:47:51.500 --> 03:47:53.380
that they're the ones that won the war.

03:47:53.380 --> 03:47:54.780
The reason it's the strongest case

03:47:54.780 --> 03:47:57.340
is where most of the fighting happened.

03:47:57.340 --> 03:47:59.300
Most of the death happened.

03:47:59.300 --> 03:48:00.940
Most of the destruction.

03:48:00.940 --> 03:48:02.660
But everyone has their perspective.

03:48:02.660 --> 03:48:05.180
And certainly in the space race,

03:48:05.180 --> 03:48:07.860
the great accomplishment is the first man on the moon.

03:48:08.780 --> 03:48:09.780
From the US perspective.

03:48:09.780 --> 03:48:10.620
Yeah, I was gonna say.

03:48:10.620 --> 03:48:13.740
And then Yuri Gagarin, from the Russian perspective,

03:48:13.740 --> 03:48:15.300
is the first man in space.

03:48:15.300 --> 03:48:16.900
And that, I think, still persists.

03:48:16.900 --> 03:48:19.500
And some of that, in healthy forms,

03:48:19.500 --> 03:48:22.820
is probably constructive to a little bit of competition

03:48:22.820 --> 03:48:26.300
as pushes all the great scientists on each side.

03:48:26.620 --> 03:48:30.700
What do you think about this Yuri Gagarin mission

03:48:30.700 --> 03:48:32.140
of the first human in space?

03:48:33.020 --> 03:48:35.780
And the Vostok mission in 1961.

03:48:35.780 --> 03:48:38.340
Just in general, when you look back at that time,

03:48:38.340 --> 03:48:42.940
leading to the first man on the moon.

03:48:42.940 --> 03:48:45.260
Yeah, April 12th, 1961.

03:48:45.260 --> 03:48:46.100
Yuri's night, baby.

03:48:46.100 --> 03:48:48.900
That's, yeah, it's insane.

03:48:48.900 --> 03:48:53.420
What's insane to me is the first person in space

03:48:53.420 --> 03:48:54.900
didn't just go to space.

03:48:54.900 --> 03:48:56.740
He went into orbit.

03:48:56.740 --> 03:49:00.900
Yuri Gagarin flew around the earth in orbit and reentered.

03:49:00.900 --> 03:49:04.500
That's a monumental task compared to suborbital.

03:49:04.500 --> 03:49:07.580
So the United States did two suborbital flights

03:49:07.580 --> 03:49:08.420
in that same year.

03:49:08.420 --> 03:49:09.740
I believe in that same year, at least.

03:49:09.740 --> 03:49:11.300
I'm pretty sure in 1961.

03:49:11.300 --> 03:49:14.220
They flew for the first time orbitally in 1962.

03:49:14.220 --> 03:49:15.940
So they weren't terribly far behind

03:49:15.940 --> 03:49:16.860
to get a human into orbit.

03:49:16.860 --> 03:49:19.660
Like in the grand scheme of things, 10 months difference.

03:49:19.660 --> 03:49:21.540
But at the same time, the fact that the Soviet Union

03:49:21.540 --> 03:49:23.860
just went straight to flying someone into orbit

03:49:23.860 --> 03:49:25.540
is monumental.

03:49:25.540 --> 03:49:27.820
And I'm sure they did not do excessive,

03:49:28.700 --> 03:49:30.660
rigorous testing here.

03:49:30.660 --> 03:49:32.260
Because there is a space race

03:49:32.260 --> 03:49:34.780
and you have the first is important.

03:49:34.780 --> 03:49:36.340
Just imagine being Yuri.

03:49:38.100 --> 03:49:39.540
What do you say when they're like launching him

03:49:39.540 --> 03:49:40.900
like, let's go or something?

03:49:40.900 --> 03:49:44.420
Like, I mean, you're taking,

03:49:44.420 --> 03:49:46.020
we're talking about you being on Starship.

03:49:46.020 --> 03:49:48.660
Like you're taking a pretty big risk

03:49:48.660 --> 03:49:52.060
being launched out into orbit.

03:49:52.100 --> 03:49:55.060
Hopefully a lot less risk than what Yuri went through.

03:49:55.060 --> 03:49:57.540
So Yuri, the crazy thing,

03:49:57.540 --> 03:50:00.020
remember those matchsticks we talked about.

03:50:00.020 --> 03:50:03.340
You know, there's 20 main combustion chambers on Soyuz

03:50:03.340 --> 03:50:08.060
and there's four and 12 more Vernier engines

03:50:08.060 --> 03:50:09.500
that all need to be lit.

03:50:09.500 --> 03:50:12.020
So you're sitting on top of this booster

03:50:12.020 --> 03:50:15.060
and they light all of those 32 combustion chambers

03:50:15.060 --> 03:50:16.300
on the ground.

03:50:16.300 --> 03:50:19.260
And then it has this insane separation process

03:50:19.260 --> 03:50:21.460
between what the Soviet Union would call the first stage

03:50:21.460 --> 03:50:22.300
and the second stages,

03:50:22.300 --> 03:50:25.340
but we would call it like the core stage and the boosters.

03:50:25.340 --> 03:50:28.460
They all, four of these boosters have to peel away perfectly

03:50:28.460 --> 03:50:30.980
from the core stage simultaneously.

03:50:30.980 --> 03:50:33.540
You know, if one of them sticks on, mission failed.

03:50:33.540 --> 03:50:35.780
If one of them doesn't eject properly

03:50:35.780 --> 03:50:39.420
and drags into the other tank, you know, it's a goner.

03:50:39.420 --> 03:50:43.780
So the staging process of the Soyuz is insane to me

03:50:43.780 --> 03:50:46.820
that that ended up working out.

03:50:46.820 --> 03:50:50.500
I was just, the technology in Soyuz,

03:50:50.500 --> 03:50:52.980
I mean, more or less that same rocket

03:50:52.980 --> 03:50:55.660
is what's still flying humans

03:50:56.660 --> 03:50:59.340
that are cosmonauts from Roscosmos

03:50:59.340 --> 03:51:01.180
and going to the International Space Station

03:51:01.180 --> 03:51:04.060
are flying on a variant of that Soyuz rocket still today.

03:51:04.060 --> 03:51:07.900
It's still like that big of a workhorse.

03:51:07.900 --> 03:51:11.980
What do you think about Roscosmos as it stands today,

03:51:11.980 --> 03:51:13.620
its history and its future

03:51:14.800 --> 03:51:19.500
in comparison to NASA and other national efforts

03:51:19.540 --> 03:51:21.980
and in comparison to commercial space flight?

03:51:21.980 --> 03:51:23.100
Yeah.

03:51:23.100 --> 03:51:25.780
I mean, utmost respect for the engineers involved

03:51:25.780 --> 03:51:27.140
and everything that's happened.

03:51:27.140 --> 03:51:29.420
I think Energomosh is like still some of the,

03:51:29.420 --> 03:51:31.660
one of the greatest engine manufacturers

03:51:31.660 --> 03:51:33.140
when they have the funding to do so,

03:51:33.140 --> 03:51:36.700
but man, it seems like they're falling from grace

03:51:36.700 --> 03:51:38.540
as far as space prowess.

03:51:38.540 --> 03:51:41.700
You know, the Roscosmos went from having,

03:51:41.700 --> 03:51:43.380
I think they got very comfortable at the top of,

03:51:43.380 --> 03:51:47.820
you know, from 2011 until 2022 or until 2020,

03:51:47.820 --> 03:51:50.860
they were the only ride to the International Space Station

03:51:50.860 --> 03:51:51.700
since then.

03:51:51.700 --> 03:51:54.620
Like it started, I feel like in 2018,

03:51:54.620 --> 03:51:56.340
honestly, I think that's kind of when things,

03:51:56.340 --> 03:51:58.220
that's the first time I specifically remember

03:51:58.220 --> 03:52:01.260
a pretty nasty like thing happened in 2018.

03:52:01.260 --> 03:52:03.560
I think it was a Soyuz mission

03:52:03.560 --> 03:52:04.700
to the International Space Station,

03:52:04.700 --> 03:52:06.660
had one of the boosters not detached

03:52:06.660 --> 03:52:09.260
and had to have an abort, but you know,

03:52:09.260 --> 03:52:12.340
that happened then all of a sudden next thing you know,

03:52:12.340 --> 03:52:14.540
there's a Progress being docked to the ISS

03:52:14.540 --> 03:52:16.260
a couple of years ago that spun the ISS,

03:52:16.300 --> 03:52:18.220
cartwheeled the ISS out of control,

03:52:18.220 --> 03:52:20.380
followed a few months later, the Pirs module

03:52:20.380 --> 03:52:22.260
docked to the International Space Station,

03:52:22.260 --> 03:52:24.300
spirals the International Space Station out of control

03:52:24.300 --> 03:52:27.380
again with like a thruster getting fixed on.

03:52:27.380 --> 03:52:31.700
There was a hole in the Russian segment.

03:52:31.700 --> 03:52:33.860
There's, well, I think the most recent one right now,

03:52:33.860 --> 03:52:36.740
there's a Soyuz dock to the ISS that has a puncture in it

03:52:36.740 --> 03:52:38.540
and it's leaking coolant

03:52:38.540 --> 03:52:41.020
and will not be returning humans on it.

03:52:41.020 --> 03:52:43.940
So they're actually having to fly up and uncrewed Soyuz.

03:52:43.940 --> 03:52:46.380
And that one likely wasn't a manufacturing error.

03:52:46.380 --> 03:52:48.580
It probably was like a micrometeorite puncture

03:52:48.580 --> 03:52:50.180
rendering spacecraft unusable.

03:52:50.180 --> 03:52:51.540
We don't know for sure yet,

03:52:52.500 --> 03:52:54.940
but it's just really been like this fall from grace

03:52:54.940 --> 03:52:58.700
where they have all the potential.

03:52:58.700 --> 03:52:59.740
They have some of the best engines,

03:52:59.740 --> 03:53:01.500
some of the best rockets,

03:53:01.500 --> 03:53:04.500
and especially like right before the collapse

03:53:04.500 --> 03:53:07.340
of the Soviet Union, the Braun shuttle

03:53:07.340 --> 03:53:10.140
and the Energia rocket were incredible.

03:53:10.140 --> 03:53:12.300
Had they been able to evolve that into Braun II

03:53:12.300 --> 03:53:13.860
and the reusable Energia,

03:53:14.740 --> 03:53:16.980
they had a fully reusable Energia on the drawing board.

03:53:16.980 --> 03:53:20.900
And like, I honestly fully think they could have done it.

03:53:20.900 --> 03:53:22.740
Is it possible to return to a place

03:53:22.740 --> 03:53:25.100
where there is friendly competition between nations

03:53:25.100 --> 03:53:30.100
that ultimately unites and inspires the peoples

03:53:30.340 --> 03:53:33.180
of these different worlds, these very different worlds

03:53:33.180 --> 03:53:36.700
that have especially recently come to conflict

03:53:36.700 --> 03:53:38.540
over the war in Ukraine.

03:53:38.540 --> 03:53:43.180
The tension builds, the war, the conflict, the suffering

03:53:43.220 --> 03:53:45.740
is actually creating more and more division,

03:53:45.740 --> 03:53:47.300
creating more and more hate.

03:53:47.300 --> 03:53:48.620
I think as we've talked about,

03:53:48.620 --> 03:53:50.420
I think science and engineering,

03:53:50.420 --> 03:53:52.780
and especially the most epic version of engineering,

03:53:52.780 --> 03:53:57.260
which is rocketry and space travel, unites people.

03:53:57.260 --> 03:54:01.260
Unites people even in a time of tension, conflict, and war.

03:54:01.260 --> 03:54:05.380
So do you have a hope that we can return to that place?

03:54:06.300 --> 03:54:09.540
I think historically, space flight has been

03:54:09.540 --> 03:54:11.540
one of the most bonding things.

03:54:12.500 --> 03:54:15.460
We have countless examples of Cold War enemies

03:54:15.460 --> 03:54:18.460
coming together and working together, lending a hand.

03:54:19.380 --> 03:54:21.580
Apollo 13, for example, of course,

03:54:21.580 --> 03:54:23.260
there is the potential that,

03:54:23.260 --> 03:54:24.620
who knew where it was gonna reenter

03:54:24.620 --> 03:54:27.060
since it was not in the planned trajectory at all

03:54:27.060 --> 03:54:28.340
for reentry.

03:54:28.340 --> 03:54:29.380
And the Soviet Union said,

03:54:29.380 --> 03:54:33.540
hey, wherever they land, we'll help you guys out, basically.

03:54:33.540 --> 03:54:37.220
And that was a pretty big thing at the time, obviously.

03:54:37.220 --> 03:54:40.580
We also in 1975 saw the Apollo-Soyuz mission,

03:54:40.620 --> 03:54:42.500
which was an Apollo spacecraft docking

03:54:42.500 --> 03:54:44.540
with the Soyuz spacecraft.

03:54:44.540 --> 03:54:46.740
First time there's international collaboration.

03:54:46.740 --> 03:54:51.420
And again, 1975 still very amidst the Cold War,

03:54:51.420 --> 03:54:53.420
yet we have this collaboration

03:54:53.420 --> 03:54:56.340
that I don't know what else could have done that.

03:54:56.340 --> 03:54:58.580
I mean, and think about what it actually takes to do that.

03:54:58.580 --> 03:55:00.980
You have to come up with a docking module

03:55:00.980 --> 03:55:04.860
that takes the two different air environments

03:55:04.860 --> 03:55:06.220
and the two different docking systems

03:55:06.220 --> 03:55:08.740
and talk to the engineers and mission planners

03:55:08.740 --> 03:55:10.820
and figure out, you know, train together.

03:55:10.820 --> 03:55:13.340
The cosmonauts and the astronauts trained together

03:55:13.340 --> 03:55:14.180
and got to know each other.

03:55:14.180 --> 03:55:16.460
They were crossing boundaries and borders

03:55:16.460 --> 03:55:17.900
and coming together for this mission.

03:55:17.900 --> 03:55:20.340
And even if it was totally a fluff piece,

03:55:20.340 --> 03:55:23.220
like even if it was totally this like, you know,

03:55:23.220 --> 03:55:27.180
cynical, you know, just trying to make a pretty face

03:55:27.180 --> 03:55:29.660
for everybody, even for the cameras or something,

03:55:29.660 --> 03:55:31.500
obviously it still had an impact.

03:55:31.500 --> 03:55:33.620
Yeah, the symbolic impact.

03:55:33.620 --> 03:55:35.060
But there's also the practical impact.

03:55:35.060 --> 03:55:37.220
I mean, a lot of people have to work together.

03:55:37.220 --> 03:55:38.060
Yes.

03:55:38.060 --> 03:55:40.500
And that has a ripple effect on the culture

03:55:40.500 --> 03:55:41.940
of the different engineers.

03:55:43.580 --> 03:55:44.460
Yeah. 100%.

03:55:44.460 --> 03:55:47.020
And even just the astronauts and cosmonauts involved,

03:55:47.020 --> 03:55:50.140
like think about what probably went through their heads

03:55:50.140 --> 03:55:52.140
during this process of like going from,

03:55:52.140 --> 03:55:53.980
oh my God, I'm gonna have to work with them

03:55:53.980 --> 03:55:57.940
to getting to know them and then sharing meals in space.

03:55:57.940 --> 03:56:01.700
Like that's a crazy transformation of timelines.

03:56:01.700 --> 03:56:04.940
And I would love, I do think that Spaceflight

03:56:04.940 --> 03:56:07.180
has the ability to bond us and unite us

03:56:07.180 --> 03:56:09.220
because it is ultimately, you know,

03:56:09.220 --> 03:56:12.580
this little tiny little planet we're floating around on,

03:56:12.580 --> 03:56:15.380
you know, it is the boundary that we all share.

03:56:15.380 --> 03:56:19.020
You know, it only takes you getting off this planet

03:56:19.020 --> 03:56:21.420
to realize, oh my God, we're all neighbors.

03:56:21.420 --> 03:56:23.700
We're all living in the same house together.

03:56:23.700 --> 03:56:26.820
And I do think ultimately, you know,

03:56:26.820 --> 03:56:29.540
as we continue to expand our horizons

03:56:29.540 --> 03:56:30.580
and expand our exploration,

03:56:30.580 --> 03:56:33.580
that it has the potential to unite us more

03:56:33.580 --> 03:56:36.020
than it has the potential to divide us.

03:56:36.020 --> 03:56:40.300
So one of the potential conflicts of the 21st century

03:56:40.300 --> 03:56:44.060
that I think everyone wants to avoid,

03:56:44.060 --> 03:56:46.700
both in the cyberspace and in the hot war space,

03:56:46.700 --> 03:56:48.980
Cold War, hot war, all kinds of war,

03:56:48.980 --> 03:56:51.380
all kinds of economic conflict

03:56:51.380 --> 03:56:53.620
is between the United States and China.

03:56:54.780 --> 03:56:58.700
So China is going full steam ahead

03:56:58.700 --> 03:57:00.700
in developing a space program,

03:57:00.700 --> 03:57:02.780
doing a lot of incredible work.

03:57:02.780 --> 03:57:07.780
Like you mentioned, 64 launches in 2022 with two failures,

03:57:09.220 --> 03:57:12.380
but, you know, moving straight ahead.

03:57:12.380 --> 03:57:14.580
And by the way, those failures, we had a lot of startups.

03:57:14.580 --> 03:57:17.100
Like a lot of the launches were from brand new companies.

03:57:17.100 --> 03:57:19.620
So to have two failures out of 64,

03:57:19.620 --> 03:57:20.980
I mean, that's still,

03:57:20.980 --> 03:57:23.820
if you look at operational launches, it was flawless.

03:57:24.780 --> 03:57:28.740
Do you see a pathway where there's again,

03:57:28.740 --> 03:57:32.940
in that same way, collaboration or friendly competition

03:57:32.940 --> 03:57:37.260
between all the different companies and nations

03:57:37.260 --> 03:57:40.500
in the United States and China in the next,

03:57:40.500 --> 03:57:45.500
as we push towards the moon, Mars and beyond?

03:57:45.740 --> 03:57:49.500
I held a dumb hope that China would actually be allowed

03:57:49.500 --> 03:57:51.260
to sign onto the Artemis Accord

03:57:51.260 --> 03:57:55.180
to be able to take part in this next step towards the moon.

03:57:55.180 --> 03:57:58.500
I mean, just imagine if like, if they provided a, you know,

03:57:58.500 --> 03:58:00.340
a propulsion module or a land or something,

03:58:00.340 --> 03:58:02.740
and we actually came together to land on the moon

03:58:02.740 --> 03:58:04.740
instead of having another space race, you know,

03:58:04.740 --> 03:58:06.900
it's like, it would have been so cool.

03:58:06.900 --> 03:58:11.900
And yeah, I still am hopeful that similar

03:58:11.900 --> 03:58:14.340
to back in the Cold War,

03:58:14.340 --> 03:58:16.660
that we might have something like that someday

03:58:16.660 --> 03:58:18.540
where we actually are collaborating.

03:58:18.540 --> 03:58:20.660
And it feels like sometimes we're really close to that.

03:58:20.660 --> 03:58:22.980
And then other times it feels like we're really far

03:58:22.980 --> 03:58:23.820
from that.

03:58:23.820 --> 03:58:25.940
It just sucks because I know, and you know,

03:58:25.940 --> 03:58:28.740
I try really hard on my channel to always separate

03:58:28.740 --> 03:58:30.740
and celebrate the work being done, you know,

03:58:30.740 --> 03:58:31.580
because at the end of the day,

03:58:31.580 --> 03:58:34.740
there's someone that's just going home to their family,

03:58:34.740 --> 03:58:36.340
clocking in hours, working really hard

03:58:36.340 --> 03:58:39.980
on pushing their program and doing engineering work,

03:58:39.980 --> 03:58:43.300
you know, and it's, we don't get to choose where we're born

03:58:43.300 --> 03:58:45.140
and what we're born into.

03:58:45.140 --> 03:58:47.700
So I really like to avoid, you know,

03:58:47.700 --> 03:58:50.260
the political aspects of things and the geopolitical aspects

03:58:50.260 --> 03:58:53.500
and just appreciate the science and the science we're seeing

03:58:53.500 --> 03:58:57.300
and the progress that China's doing in the last 10 years

03:58:57.300 --> 03:59:00.780
is very akin to the, you know, early space flight programs

03:59:00.780 --> 03:59:03.660
and with the runway of like, just keep on going.

03:59:03.660 --> 03:59:06.140
Like I see no reason for them to be slowing down.

03:59:06.140 --> 03:59:07.980
So it's definitely something to watch

03:59:07.980 --> 03:59:10.780
and be interested in and who knows?

03:59:10.780 --> 03:59:13.580
I mean, there really genuinely might be a race

03:59:13.580 --> 03:59:15.340
to the moon again, and there really genuinely

03:59:15.340 --> 03:59:16.660
might be a race to Mars.

03:59:18.500 --> 03:59:20.780
The part of me is excited about that

03:59:20.780 --> 03:59:23.180
because a race is pretty cool.

03:59:23.180 --> 03:59:24.020
Yeah.

03:59:25.020 --> 03:59:28.900
But hopefully it's friendly competition

03:59:28.900 --> 03:59:30.460
and some collaboration.

03:59:30.460 --> 03:59:34.500
It is true that maybe I'm being a bit cynical,

03:59:34.500 --> 03:59:37.940
but nations, sometimes the governments

03:59:37.940 --> 03:59:40.900
and leaders of those governments sometimes ruin things.

03:59:40.900 --> 03:59:44.660
Like you don't often have, statistically speaking,

03:59:44.660 --> 03:59:46.940
it's harder to have a leader of a nation

03:59:46.940 --> 03:59:49.860
that looks beyond the political,

03:59:49.900 --> 03:59:53.300
the particular political bickering of that nation.

03:59:53.300 --> 03:59:55.060
And you have like a JFK type character

03:59:55.060 --> 03:59:56.820
that really steps up and inspires.

03:59:56.820 --> 03:59:58.460
I think statistically speaking,

03:59:58.460 --> 04:00:00.220
it's better to have somebody like Elon,

04:00:00.220 --> 04:00:03.140
who's a leader of a company, a commercial effort

04:00:03.140 --> 04:00:05.980
that is able to look beyond the borders of nations

04:00:05.980 --> 04:00:10.100
and certainly inspiring educators like yourself

04:00:11.020 --> 04:00:14.380
to look beyond the borders of those nations

04:00:14.380 --> 04:00:16.540
and the geopolitical conflicts and so on

04:00:17.020 --> 04:00:19.820
to inspire people.

04:00:19.820 --> 04:00:22.180
I think that's just made so much easier.

04:00:22.180 --> 04:00:24.660
Like you can have more reach.

04:00:26.300 --> 04:00:29.300
Tim Nod can have more reach than NASA, right?

04:00:29.300 --> 04:00:31.900
Like in terms of inspiring the world,

04:00:31.900 --> 04:00:33.100
and that's fascinating.

04:00:33.100 --> 04:00:35.740
Like that gives power to the individuals

04:00:35.740 --> 04:00:40.740
that see past the silly short-term geopolitical conflicts.

04:00:41.460 --> 04:00:42.780
That's the hope, at least.

04:00:42.780 --> 04:00:44.740
Yeah, yeah.

04:00:44.740 --> 04:00:48.780
Do you worry that there might be a war in space?

04:00:48.780 --> 04:00:49.820
Yeah.

04:00:49.820 --> 04:00:50.980
Let's look out into the future.

04:00:50.980 --> 04:00:53.780
So forget, so the interesting thing

04:00:53.780 --> 04:00:54.900
about these rockets, right?

04:00:54.900 --> 04:00:59.500
Let's not forget rockets do what rockets do,

04:00:59.500 --> 04:01:03.460
that they can carry payloads that can be weapons.

04:01:05.700 --> 04:01:06.980
Do you worry about this?

04:01:07.900 --> 04:01:11.740
I worry most about space wars

04:01:11.740 --> 04:01:14.140
as leading to the Kessler syndrome

04:01:14.140 --> 04:01:17.660
of having a cascading effect of like a spacecraft

04:01:17.660 --> 04:01:20.060
blowing up and then affecting another spacecraft

04:01:20.060 --> 04:01:22.460
and that blows up and then all of a sudden you're trapped

04:01:22.460 --> 04:01:25.540
and have this debris cloud that we can't go,

04:01:25.540 --> 04:01:26.820
we can't go into space anymore.

04:01:26.820 --> 04:01:28.220
Like that's my biggest,

04:01:28.220 --> 04:01:30.300
because frankly at this point we could annihilate ourselves

04:01:30.300 --> 04:01:32.740
with terrestrial stuff anyway, you know what I mean?

04:01:32.740 --> 04:01:37.300
We don't need space to end society as we know it.

04:01:37.300 --> 04:01:38.140
You know what I mean?

04:01:38.140 --> 04:01:39.020
Yeah.

04:01:39.020 --> 04:01:43.540
But we could really, and the good thing is

04:01:43.540 --> 04:01:46.220
I think everyone, well, mostly everyone seems

04:01:46.220 --> 04:01:47.340
to understand this for the most part,

04:01:47.340 --> 04:01:50.740
that like we really can't be risking

04:01:50.740 --> 04:01:53.220
blowing up stuff in space in low earth orbit

04:01:53.220 --> 04:01:55.340
because it could easily,

04:01:55.340 --> 04:01:57.380
like we could strain ourselves from space assets

04:01:57.380 --> 04:01:59.340
for 50 years if-

04:01:59.340 --> 04:02:00.700
Oh, can you elaborate on that?

04:02:00.700 --> 04:02:02.980
So like what is the danger of the debris there

04:02:02.980 --> 04:02:06.580
that could jeopardize space?

04:02:06.580 --> 04:02:09.300
So for instance, and it was only a couple of years ago,

04:02:09.300 --> 04:02:13.300
Russia did an anti-satellite test on an orbital.

04:02:14.100 --> 04:02:15.820
We've done this too, the US has done this.

04:02:15.820 --> 04:02:19.820
I'm not pinning it on them, but we kind of know nowadays

04:02:19.820 --> 04:02:22.620
don't do anti-satellite tests on orbital things

04:02:22.620 --> 04:02:24.700
because those things stay in orbit.

04:02:24.700 --> 04:02:27.940
When you blow something up in space, it's not like,

04:02:27.940 --> 04:02:31.660
people think in space, like, oh, you throw something,

04:02:31.660 --> 04:02:34.020
it's just gonna keep going forever and ever and ever.

04:02:34.020 --> 04:02:37.940
I mean, in the sense that it's not going to be slowed down

04:02:37.940 --> 04:02:41.500
due to air resistance, it's going to continue to do that,

04:02:41.500 --> 04:02:42.980
but it's staying in orbit around the earth.

04:02:42.980 --> 04:02:45.860
Like you just slightly change the orbit of it around earth

04:02:45.860 --> 04:02:48.660
when you throw a ball or something, you know?

04:02:48.660 --> 04:02:53.060
So the scary thing is when you blow up a satellite,

04:02:53.060 --> 04:02:54.660
all those pieces of that satellite

04:02:54.660 --> 04:02:59.660
are now millions of bullets in a halo around the earth,

04:03:00.900 --> 04:03:02.820
in a very specific halo, you know?

04:03:02.820 --> 04:03:06.820
So some things get blown up faster, you know,

04:03:06.820 --> 04:03:08.140
according to its orbit, faster,

04:03:08.140 --> 04:03:10.220
so they'll go a little bit higher elliptically.

04:03:10.260 --> 04:03:12.380
Some things will get slowed down in that explosion

04:03:12.380 --> 04:03:13.500
and actually re-enter.

04:03:13.500 --> 04:03:14.860
Some things will go sideways

04:03:14.860 --> 04:03:16.460
and change its inclination of that orbit.

04:03:16.460 --> 04:03:18.020
So you have this debris field,

04:03:18.020 --> 04:03:22.540
but it more or less becomes a band of like, no, no,

04:03:22.540 --> 04:03:27.100
you know, like a big, scary, sharp, scary bullets

04:03:27.100 --> 04:03:28.940
that can destroy another spacecraft.

04:03:28.940 --> 04:03:30.780
And so then all of a sudden, especially now star-linking,

04:03:30.780 --> 04:03:32.340
we're talking about thousands and thousands

04:03:32.340 --> 04:03:34.580
and thousands of satellites in space,

04:03:34.580 --> 04:03:36.620
if all of a sudden one, you know,

04:03:36.620 --> 04:03:39.220
a couple of them crash and, you know, blow up

04:03:39.220 --> 04:03:40.940
and obviously you have all the shrapnel going everywhere

04:03:40.940 --> 04:03:42.580
and then that hits another satellite,

04:03:42.580 --> 04:03:43.420
that creates shrapnel.

04:03:43.420 --> 04:03:47.020
You can literally blanket our entire low earth orbit

04:03:47.020 --> 04:03:50.660
in 17,500 mile an hour bullets.

04:03:52.140 --> 04:03:52.980
You know, we're talking,

04:03:52.980 --> 04:03:57.300
the kinetic energy in this is so hard for people to fathom

04:03:57.300 --> 04:03:59.460
because that's over 10 times faster

04:03:59.460 --> 04:04:01.140
than most like rifle bullets.

04:04:01.140 --> 04:04:05.100
And even like a big 50 cal is not gonna be, you know,

04:04:05.100 --> 04:04:08.140
we're still talking about about 10% that.

04:04:08.140 --> 04:04:10.700
So when you think about the kinetic energy, it's insane.

04:04:10.700 --> 04:04:14.740
So a fleck of paint can go through panes of glass

04:04:15.620 --> 04:04:17.060
at that velocity.

04:04:17.060 --> 04:04:19.580
You know, a little piece of metal can puncture,

04:04:19.580 --> 04:04:21.940
you know, blow straight through.

04:04:21.940 --> 04:04:26.580
So like, so our actions that seem small,

04:04:26.580 --> 04:04:30.540
so small scale military actions can have,

04:04:31.980 --> 04:04:34.380
can have dire detrimental effects

04:04:34.380 --> 04:04:37.300
to the whole space program, like global space program.

04:04:37.340 --> 04:04:40.220
Oh yeah, that can affect everything and everyone.

04:04:40.220 --> 04:04:42.940
Including the like, including satellites.

04:04:42.940 --> 04:04:44.660
Oh yeah, especially satellites.

04:04:44.660 --> 04:04:47.660
Like that's the one, I mean, the good and the bad thing is,

04:04:47.660 --> 04:04:50.300
the good thing is a lot of satellites don't operate

04:04:50.300 --> 04:04:51.300
in low earth orbit.

04:04:51.300 --> 04:04:53.860
Like a lot of the ones that we use day to day,

04:04:53.860 --> 04:04:56.620
a lot of them are in medium earth orbit,

04:04:56.620 --> 04:04:59.460
like if they're GPS or they're geostationary,

04:04:59.460 --> 04:05:01.540
which are way, way, way out there.

04:05:01.540 --> 04:05:05.540
And because of that, they won't really ever deorbit

04:05:05.540 --> 04:05:08.020
like it'll take, you know, millennia to deorbit

04:05:08.020 --> 04:05:10.220
because, you know, just because something's in space

04:05:10.220 --> 04:05:11.380
doesn't mean it's there forever,

04:05:11.380 --> 04:05:13.100
especially like in low earth orbit.

04:05:13.100 --> 04:05:14.740
The atmosphere doesn't just suddenly stop.

04:05:14.740 --> 04:05:17.260
It's not like you hit the Karman line 100 kilometers

04:05:17.260 --> 04:05:18.620
and all of a sudden there's zero atmosphere.

04:05:18.620 --> 04:05:20.060
The atmosphere just slowly tapers.

04:05:20.060 --> 04:05:21.580
You know, you can experience that yourself

04:05:21.580 --> 04:05:22.420
as you climb a mountain,

04:05:22.420 --> 04:05:24.660
you slowly realize there's less and less air.

04:05:24.660 --> 04:05:26.100
You just keep going.

04:05:26.100 --> 04:05:29.580
And just because you're in space 200, 300 kilometers up,

04:05:29.580 --> 04:05:31.540
there's still trace molecules.

04:05:31.540 --> 04:05:34.020
You know, there's the occasional oxygen molecule.

04:05:34.020 --> 04:05:35.900
There's the occasional nitrogen molecule.

04:05:35.900 --> 04:05:37.300
And so that is actually drag.

04:05:37.300 --> 04:05:39.820
So as a spacecraft in low earth orbit,

04:05:39.820 --> 04:05:41.940
depending on its altitude will take anywhere

04:05:41.940 --> 04:05:45.620
from five years to five months to deorbit,

04:05:45.620 --> 04:05:47.340
you know, or two months or one month,

04:05:47.340 --> 04:05:49.900
like depending on its orbit or its altitude,

04:05:49.900 --> 04:05:51.500
we'll have some parasitic drag still

04:05:51.500 --> 04:05:54.060
and slowly throughout time slow down,

04:05:54.060 --> 04:05:57.100
which lowers its orbit, which drags it down more,

04:05:57.100 --> 04:05:58.620
lowers its orbit and et cetera, et cetera,

04:05:58.620 --> 04:06:00.220
until it reenters.

04:06:00.260 --> 04:06:04.620
So if we end up with some kind of catastrophic event

04:06:04.620 --> 04:06:06.860
where the entire low earth orbit

04:06:06.860 --> 04:06:09.180
has been inundated and blown up,

04:06:09.180 --> 04:06:12.860
it'll take months for the first band to clear up.

04:06:12.860 --> 04:06:14.820
It'll take years for something like beyond.

04:06:14.820 --> 04:06:15.660
There's charts, you know,

04:06:15.660 --> 04:06:17.740
people have all this stuff available.

04:06:17.740 --> 04:06:18.580
You shouldn't look it up.

04:06:18.580 --> 04:06:20.700
This is terrifying by the way.

04:06:20.700 --> 04:06:25.420
But again, the caveat is for the most part,

04:06:25.420 --> 04:06:28.700
the low earth orbit stuff would clear up within years.

04:06:28.700 --> 04:06:30.500
So we could get back to doing some more with it.

04:06:30.500 --> 04:06:33.260
Like Starlink stuff would probably be able to be re

04:06:33.260 --> 04:06:35.060
and you know, we could kind of redo it

04:06:35.060 --> 04:06:37.220
and build up from the ground up again.

04:06:37.220 --> 04:06:38.580
GPS wouldn't be wiped out

04:06:38.580 --> 04:06:40.260
and our geostationary satellites wouldn't be wiped out.

04:06:40.260 --> 04:06:42.620
But the scary thing is we wouldn't be able to relaunch

04:06:42.620 --> 04:06:45.100
and replace new things because we're stuck.

04:06:45.100 --> 04:06:47.820
We're not gonna fly through that debris field, you know.

04:06:48.940 --> 04:06:52.700
And we avoid that by avoiding military actions in space.

04:06:52.700 --> 04:06:57.020
And these days, like there's more and more requirements

04:06:57.140 --> 04:06:59.300
and legislation and especially trying

04:06:59.300 --> 04:07:00.500
to get international collaboration

04:07:00.500 --> 04:07:03.020
on having end of life plans for satellites.

04:07:03.020 --> 04:07:05.580
So that satellites, especially those in low earth orbit

04:07:05.580 --> 04:07:07.540
have like drag devices to increase them.

04:07:07.540 --> 04:07:08.940
Once they're done, they literally pull like

04:07:08.940 --> 04:07:11.340
even just a ribbon, like a silly little

04:07:11.340 --> 04:07:14.340
like, you know, 40 foot long ribbon will sit there

04:07:14.340 --> 04:07:18.380
and it'll slowly, it can speed up its reentry process

04:07:18.380 --> 04:07:20.540
by months or years or whatever.

04:07:20.540 --> 04:07:22.820
So we're starting to see that this is now an importance.

04:07:22.820 --> 04:07:25.620
There's a really cool company called Stoke Aerospace

04:07:25.660 --> 04:07:28.740
out in Washington is one of these launch providers

04:07:28.740 --> 04:07:30.340
that's really looking not into just trying

04:07:30.340 --> 04:07:32.740
to be the next, you know, SpaceX launch company.

04:07:32.740 --> 04:07:35.900
They're really seeing satellite bringing stuff down

04:07:35.900 --> 04:07:39.220
from space as actually being, especially right now

04:07:39.220 --> 04:07:41.780
we have all of these hundreds and thousands

04:07:41.780 --> 04:07:43.580
of satellites being launched every year.

04:07:43.580 --> 04:07:45.220
Someone at some point is probably gonna have

04:07:45.220 --> 04:07:46.140
to do some cleanup.

04:07:47.100 --> 04:07:48.620
And so they're looking at being one

04:07:48.620 --> 04:07:50.100
of those companies to do that.

04:07:50.100 --> 04:07:52.620
Well, what do you think about Starlink

04:07:52.620 --> 04:07:56.620
and the efforts of Starlink to put a very large number

04:07:56.620 --> 04:08:01.620
of satellites out there and provide internet access

04:08:02.340 --> 04:08:06.260
to anyone?

04:08:06.260 --> 04:08:09.620
Generally, I think Starlink is phenomenal.

04:08:09.620 --> 04:08:11.860
And I would be saying this if it was any company

04:08:11.860 --> 04:08:13.260
I wanna make that clear that people think

04:08:13.260 --> 04:08:15.380
I'm just some, you know, SpaceX fan boy or something

04:08:15.380 --> 04:08:16.700
and anything they do is perfect.

04:08:16.700 --> 04:08:19.540
I think as your fan, I could say you're basically

04:08:20.300 --> 04:08:23.460
a fan boy or just a fan of everybody

04:08:23.460 --> 04:08:24.980
that's doing space stuff.

04:08:24.980 --> 04:08:27.980
And I don't, like, even in this whole conversation

04:08:27.980 --> 04:08:30.380
there's no way we cover like 10% of what I wanted

04:08:30.380 --> 04:08:32.300
to talk to you about so we're jumping around.

04:08:32.300 --> 04:08:35.340
I mean, there's, we could talk probably for an hour

04:08:35.340 --> 04:08:39.580
about Artemis, we could talk about anything

04:08:39.580 --> 04:08:43.500
with ULA, obviously all the other commercial efforts.

04:08:43.500 --> 04:08:45.820
We could talk about the NASA efforts that, you know,

04:08:46.700 --> 04:08:49.540
I mean, and Saturn fight, like, are we gonna really go

04:08:49.540 --> 04:08:51.500
with this conversation, not talk about Saturn fight?

04:08:51.500 --> 04:08:53.020
And we might, okay?

04:08:53.020 --> 04:08:55.860
So like, anyway, if you're a fan of everything,

04:08:55.860 --> 04:08:59.620
Starlink is in general exciting to you.

04:08:59.620 --> 04:09:02.460
And not for the space assets but just the potential

04:09:02.460 --> 04:09:03.300
for humanity.

04:09:03.300 --> 04:09:06.780
Like, I really think even as a consumer of the internet

04:09:06.780 --> 04:09:09.540
personally, our studio space down in Texas,

04:09:09.540 --> 04:09:12.580
we're stuck with MediaCom which has, like,

04:09:12.580 --> 04:09:15.140
the least reliable internet service, period.

04:09:15.140 --> 04:09:15.980
That's the only option.

04:09:15.980 --> 04:09:18.620
Either that or they're trying to charge me like $20,000

04:09:18.620 --> 04:09:21.140
to run a fiber optic cable like a thousand meters

04:09:21.140 --> 04:09:21.980
or something.

04:09:21.980 --> 04:09:23.340
Like, it's insane.

04:09:23.340 --> 04:09:24.780
I'm not going to do that.

04:09:24.780 --> 04:09:26.140
I bought Starlink.

04:09:26.140 --> 04:09:29.100
It helps but it's still not, you know, amazing.

04:09:29.100 --> 04:09:30.580
But it has, you can see where this is going

04:09:30.580 --> 04:09:32.300
in a year, two, three, five years.

04:09:32.300 --> 04:09:35.020
Like, oh, I can totally screw this other internet provider

04:09:35.020 --> 04:09:37.820
and this is now by far the best option.

04:09:37.820 --> 04:09:39.500
And it's available literally anywhere.

04:09:39.500 --> 04:09:42.180
You don't have to be limited to your internet,

04:09:42.180 --> 04:09:44.620
local internet service provider.

04:09:45.180 --> 04:09:47.100
On the global scale, of course, you have, you know,

04:09:47.100 --> 04:09:50.380
people being able to learn and learn about rockets,

04:09:50.380 --> 04:09:53.820
learn about water management and architecture

04:09:53.820 --> 04:09:57.740
and city planning and fitness and health.

04:09:57.740 --> 04:10:00.060
All of the modern conveniences that we Google

04:10:00.060 --> 04:10:02.220
every single day, there's people that don't have access

04:10:02.220 --> 04:10:03.420
to that right now.

04:10:03.420 --> 04:10:06.300
You know, I'm a self-taught rocket nerd.

04:10:06.300 --> 04:10:08.660
I would not be who I am if it wasn't for the internet

04:10:08.660 --> 04:10:11.260
in the last seven years, you know, six, seven years.

04:10:11.260 --> 04:10:14.500
So unlocking the intellectual potential of places

04:10:15.380 --> 04:10:17.020
like Africa, of rural areas that don't currently

04:10:17.020 --> 04:10:18.260
have internet access.

04:10:19.740 --> 04:10:22.620
That's a genuine, that's a huge thing.

04:10:22.620 --> 04:10:26.340
That's like humanitarian 101 is give people access

04:10:26.340 --> 04:10:29.620
to information and like, you know, I think we have

04:10:29.620 --> 04:10:32.900
this potential to try to step in and fix other people's

04:10:32.900 --> 04:10:35.140
problems, but the reality is like, people are smart.

04:10:35.140 --> 04:10:37.300
No matter where you are, you give them the resources

04:10:37.300 --> 04:10:39.140
to learn, they're gonna solve problems.

04:10:39.140 --> 04:10:40.580
They're gonna problem solve, they're gonna engineer,

04:10:40.580 --> 04:10:43.140
they're going to, but if you don't give them access

04:10:43.140 --> 04:10:45.860
to that information, they're gonna be stuck in their,

04:10:45.860 --> 04:10:49.060
in their cycles, you know, and so I think the potential

04:10:49.060 --> 04:10:50.740
for Starlink is incredible.

04:10:50.740 --> 04:10:52.180
I think it's already impactful.

04:10:52.180 --> 04:10:56.580
It's already affecting people in, you know, in rural

04:10:56.580 --> 04:11:00.020
and indigenous areas and it's already affecting businesses

04:11:00.020 --> 04:11:00.860
and all that stuff.

04:11:00.860 --> 04:11:02.020
I think it's great.

04:11:02.020 --> 04:11:06.100
I think it is, you know, there's some downsides

04:11:06.100 --> 04:11:08.940
with astronomy, with ground-based astronomy

04:11:08.940 --> 04:11:13.020
that it can hinder observations from the ground.

04:11:13.060 --> 04:11:16.300
There's already a lot of communications between SpaceX

04:11:16.300 --> 04:11:20.060
and astronomical societies and things like that

04:11:20.060 --> 04:11:22.060
because it is a real concern, you know, it's,

04:11:22.060 --> 04:11:25.180
it can ruin observations, it can ruin data,

04:11:25.180 --> 04:11:26.940
but like one of the big ones, for instance, recently,

04:11:26.940 --> 04:11:29.620
I think a new thing they're going to be working into

04:11:29.620 --> 04:11:33.260
is that currently if a Starlink is flying over,

04:11:34.300 --> 04:11:37.300
over a ground-based asset, a lot of, a lot of ground

04:11:37.300 --> 04:11:40.300
telescopes actually have a laser that goes up

04:11:40.300 --> 04:11:42.220
and it measures the atmospheric distortion

04:11:42.220 --> 04:11:43.660
and the telescopes literally sit there

04:11:43.660 --> 04:11:48.300
and like by the millisecond fixes, like changes the focus

04:11:48.300 --> 04:11:51.540
and fixes those atmospheric distortions.

04:11:51.540 --> 04:11:54.580
And that laser can interfere with satellites.

04:11:54.580 --> 04:11:57.700
So previously, I'm pretty sure that SpaceX actually had

04:11:57.700 --> 04:12:00.660
to, you know, request that as they're flying over

04:12:00.660 --> 04:12:02.420
these satellites, they are these telescopes,

04:12:02.420 --> 04:12:04.220
they turn off the laser.

04:12:04.220 --> 04:12:08.500
And when you have tens of thousands of these things flying,

04:12:08.500 --> 04:12:11.260
you're going to be turning off the laser more than it's on,

04:12:11.300 --> 04:12:14.140
you know, and just being this insanely inconvenient thing

04:12:14.140 --> 04:12:16.580
because you're going to have these junctions happen often.

04:12:16.580 --> 04:12:18.500
And I think one of the things that SpaceX is like,

04:12:18.500 --> 04:12:20.260
okay, no, no, no, you guys keep the laser on,

04:12:20.260 --> 04:12:23.860
we'll deal with your laser, good, good stuff, you know,

04:12:23.860 --> 04:12:26.060
things like that, mitigating the brightness of them

04:12:26.060 --> 04:12:28.860
so they're not visible under most conditions.

04:12:28.860 --> 04:12:31.060
Of course, like there's still always going to be visible

04:12:31.060 --> 04:12:34.940
in some, but then ultimately for me, it's like this,

04:12:34.940 --> 04:12:38.980
you have this weird, like almost like a puberty of spaceflight

04:12:38.980 --> 04:12:42.660
and astronomy where currently it's not cheap enough

04:12:42.660 --> 04:12:45.260
to really do a ton of incredible science

04:12:45.260 --> 04:12:46.620
or space-based telescopes.

04:12:46.620 --> 04:12:49.900
You know, we have Webb, we have Hubble, we have, you know,

04:12:49.900 --> 04:12:54.340
all these other, you know, awesome space-based telescopes,

04:12:54.340 --> 04:12:56.980
Chandra, you know, et cetera, et cetera, whatever.

04:12:56.980 --> 04:13:01.980
And you, but it's still so expensive to launch them

04:13:02.380 --> 04:13:04.660
that we're still so reliant on our ground telescopes.

04:13:04.660 --> 04:13:07.620
But in the future, you can see a world where,

04:13:07.660 --> 04:13:09.780
oh, this is so cheap, we'll just launch like,

04:13:09.780 --> 04:13:12.860
we can launch 50 James Webb Space Telescope-sized

04:13:12.860 --> 04:13:15.060
telescopes this year for half the price

04:13:15.060 --> 04:13:17.980
of doing it on Earth, you know, and get way better data.

04:13:17.980 --> 04:13:20.100
So in the future, I think in 20, 30 years,

04:13:20.100 --> 04:13:21.140
we'll look at it and be like, oh man,

04:13:21.140 --> 04:13:23.660
that was an awkward time where space assets

04:13:23.660 --> 04:13:26.140
were interfering with astronomy.

04:13:26.140 --> 04:13:27.300
But I think in the future, it's like,

04:13:27.300 --> 04:13:29.060
can you imagine doing space, you know,

04:13:29.060 --> 04:13:31.340
astronomy from the ground?

04:13:31.340 --> 04:13:32.380
That's insane, you know.

04:13:32.380 --> 04:13:35.020
There could be complexities to just having that many,

04:13:35.060 --> 04:13:36.060
just another topic.

04:13:36.060 --> 04:13:39.660
So complexity is associated with having so many satellites,

04:13:40.820 --> 04:13:43.820
especially with competing companies and competing nations.

04:13:43.820 --> 04:13:46.100
Do you see that as an issue, having tens of thousands,

04:13:46.100 --> 04:13:47.860
hundreds of thousands of satellites?

04:13:47.860 --> 04:13:48.700
Yeah.

04:13:48.700 --> 04:13:51.180
It becomes a very interesting robotics,

04:13:51.180 --> 04:13:52.780
a collision avoidance problem.

04:13:52.780 --> 04:13:55.260
The one thing to keep in mind is perspective.

04:13:55.260 --> 04:13:57.420
Like I know 10,000 satellites and 20,000

04:13:57.420 --> 04:14:00.020
and 100,000 satellites sounds insane,

04:14:00.020 --> 04:14:01.940
and it sounds really scary.

04:14:01.940 --> 04:14:04.140
But I mean, just even look at how many planes

04:14:04.220 --> 04:14:05.820
are in the air at any given time.

04:14:05.820 --> 04:14:08.740
And the planes are bigger, they're flying slower,

04:14:08.740 --> 04:14:10.660
which actually means there's a greater chance of collision.

04:14:10.660 --> 04:14:14.180
If you think about, you know, two objects occupying space,

04:14:14.180 --> 04:14:15.500
if they're, one's moving really fast.

04:14:15.500 --> 04:14:16.980
Like imagine trying to, you know,

04:14:16.980 --> 04:14:19.460
throw two basketballs at each other, relatively easy.

04:14:19.460 --> 04:14:21.580
Now try shooting two bullets at each other

04:14:21.580 --> 04:14:24.220
and having like, you know, at 90 degrees from each other.

04:14:24.220 --> 04:14:25.460
You have to have your timing down

04:14:25.460 --> 04:14:28.180
like really perfect to do that.

04:14:28.180 --> 04:14:29.740
Now take that times 10, you know,

04:14:29.740 --> 04:14:33.180
and these objects are taking up physical space

04:14:33.180 --> 04:14:34.340
a very small amount of time.

04:14:34.340 --> 04:14:35.260
They're relatively small.

04:14:35.260 --> 04:14:36.900
Like most satellites are not very big

04:14:36.900 --> 04:14:40.180
and they have limitless altitudes to deal with.

04:14:40.180 --> 04:14:43.100
So even though you can have what look like convergences,

04:14:43.100 --> 04:14:45.140
you know, they can be 10, 20, 50,

04:14:45.140 --> 04:14:46.740
a hundred kilometers difference often.

04:14:46.740 --> 04:14:48.780
And, you know, they're dealing with this.

04:14:48.780 --> 04:14:51.740
Like all the all space assets know,

04:14:51.740 --> 04:14:53.980
hey, I'm at this orbital plane and this blah, blah, blah,

04:14:53.980 --> 04:14:55.300
blah, and they know their altitudes

04:14:55.300 --> 04:14:56.420
and know their safe distances

04:14:56.420 --> 04:14:59.140
and have these margins built in and it's space.

04:14:59.140 --> 04:15:01.900
So there's like an insane amount of room, you know?

04:15:01.900 --> 04:15:03.420
So there's a lot of margin.

04:15:03.420 --> 04:15:04.900
There's a lot of margin,

04:15:04.900 --> 04:15:07.700
but of course you can't excuse that all the way.

04:15:07.700 --> 04:15:09.740
Like you have to still have plans

04:15:09.740 --> 04:15:12.740
and be considering that and considering collisions

04:15:12.740 --> 04:15:14.700
and considering all of the above.

04:15:18.060 --> 04:15:19.620
When do you think the first human being

04:15:19.620 --> 04:15:21.100
will step foot on Mars?

04:15:22.860 --> 04:15:25.980
You don't like timelines, but is this something

04:15:25.980 --> 04:15:30.660
and you're very much focused on kind of the short term

04:15:30.660 --> 04:15:33.460
of incredible progress that's happening

04:15:33.460 --> 04:15:34.900
and that makes total sense.

04:15:34.900 --> 04:15:39.140
But there is the Mars plan that was at the origin

04:15:39.140 --> 04:15:42.060
of the commercial space flight efforts.

04:15:42.060 --> 04:15:44.780
Do you still see and dream about that day?

04:15:45.700 --> 04:15:47.980
Let me be clear that I don't wanna go to Mars,

04:15:47.980 --> 04:15:52.860
but I do think if you're making me guess a timeline

04:15:52.860 --> 04:15:54.980
for when humans will walk on Mars,

04:15:56.100 --> 04:15:59.180
even a year ago, I still would have said by the end of 2020,

04:15:59.180 --> 04:16:01.740
like the 2020s decade, you know?

04:16:01.740 --> 04:16:05.180
So by December 31st, 2029,

04:16:05.180 --> 04:16:06.460
I thought humans would have walked on Mars.

04:16:06.460 --> 04:16:10.980
I'm starting to think that's still too optimistic,

04:16:10.980 --> 04:16:13.860
but I do, I definitely think by 2040.

04:16:13.860 --> 04:16:15.580
Like I for sure think that.

04:16:15.580 --> 04:16:19.900
And I really think it's just hard to predict that curve,

04:16:19.900 --> 04:16:21.780
you know, that project out that curve.

04:16:21.780 --> 04:16:23.540
We're gonna go from feeling like it's impossible

04:16:23.540 --> 04:16:24.860
to like it's feeling like it's inevitable.

04:16:24.860 --> 04:16:25.900
You know, it could be another,

04:16:25.900 --> 04:16:28.340
by the end of this decade, JFK type moment,

04:16:28.340 --> 04:16:31.260
especially if China steps up with the space race.

04:16:31.260 --> 04:16:33.740
It could be like, all right,

04:16:33.740 --> 04:16:37.900
NASA kinda says, all right, this Elon fella,

04:16:37.900 --> 04:16:40.540
like really make this a gigantic effort.

04:16:40.540 --> 04:16:42.580
Well, and if Starship works out as planned

04:16:42.580 --> 04:16:45.740
and as NASA has invested in human landing system,

04:16:45.740 --> 04:16:48.140
they're relying on SpaceX to land on the moon.

04:16:48.140 --> 04:16:51.220
SpaceX can land on the moon, they can land on Mars.

04:16:51.220 --> 04:16:52.980
Now, whether or not the life support

04:16:52.980 --> 04:16:56.020
and the human considerations of long-term space flight

04:16:56.020 --> 04:16:57.300
and high emissions and high radiation

04:16:57.300 --> 04:16:59.820
and blah, blah, blah, blah, refueling on Mars

04:16:59.820 --> 04:17:01.860
is a huge, huge, huge deal.

04:17:01.860 --> 04:17:04.220
They definitely could send a Starship to Mars

04:17:04.220 --> 04:17:07.500
and land, ideally land in one piece on Mars.

04:17:09.580 --> 04:17:10.660
As soon as they can land on the moon,

04:17:10.660 --> 04:17:11.900
they can land on Mars basically.

04:17:11.900 --> 04:17:13.420
I mean, those two things are very,

04:17:13.420 --> 04:17:15.740
in some ways Mars is almost easier.

04:17:17.180 --> 04:17:18.540
Because you can use the atmosphere to slow down.

04:17:18.540 --> 04:17:21.300
It actually doesn't take that much more Delta V

04:17:21.300 --> 04:17:23.100
to actually land on Mars than it does.

04:17:23.100 --> 04:17:24.460
Because on the moon, you don't have any,

04:17:24.460 --> 04:17:26.500
you have to first get out to the moon,

04:17:26.500 --> 04:17:28.300
then orbit the moon, you know, you have to slow down.

04:17:28.300 --> 04:17:30.340
Every one of those is a maneuver change.

04:17:30.340 --> 04:17:33.580
Then you have to lower your orbit until it coincides,

04:17:33.580 --> 04:17:35.940
you know, hits the moon.

04:17:35.940 --> 04:17:38.180
Then you have to slow down enough to not explode

04:17:38.180 --> 04:17:39.380
when you hit the moon.

04:17:39.380 --> 04:17:40.500
So there's a lot of Delta V there,

04:17:40.500 --> 04:17:42.580
a lot of change in velocity.

04:17:42.580 --> 04:17:45.460
Mars is actually, by the time you kind of crunch the numbers,

04:17:45.460 --> 04:17:46.980
it's relatively similar.

04:17:46.980 --> 04:17:49.020
It's just a lot more difficult like timeline-wise

04:17:49.020 --> 04:17:52.460
and you know, accuracy and all of these other communication.

04:17:52.460 --> 04:17:54.980
You know, there's a lot of other things obviously involved.

04:17:54.980 --> 04:17:57.900
I'm glossing over it, making it sound easy, it's not.

04:17:57.900 --> 04:18:02.500
But you know, I think there's a real decent chance

04:18:02.500 --> 04:18:05.300
we could see a starship vehicle land on Mars

04:18:05.300 --> 04:18:06.940
uncrewed by the end of the decade though.

04:18:06.940 --> 04:18:08.180
End of the decade.

04:18:08.180 --> 04:18:10.700
I mean, there's also a sociological element,

04:18:10.700 --> 04:18:14.020
maybe a political one where I think you're allowed

04:18:14.020 --> 04:18:17.100
to take more risks with Mars than you are with the moon.

04:18:17.100 --> 04:18:21.260
Because we've done the moon, 1969, it's been a while.

04:18:21.260 --> 04:18:25.100
So PR-wise, you have to be much safer.

04:18:25.100 --> 04:18:27.340
With Mars, like everyone's like, it's super dangerous,

04:18:27.340 --> 04:18:31.980
like super, so you could take a little more risk.

04:18:31.980 --> 04:18:32.820
100%.

04:18:32.820 --> 04:18:34.620
Especially with manned missions.

04:18:34.620 --> 04:18:38.540
But actually just going back to the moon landing,

04:18:38.540 --> 04:18:40.260
Apollo 11 mission.

04:18:40.260 --> 04:18:42.140
We haven't talked about this, Adam.

04:18:42.140 --> 04:18:44.460
The amazing engine there.

04:18:44.460 --> 04:18:46.780
But again, the romantic question,

04:18:46.780 --> 04:18:48.780
when you look back at that moon landing,

04:18:49.300 --> 04:18:54.300
one small step for man, one giant step for mankind.

04:18:54.580 --> 04:18:57.900
What do you think about that moment in human history?

04:18:57.900 --> 04:18:59.460
Do you go back to that often?

04:18:59.460 --> 04:19:02.620
Or are you focused just like with the cars on the engines?

04:19:02.620 --> 04:19:06.500
No, no, no, I still, when I need inspiration,

04:19:06.500 --> 04:19:09.420
I rewatch this documentary called When We Left Earth.

04:19:09.420 --> 04:19:11.060
I think it was like a, I think it was Discovery Channel

04:19:11.060 --> 04:19:13.300
did it, six part episode.

04:19:13.300 --> 04:19:16.900
It was narrated by Gary Sinise,

04:19:16.900 --> 04:19:20.100
phenomenal overview of the space race.

04:19:20.100 --> 04:19:23.260
And that will get my juices flowing every time.

04:19:23.260 --> 04:19:25.500
Every time, just, it's so well done.

04:19:25.500 --> 04:19:29.060
And it really just summarizes that program so well.

04:19:29.060 --> 04:19:30.860
And when I, and beyond,

04:19:30.860 --> 04:19:31.940
it goes all the way to the space shuttle.

04:19:31.940 --> 04:19:35.940
But yeah, when I watch footage

04:19:35.940 --> 04:19:37.340
of humans walking on the moon,

04:19:37.340 --> 04:19:41.460
it's just, I can't believe we're dumb enough

04:19:41.460 --> 04:19:43.420
to do it with the technology we had

04:19:43.420 --> 04:19:45.460
and the risks they took to do it.

04:19:45.460 --> 04:19:50.020
And the insane engineering that it took to do that

04:19:50.020 --> 04:19:53.180
is just absolutely astonishing.

04:19:53.180 --> 04:19:56.220
The amount of the sheer like logistics

04:19:56.220 --> 04:19:57.780
of what it took to do it

04:19:57.780 --> 04:20:00.300
with the technology we had back then

04:20:00.300 --> 04:20:02.780
is like, how did we have so much money

04:20:02.780 --> 04:20:06.860
and effort and energy and time and resources,

04:20:06.860 --> 04:20:08.340
human resources to do this?

04:20:08.340 --> 04:20:09.940
Like, it's just insane.

04:20:09.940 --> 04:20:12.980
Just the weakness of the computers they had back then.

04:20:12.980 --> 04:20:14.180
They had to do so much.

04:20:14.180 --> 04:20:17.260
I mean, yeah, it's, so much was so little.

04:20:17.260 --> 04:20:18.300
It's insane.

04:20:18.300 --> 04:20:21.100
And, but at the same time, like,

04:20:21.100 --> 04:20:22.780
I don't know if we wanna talk about conspiracy theories

04:20:22.780 --> 04:20:24.820
or anything, but like, it is all of,

04:20:24.820 --> 04:20:26.780
we have the proof in the pudding of like,

04:20:26.780 --> 04:20:29.300
the 400,000 people on payroll,

04:20:29.300 --> 04:20:32.140
like all of the paperwork, all of the-

04:20:32.140 --> 04:20:34.220
Oh, you mean now the question of conspiracy

04:20:34.220 --> 04:20:35.340
if we land on the moon?

04:20:35.340 --> 04:20:36.180
Yeah, like-

04:20:36.180 --> 04:20:37.980
Well, I mean, I think the receipts are there,

04:20:37.980 --> 04:20:39.540
like literally.

04:20:39.540 --> 04:20:43.380
But it's like a lot of things like that.

04:20:43.380 --> 04:20:46.540
I mean, we actually generally live in a pretty cynical time

04:20:46.540 --> 04:20:48.060
where people distrust institutions.

04:20:48.060 --> 04:20:50.580
Part of the thing with the space program

04:20:50.580 --> 04:20:53.580
is one of the things that can help reinvigorate

04:20:53.580 --> 04:20:55.140
the trust in institutions.

04:20:55.140 --> 04:20:59.220
By institutions, even that word is a bad word now,

04:20:59.220 --> 04:21:02.340
but institutions means a bunch of humans get together

04:21:02.340 --> 04:21:04.180
and do a big thing together.

04:21:04.180 --> 04:21:05.020
Yeah.

04:21:06.140 --> 04:21:11.060
Yeah, but, you know, like, if I was conspiratorially minded,

04:21:11.060 --> 04:21:14.740
it's like, how the hell did humans do that?

04:21:14.740 --> 04:21:15.780
Yeah.

04:21:15.780 --> 04:21:19.060
So I think that's a very cynical take, unfortunately,

04:21:19.060 --> 04:21:21.540
but it's still an incredible one.

04:21:21.540 --> 04:21:26.540
And also, you know, there's, until you look at the receipts,

04:21:26.660 --> 04:21:31.660
there's a kind of, like a rationale

04:21:32.340 --> 04:21:33.780
to that kind of conspiracy theory

04:21:33.780 --> 04:21:37.860
because so much pressure was put on the space race,

04:21:37.860 --> 04:21:40.020
the PR of it, to be the winner.

04:21:40.020 --> 04:21:43.540
So it makes sense that you might want to try

04:21:43.540 --> 04:21:46.380
to take shortcuts and fake things and, you know,

04:21:46.380 --> 04:21:49.940
propaganda, you know, different kinds of messaging.

04:21:49.940 --> 04:21:51.780
And I'm sure stuff like that was happening.

04:21:51.780 --> 04:21:54.500
Some kind of, like, little, you know,

04:21:54.500 --> 04:21:56.820
adjustment here and there to present things better

04:21:56.820 --> 04:22:00.300
and so on, but ultimately the actual engineering project

04:22:00.300 --> 04:22:03.860
of landing on the moon, the fact that humans did that.

04:22:03.860 --> 04:22:07.420
I mean, it is sad that we didn't have better, like,

04:22:07.420 --> 04:22:08.780
ways to record it.

04:22:08.780 --> 04:22:11.380
And as I watch like SpaceX efforts and Blue Origin

04:22:11.380 --> 04:22:15.940
and these efforts, it's still not trivial to record the,

04:22:17.460 --> 04:22:20.940
how just amazing, awe-inspiring space is.

04:22:20.940 --> 04:22:24.580
Because it, like, you know, it's like Elon jokes about,

04:22:24.580 --> 04:22:26.380
like, space does look fake.

04:22:26.380 --> 04:22:27.220
Yeah.

04:22:27.220 --> 04:22:29.420
Like, I think there is some element of it

04:22:29.420 --> 04:22:32.500
where you have to be there to experience it, really.

04:22:32.500 --> 04:22:35.860
And I don't, like, I think it's currently

04:22:35.860 --> 04:22:38.860
is still an unsolved problem of how do you capture

04:22:38.860 --> 04:22:39.780
the awe of that?

04:22:39.780 --> 04:22:43.940
I mean, you're one of the early people that are

04:22:43.940 --> 04:22:46.940
part of the crew that is exploring that very question.

04:22:46.940 --> 04:22:48.940
I'm sure you won't find all the answers,

04:22:48.940 --> 04:22:52.060
but you will start to say, like, how do we convert this

04:22:52.060 --> 04:22:54.300
into a visual format, into some kind of format

04:22:54.300 --> 04:22:56.500
that captures the magic of it?

04:22:56.500 --> 04:22:57.340
100%.

04:22:57.340 --> 04:22:59.380
And that's a perspective thing that I think about

04:22:59.380 --> 04:23:01.460
all the time, you know, and I,

04:23:01.460 --> 04:23:03.700
I'll do a lot of thinking about, like,

04:23:03.700 --> 04:23:05.980
what is the thing that's reacting to people?

04:23:05.980 --> 04:23:06.820
Is it the sound?

04:23:06.820 --> 04:23:07.740
Is it the perspective?

04:23:07.740 --> 04:23:09.220
Is it, like, seeing a little tiny human

04:23:09.220 --> 04:23:11.300
next to a landing leg that makes people go,

04:23:11.300 --> 04:23:12.780
oh my God, this thing is huge, you know,

04:23:12.780 --> 04:23:15.500
just reading, you know, and digesting that

04:23:15.500 --> 04:23:19.500
and trying to help to convey that as best as possible.

04:23:19.500 --> 04:23:22.140
Because the stuff that we are and have worked on

04:23:22.140 --> 04:23:24.460
is so cool.

04:23:24.460 --> 04:23:26.380
It's so exciting.

04:23:26.380 --> 04:23:27.980
And it's so important.

04:23:27.980 --> 04:23:30.940
And, like, actually, you know, so much bigger

04:23:30.980 --> 04:23:34.620
than any one of us, physically and metaphorically.

04:23:34.620 --> 04:23:37.740
It's just so, it's just, I wish everyone had that experience

04:23:37.740 --> 04:23:39.140
and had that light bulb go off.

04:23:39.140 --> 04:23:41.100
And that's the cool thing that you're, like,

04:23:41.100 --> 04:23:44.620
smack in the middle of solving that really difficult

04:23:44.620 --> 04:23:47.340
and fascinating problem of how,

04:23:47.340 --> 04:23:48.740
how do you capture the magic?

04:23:48.740 --> 04:23:50.300
How do you inspire?

04:23:50.300 --> 04:23:52.860
Like, that's not just an engineer problem.

04:23:52.860 --> 04:23:55.340
That's a communication problem, education problem.

04:23:55.340 --> 04:23:57.700
I find, specifically for myself,

04:23:57.700 --> 04:23:59.380
that I get most excited about something

04:23:59.380 --> 04:24:00.300
when I learn a lot about it.

04:24:00.340 --> 04:24:01.780
Like, when I learn the ins and the outs

04:24:01.780 --> 04:24:03.500
and I learn all the little problem solving

04:24:03.500 --> 04:24:05.860
and the, you know, the cool, like,

04:24:05.860 --> 04:24:07.700
oh my God, they had to do what to make it work?

04:24:07.700 --> 04:24:09.580
Wow, that's amazing.

04:24:09.580 --> 04:24:13.180
And that's, I try to just always go back to that thing

04:24:13.180 --> 04:24:14.820
of, like, what can I teach myself?

04:24:14.820 --> 04:24:18.140
Like, if I'm, every video, I expect that I learn something,

04:24:18.140 --> 04:24:19.260
making it, no matter what.

04:24:19.260 --> 04:24:22.660
Like, no matter how much I think I know about something,

04:24:22.660 --> 04:24:24.260
at the end of the day, if I'm not learning something,

04:24:24.260 --> 04:24:26.140
it's not a good video, you know?

04:24:26.140 --> 04:24:29.780
And I always think that people get excited when they learn.

04:24:29.780 --> 04:24:32.540
And when they have some questions answered for them.

04:24:34.540 --> 04:24:36.540
Let me ask you a couple of quick

04:24:36.540 --> 04:24:39.180
out there futuristic questions I have to.

04:24:39.180 --> 04:24:41.380
I'd hate myself if I don't ask you.

04:24:41.380 --> 04:24:43.460
So first, let's talk about nuclear propulsion.

04:24:43.460 --> 04:24:46.500
So out there, interesting propulsion ideas.

04:24:46.500 --> 04:24:51.300
So what do you think, beyond the chemical engines

04:24:51.300 --> 04:24:53.140
that we talked about, what do you think

04:24:53.140 --> 04:24:58.140
about using nuclear fission and maybe even nuclear fusion

04:24:58.620 --> 04:25:00.620
for propulsion?

04:25:00.620 --> 04:25:03.940
We already have thermal nuclear reactors.

04:25:03.940 --> 04:25:06.500
There are nuclear engines that have been tested,

04:25:06.500 --> 04:25:07.980
both by the United States and Soviet Union,

04:25:07.980 --> 04:25:11.940
that were 100% valid, like, totally ready to go,

04:25:11.940 --> 04:25:16.900
efficient, super awesome, yes, yes, yes, hardcore yes.

04:25:16.900 --> 04:25:21.220
And what they're using is, yeah, basically a fusion reactor.

04:25:21.220 --> 04:25:23.140
You're flowing hydrogen through it

04:25:23.140 --> 04:25:26.220
and heating up the hydrogen, taking it from liquid to gas,

04:25:27.100 --> 04:25:30.140
by heating it up, you're adding energy to the propellant.

04:25:30.140 --> 04:25:31.420
And then you're literally just using

04:25:31.420 --> 04:25:34.140
that now steam hot hydrogen

04:25:34.140 --> 04:25:36.260
and flowing it through a DeLavelle nozzle.

04:25:36.260 --> 04:25:38.900
And you also have to use that energy to spin the pumps

04:25:38.900 --> 04:25:40.460
to still pump the thing.

04:25:40.460 --> 04:25:41.380
So you're still kind of using

04:25:41.380 --> 04:25:42.980
like a lot of the tricks that you're using.

04:25:42.980 --> 04:25:45.060
But instead of a chemical reaction,

04:25:45.060 --> 04:25:48.940
you're literally just using nuclear fission

04:25:48.940 --> 04:25:51.780
to heat up propellant and do the same thing.

04:25:51.780 --> 04:25:52.780
And at the end of the day, you end up with like

04:25:52.780 --> 04:25:54.900
eight to 900 seconds of specific impulse,

04:25:54.900 --> 04:25:57.660
which is double that of chemical propulsion.

04:25:57.660 --> 04:25:59.780
Most of that comes just because hydrogen is so light.

04:25:59.780 --> 04:26:00.900
You're only emitting,

04:26:00.900 --> 04:26:03.780
you're only ejecting hydrogen out of the nozzle.

04:26:03.780 --> 04:26:07.100
So the lighter molecule is the faster, you know,

04:26:07.100 --> 04:26:12.100
just like if you had a golf ball versus like a bowling ball,

04:26:12.820 --> 04:26:14.780
you can only physically throw one so fast

04:26:14.780 --> 04:26:15.940
and the other one as a human,

04:26:15.940 --> 04:26:17.700
you're not gonna do very well with.

04:26:17.700 --> 04:26:19.180
So you can just, you get,

04:26:19.180 --> 04:26:22.380
you have the more potential for a higher exit velocity.

04:26:22.380 --> 04:26:25.220
So nuclear thermal, amazing.

04:26:25.220 --> 04:26:27.660
You can just shoot these little hydrogen molecules out,

04:26:27.660 --> 04:26:29.460
crazy fast, crazy efficiently.

04:26:29.460 --> 04:26:31.660
We already have it, we can do it.

04:26:31.660 --> 04:26:32.500
Yes, yes, yes.

04:26:32.500 --> 04:26:35.140
And actually we're already reinvesting in that again,

04:26:35.140 --> 04:26:38.100
as the United States is looking into

04:26:38.100 --> 04:26:40.620
basically ramping back up our nuclear propulsion.

04:26:40.620 --> 04:26:42.820
Why haven't we done it yet?

04:26:42.820 --> 04:26:44.620
And what do you think the challenges are there?

04:26:44.620 --> 04:26:46.180
And do you think that's an obvious future?

04:26:46.180 --> 04:26:48.900
Like would you see in 50 years,

04:26:48.900 --> 04:26:50.100
we're not using,

04:26:52.580 --> 04:26:54.580
like we're not, for major projects,

04:26:54.580 --> 04:26:55.980
like a Starship type of project,

04:26:55.980 --> 04:26:58.140
we're not using chemical propulsion anymore?

04:26:58.140 --> 04:26:59.180
For getting off earth,

04:26:59.180 --> 04:27:01.420
you'll always want to use chemical propulsion

04:27:01.420 --> 04:27:03.420
because the gas will come irradiated.

04:27:03.420 --> 04:27:05.140
Like you don't want to,

04:27:05.140 --> 04:27:07.220
and actually the thrust to weight ratio of these engines

04:27:07.220 --> 04:27:08.260
are relatively poor.

04:27:08.260 --> 04:27:10.700
They're very heavy, they have a nuclear reactor.

04:27:10.700 --> 04:27:12.900
Like they're not, they're really,

04:27:12.900 --> 04:27:14.260
the reason we kind of give up on them

04:27:14.260 --> 04:27:17.380
is they're really most useful for like interplanetary.

04:27:17.380 --> 04:27:18.340
If you're trying to get a big,

04:27:18.340 --> 04:27:21.300
like if you're trying to send a huge payload off to Mars,

04:27:21.300 --> 04:27:23.620
nuclear thermal is amazing.

04:27:23.620 --> 04:27:27.220
It's still could be beneficial even going to the moon,

04:27:27.220 --> 04:27:28.460
like in an earth moon system,

04:27:28.460 --> 04:27:31.740
you could use nuclear thermal very effectively

04:27:31.740 --> 04:27:33.540
and it could be a great choice.

04:27:33.540 --> 04:27:36.580
But it also, that starts to get into that trade of like,

04:27:36.580 --> 04:27:38.860
we can just kind of use a little bit bigger rocket

04:27:38.860 --> 04:27:42.900
and fly a normal, it's that whole trade thing.

04:27:42.900 --> 04:27:46.580
But another reason why we kind of stopped using them,

04:27:46.580 --> 04:27:48.300
the one that the United States developed

04:27:49.260 --> 04:27:50.900
was the Nerva was so heavy,

04:27:50.900 --> 04:27:53.780
only a Saturn V could actually lift the stage of it,

04:27:53.780 --> 04:27:54.620
like the upper stage.

04:27:54.620 --> 04:27:57.900
So it replaced the S-IVB with a nuclear thermal

04:27:57.900 --> 04:27:59.260
with the Nerva engine.

04:27:59.260 --> 04:28:01.820
The Soviet Union developed one about one tenth the size

04:28:01.820 --> 04:28:05.860
and thrust that was small enough to fly on a proton rocket.

04:28:06.700 --> 04:28:08.340
But neither of them ever flew.

04:28:08.340 --> 04:28:09.580
Both of them have been tested

04:28:09.580 --> 04:28:12.020
and like thumbs up, ready to go,

04:28:12.020 --> 04:28:14.020
which is just a huge shame to me

04:28:14.020 --> 04:28:18.140
because they could unlock a lot of interplanetary potential

04:28:19.060 --> 04:28:21.260
which potentially interstellar as well.

04:28:22.420 --> 04:28:24.380
I don't think nuclear thermal,

04:28:24.380 --> 04:28:25.460
we're not quite getting there,

04:28:25.460 --> 04:28:27.660
but then you get into like nuclear pulse drives

04:28:27.660 --> 04:28:29.700
and things where you're literally like,

04:28:29.700 --> 04:28:32.420
basically ejecting a bomb out the back of your rocket

04:28:32.420 --> 04:28:34.660
and exploding and having like a shock absorber

04:28:34.660 --> 04:28:37.260
and Pogo sticking your way out of the solar system.

04:28:40.380 --> 04:28:42.020
I mean, by all physics, sure,

04:28:42.020 --> 04:28:43.540
there's nothing wrong with that.

04:28:43.540 --> 04:28:45.420
It's not breaking any laws of physics.

04:28:46.100 --> 04:28:48.140
You know, but I just don't see us getting

04:28:48.140 --> 04:28:49.740
to that need anytime soon.

04:28:49.740 --> 04:28:50.580
I don't think we're gonna be-

04:28:50.580 --> 04:28:51.420
Interstellar travel.

04:28:51.420 --> 04:28:54.100
Yeah, I mean, I think we're gonna want

04:28:54.100 --> 04:28:57.300
a better understanding of physics and physics itself.

04:28:57.300 --> 04:29:00.980
Yeah, do you have a hope that maybe theoretical physics

04:29:00.980 --> 04:29:03.700
will open the door to some exciting propulsion systems?

04:29:03.700 --> 04:29:05.220
Yeah, I do.

04:29:05.220 --> 04:29:07.060
I think we're still at the very infancy

04:29:07.060 --> 04:29:09.820
of our understanding of everything and how things work.

04:29:09.820 --> 04:29:12.260
And, you know, a hundred years ago,

04:29:12.260 --> 04:29:13.540
it would be stupid to try to predict

04:29:13.540 --> 04:29:14.380
the things we know today

04:29:14.380 --> 04:29:16.540
and who knows, like even, you know,

04:29:16.540 --> 04:29:18.540
I think about things like James Webb

04:29:18.540 --> 04:29:20.900
looking deeper into our solar system than ever before

04:29:20.900 --> 04:29:22.820
and physically being able to see objects

04:29:22.820 --> 04:29:24.140
that we just have not even been able

04:29:24.140 --> 04:29:25.860
to physically see before.

04:29:25.860 --> 04:29:29.220
On being able to study black holes, for example,

04:29:29.220 --> 04:29:30.700
and better and better the stuff that's happening

04:29:30.700 --> 04:29:33.500
outside of black holes, at the edges of black holes,

04:29:33.500 --> 04:29:35.780
how the information is stored,

04:29:35.780 --> 04:29:39.140
the holographic principle, just,

04:29:39.140 --> 04:29:42.180
there's so much weirdness around black holes.

04:29:42.180 --> 04:29:47.020
Around where gravity starts bending light,

04:29:48.060 --> 04:29:51.620
it's like, all right, we'll get to look at that now

04:29:51.620 --> 04:29:54.420
and start to wonder like, what is going on?

04:29:54.420 --> 04:29:59.140
And how can we like use that somehow for propulsion?

04:29:59.140 --> 04:30:00.820
I mean, it seems like awfully crazy

04:30:00.820 --> 04:30:02.020
and futuristic at this moment,

04:30:02.020 --> 04:30:05.820
but I think that's because we know almost nothing about,

04:30:07.100 --> 04:30:10.660
you know, those kinds of objects where, again,

04:30:10.660 --> 04:30:13.820
where the general relativity and quantum mechanics

04:30:13.820 --> 04:30:17.980
start to have to be both considered

04:30:17.980 --> 04:30:19.540
to describe those kinds of objects.

04:30:19.540 --> 04:30:21.020
And as we study those objects,

04:30:21.020 --> 04:30:23.580
we might figure out some kind of unification thing

04:30:23.580 --> 04:30:26.340
that will allow us to understand maybe

04:30:26.340 --> 04:30:29.340
how to use black holes for propulsion.

04:30:29.340 --> 04:30:33.260
Like, I could say a lot of crazy things,

04:30:33.260 --> 04:30:34.100
but like basically-

04:30:34.100 --> 04:30:36.740
But the point is it'd be stupid for us to even

04:30:36.740 --> 04:30:38.580
guess about things we don't even know about yet.

04:30:38.580 --> 04:30:39.420
You know what I mean?

04:30:40.180 --> 04:30:41.980
So therefore I'm not going to say

04:30:41.980 --> 04:30:43.900
that the best option for interstellar travel

04:30:43.900 --> 04:30:46.300
is nuclear drives.

04:30:46.300 --> 04:30:48.580
Like that could be like someone saying, you know,

04:30:48.580 --> 04:30:51.180
in 1600, the only way to fly is

04:30:51.180 --> 04:30:54.260
by strapping a thousand birds to your head, you know, like.

04:30:54.260 --> 04:30:57.980
But that said, I mean, everything you're saying is right,

04:30:57.980 --> 04:31:00.140
but human history is such,

04:31:00.140 --> 04:31:02.060
like at the beginning of the 20th century,

04:31:02.060 --> 04:31:04.460
physicists, Rutherford, everybody,

04:31:04.460 --> 04:31:05.700
there's brilliant people that said

04:31:05.700 --> 04:31:07.900
we've basically solved all of it.

04:31:07.900 --> 04:31:08.740
Right.

04:31:08.740 --> 04:31:09.700
If you talk to most physicists,

04:31:09.700 --> 04:31:11.460
I think they're going to say like,

04:31:11.460 --> 04:31:14.620
we've pretty much solved,

04:31:14.620 --> 04:31:16.900
like the standard model describes physics

04:31:16.900 --> 04:31:18.420
extremely accurately.

04:31:18.420 --> 04:31:19.620
Right.

04:31:19.620 --> 04:31:22.380
General relativity explains the cosmos

04:31:22.380 --> 04:31:25.220
as we observe them extremely accurately.

04:31:25.220 --> 04:31:27.060
Yeah, there's a whole dark matter, dark energy thing,

04:31:27.060 --> 04:31:27.900
whatever. Yeah.

04:31:27.900 --> 04:31:32.260
But outside of that, so like we basically solved like,

04:31:33.740 --> 04:31:37.620
like where are you going to find gaps in knowledge

04:31:37.620 --> 04:31:40.340
that are going to somehow create warp drives

04:31:40.340 --> 04:31:41.180
or something like that? Right.

04:31:41.180 --> 04:31:42.060
So wormholes.

04:31:43.380 --> 04:31:46.700
But that's, it seems like throughout history,

04:31:46.700 --> 04:31:48.900
we prove ourselves wrong time and time again.

04:31:48.900 --> 04:31:49.740
Yes.

04:31:49.740 --> 04:31:53.580
No, and I, this is well outside of any of my knowledge base.

04:31:53.580 --> 04:31:55.740
So I want to make sure that if I say anything stupid,

04:31:55.740 --> 04:32:00.060
it's because I'm just a peasant here in physics land, but.

04:32:00.060 --> 04:32:03.300
Yes, we're all peasants in physics land.

04:32:03.300 --> 04:32:05.460
But I really just think like,

04:32:05.460 --> 04:32:07.860
it's very humbling that we're still using chemical

04:32:07.860 --> 04:32:10.540
propulsion and variance of like injecting mass

04:32:10.540 --> 04:32:11.740
to propel ourselves.

04:32:11.740 --> 04:32:14.220
And I, no matter how you get at it.

04:32:14.220 --> 04:32:18.220
And I think someday I would expect that our species

04:32:18.220 --> 04:32:20.660
has figured out a way to get beyond that.

04:32:21.620 --> 04:32:24.380
Got to ask you another wild question.

04:32:25.540 --> 04:32:28.540
What do you think of Bob Lazar,

04:32:28.540 --> 04:32:33.540
who claimed that he worked at and saw in area 51,

04:32:33.580 --> 04:32:37.940
a propulsion system fueled by, I'm quoting here,

04:32:37.940 --> 04:32:38.900
maybe from Wikipedia.

04:32:38.900 --> 04:32:40.860
I don't know where I got this from.

04:32:40.860 --> 04:32:42.980
Fueled by an anti-matter reactor,

04:32:42.980 --> 04:32:45.860
which used as fuel the chemical element

04:32:45.860 --> 04:32:48.220
with atomic number 115.

04:32:48.220 --> 04:32:50.140
At the time it wasn't synthesized.

04:32:50.140 --> 04:32:55.140
It was later in 2003 synthesized, named Muscovium.

04:32:56.660 --> 04:32:58.620
He said that the propulsion system relied

04:32:58.620 --> 04:33:01.340
on a stable isotope of element 115,

04:33:01.340 --> 04:33:03.580
which allegedly generates a gravity wave

04:33:03.580 --> 04:33:05.100
that allowed the vehicle to fly

04:33:05.100 --> 04:33:08.820
and to evade visual detection by bending light around it.

04:33:08.820 --> 04:33:11.780
No stabilized isotopes of Muscovium

04:33:11.780 --> 04:33:13.380
have yet been synthesized.

04:33:13.380 --> 04:33:15.460
All have proven extremely radioactive,

04:33:15.460 --> 04:33:19.500
decaying in a few hundred milliseconds.

04:33:19.500 --> 04:33:21.620
One, do you believe him?

04:33:21.620 --> 04:33:25.500
Which I find him fascinating because it's,

04:33:25.500 --> 04:33:29.140
I find the human mind even more fascinating

04:33:29.140 --> 04:33:34.140
than something like an anti-matter drive,

04:33:34.580 --> 04:33:36.340
because I think it's such a giant mystery

04:33:36.340 --> 04:33:38.780
that we haven't even begun to explore deeply.

04:33:38.780 --> 04:33:42.860
Anyway, in that sense, whether he's lying or not,

04:33:42.860 --> 04:33:45.260
are both interesting things to explore

04:33:45.260 --> 04:33:47.140
from a psychology perspective.

04:33:47.140 --> 04:33:51.260
But two, he's basically saying that, I guess,

04:33:51.260 --> 04:33:56.260
it's an alien extraterrestrial engine thing

04:33:59.900 --> 04:34:01.060
What do you think?

04:34:01.060 --> 04:34:03.460
I mean, I'm happy to change my opinion

04:34:03.460 --> 04:34:05.460
based on new evidence at any point.

04:34:06.340 --> 04:34:10.140
I have like, the biggest part of me wants to just be like,

04:34:10.140 --> 04:34:12.780
this is obviously just stupid and a hoax

04:34:12.780 --> 04:34:14.700
and just total, you know, quack.

04:34:15.740 --> 04:34:18.060
And then another part of me still is like,

04:34:18.060 --> 04:34:21.380
this is exciting and fun to think that this is all real.

04:34:21.380 --> 04:34:23.500
And then another part of me goes, why,

04:34:23.500 --> 04:34:26.660
how good is this guy at lying and making stuff up?

04:34:26.660 --> 04:34:30.300
Because it's all really good, like good storytelling,

04:34:30.300 --> 04:34:32.540
good, like, I don't know what to think, honestly.

04:34:32.540 --> 04:34:35.340
I don't know, I'm really very skeptical

04:34:35.340 --> 04:34:37.220
about anyone explaining anything like this.

04:34:37.220 --> 04:34:40.460
Like, I mean, my radar is like screaming at me,

04:34:40.460 --> 04:34:44.460
like, this is all full crap, you know?

04:34:44.460 --> 04:34:46.260
But I'd say like, there's still a part of me

04:34:46.260 --> 04:34:48.540
that's just like, man, that is kind of cool.

04:34:48.540 --> 04:34:49.620
How did he know that?

04:34:49.620 --> 04:34:51.740
And like, you know what I mean?

04:34:51.740 --> 04:34:52.980
I'm conflicted.

04:34:52.980 --> 04:34:55.100
I think you're actually in the best kind of place

04:34:55.100 --> 04:34:58.700
because it's, I'm afraid of being the kind of person

04:34:58.700 --> 04:35:01.060
that hears something like that and says,

04:35:01.060 --> 04:35:04.780
it's definitely, he's definitely full of crap

04:35:04.780 --> 04:35:07.300
and basically closed my mind off to all that stuff.

04:35:07.300 --> 04:35:09.900
I'm afraid of being somebody who closes my mind off

04:35:09.900 --> 04:35:13.860
to a thing that's actually an early thread

04:35:13.860 --> 04:35:16.540
to a brilliant, to a future,

04:35:16.540 --> 04:35:21.060
to a fascinating solution to a mystery, so.

04:35:21.060 --> 04:35:23.540
But in this case, I mean, I have so many red flags

04:35:23.540 --> 04:35:26.020
from a psychological perspective that,

04:35:28.340 --> 04:35:31.900
but again, outside of this particular individual,

04:35:31.900 --> 04:35:34.140
I do wonder if aliens have visited us.

04:35:35.500 --> 04:35:37.260
I think aliens are everywhere.

04:35:37.260 --> 04:35:41.060
I think the universe is teeming with alien life.

04:35:41.060 --> 04:35:44.420
I mean, there's, it's very difficult for me

04:35:44.420 --> 04:35:46.460
to statistically understand,

04:35:46.460 --> 04:35:51.460
given how life finds a way here on Earth,

04:35:52.060 --> 04:35:53.660
just everywhere.

04:35:53.660 --> 04:35:55.700
The entire history of life on Earth,

04:35:55.700 --> 04:35:57.980
from the very origin of life,

04:35:57.980 --> 04:36:01.140
it seems to be damn good at doing its thing,

04:36:01.140 --> 04:36:03.500
evolving to get better and better and better

04:36:03.500 --> 04:36:04.580
at doing its thing.

04:36:04.580 --> 04:36:06.660
Now, there could be some special aspects

04:36:06.660 --> 04:36:08.340
to the origin of life itself,

04:36:08.340 --> 04:36:10.180
which is completely not understood.

04:36:10.180 --> 04:36:13.820
So maybe the true magic is in the origin of life.

04:36:13.820 --> 04:36:17.100
Or it could be that there is some magical leaps

04:36:17.100 --> 04:36:19.740
to eukaryotic cells, for example,

04:36:19.740 --> 04:36:23.380
that the universe, our galaxy, is teeming with alien life,

04:36:23.380 --> 04:36:24.740
but it's all bacteria.

04:36:24.740 --> 04:36:27.580
They're all boring bacteria, or exciting bacteria.

04:36:27.580 --> 04:36:29.420
No offense to bacteria.

04:36:29.420 --> 04:36:32.780
But the no-intelligence space-faring civilizations.

04:36:32.780 --> 04:36:35.820
I don't know, but I just, if I were to guess,

04:36:35.820 --> 04:36:37.700
if I had to bet all my money,

04:36:37.700 --> 04:36:40.940
there is space-faring civilizations

04:36:40.940 --> 04:36:42.940
everywhere in the universe.

04:36:42.940 --> 04:36:45.020
And the fact that they're not,

04:36:45.060 --> 04:36:49.260
they have not been directly definitively observed

04:36:50.140 --> 04:36:51.740
confuses me.

04:36:51.740 --> 04:36:53.380
And I think it's a mystery.

04:36:53.380 --> 04:36:56.180
And if I were to suggest what the solution

04:36:56.180 --> 04:36:57.460
to that mystery is,

04:36:57.460 --> 04:37:00.780
is they might look extremely different from us.

04:37:00.780 --> 04:37:03.340
And we might be too dumb to detect them.

04:37:03.340 --> 04:37:04.180
Yeah.

04:37:04.180 --> 04:37:08.620
And so there, I think you have to be extremely open-minded

04:37:08.620 --> 04:37:11.660
at what would we be looking for.

04:37:11.660 --> 04:37:12.580
Right.

04:37:13.220 --> 04:37:16.620
And that's a very practical thing to be open-minded about.

04:37:16.620 --> 04:37:19.380
And practically speaking,

04:37:19.380 --> 04:37:23.300
if we were to be able to even detect them from a distance,

04:37:23.300 --> 04:37:26.940
get a techno-signature of a distant planet,

04:37:26.940 --> 04:37:30.300
of a distant star system that has alien life,

04:37:31.380 --> 04:37:34.740
honestly, the number one thing I kind of want to know

04:37:34.740 --> 04:37:37.580
is like, what's your propulsion systems?

04:37:37.580 --> 04:37:41.020
Like, how do we travel faster, right?

04:37:41.020 --> 04:37:42.860
Like, there's a bunch of details probably,

04:37:42.860 --> 04:37:45.420
but first, let's get together.

04:37:45.420 --> 04:37:46.860
And teach me how to go fast.

04:37:46.860 --> 04:37:47.700
Go fast.

04:37:47.700 --> 04:37:48.940
I like motorcycles, I like rockets.

04:37:48.940 --> 04:37:50.540
Tell me what you got, yeah.

04:37:50.540 --> 04:37:52.420
Yeah, like how, like, I'll show you mine

04:37:52.420 --> 04:37:53.900
if you show me yours kind of thing

04:37:53.900 --> 04:37:57.740
at the interstellar, intergalactic level.

04:37:58.900 --> 04:38:00.460
Yeah, anyway, I just wonder,

04:38:01.340 --> 04:38:04.860
maybe it's a cheat code in this video game we call life,

04:38:04.860 --> 04:38:07.620
but I want to use the cheat code to figure out

04:38:07.620 --> 04:38:09.780
what kind of propulsion systems are possible.

04:38:09.780 --> 04:38:12.540
And it feels like other alien civilizations

04:38:12.540 --> 04:38:15.100
might help us, give us,

04:38:18.060 --> 04:38:20.020
give us a guidance on that.

04:38:20.020 --> 04:38:23.940
Of course, I think even just discovering,

04:38:24.780 --> 04:38:26.860
boy, one of the things with the space program,

04:38:26.860 --> 04:38:29.220
like everything we're doing with Mars,

04:38:29.220 --> 04:38:31.460
like the secret thing I'm really excited about,

04:38:31.460 --> 04:38:33.300
the romantic thing is humans on Mars,

04:38:33.300 --> 04:38:37.660
but the secret thing is building giant stations on Mars

04:38:37.660 --> 04:38:42.300
that allow us to definitively, hopefully find

04:38:42.300 --> 04:38:47.300
the traces of life that either currently doesn't live

04:38:47.580 --> 04:38:48.940
or has once lived on Mars.

04:38:48.940 --> 04:38:50.900
Because if that's the case,

04:38:50.900 --> 04:38:53.100
that means for sure life is everywhere.

04:38:53.100 --> 04:38:53.940
Oh, 100%.

04:38:53.940 --> 04:38:56.380
And then you're like, once you know that,

04:38:56.380 --> 04:38:58.700
sorry to keep interrupting, not shutting the hell up,

04:38:58.700 --> 04:39:00.660
is this supposed to be an interview, god damn it.

04:39:00.660 --> 04:39:05.540
All right, that, like, that, just the knowledge of that,

04:39:05.540 --> 04:39:08.940
just the knowledge that a four-minute mile can be run,

04:39:08.940 --> 04:39:11.580
I think will open our minds completely

04:39:11.580 --> 04:39:15.540
to really, really hardcore push to interstellar travel

04:39:15.540 --> 04:39:18.860
or colonizing Mars, becoming a multi-planetary species.

04:39:18.860 --> 04:39:20.980
It'd be truly inspiring.

04:39:20.980 --> 04:39:22.100
You think that.

04:39:24.340 --> 04:39:26.340
Do you get nervous though, like,

04:39:26.340 --> 04:39:29.060
I'm the interviewer now, don't you get nervous

04:39:29.060 --> 04:39:32.020
that we could make spectacular discovery on Mars

04:39:32.020 --> 04:39:33.940
that not only has there been life,

04:39:33.940 --> 04:39:36.780
there's actually like pretty advanced micro,

04:39:36.780 --> 04:39:39.700
you know, multi-cellular life,

04:39:39.700 --> 04:39:41.340
totally thriving in certain regions.

04:39:41.340 --> 04:39:42.860
We just hadn't visited a man on Mars

04:39:42.860 --> 04:39:44.340
and we make this big discovery

04:39:44.340 --> 04:39:48.300
that a relatively large percentage of people

04:39:48.300 --> 04:39:49.940
just simply wouldn't believe it.

04:39:49.940 --> 04:39:52.980
They'd think it's all 100% fake

04:39:52.980 --> 04:39:55.140
and that they're just doing this to control us

04:39:55.140 --> 04:39:55.980
and that blah, blah, blah.

04:39:55.980 --> 04:39:59.580
Like, we could make the most important discovery

04:39:59.580 --> 04:40:03.420
in human life, like in all of human existence

04:40:04.100 --> 04:40:05.940
that we're not alone in this universe,

04:40:07.700 --> 04:40:11.020
cellularly at least, and a good percentage of people,

04:40:11.020 --> 04:40:14.460
I'm thinking 20, 30, in today's world,

04:40:14.460 --> 04:40:18.980
40 plus percent of people wouldn't even believe it existed.

04:40:18.980 --> 04:40:19.820
Interesting.

04:40:21.140 --> 04:40:23.540
It's just a very important thing to think about,

04:40:23.540 --> 04:40:26.340
especially as an educator like yourself.

04:40:26.340 --> 04:40:30.020
I think the current cynicism towards institutions

04:40:30.020 --> 04:40:31.620
and science is temporary.

04:40:31.620 --> 04:40:35.260
I think it's, they're basically, the internet woke up,

04:40:35.260 --> 04:40:38.500
the internet smells bullshit, and it looked at,

04:40:39.660 --> 04:40:40.860
I'm sorry, I'm not being ageist,

04:40:40.860 --> 04:40:43.540
but saying older scientists, and they looked at them

04:40:43.540 --> 04:40:45.900
and they kind of said, you're kind of full of shit.

04:40:45.900 --> 04:40:50.220
You got a lot of ego, you speak down to everybody,

04:40:50.220 --> 04:40:52.180
you're not very good at communicating.

04:40:52.180 --> 04:40:54.740
I think there's a lot of truth to what they're saying

04:40:54.740 --> 04:40:57.180
and I think the young scientists that are coming up

04:40:57.180 --> 04:40:59.460
will be much better at not being full of shit,

04:40:59.460 --> 04:41:00.980
being authentic, being real,

04:41:00.980 --> 04:41:04.060
not treating people like they're children

04:41:04.060 --> 04:41:05.220
they can't possibly understand,

04:41:05.220 --> 04:41:06.980
like taking it very seriously,

04:41:06.980 --> 04:41:09.140
that there's a lot of intelligent people out there

04:41:09.140 --> 04:41:13.260
that are curious, that are full of desire for knowledge,

04:41:13.260 --> 04:41:16.140
like being transparent about all the uncertainties

04:41:17.100 --> 04:41:19.820
of the scientific process, all the tensions,

04:41:19.820 --> 04:41:21.260
the conflicts, all of that,

04:41:21.260 --> 04:41:26.260
and I think once we fix the science communication system

04:41:26.780 --> 04:41:31.220
adapted to the internet, I think that won't be an issue,

04:41:31.220 --> 04:41:33.980
I hope, I hope, I mean, that's why people like you

04:41:33.980 --> 04:41:37.540
are really important, is like communicate with authenticity.

04:41:39.460 --> 04:41:41.540
But yeah, that's definitely something to think about.

04:41:41.540 --> 04:41:45.260
I mean, yes, the early, I mean, listen, scientists too,

04:41:45.260 --> 04:41:48.580
like the phosphine discovered on Venus is like,

04:41:48.580 --> 04:41:51.540
they're extremely skeptical always,

04:41:51.540 --> 04:41:54.380
so definitely there will be a lot of skepticism.

04:41:54.580 --> 04:41:56.020
And it depends what it looks like,

04:41:56.020 --> 04:41:57.660
if it kind of looks like,

04:41:57.660 --> 04:42:00.500
this thing kind of looks like bacteria back on Earth,

04:42:00.500 --> 04:42:02.860
yes, so it means contamination

04:42:02.860 --> 04:42:04.860
is very difficult to avoid in general,

04:42:04.860 --> 04:42:08.060
but if the thing looks like fundamentally different,

04:42:08.060 --> 04:42:10.340
then you're like, all right.

04:42:10.340 --> 04:42:14.380
Yeah, totally different DNA, RNA, like this is not,

04:42:14.380 --> 04:42:16.780
we've never observed this ever, ever.

04:42:16.780 --> 04:42:21.180
Yeah, then you're like, all right, cool, of course.

04:42:22.020 --> 04:42:25.820
Of course, so that, another promising thing

04:42:25.820 --> 04:42:28.380
that difficult to be definitive about,

04:42:28.380 --> 04:42:32.460
but let's get better and better direct imaging systems,

04:42:32.460 --> 04:42:34.780
there's now, I don't know how many,

04:42:34.780 --> 04:42:38.420
but thousands of planets are being discovered

04:42:38.420 --> 04:42:39.980
outside of our solar system,

04:42:39.980 --> 04:42:41.340
there's moons being discovered,

04:42:41.340 --> 04:42:43.380
now Earth-like planets being discovered,

04:42:43.380 --> 04:42:45.820
so like all of that, if we could do direct imaging

04:42:45.820 --> 04:42:48.700
of those planets more and more and more,

04:42:48.740 --> 04:42:52.060
there could be some gigantic, listen,

04:42:52.060 --> 04:42:55.780
if there is like a Kardashev like type two civilization,

04:42:55.780 --> 04:42:57.260
we're gonna see the damn thing,

04:42:57.260 --> 04:42:59.940
it's gonna be producing a lot of,

04:42:59.940 --> 04:43:02.500
it's gonna be radiating a lot of energy,

04:43:02.500 --> 04:43:04.700
so the possibility of detecting some of that,

04:43:04.700 --> 04:43:06.940
that's also a real possibility

04:43:06.940 --> 04:43:08.780
with something like James Webb telescopes,

04:43:08.780 --> 04:43:10.420
like those kinds of efforts

04:43:10.420 --> 04:43:12.300
that starts becoming a reality.

04:43:12.300 --> 04:43:14.660
Have you read Andy Weir's project Hail Mary?

04:43:14.660 --> 04:43:15.900
I have not, no.

04:43:15.900 --> 04:43:18.180
You're going to love it,

04:43:18.700 --> 04:43:23.220
it is basically, almost answering that like,

04:43:23.220 --> 04:43:25.700
how could they not see us type of thing almost,

04:43:25.700 --> 04:43:28.180
where he creates this incredible,

04:43:28.180 --> 04:43:29.100
I don't wanna spoil anything,

04:43:29.100 --> 04:43:33.900
but it's just the sense that like,

04:43:33.900 --> 04:43:35.500
we could have totally different perspectives

04:43:35.500 --> 04:43:36.940
with an alien race,

04:43:36.940 --> 04:43:40.460
and not even consider that the two of us

04:43:40.460 --> 04:43:42.340
are coexisting almost,

04:43:42.340 --> 04:43:43.180
I don't wanna spoil anything,

04:43:43.180 --> 04:43:45.700
it's really, really, really worth the read.

04:43:45.700 --> 04:43:47.100
Oh, you mean a different perspective,

04:43:47.100 --> 04:43:49.620
like the aliens have a different perspective than humans?

04:43:49.620 --> 04:43:50.900
Yeah, like we just like,

04:43:50.900 --> 04:43:52.980
we see with this visual light,

04:43:52.980 --> 04:43:55.060
someone could see in X-ray, et cetera,

04:43:55.060 --> 04:43:55.940
you know, like,

04:43:55.940 --> 04:43:59.700
and just the way we even come to the same perspective

04:43:59.700 --> 04:44:01.100
and like looking and observing

04:44:01.100 --> 04:44:03.700
is just so different fundamentally,

04:44:03.700 --> 04:44:04.540
that like we could,

04:44:04.540 --> 04:44:06.220
I mean, it's not quite like that,

04:44:06.220 --> 04:44:07.060
it's not like it's like,

04:44:07.060 --> 04:44:08.220
oh, they were actually on the moon,

04:44:08.220 --> 04:44:09.580
and we're, you know, it's nothing like that,

04:44:09.580 --> 04:44:14.180
but it's such a unique and incredible story,

04:44:14.180 --> 04:44:17.540
I think Andy Weir's one of the best science fiction writers,

04:44:17.540 --> 04:44:19.260
I don't, I can't say that with much authority

04:44:19.260 --> 04:44:21.700
because I don't listen to much science fiction,

04:44:21.700 --> 04:44:22.780
so zero authority,

04:44:22.780 --> 04:44:24.380
I really like Andy Weir's books,

04:44:24.380 --> 04:44:25.500
and that book is no different.

04:44:25.500 --> 04:44:26.340
Well, that sounds like,

04:44:26.340 --> 04:44:27.180
I'm really worried about that,

04:44:27.180 --> 04:44:30.180
and it sounds like I would really love it,

04:44:30.180 --> 04:44:32.540
I've definitely, I've been very,

04:44:33.660 --> 04:44:35.340
I've done a lot of reading in my life,

04:44:35.340 --> 04:44:37.140
but like the science fiction is one of the things

04:44:37.140 --> 04:44:38.660
I've been really, really weak on,

04:44:38.660 --> 04:44:39.940
I haven't really read much,

04:44:39.940 --> 04:44:41.780
and I just made more and more friends

04:44:41.780 --> 04:44:43.320
over the years recently,

04:44:44.540 --> 04:44:47.660
that say that I absolutely must read

04:44:47.660 --> 04:44:48.500
some of these things.

04:44:48.500 --> 04:44:50.020
Are you, do you physically read,

04:44:50.020 --> 04:44:52.060
or do you do audiobooks while you run and stuff?

04:44:52.060 --> 04:44:53.620
Both, I do both, yeah,

04:44:53.620 --> 04:44:55.820
but physically, I sadly don't,

04:44:55.820 --> 04:44:56.940
it's a Kindle, right?

04:44:56.940 --> 04:44:58.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:44:58.060 --> 04:45:02.020
Yeah, but while I run, I also do,

04:45:02.020 --> 04:45:06.380
so I do both, I do about on a normal day,

04:45:06.380 --> 04:45:09.780
especially now that I've been really focused on reading,

04:45:09.820 --> 04:45:14.820
it's about 60 minutes of reading on a Kindle,

04:45:14.940 --> 04:45:18.060
and one to two hours,

04:45:18.060 --> 04:45:19.940
because I run about two hours,

04:45:19.940 --> 04:45:21.900
when I don't have like other stuff,

04:45:21.900 --> 04:45:23.700
like today I won't run,

04:45:23.700 --> 04:45:24.780
so it's about three hours,

04:45:24.780 --> 04:45:26.460
so on average, I would say it's like two,

04:45:26.460 --> 04:45:28.780
two and a half hours a day that I read,

04:45:28.780 --> 04:45:30.100
and audiobooks are just the same,

04:45:30.100 --> 04:45:31.320
they're a little slower,

04:45:31.320 --> 04:45:32.620
but they're, they can,

04:45:32.620 --> 04:45:33.660
especially for the classics,

04:45:33.660 --> 04:45:36.300
they can capture some of the magic with a deep voice,

04:45:36.300 --> 04:45:38.460
usually with a British accent, I love it.

04:45:38.460 --> 04:45:41.420
I also read that, listened to, sorry,

04:45:41.420 --> 04:45:44.980
that a book on propulsion like two years ago,

04:45:44.980 --> 04:45:48.220
I remember, but I remember that was extremely difficult.

04:45:48.220 --> 04:45:49.060
Ignition?

04:45:49.060 --> 04:45:50.140
Yeah, it was Ignition.

04:45:50.140 --> 04:45:51.860
By Don D. Clark, yeah.

04:45:51.860 --> 04:45:52.900
It was very difficult to listen.

04:45:52.900 --> 04:45:54.540
Oh, yeah, I see, I don't read,

04:45:54.540 --> 04:45:56.300
I listen while I'm on road trips or running

04:45:56.300 --> 04:45:57.220
or stuff like that too,

04:45:57.220 --> 04:46:00.020
so I swear there's probably 40,

04:46:00.020 --> 04:46:02.380
or like not 40, but there's like eight minutes of,

04:46:02.380 --> 04:46:07.380
we tried BMZ 15, 13, BM4 12,

04:46:07.620 --> 04:46:11.540
RMNL, mitral microhydrogen for like,

04:46:11.540 --> 04:46:12.980
I swear it's multiple minutes

04:46:12.980 --> 04:46:15.220
of explaining one trial on something,

04:46:15.220 --> 04:46:17.700
because there's just so many different chemicals they try,

04:46:17.700 --> 04:46:20.100
I don't know, it's almost a joke,

04:46:20.100 --> 04:46:22.620
like I literally audibly laughed out loud listening to it,

04:46:22.620 --> 04:46:24.380
because I'm like, this is so ridiculous,

04:46:24.380 --> 04:46:25.540
I'm sure it makes sense reading it,

04:46:25.540 --> 04:46:27.860
but like listening to it is just hilarious,

04:46:27.860 --> 04:46:28.860
but it's great though.

04:46:30.140 --> 04:46:31.860
What do you think of some of the challenges

04:46:31.860 --> 04:46:33.660
for long-term space travel?

04:46:33.660 --> 04:46:36.340
Do you think about this kind of stuff, the biological stuff?

04:46:37.340 --> 04:46:40.860
Do you worry, do you think about radiation on Mars

04:46:42.300 --> 04:46:45.660
and out in space over periods of,

04:46:45.660 --> 04:46:47.460
actually the effects on the human body,

04:46:47.460 --> 04:46:49.100
forget even the radiation,

04:46:49.100 --> 04:46:51.100
over periods of months and years?

04:46:51.100 --> 04:46:56.100
Yeah, I think realistically we have a really good handle

04:46:56.620 --> 04:46:59.660
on what the effects are,

04:46:59.660 --> 04:47:02.460
and we actually have the solution to like everything,

04:47:02.460 --> 04:47:05.740
it's just whether or not we can,

04:47:06.220 --> 04:47:08.420
for instance, low-earth orbit,

04:47:08.420 --> 04:47:10.420
one of the biggest challenges eventually

04:47:10.420 --> 04:47:12.540
after your long-term space travel

04:47:12.540 --> 04:47:15.420
is bone density loss and not having gravity,

04:47:15.420 --> 04:47:18.180
you actually have issues with a handful of things,

04:47:18.180 --> 04:47:22.220
and artificial gravity is easy in terms of,

04:47:22.220 --> 04:47:24.980
relatively easy in terms of space flight,

04:47:24.980 --> 04:47:27.980
you can have two vehicles just tethered together

04:47:27.980 --> 04:47:30.700
and just spinning,

04:47:30.700 --> 04:47:33.580
give it enough distance and a decent enough spin velocity,

04:47:34.500 --> 04:47:37.420
you can get one gene relatively easy,

04:47:37.420 --> 04:47:39.020
we're talking again, relatively easy,

04:47:39.020 --> 04:47:41.380
especially after talking about theoretical physics,

04:47:41.380 --> 04:47:44.500
that's easy stuff, we haven't done that yet,

04:47:44.500 --> 04:47:46.780
but there's no reason

04:47:46.780 --> 04:47:48.500
why we can't produce artificial gravity,

04:47:48.500 --> 04:47:52.140
if we say that that's a big enough hurdle

04:47:52.140 --> 04:47:54.140
that we absolutely have to overcome this,

04:47:54.140 --> 04:47:56.540
okay, cool, we'll just spin up two vehicles

04:47:56.540 --> 04:47:58.940
that are going to Mars and people will have,

04:47:58.940 --> 04:48:00.980
but that's the thing is Mars is only about,

04:48:00.980 --> 04:48:03.180
we'll say six months there,

04:48:03.180 --> 04:48:05.980
then you're hanging on Mars, you have 38% of gravity,

04:48:05.980 --> 04:48:08.060
and then six months-ish back,

04:48:08.060 --> 04:48:10.660
people live on the International Space Station

04:48:10.660 --> 04:48:13.300
at six months stints, we've had people for basically a year

04:48:13.300 --> 04:48:15.100
up on the International Space Station,

04:48:15.100 --> 04:48:17.620
it's not like it's not life altering,

04:48:17.620 --> 04:48:18.780
yeah, you have a couple of days

04:48:18.780 --> 04:48:20.980
of not being able to walk very well,

04:48:20.980 --> 04:48:22.620
and you do have some bone density loss

04:48:22.620 --> 04:48:24.260
and some other concerns,

04:48:24.260 --> 04:48:26.900
but again, it's solvable,

04:48:26.900 --> 04:48:30.060
and I think the first mission is to Mars,

04:48:30.060 --> 04:48:33.580
I think it might, we'll probably do the trade,

04:48:33.580 --> 04:48:36.900
is it worth it to land on Mars and have a crippled crew

04:48:36.900 --> 04:48:41.100
that can't even physically stand yet for a day or two

04:48:41.100 --> 04:48:43.500
before they get their feet from underneath them,

04:48:43.500 --> 04:48:48.100
or do we need to spin up two spacecraft or a tether

04:48:48.100 --> 04:48:50.460
and have, you can't do it like Starship,

04:48:50.460 --> 04:48:52.620
even though it's 30 feet wide or nine meters wide,

04:48:52.620 --> 04:48:55.340
if you spin it on that one axis,

04:48:55.340 --> 04:48:59.140
that's not enough space to get one G

04:48:59.180 --> 04:49:00.380
without your feet and your head

04:49:00.380 --> 04:49:02.500
being at two different velocities,

04:49:02.500 --> 04:49:03.940
so you get really sick,

04:49:03.940 --> 04:49:05.420
you'll always feel like you're falling,

04:49:05.420 --> 04:49:08.380
your brain will tell you that you're falling constantly,

04:49:08.380 --> 04:49:10.660
but then again, okay, so this is a whole thing,

04:49:10.660 --> 04:49:13.460
and I don't know if there's,

04:49:13.460 --> 04:49:16.460
we don't really have the data yet on going from zero G,

04:49:16.460 --> 04:49:17.780
we know the effects of that,

04:49:17.780 --> 04:49:19.860
we know the effects of one G really well,

04:49:19.860 --> 04:49:22.220
that's our majority of our data set,

04:49:22.220 --> 04:49:23.420
but we don't really have much data

04:49:23.420 --> 04:49:27.220
on the long-term effects of one sixth gravity,

04:49:27.220 --> 04:49:29.340
like on the moon, or 38% gravity,

04:49:29.340 --> 04:49:31.900
is one sixth gravity actually enough

04:49:31.900 --> 04:49:36.060
to counteract 95% of the effects of low gravity,

04:49:36.060 --> 04:49:38.660
or is it 15, is it one sixth,

04:49:38.660 --> 04:49:43.020
is it like a linear thing, is 38% gravity totally,

04:49:43.020 --> 04:49:45.660
38% as bad as one or whatever,

04:49:45.660 --> 04:49:48.560
is it a slight, where is it at on the scale?

04:49:48.560 --> 04:49:50.380
So there's a chance that we don't need anywhere

04:49:50.380 --> 04:49:52.540
near one G of gravity to counteract

04:49:52.540 --> 04:49:54.260
the bulk majority of these problems,

04:49:54.260 --> 04:49:58.620
we could have 0.1 G, or whatever is the right compromise

04:49:58.620 --> 04:50:03.460
of vehicle complexity, and human biology,

04:50:03.460 --> 04:50:05.820
and all of these other effects,

04:50:05.820 --> 04:50:08.100
this is absolutely a solvable thing, that is.

04:50:08.100 --> 04:50:11.940
And we figure some of this out through just experimentation.

04:50:11.940 --> 04:50:12.780
100%.

04:50:12.780 --> 04:50:13.600
Along the way.

04:50:13.600 --> 04:50:14.440
Yep.

04:50:14.440 --> 04:50:15.740
One of the, this is back to my dating life,

04:50:15.740 --> 04:50:18.660
I think one of the essential fundamental research questions

04:50:18.660 --> 04:50:23.100
I'm wondering about is the dynamics,

04:50:23.100 --> 04:50:27.860
and so the details of how you have sex in space.

04:50:29.100 --> 04:50:30.700
Asking for a friend, of course.

04:50:30.700 --> 04:50:33.740
I mean, there literally is sort of work on this, right?

04:50:33.740 --> 04:50:37.180
Cause like, if you think about long-term space travel,

04:50:37.180 --> 04:50:42.180
I mean, sex is sort of like the,

04:50:42.180 --> 04:50:43.900
there's the recreational aspect of sex,

04:50:43.900 --> 04:50:46.200
but the most important aspect of sex

04:50:46.200 --> 04:50:51.200
for long-term space travel is procreation is,

04:50:51.400 --> 04:50:54.120
and also the full biological cycle of that,

04:50:54.120 --> 04:50:56.720
so from the embryo, the development of the baby,

04:50:56.720 --> 04:50:59.040
the giving the birth, and all that kind of stuff.

04:50:59.040 --> 04:51:02.960
So like, you know, there's a lot of really difficult

04:51:04.040 --> 04:51:06.920
problems of biology there to understand,

04:51:06.920 --> 04:51:08.560
and perhaps to solve.

04:51:08.560 --> 04:51:11.040
Some of that, again, just like you said brilliantly,

04:51:11.040 --> 04:51:13.600
some of that can be just solved with engineering

04:51:13.600 --> 04:51:14.600
outside of the human body

04:51:14.600 --> 04:51:18.260
by creating a gravitational field like that,

04:51:18.260 --> 04:51:20.160
but maybe along the way, you can figure out

04:51:20.160 --> 04:51:21.840
how to do that without doing it,

04:51:21.840 --> 04:51:23.500
if we're balancing the cost and so on.

04:51:23.500 --> 04:51:25.520
And radiation's the other thing.

04:51:25.520 --> 04:51:28.520
We know we have a really good data set

04:51:28.520 --> 04:51:31.040
on what radiation and doses do to humans.

04:51:31.040 --> 04:51:33.280
We know, we can measure radiation,

04:51:33.280 --> 04:51:35.360
we know we can approximate, you know,

04:51:35.360 --> 04:51:38.200
and kind of give edge cases for the Mars transient

04:51:38.200 --> 04:51:40.080
and getting to Mars and being on Mars.

04:51:40.080 --> 04:51:42.400
And the simple answer to that is like,

04:51:42.400 --> 04:51:44.800
at the end of the day, if we have to, you know,

04:51:44.800 --> 04:51:48.160
dig into Mars or find a tunnel to live in

04:51:48.160 --> 04:51:50.160
so you get some extra mass in between you

04:51:50.160 --> 04:51:52.160
and cosmic radiation, so be it.

04:51:52.160 --> 04:51:53.920
Like that's the answer then.

04:51:53.920 --> 04:51:56.560
Again, none of these are like insolvable problems.

04:51:56.560 --> 04:51:59.280
They're just things, hurdles you would have to overcome

04:51:59.280 --> 04:52:04.080
based on, you know, the risk exposure and the posture there.

04:52:04.080 --> 04:52:08.580
Imagine being the first child,

04:52:08.580 --> 04:52:11.960
the first baby born outside of Earth.

04:52:12.920 --> 04:52:13.760
That'd be pretty cool.

04:52:13.760 --> 04:52:14.600
Yeah, that'll be.

04:52:14.600 --> 04:52:17.480
I would love to be alive to see that.

04:52:17.480 --> 04:52:18.680
That'll be a big one.

04:52:18.680 --> 04:52:19.680
I don't know if he'll,

04:52:22.040 --> 04:52:24.880
I don't know, because it's such a dangerous thing.

04:52:24.880 --> 04:52:26.000
It's so risky.

04:52:26.000 --> 04:52:27.840
I think that could be in our lifetime.

04:52:27.840 --> 04:52:28.680
You think so?

04:52:28.680 --> 04:52:31.480
Yeah, I would like to think in a perfect world

04:52:31.480 --> 04:52:35.000
of overthinking futurism that in 30 to 50 years,

04:52:35.000 --> 04:52:36.840
I definitely think we could have a full-time,

04:52:36.840 --> 04:52:40.480
like permanent major civilizations, you know,

04:52:40.480 --> 04:52:44.520
like what Blue Origin wants to develop

04:52:44.520 --> 04:52:47.160
where they have a huge like sphere, you know,

04:52:47.320 --> 04:52:51.440
you're doing a lot of, especially heavy industry

04:52:51.440 --> 04:52:52.880
off of Earth, so you're not polluting Earth.

04:52:52.880 --> 04:52:55.060
Like that makes so much sense to me.

04:52:56.160 --> 04:53:00.480
Yeah, I think we could live in a lifetime where,

04:53:00.480 --> 04:53:03.000
you know, we've thought this since the 50s and 60s

04:53:03.000 --> 04:53:04.800
that people are gonna be living and working in space,

04:53:04.800 --> 04:53:06.800
like crazy, and at any given point,

04:53:06.800 --> 04:53:09.040
we're lucky to have 12 people in space today.

04:53:10.820 --> 04:53:12.280
But I really think in our lifetime,

04:53:12.280 --> 04:53:14.280
we're finally getting to that point of,

04:53:15.280 --> 04:53:17.240
yeah, that that's a reality.

04:53:17.240 --> 04:53:19.680
Let me, because you mentioned Blue Origin,

04:53:19.680 --> 04:53:23.320
can we just lay out some of the competitors to SpaceX?

04:53:23.320 --> 04:53:27.080
So much of what we talked about is SpaceX,

04:53:27.080 --> 04:53:29.680
specifically because they're sort of pushing the boundaries

04:53:29.680 --> 04:53:31.760
of what's possible in the commercial space flight,

04:53:31.760 --> 04:53:33.240
but there's a lot of, like you said,

04:53:33.240 --> 04:53:36.040
incredible work being done for large companies,

04:53:36.040 --> 04:53:38.360
and small companies, startups, and so on.

04:53:38.360 --> 04:53:40.960
So who are the competitors to SpaceX?

04:53:40.960 --> 04:53:44.000
ULA, you know, Launch Alliance, Blue Origin,

04:53:44.760 --> 04:53:47.560
it's a Virgin, is it Galactic Orbit?

04:53:47.560 --> 04:53:49.600
Orbit would be the competitor.

04:53:49.600 --> 04:53:52.640
Virgin Orbit, there's Rocket Labs,

04:53:52.640 --> 04:53:54.340
Electron Rocket that you mentioned.

04:53:55.920 --> 04:53:58.240
There's the folks you covered, Firefly.

04:53:58.240 --> 04:53:59.080
Yep, yep.

04:53:59.080 --> 04:54:01.000
And what are we missing?

04:54:01.000 --> 04:54:05.640
There's the epic space launch system from NASA,

04:54:05.640 --> 04:54:06.720
I guess that is, yeah.

04:54:06.720 --> 04:54:09.120
Thankfully NASA, but Prime Contractor, Boeing and-

04:54:09.120 --> 04:54:10.440
Boeing and Lockheed.

04:54:10.440 --> 04:54:11.280
Lockheed.

04:54:11.280 --> 04:54:13.360
Yeah, North was the boosters, yep.

04:54:13.440 --> 04:54:16.240
Nice, so like what's interesting to say

04:54:16.240 --> 04:54:18.640
to lay out the land here that you're excited about?

04:54:18.640 --> 04:54:21.320
Just in general, I think if you aren't working

04:54:21.320 --> 04:54:24.080
on a reusable, some form of reusable vehicle,

04:54:24.080 --> 04:54:27.040
like physically working on it, pen to paper,

04:54:27.040 --> 04:54:29.560
not beyond pen to paper, like bending metal

04:54:29.560 --> 04:54:32.680
for a reusable vehicle, you're gone, you're toast.

04:54:32.680 --> 04:54:37.680
I think we're well into that being the only provable,

04:54:37.800 --> 04:54:39.560
you know, way forward.

04:54:39.560 --> 04:54:41.560
The only way you're gonna compete and survive

04:54:41.560 --> 04:54:43.240
is a reusable rocket.

04:54:44.120 --> 04:54:44.960
Fully reusable would be great,

04:54:44.960 --> 04:54:47.960
but that's obviously massively aspirational still,

04:54:47.960 --> 04:54:49.240
but it will come.

04:54:49.240 --> 04:54:53.280
But to me, yeah, the list, you pretty much had it

04:54:53.280 --> 04:54:54.520
right on the head.

04:54:54.520 --> 04:54:57.440
There's Astra was another orbital rocket company.

04:55:00.040 --> 04:55:00.880
There's a lot of companies.

04:55:00.880 --> 04:55:04.240
I think right now the ones that I personally

04:55:04.240 --> 04:55:08.360
really believe in, you know, Rocket Lab is awesome.

04:55:08.360 --> 04:55:11.000
I really think that they are one of the few

04:55:11.000 --> 04:55:12.320
that I believe can actually build

04:55:12.360 --> 04:55:17.000
a Falcon 9 class rocket like today with their technology,

04:55:17.000 --> 04:55:19.520
with their knowledge, with their investments,

04:55:19.520 --> 04:55:21.080
with their funding, you know,

04:55:21.080 --> 04:55:22.000
and they've proven themselves.

04:55:22.000 --> 04:55:25.520
There's very few, they have actually made it look easy.

04:55:25.520 --> 04:55:27.840
I think there's a lot of startups and a lot of new rocket.

04:55:27.840 --> 04:55:30.360
There's too many launch providers popping out

04:55:30.360 --> 04:55:31.440
of the woodwork right now.

04:55:31.440 --> 04:55:33.520
They won't all survive, of course.

04:55:33.520 --> 04:55:35.880
I think realistically, if you look at like airplanes,

04:55:35.880 --> 04:55:37.880
how many airplane, you know,

04:55:37.880 --> 04:55:39.840
there's a handful of airplane manufacturers.

04:55:39.880 --> 04:55:41.480
There's not hundreds and thousands

04:55:41.480 --> 04:55:43.160
of airplane manufacturers.

04:55:43.160 --> 04:55:44.960
I think it'll be a similar thing for space flight.

04:55:44.960 --> 04:55:48.320
I think we'll see, we'll see, you know,

04:55:48.320 --> 04:55:50.840
realistically in the terms of jumbo jets and passengers,

04:55:50.840 --> 04:55:52.360
there's basically two, you know,

04:55:52.360 --> 04:55:54.000
there's Airbus and there's Boeing.

04:55:55.480 --> 04:55:58.800
So I think in the long run,

04:55:58.800 --> 04:56:01.720
there'll be two or three major players.

04:56:01.720 --> 04:56:05.920
I think there'll be, you know, 10 minor,

04:56:05.920 --> 04:56:07.680
like as far as launch providers,

04:56:07.680 --> 04:56:09.440
as far as the ones actually leaving Earth

04:56:10.040 --> 04:56:10.880
and getting into orbit,

04:56:10.880 --> 04:56:11.800
I just don't think there's a ton of room

04:56:11.800 --> 04:56:14.800
for individuality really, you know?

04:56:14.800 --> 04:56:17.560
Yeah, I would love to see it like a really serious

04:56:17.560 --> 04:56:21.440
competitor to SpaceX in the way that SpaceX does things.

04:56:21.440 --> 04:56:25.200
I don't know if ULA is quite what I,

04:56:25.200 --> 04:56:27.720
it's quite the right kind of competitor.

04:56:27.720 --> 04:56:31.120
Let me say this, ULA has all of the potential,

04:56:31.120 --> 04:56:34.760
but just operationally, they're either Lockheed Martin

04:56:34.760 --> 04:56:36.840
and Boeing's like love child,

04:56:36.840 --> 04:56:41.360
they're kind of set up in a far too traditional manner

04:56:41.360 --> 04:56:43.960
where they just really aren't given the opportunity

04:56:43.960 --> 04:56:46.720
to innovate like a lot of these startups are.

04:56:46.720 --> 04:56:49.640
So Rocket Lab is a little bit more of that nature.

04:56:49.640 --> 04:56:53.360
What do you think about sort of just Blue Origin in general?

04:56:53.360 --> 04:56:55.240
Blue Origin's, man, I,

04:56:56.600 --> 04:56:59.240
what Blue Origin has done with New Shepard is amazing

04:56:59.240 --> 04:57:02.840
and people just laud it because it's suborbital

04:57:02.840 --> 04:57:05.120
and it looks very phallic.

04:57:05.120 --> 04:57:05.960
It's.

04:57:07.160 --> 04:57:10.040
So I guess the meme matters also in this modern day.

04:57:10.040 --> 04:57:11.520
But it's sad because people don't see

04:57:11.520 --> 04:57:14.080
what they are also working on, which is New Glenn.

04:57:14.080 --> 04:57:16.800
You know, I see comments almost every day still of like,

04:57:16.800 --> 04:57:18.760
it doesn't matter because, you know,

04:57:18.760 --> 04:57:19.600
they're working on Tiny.

04:57:19.600 --> 04:57:21.760
It's like, no, New Glenn is more powerful

04:57:21.760 --> 04:57:23.520
and more capable than Falcon Heavy.

04:57:23.520 --> 04:57:26.240
New Glenn is almost more of a competitor to,

04:57:26.240 --> 04:57:28.600
not quite as to Starship, but it's almost in that class.

04:57:28.600 --> 04:57:31.040
It's a heavy lift launch vehicle.

04:57:31.040 --> 04:57:32.640
It's huge, it's crazy.

04:57:32.640 --> 04:57:33.760
It'll be nuts.

04:57:33.760 --> 04:57:35.480
They're very actively working on it.

04:57:35.480 --> 04:57:37.520
You know, I still think we're three years away

04:57:37.520 --> 04:57:40.640
from it launching, but that's a very strong competitor

04:57:40.640 --> 04:57:44.040
in the class of rockets that SpaceX is currently making.

04:57:44.040 --> 04:57:46.000
So SpaceX is currently leading the way,

04:57:46.000 --> 04:57:50.120
but that, it couldn't become a close race.

04:57:50.120 --> 04:57:53.760
And it's just, we'll just, for now we'll ignore SpaceX

04:57:53.760 --> 04:57:55.080
and we'll just kind of talk about like,

04:57:55.080 --> 04:57:57.120
I think who's kind of coming around the corner here.

04:57:57.120 --> 04:57:57.960
Who's here?

04:57:57.960 --> 04:57:59.880
So let me just do a quick overview.

04:57:59.880 --> 04:58:01.440
I'm gonna shoot myself in the foot

04:58:01.440 --> 04:58:03.160
for getting some cool people here

04:58:03.200 --> 04:58:04.400
and some exciting companies.

04:58:04.400 --> 04:58:06.440
But Relativity is one that if you,

04:58:06.440 --> 04:58:08.360
you should definitely get Tim Ellis on the show,

04:58:08.360 --> 04:58:10.960
who is the CEO of Relativity.

04:58:10.960 --> 04:58:13.120
They're doing 3D printed rockets.

04:58:13.120 --> 04:58:15.600
They're the ones that have the world's largest 3D printer.

04:58:15.600 --> 04:58:18.840
They're getting really close to their first orbital launch.

04:58:18.840 --> 04:58:19.720
The cool thing about them,

04:58:19.720 --> 04:58:21.560
the reason that I think they're exciting,

04:58:21.560 --> 04:58:24.440
the reason that I think they have the potential

04:58:24.440 --> 04:58:27.040
is just how quickly they can iterate.

04:58:27.040 --> 04:58:29.160
I think 3D printing a rocket is really dumb.

04:58:30.120 --> 04:58:33.360
I think iterating with 3D printing on a rocket is brilliant

04:58:33.360 --> 04:58:35.600
because you can literally change software

04:58:35.600 --> 04:58:38.800
and have like very little, you know, upload a file

04:58:38.800 --> 04:58:39.800
and have a new rocket.

04:58:39.800 --> 04:58:41.480
Like that's amazing.

04:58:41.480 --> 04:58:45.360
So in terms of long-term iterative process,

04:58:45.360 --> 04:58:47.760
if we're really talking about like hitting the ground running

04:58:47.760 --> 04:58:50.680
and just seeing where the evolution takes you,

04:58:50.680 --> 04:58:52.800
I think that's about as good as you can get.

04:58:52.800 --> 04:58:54.440
You know, I think what SpaceX is doing at Starbase,

04:58:54.440 --> 04:58:56.000
just physically bending cheap steel

04:58:56.000 --> 04:58:58.520
is probably also a very valid solution.

04:58:59.320 --> 04:59:01.440
So I really think, and they have the engineering chops,

04:59:01.440 --> 04:59:04.040
I think they've got some amazing people there.

04:59:04.040 --> 04:59:07.000
Again, Rocket Lab, I adore what they work on.

04:59:07.000 --> 04:59:10.120
And you know, like everyone, there's a caveat here

04:59:10.120 --> 04:59:11.600
that everything takes longer.

04:59:11.600 --> 04:59:13.240
Anything, any company tells you

04:59:13.240 --> 04:59:15.440
it's two or three times longer, just period.

04:59:15.440 --> 04:59:17.360
Rocket Lab's no different.

04:59:17.360 --> 04:59:19.640
But I really, they're working on a neutron rocket

04:59:19.640 --> 04:59:23.760
that's gonna be like, I think 8,000 to 15,000 kilograms

04:59:23.760 --> 04:59:24.600
to lower the orbit.

04:59:24.600 --> 04:59:26.320
Like it's a good medium class rocket

04:59:26.360 --> 04:59:29.560
that will compete right along with Falcon 9, hopefully.

04:59:29.560 --> 04:59:31.760
By the way, neutron would be its name, right?

04:59:31.760 --> 04:59:32.600
Yep, yep.

04:59:32.600 --> 04:59:34.560
It's not some kind of, it's not some kind of fascinating

04:59:34.560 --> 04:59:36.600
new physics breakthrough where they're using neutrons.

04:59:36.600 --> 04:59:38.160
No, no, but they are using,

04:59:38.160 --> 04:59:41.520
they're also using liquid methane and liquid oxygen.

04:59:41.520 --> 04:59:44.680
I just think it's a really, it seems like a great rocket

04:59:44.680 --> 04:59:46.960
and assuming they can actually get it flying

04:59:46.960 --> 04:59:49.200
in two or three years, I think they're gonna be,

04:59:49.200 --> 04:59:51.240
it's here to stay, you know?

04:59:51.240 --> 04:59:53.160
I'd be remiss, right now I'm editing a video

04:59:53.160 --> 04:59:54.720
from an interview with Stoke Aerospace

04:59:54.720 --> 04:59:56.320
out in Kent, Washington.

04:59:57.440 --> 04:59:58.660
It was just one of these companies

04:59:58.660 --> 05:00:00.440
that they have a long ways to go.

05:00:00.440 --> 05:00:02.360
Like they're still in the very,

05:00:02.360 --> 05:00:03.920
they're behind the curve, frankly,

05:00:03.920 --> 05:00:05.680
in terms of launch vehicles right now,

05:00:05.680 --> 05:00:07.560
because like I said, there's so many

05:00:07.560 --> 05:00:08.680
coming out of the woodwork.

05:00:08.680 --> 05:00:11.160
But the idea they're working on,

05:00:11.160 --> 05:00:15.600
their solution to a fully reusable rocket is amazing.

05:00:15.600 --> 05:00:17.880
One of the coolest concepts I've ever seen.

05:00:17.880 --> 05:00:19.120
Are you gonna cover it in the video?

05:00:19.120 --> 05:00:20.080
Yeah, yep, yep.

05:00:20.080 --> 05:00:21.520
That'll be hopefully coming out in the next,

05:00:21.520 --> 05:00:24.160
depending on what the schedule like is down there.

05:00:24.640 --> 05:00:28.240
I'm actively editing that as we speak and it is so cool.

05:00:28.240 --> 05:00:31.400
I mean, it is like, it's genius.

05:00:31.400 --> 05:00:33.720
And if they can actually get it to work,

05:00:33.720 --> 05:00:34.720
I can see them merging.

05:00:34.720 --> 05:00:36.800
I can for sure see someone potentially,

05:00:36.800 --> 05:00:38.840
like I perfectly, in a perfect world,

05:00:38.840 --> 05:00:40.520
they've merged with Rocket Lab.

05:00:40.520 --> 05:00:43.000
They, Stoke develops the upper stage

05:00:43.000 --> 05:00:44.960
and maybe even the engines, they are.

05:00:44.960 --> 05:00:47.920
The two guys, the CEO, the co-founders of that company

05:00:49.600 --> 05:00:53.200
they are engine, like propulsion engineer magnificence.

05:00:53.200 --> 05:00:55.880
They have, they used to, they both have worked at Blue.

05:00:55.880 --> 05:00:57.400
They developed engines in a hurry there

05:00:57.400 --> 05:00:59.240
and then left Blue when it felt like

05:00:59.240 --> 05:01:00.360
it was getting too slow for them.

05:01:00.360 --> 05:01:03.040
And now they are, I mean, these guys fired

05:01:03.040 --> 05:01:06.840
a 15 chambered rocket engine instead of four

05:01:06.840 --> 05:01:08.640
from the Soviet and we're talking 15 chambers,

05:01:08.640 --> 05:01:12.880
single turbo pump, 70 times in the month of October.

05:01:12.880 --> 05:01:14.160
Wow.

05:01:14.160 --> 05:01:15.880
That's impressive. Wow.

05:01:15.880 --> 05:01:17.600
And that's like, that was on average, you know,

05:01:17.600 --> 05:01:20.160
if you think about like days off, time off,

05:01:20.200 --> 05:01:23.640
you know, parts changing over twice a day

05:01:23.640 --> 05:01:26.240
on average of a hydro locks engine.

05:01:26.240 --> 05:01:27.160
That's insane.

05:01:27.160 --> 05:01:30.360
So I, I love them and I hope the best for them,

05:01:31.600 --> 05:01:33.000
but they're also topical right now.

05:01:33.000 --> 05:01:33.920
They're at top of my head.

05:01:33.920 --> 05:01:36.000
So what about Firefly?

05:01:36.000 --> 05:01:38.640
What I like about Firefly, they've already got

05:01:38.640 --> 05:01:40.640
kind of a traditional aerospace backing.

05:01:40.640 --> 05:01:42.440
They're starting to buddy up a lot with Northrop Grumman.

05:01:42.440 --> 05:01:44.360
So they're going to be building the booster stage

05:01:44.360 --> 05:01:46.440
for Antares, which is currently flying

05:01:46.440 --> 05:01:48.440
only out of Wallops, Virginia.

05:01:48.440 --> 05:01:50.560
And is one of the only other commercial providers

05:01:50.560 --> 05:01:51.560
for the international space station.

05:01:51.560 --> 05:01:54.880
And Northrop Grumman is a very traditional aerospace company,

05:01:54.880 --> 05:01:57.320
you know, like lots of solid rocket boosters

05:01:57.320 --> 05:02:01.240
and they've purchased, ironically, their current Antares

05:02:01.240 --> 05:02:04.640
is reliant on Russian engines and Ukrainian boosters.

05:02:04.640 --> 05:02:06.120
Two things that I don't think you're going to be able

05:02:06.120 --> 05:02:08.040
to get your hands on too much anymore.

05:02:08.040 --> 05:02:13.040
So they're looking to some US propulsion and stages.

05:02:13.120 --> 05:02:16.720
So they actually are partnering with Firefly

05:02:16.720 --> 05:02:20.120
and their new Antares rocket will be a first stage

05:02:20.120 --> 05:02:21.360
built entirely by Firefly.

05:02:21.360 --> 05:02:23.840
So I'm excited that Firefly already has

05:02:23.840 --> 05:02:25.920
the propulsion technology.

05:02:25.920 --> 05:02:27.920
And they actually developed, ironically,

05:02:27.920 --> 05:02:30.280
their tap-off cycle engine was developed

05:02:30.280 --> 05:02:32.960
in partnership with Ukraine, with Ukrainian engineers

05:02:33.880 --> 05:02:36.280
who developed the whole turbo pump system.

05:02:36.280 --> 05:02:41.060
So it's like, it's this cool meddling of these worlds.

05:02:42.000 --> 05:02:44.760
Their former CEO, Tom Rekusik was,

05:02:44.760 --> 05:02:45.800
like I have an interview with him

05:02:45.800 --> 05:02:50.800
and he's anyone that can just spout nuances and facts.

05:02:50.880 --> 05:02:53.880
I just love, I just soaked that guy's information

05:02:53.880 --> 05:02:56.320
up as best I could, because he is brilliant.

05:02:56.320 --> 05:03:00.400
Literally a doctor, a rocket doctor, you know, it's so.

05:03:00.400 --> 05:03:02.000
Yeah, I mean, that's what, like you said,

05:03:02.000 --> 05:03:03.320
the fascinating thing about these folks,

05:03:03.320 --> 05:03:06.360
they're legit, they're such great engineers,

05:03:06.360 --> 05:03:08.360
the people that bring these rockets to life.

05:03:08.360 --> 05:03:11.200
And then there's all this stuff that we know

05:03:11.200 --> 05:03:14.400
and don't know about in China and other parts

05:03:14.400 --> 05:03:16.680
and other nations that are putting stuff into orbit.

05:03:16.680 --> 05:03:18.520
One of the sad things also is like, you know,

05:03:18.520 --> 05:03:21.520
with Lockheed and Boeing is,

05:03:22.880 --> 05:03:24.840
and just military applications in general,

05:03:24.840 --> 05:03:29.000
there's so much technology that's currently being developed

05:03:29.000 --> 05:03:30.680
that we probably know nothing about.

05:03:30.680 --> 05:03:31.560
Yeah.

05:03:31.560 --> 05:03:34.960
And Ed, it makes me a little bit sad, of course.

05:03:34.960 --> 05:03:36.280
Yeah.

05:03:36.280 --> 05:03:37.240
For several reasons.

05:03:37.240 --> 05:03:40.220
One is that the use of that technology is,

05:03:40.220 --> 05:03:44.500
that has really much, like, it's not that inspiring.

05:03:44.500 --> 05:03:46.100
It's like a very military focus.

05:03:46.100 --> 05:03:47.140
Yeah, it's to kill someone.

05:03:47.140 --> 05:03:48.900
It's to kill someone, yeah.

05:03:48.900 --> 05:03:52.740
There's not even like a side application.

05:03:52.740 --> 05:03:53.580
Right.

05:03:53.580 --> 05:03:55.660
And the big one is that the secret,

05:03:55.660 --> 05:03:58.460
it's shot in secrecy as opposed to being

05:03:58.460 --> 05:03:59.740
a source of inspiration.

05:03:59.740 --> 05:04:00.660
Yeah, 100%.

05:04:00.660 --> 05:04:02.660
But that's the way of the world.

05:04:02.660 --> 05:04:04.700
Like, what was that one plane that you covered

05:04:04.700 --> 05:04:06.860
that was like, we know nothing about?

05:04:06.860 --> 05:04:08.100
Oh, the X-37B.

05:04:08.100 --> 05:04:09.300
Yeah, X-37B.

05:04:09.300 --> 05:04:11.820
Yeah, orbited for over 900 days and returned.

05:04:11.820 --> 05:04:13.460
Like, yeah, I want to know about that thing.

05:04:13.460 --> 05:04:14.300
What's that thing up to?

05:04:14.300 --> 05:04:15.140
I don't know.

05:04:15.140 --> 05:04:17.100
That's what's, it's so frustrating.

05:04:17.100 --> 05:04:19.900
We know when it launches, people, you know,

05:04:19.900 --> 05:04:22.740
amateurs track and know, they even will be like,

05:04:22.740 --> 05:04:23.820
oh, it changed orbit.

05:04:23.820 --> 05:04:26.300
You know, it raised and lowered its orbit, blah, blah, blah.

05:04:26.300 --> 05:04:28.460
We generally have just almost no idea

05:04:28.460 --> 05:04:29.580
what it's doing up there.

05:04:29.580 --> 05:04:32.820
And it just saddens me, because I want to know.

05:04:32.820 --> 05:04:35.420
And it's awesome, it's a great vehicle.

05:04:35.420 --> 05:04:37.660
War, what is it good for?

05:04:38.660 --> 05:04:41.740
You mentioned Kerbal Space Program, the video game.

05:04:41.740 --> 05:04:44.060
Someone asked you what video game you recommend

05:04:44.060 --> 05:04:45.620
for learning about space and rockets.

05:04:45.620 --> 05:04:49.660
And you said, duh, Kerbal Space Program.

05:04:49.660 --> 05:04:50.860
So tell me about this game.

05:04:50.860 --> 05:04:52.020
What is this game?

05:04:52.020 --> 05:04:56.140
And I also saw, heard that a second one is coming out.

05:04:56.140 --> 05:05:01.140
So what, you know, I've been playing more games recently

05:05:02.580 --> 05:05:05.940
because games are fun and they remind you

05:05:06.020 --> 05:05:07.260
that life is awesome.

05:05:08.300 --> 05:05:10.340
So why should I play this game?

05:05:10.340 --> 05:05:13.620
If you want to learn about rockets, how to fly,

05:05:13.620 --> 05:05:14.940
how to build, how to get into orbit,

05:05:14.940 --> 05:05:18.100
how to get to other planets, there's no better way

05:05:18.100 --> 05:05:20.580
to learn about rockets than playing Kerbal Space Program.

05:05:20.580 --> 05:05:21.460
What does it entail?

05:05:21.460 --> 05:05:22.980
Like, do you actually like?

05:05:22.980 --> 05:05:27.500
It's like SimCity and Microsoft Flight Simulator for rockets.

05:05:27.500 --> 05:05:28.340
Oh, interesting.

05:05:28.340 --> 05:05:31.260
So you will get to like, what, do you design the rockets?

05:05:31.260 --> 05:05:34.300
Yeah, yeah, it's, okay.

05:05:34.300 --> 05:05:37.140
So I started playing it in like 2014, I think,

05:05:37.140 --> 05:05:39.500
around as I'm like falling in love with space.

05:05:39.500 --> 05:05:41.940
And I became obsessed with this game.

05:05:41.940 --> 05:05:46.060
Like literally you, you know, you take a,

05:05:46.060 --> 05:05:49.140
you get a little command module, click on a fuel tank,

05:05:49.140 --> 05:05:50.500
boop, you choose your engine, boop,

05:05:50.500 --> 05:05:51.940
you choose a stage connector, boop,

05:05:51.940 --> 05:05:55.060
you connect more tanks and build these space planes

05:05:55.060 --> 05:05:56.420
and fantastical things.

05:05:56.420 --> 05:05:58.380
And it's all like physics-based.

05:05:58.380 --> 05:06:00.180
It's available, this sounds like a commercial.

05:06:00.180 --> 05:06:03.140
It's available on PC and Mac and console.

05:06:03.140 --> 05:06:04.500
Like it's available everywhere.

05:06:04.500 --> 05:06:05.580
But wait, there's more.

05:06:05.580 --> 05:06:06.420
But wait, there's more.

05:06:06.420 --> 05:06:09.900
And you said like, you streamed yourself playing this.

05:06:09.900 --> 05:06:11.260
Are those any of those videos up?

05:06:11.260 --> 05:06:12.100
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:06:12.100 --> 05:06:13.740
There's some of my, actually the first videos

05:06:13.740 --> 05:06:17.780
I ever uploaded to YouTube were like recaptured streams

05:06:17.780 --> 05:06:20.860
from Twitch that I just physically uploaded to YouTube.

05:06:20.860 --> 05:06:21.780
This is awesome.

05:06:21.780 --> 05:06:23.380
And so it's me playing Kerbal.

05:06:23.380 --> 05:06:26.620
We, I used to do this kind of like a podcast style thing.

05:06:26.620 --> 05:06:27.580
I should get back into this

05:06:27.580 --> 05:06:28.780
because it's one of my favorite things I ever did.

05:06:28.780 --> 05:06:31.220
It's called, we called it Todayish in Space Fight History,

05:06:31.220 --> 05:06:33.780
but these days I'd probably just play Kerbal.

05:06:33.780 --> 05:06:35.860
But I had my friend come sit next to me.

05:06:35.860 --> 05:06:37.540
His name's Jacob.

05:06:37.540 --> 05:06:41.140
And he is a former professional pole vaulter.

05:06:41.140 --> 05:06:44.700
Just this really, knows nothing about rockets.

05:06:44.700 --> 05:06:45.900
Knows nothing about space.

05:06:45.900 --> 05:06:49.260
Hilarious, like in the sweetest, most fun way he,

05:06:49.260 --> 05:06:51.140
like he, you know, as an adult asked me,

05:06:51.140 --> 05:06:53.020
which is bigger, the Earth or the moon?

05:06:53.020 --> 05:06:54.140
And I love that for him.

05:06:54.140 --> 05:06:55.700
You know, that's fantastic.

05:06:55.700 --> 05:06:57.260
He's just a delightful human.

05:06:57.260 --> 05:06:58.460
He would sit next to me.

05:06:58.460 --> 05:07:00.620
We would recreate a historical space flight mission

05:07:00.620 --> 05:07:01.620
in Kerbal Space Program.

05:07:01.620 --> 05:07:03.260
And he would just sit there and play guitar

05:07:03.260 --> 05:07:06.260
and sing about what I'm like doing and asking questions.

05:07:06.260 --> 05:07:08.300
And it's still one of my favorite things I've ever done.

05:07:08.300 --> 05:07:09.940
Yeah, you should definitely do something like that.

05:07:09.940 --> 05:07:14.540
So basically just, yeah, shoot the shit with a friend.

05:07:14.540 --> 05:07:15.940
Get their curiosity going.

05:07:15.940 --> 05:07:18.060
Let them just sit there and ask questions.

05:07:18.060 --> 05:07:18.900
It was awesome.

05:07:18.900 --> 05:07:21.740
Like, I mean, yeah, those are some,

05:07:21.740 --> 05:07:23.060
I've done it a handful of times.

05:07:23.060 --> 05:07:25.060
I think we probably did like 20 or 30 episodes or something.

05:07:25.060 --> 05:07:27.140
And it is, it's definitely something

05:07:27.140 --> 05:07:28.380
I would like to get back to doing.

05:07:28.380 --> 05:07:31.540
Can you in the game, like go to the moon?

05:07:31.540 --> 05:07:33.740
Yeah, so it's technically a different solar system.

05:07:33.740 --> 05:07:37.500
It's the Kerbal system and you're on the planet Kerbin.

05:07:37.500 --> 05:07:39.940
So there's the Mun, M-U-N.

05:07:39.940 --> 05:07:44.020
There's a second moon in the system on this planet.

05:07:44.020 --> 05:07:45.260
It's called Minmus.

05:07:45.260 --> 05:07:47.500
They didn't want to pay licensing fees or what?

05:07:47.500 --> 05:07:49.940
Well, it's just a little easier.

05:07:49.940 --> 05:07:51.100
It's a little bit smaller.

05:07:51.100 --> 05:07:53.220
So the physics are easier.

05:07:53.220 --> 05:07:55.220
Oh, so it tries to be consistent with physics.

05:07:55.220 --> 05:07:56.060
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.

05:07:56.060 --> 05:07:58.940
Physics are all like real world physics.

05:07:58.940 --> 05:08:00.540
And I mean, there's aerosimulations,

05:08:00.540 --> 05:08:05.020
there's all of it's like one-to-one for Earth physics.

05:08:05.020 --> 05:08:07.460
It's just on an easier scale, solar system.

05:08:07.460 --> 05:08:09.580
So it's easier to navigate.

05:08:09.580 --> 05:08:11.340
But there's still like, there's a planet called Eve

05:08:11.340 --> 05:08:13.020
that's kind of like Venus.

05:08:13.020 --> 05:08:15.300
So it has a really thick atmosphere, really thick,

05:08:15.300 --> 05:08:18.620
really soupy and a lot more gravity.

05:08:18.620 --> 05:08:21.460
So it's just really, really hard to get off of.

05:08:21.460 --> 05:08:23.380
It's relatively easy to land on Eve,

05:08:23.380 --> 05:08:25.540
but that's kind of like the ultimate boss in the game

05:08:25.540 --> 05:08:26.660
is like getting off of Eve.

05:08:26.660 --> 05:08:28.540
So that's one of my favorite things to do

05:08:28.540 --> 05:08:32.540
is build these crafts to get to Eve and try to return home.

05:08:32.540 --> 05:08:34.660
You mentioned that there's almost like a podcast thing.

05:08:34.660 --> 05:08:37.140
You also did our ludicrous future.

05:08:39.420 --> 05:08:41.180
Is there a podcast in your future?

05:08:41.180 --> 05:08:42.860
Are you thinking, do you enjoy the medium?

05:08:42.860 --> 05:08:45.380
You're so incredibly good at talking.

05:08:45.380 --> 05:08:50.380
It's less effort to sort of to produce.

05:08:50.380 --> 05:08:53.420
Are you, is that something in the back of your mind also?

05:08:53.460 --> 05:08:57.140
Oh man, I love talking.

05:08:57.140 --> 05:08:58.620
Yeah, you're very good at it.

05:08:58.620 --> 05:08:59.460
I mean, yeah.

05:09:01.300 --> 05:09:06.300
I find that I, it's just the problem for me with podcasts

05:09:06.660 --> 05:09:08.660
and I think it's the podcasts that I've done

05:09:08.660 --> 05:09:10.380
have tried to be relatively topical

05:09:10.380 --> 05:09:13.340
about like the current space flight affairs.

05:09:13.340 --> 05:09:17.180
And for three or four years ago, that was actually,

05:09:17.180 --> 05:09:19.740
you know, manageable for me to keep up with.

05:09:19.740 --> 05:09:22.140
These days, man, I can't keep,

05:09:22.140 --> 05:09:24.260
I just can't keep up with it.

05:09:24.260 --> 05:09:26.180
I gave up on trying to be super topical

05:09:26.180 --> 05:09:29.420
and I realized that maybe my biggest talent

05:09:29.420 --> 05:09:31.580
and the things that resonate most with people

05:09:31.580 --> 05:09:34.340
is just trying to explain the like the basics

05:09:34.340 --> 05:09:36.460
and the root really get,

05:09:36.460 --> 05:09:38.060
so I'm really just trying to like,

05:09:39.100 --> 05:09:41.820
I'm trying to do less live streams if I can,

05:09:41.820 --> 05:09:44.020
but then again, like Starship, I gotta stream that.

05:09:44.020 --> 05:09:45.620
There's no way I'm not gonna do that.

05:09:45.620 --> 05:09:46.780
But I'm really just trying to get back

05:09:46.780 --> 05:09:48.900
to like making the deep dive videos

05:09:48.900 --> 05:09:52.060
where I have no limit on how long and how deep

05:09:52.060 --> 05:09:53.380
and just really go for it

05:09:53.380 --> 05:09:54.700
because that's actually what I love to do the most.

05:09:54.700 --> 05:09:57.780
Yeah, I mean, that's like, views aside,

05:09:57.780 --> 05:09:59.420
those are just works of genius

05:09:59.420 --> 05:10:00.900
and you're getting better and better at them

05:10:00.900 --> 05:10:05.060
and like that's the, that,

05:10:05.060 --> 05:10:07.100
in terms of the beautiful things you can create

05:10:07.100 --> 05:10:08.300
in this world, those are that.

05:10:08.300 --> 05:10:09.580
So like if you continue,

05:10:09.580 --> 05:10:13.420
especially where the way space travel is developing,

05:10:13.420 --> 05:10:15.260
like that, your voice is very much needed.

05:10:15.260 --> 05:10:20.260
So I think it's wise to do what you do best.

05:10:20.740 --> 05:10:22.780
And I think I'm feeling more and more,

05:10:22.780 --> 05:10:23.660
especially this last year,

05:10:23.660 --> 05:10:26.020
I did a lot of like live streaming and traveling

05:10:26.020 --> 05:10:28.140
back and forth between Florida and California

05:10:28.140 --> 05:10:32.580
and here and just handling major like big live streams,

05:10:32.580 --> 05:10:33.940
really stressed myself out.

05:10:33.940 --> 05:10:35.140
And at the end of the day, I was like,

05:10:35.140 --> 05:10:38.140
all of this is taking away from my ability to make videos.

05:10:38.140 --> 05:10:40.260
And that's ideally, honestly,

05:10:40.260 --> 05:10:41.980
if I like had my choice of things,

05:10:41.980 --> 05:10:43.900
I would just ignore everything else

05:10:43.900 --> 05:10:48.020
and just sit and lock myself in my house for a year

05:10:48.020 --> 05:10:49.420
and just sit there and make videos

05:10:49.420 --> 05:10:52.700
and go and travel every other month, for fun,

05:10:52.700 --> 05:10:54.540
like not for space stuff,

05:10:54.540 --> 05:10:58.180
just go and do some light traveling.

05:10:58.180 --> 05:10:59.700
Like around the moon or what?

05:11:00.580 --> 05:11:02.220
Yeah, just some light traveling.

05:11:03.780 --> 05:11:07.340
What advice would you give to young folks

05:11:07.340 --> 05:11:11.060
or just folks struggling to find their way in life,

05:11:11.060 --> 05:11:13.580
whether they're in high school, college or beyond,

05:11:14.260 --> 05:11:15.700
like how to have a life they can be proud of,

05:11:15.700 --> 05:11:17.580
how to have a career they can be proud of.

05:11:17.580 --> 05:11:20.940
You've had a really interesting journey yourself.

05:11:20.940 --> 05:11:25.740
What from that can you draw, give good advice to others?

05:11:25.740 --> 05:11:30.020
To be honest, I feel like it's so painfully obvious

05:11:30.020 --> 05:11:32.900
to follow your heart and follow what makes you happy

05:11:32.900 --> 05:11:36.460
that I'm just shocked that people allow themselves

05:11:36.460 --> 05:11:38.220
to sit on mediocrity,

05:11:38.220 --> 05:11:39.060
to just sit there and be like,

05:11:39.060 --> 05:11:40.380
well, this is just what I do.

05:11:40.380 --> 05:11:42.980
And for a lot of people, that's perfectly fine.

05:11:43.980 --> 05:11:46.340
Some of my best friends are clocking in and out

05:11:46.340 --> 05:11:47.260
and they're perfectly happy.

05:11:47.260 --> 05:11:48.180
They have a wonderful life.

05:11:48.180 --> 05:11:51.100
Absolutely no judgment there, of course.

05:11:51.100 --> 05:11:55.220
But for people that are stuck feeling like they're not sure

05:11:55.220 --> 05:11:59.620
of what's next and how to bring light into their world,

05:11:59.620 --> 05:12:02.420
you really just gotta listen to what does make you happy.

05:12:02.420 --> 05:12:03.580
People feel guilty about,

05:12:03.580 --> 05:12:05.660
oh, I play video games for eight hours,

05:12:05.660 --> 05:12:07.980
then start learning how to make a video game,

05:12:07.980 --> 05:12:10.300
learn how to do reviews of video games or make,

05:12:11.020 --> 05:12:13.060
you can work in the video game industry.

05:12:13.060 --> 05:12:16.260
You don't have to isolate your love from your work.

05:12:16.260 --> 05:12:21.260
And it's just funny that maybe you feel guilty

05:12:22.140 --> 05:12:22.980
that you drink too much.

05:12:22.980 --> 05:12:25.340
Okay, I don't know if that's a good advice.

05:12:25.340 --> 05:12:28.260
Go learn how to make alcohol.

05:12:28.260 --> 05:12:29.100
Start a liquor company.

05:12:29.100 --> 05:12:29.940
Yeah, start a liquor company.

05:12:29.940 --> 05:12:31.780
I mean, maybe that's a terrible advice.

05:12:31.780 --> 05:12:34.740
It's great advice, but it's also in your own story.

05:12:34.740 --> 05:12:36.940
It seems like you've almost stumbled on,

05:12:38.340 --> 05:12:39.980
some of it is just exploration

05:12:40.660 --> 05:12:42.660
and keeping your mind and heart open

05:12:42.660 --> 05:12:45.180
to discovering that thing that grabs you.

05:12:45.180 --> 05:12:46.020
It's not-

05:12:46.020 --> 05:12:47.980
What are you fall asleep thinking about?

05:12:47.980 --> 05:12:51.260
But you stumbled on the space almost accidentally, right?

05:12:51.260 --> 05:12:56.260
I mean, when you were being a professional photographer,

05:12:56.660 --> 05:12:58.060
would you have known?

05:12:58.060 --> 05:12:59.100
Oh, no.

05:12:59.100 --> 05:13:00.580
Well, do you wanna know what I wanted to be

05:13:00.580 --> 05:13:01.420
when I was a kid?

05:13:01.420 --> 05:13:02.260
What's that?

05:13:02.260 --> 05:13:04.020
Well, first, when I was young, I wanted to be a tractor.

05:13:04.020 --> 05:13:07.180
I'm not quite sure I understood how that works.

05:13:07.180 --> 05:13:09.540
Then I wanted to be a scorpion trainer.

05:13:10.100 --> 05:13:12.020
I thought I could train them to cut people's lawns.

05:13:12.020 --> 05:13:12.860
Better and better?

05:13:12.860 --> 05:13:13.700
Yep, yep.

05:13:13.700 --> 05:13:16.060
And then, honestly, the majority of my childhood-

05:13:16.060 --> 05:13:16.900
People's lawns, God.

05:13:16.900 --> 05:13:18.740
I think your understanding of physics early on

05:13:18.740 --> 05:13:19.580
was just a little-

05:13:19.580 --> 05:13:21.860
The pinchers, man, the pinchers.

05:13:21.860 --> 05:13:26.860
Then from probably six until early college,

05:13:26.860 --> 05:13:29.220
I wanted to be a prosthetic engineer.

05:13:29.220 --> 05:13:34.220
And never once did I think about anything rockets, really.

05:13:34.380 --> 05:13:37.260
I had a space shuttle poster.

05:13:37.260 --> 05:13:39.340
I had some space shuttle Legos.

05:13:40.180 --> 05:13:42.660
I liked space and I knew of the space shuttle,

05:13:42.660 --> 05:13:45.540
but it was far down the list

05:13:45.540 --> 05:13:47.660
as far as things that I thought were cool.

05:13:48.620 --> 05:13:51.980
Ninja Turtles, Lamborghini Countach,

05:13:51.980 --> 05:13:54.180
B-17G, Flying Fortress.

05:13:54.180 --> 05:13:55.860
Yeah, I guess that means-

05:13:55.860 --> 05:13:57.740
If you just keep your heart open

05:13:57.740 --> 05:14:00.580
to falling in love with an idea, with a passion, yeah.

05:14:00.580 --> 05:14:02.340
You could start from that,

05:14:02.340 --> 05:14:05.300
from Ninja Turtles and scorpions cutting the lawn,

05:14:05.300 --> 05:14:10.300
to being one of the best, one of the top educators,

05:14:10.980 --> 05:14:13.620
inspirational figures in space,

05:14:13.620 --> 05:14:16.140
and actually traveling around the moon.

05:14:16.140 --> 05:14:18.660
And who knows, maybe one day stepping foot on the moon

05:14:18.660 --> 05:14:21.340
and Mars, even though you say you're not interested,

05:14:21.340 --> 05:14:24.220
it seems like you stating that you're not interested

05:14:24.220 --> 05:14:29.220
in certain things somehow results in you doing those things.

05:14:29.260 --> 05:14:31.180
My friends joke that I'm gonna be the first person

05:14:31.180 --> 05:14:32.580
to go to the moon against their will.

05:14:32.580 --> 05:14:34.980
Yeah, it's like, I guess, all right.

05:14:35.540 --> 05:14:37.740
This is, all right, what's the food like up here?

05:14:37.740 --> 05:14:38.580
Guys, we're gonna start a fundraiser.

05:14:38.580 --> 05:14:42.060
Please, Tim just doesn't wanna go, you know?

05:14:42.060 --> 05:14:43.980
Definitely don't want to do it.

05:14:43.980 --> 05:14:45.820
All right, Tim, you're an incredible person.

05:14:45.820 --> 05:14:47.100
Thank you so much for everything you do.

05:14:47.100 --> 05:14:49.460
I've been a fan of yours for a long time.

05:14:49.460 --> 05:14:52.140
Not just the content, but just who you are as a human being,

05:14:52.140 --> 05:14:54.340
just how excited you are for everything.

05:14:54.340 --> 05:14:56.700
It's just an inspiration, you're a joy to watch.

05:14:56.700 --> 05:14:57.940
Thank you for being you.

05:14:57.940 --> 05:15:00.540
Thank you for doing the stuff you're doing.

05:15:00.540 --> 05:15:03.140
I can't wait to see what you do next, man.

05:15:03.140 --> 05:15:04.900

And now, let me leave you with some words from H.G. Wells.

05:15:18.740 --> 05:15:22.020
Life, forever dying to be born afresh,

05:15:22.020 --> 05:15:24.140
forever young and eager,

05:15:24.140 --> 05:15:27.780
will presently stand upon this earth as upon a footstool

05:15:27.780 --> 05:15:31.460
and stretch out its realm amidst the stars.

05:15:31.460 --> 05:15:35.620
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
