WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.840
You can study chemistry, you can study physics,

00:01.840 --> 00:04.300
you can study geology anywhere in the universe,

00:04.300 --> 00:07.140
but this is the only place you can study biology.

00:07.140 --> 00:08.720
This is the only place to be a biologist.

00:08.720 --> 00:09.560
Earth.

00:09.560 --> 00:10.380
That's it.

00:10.380 --> 00:11.220
Yeah.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.680
So definitely something very fundamental happened here

00:13.680 --> 00:16.000
and you cannot take biology out of the equation.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.240
If you wanna understand how that vast chemistry space,

00:19.240 --> 00:23.960
how that general sequence space got narrowed down

00:23.960 --> 00:28.600
to what is available or what is used by life,

00:28.640 --> 00:31.380
you need to understand the rules of selection

00:31.380 --> 00:34.220
and that's when evolution and biology comes into play.

00:36.440 --> 00:39.680
The following is a conversation with Batul Kachar,

00:39.680 --> 00:42.340
an astrobiologist at University of Wisconsin

00:42.340 --> 00:46.840
studying the essential biological attributes of life.

00:46.840 --> 00:48.720
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.600
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:50.600 --> 00:53.680
in the description and now to your friends,

00:53.680 --> 00:55.740
here's Batul Kachar.

00:56.740 --> 00:59.780
What is the phylogenetic tree or the evolutionary tree

00:59.780 --> 01:02.260
of life and what can we learn by running it back

01:02.260 --> 01:04.940
and studying ancient gene sequences as you have?

01:04.940 --> 01:09.940
I think phylogenetic trees could be one of the most

01:10.100 --> 01:14.780
romantic and beautiful notions that can come out of biology.

01:14.780 --> 01:19.260
It shows us a way to depict the connectedness of life

01:19.260 --> 01:21.600
and all living beings with one another.

01:22.440 --> 01:26.240
It itself is an ever evolving notion.

01:26.240 --> 01:29.040
Biologists like visualizations.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.520
They like these graphics, these diagrams

01:31.520 --> 01:33.120
and tree of life is one of them.

01:33.120 --> 01:36.540
So the tree starts at a common ancestor.

01:36.540 --> 01:37.960
It's actually the other way around.

01:37.960 --> 01:42.280
It starts from the branches.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.880
It starts from the tip of the branch actually

01:44.880 --> 01:49.880
and then depending on what you collected to build the tree.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.160
So depending on the branches,

01:53.160 --> 01:55.040
depending on what's on the tip of the branch

01:55.040 --> 01:56.820
and I will explain what I mean.

01:56.820 --> 01:59.440
The roots will be determined by what is really sitting

01:59.440 --> 02:01.160
on the tip of the branch of the tree.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.960
So we could study the leaves of the tree

02:02.960 --> 02:04.200
by looking at what we have today

02:04.200 --> 02:06.240
and then start to reverse engineer,

02:06.240 --> 02:09.000
start to move back in time to try to understand

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
what the rest of the tree,

02:10.000 --> 02:11.160
what the roots of the tree look like.

02:11.160 --> 02:14.520
Exactly, so the tree itself by just taking a few steps back

02:14.520 --> 02:16.900
and looking at the entire tree itself

02:16.900 --> 02:20.200
can give you an idea about the connectedness,

02:21.080 --> 02:23.000
of the organisms or whatever, again,

02:23.000 --> 02:24.680
you use to create your tree.

02:24.680 --> 02:28.040
There are different ways, but in this case,

02:28.040 --> 02:32.620
I'm imagining entire diversity of life today

02:32.620 --> 02:35.400
is sitting on the tips of the branches of this tree.

02:35.400 --> 02:40.400
And we look at biologists, look at the tree itself.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.040
We like to think of it as the topology of the tree

02:45.040 --> 02:48.680
to understand when certain organisms

02:48.680 --> 02:53.440
or their ancestry may have merged over time.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.480
And depending on the tools you use,

02:56.480 --> 03:00.020
you might use this tree to then reconstruct

03:00.020 --> 03:01.960
the ancestors as well.

03:01.960 --> 03:04.840
And so what are the different ways to do the reconstruction?

03:04.840 --> 03:06.780
So you can do that at the gene level,

03:08.200 --> 03:12.640
or you could do it at the higher complex biology level.

03:12.640 --> 03:17.560
So in which way have you approached this fascinating problem?

03:17.640 --> 03:19.600
We approached it in every way we can.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.120
So it's the gene, could be protein,

03:22.120 --> 03:25.900
the product of the gene, or species,

03:25.900 --> 03:28.540
or could be even groups of species.

03:28.540 --> 03:31.800
It totally depends on what you want to do with your tree.

03:31.800 --> 03:35.280
If you wanna understand certain past events,

03:35.280 --> 03:38.480
whether an organism exchanged a certain DNA

03:38.480 --> 03:41.660
with another one along the course of evolution,

03:41.660 --> 03:43.920
you can build your tree accordingly.

03:43.920 --> 03:47.760
If you rather use the tree to reconstruct

03:47.760 --> 03:51.040
or resurrect ancient DNA, which is what we do,

03:51.040 --> 03:53.320
then in our case, for instance,

03:53.320 --> 03:55.740
we do both gene, protein, and species,

03:55.740 --> 03:58.200
because we want to compare the tree

03:59.260 --> 04:02.480
that we create using these different information.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.800
Okay, well, let me ask you the ridiculous question then.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.080
So how realistic is Jurassic Park?

04:08.280 --> 04:11.000
Can we study the genes of ancient organisms,

04:11.000 --> 04:14.400
and can we bring those ancient organisms back?

04:14.400 --> 04:16.760
So the reason I asked that kind of ridiculous

04:16.760 --> 04:19.920
sounding question is maybe it gives us context

04:19.920 --> 04:23.280
of what we can and can't do by looking back in time.

04:23.280 --> 04:27.520
Yeah, so dinosaurs or all these mammals,

04:27.520 --> 04:32.280
at least for us, is the exciting thing already happened

04:32.280 --> 04:36.400
by the time we hit to larger organisms or to eukaryotes.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.080
Or to you, the fun stuff is before we got to the mammals.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.520
The fun stuff is what people think is boring, I think.

04:42.520 --> 04:45.400
The phase that's, well, at least two different times

04:45.400 --> 04:46.640
in the geologic history.

04:46.640 --> 04:51.360
One is the first life, past origin of life,

04:51.360 --> 04:53.680
how did first life look like?

04:53.680 --> 04:57.220
And the second is why do we think that

04:57.220 --> 05:00.360
over certain periods of geologic time,

05:00.360 --> 05:02.800
no significant innovation happened

05:02.800 --> 05:05.740
to the degree of leaving no record behind?

05:05.740 --> 05:08.080
So what do we not have a record of?

05:08.920 --> 05:13.080
So you say the fun stuff to you is after the origin of life,

05:13.080 --> 05:14.200
which we'll talk about.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.040
After the origin of life, there's single cell organisms,

05:17.040 --> 05:18.960
the whole thing with the photosynthesis,

05:18.960 --> 05:20.480
the whole thing with the eukaryotes

05:20.480 --> 05:25.200
and multicell organisms, and what else is the fun stuff?

05:25.200 --> 05:28.260
The whole oxygen thing, which mixes in

05:28.260 --> 05:30.340
with the origin of life.

05:30.340 --> 05:31.760
There's a bunch of different inventions.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.160
All they have to do with is primitive

05:33.160 --> 05:36.840
kind of looking organisms that we don't have

05:36.880 --> 05:38.280
a good record of.

05:38.280 --> 05:41.760
So I will tell you the more interesting things for us.

05:41.760 --> 05:45.880
One is the origin of life or what happened, right,

05:45.880 --> 05:47.880
following the emergence of life.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.440
How did the first cells look like?

05:50.440 --> 05:54.000
And then pretty much anything that we think

05:54.000 --> 05:58.720
shaped the environment and was shaped by the environment

05:58.720 --> 06:01.520
in a way that impacted the entire planet

06:01.520 --> 06:04.480
that enabled you and I to have this conversation.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.560
We have very little understanding

06:06.560 --> 06:09.400
of the biological innovations that took place

06:09.400 --> 06:11.640
in the past of this planet.

06:11.640 --> 06:16.280
We work with a very limited set of,

06:16.280 --> 06:17.720
I don't wanna even say data

06:17.720 --> 06:19.520
because they have fossil records.

06:19.520 --> 06:23.400
So let's say imprints, either that comes from the rock

06:23.400 --> 06:28.160
and the rock record itself, or what I just described,

06:28.160 --> 06:30.220
these trees that we create

06:30.220 --> 06:32.800
and whatever we can infer about the past.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.160
So we have two distinct ways

06:35.160 --> 06:37.960
that comes from geology and biology,

06:37.960 --> 06:40.600
and they each have their limitations.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.640
Okay, so, right, so there's an interplay.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.360
The geology gives you that little bit of data,

06:47.320 --> 06:51.160
and then the biology gives you

06:51.160 --> 06:53.000
that little bit of kind of constraints

06:53.000 --> 06:55.520
in the materials you get to work with to infer

06:55.520 --> 06:58.520
how does this result in the kind of data that we're seeing.

06:58.520 --> 07:01.400
And now we can have this through the fog,

07:01.400 --> 07:05.160
we can see, we can look back hundreds of millions of years,

07:05.160 --> 07:07.720
a couple of billion years, and try to infer.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.200
Even further, and I like that you said fog.

07:10.200 --> 07:14.560
It is pretty foggy, and it gets foggier and foggier

07:14.560 --> 07:17.620
the further you try to see into the past.

07:18.520 --> 07:23.520
Biology is, you basically study the survivors,

07:23.680 --> 07:26.960
broadly speaking, and you're trying to pitch,

07:26.960 --> 07:28.440
sort of put together their history

07:28.440 --> 07:30.440
based on whatever you can recover today.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.760
What makes biology fascinating,

07:32.760 --> 07:37.760
also let it erase its own history in a way, right?

07:38.240 --> 07:40.760
So you work with this four-billion-year product,

07:40.760 --> 07:44.000
that's genome, that's the DNA, it's great.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.920
It's a very dynamic, ever-evolving chemical thing.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.800
And so you will get some information,

07:50.800 --> 07:55.320
but you're not gonna get much unless you know where to look,

07:57.360 --> 07:59.740
because it is responding to the environment.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.560
Yeah, so what we have, that's fascinating,

08:03.560 --> 08:08.560
what we have is the survivors, the successful organisms,

08:09.240 --> 08:12.360
even the primitive ones, even the bacteria we have today.

08:12.360 --> 08:15.280
So bacteria is not primitive, and we-

08:15.280 --> 08:17.760
Sorry, sorry to offend the bacteria.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.760
We should be very grateful to bacteria.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.840
First of all, they are our great, great ancestors.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.520
I like this quote by Douglas Adams,

08:25.520 --> 08:28.100
humans don't like their ancestors,

08:28.100 --> 08:31.620
they rarely invite them over for dinner, right?

08:31.620 --> 08:34.260
But bacteria is in your dinner, bacteria is in your gut,

08:34.260 --> 08:35.300
bacteria is helping you along the way.

08:35.300 --> 08:37.180
So we do invite them for dinner.

08:37.180 --> 08:39.620
Well, they'd get themselves invited in a way.

08:39.620 --> 08:43.140
And so we, and they're definitely older,

08:44.220 --> 08:48.340
and definitely very sophisticated, very resilient

08:48.340 --> 08:52.060
than anything else as someone working at,

08:52.060 --> 08:56.300
as a bacteriologist, I feel like I need to defend them

08:56.300 --> 08:58.740
in this case, because they don't get much shout out

08:58.740 --> 08:59.580
when we think about life.

08:59.580 --> 09:00.940
So you do study bacteria.

09:00.940 --> 09:03.900
So which organisms gives you hints that are alive today

09:03.900 --> 09:08.900
that give you hints about what ancient organisms were like?

09:09.020 --> 09:11.120
Is it bacteria, is it viruses?

09:11.120 --> 09:12.580
What do you study in the lab?

09:12.580 --> 09:14.660
We study a variety of different bacteria,

09:14.660 --> 09:16.820
depending on the questions that we ask.

09:16.820 --> 09:19.140
We engineer bacteria.

09:19.140 --> 09:21.220
So ideally, we wanna work with bacteria

09:21.220 --> 09:23.380
that we can engineer.

09:23.380 --> 09:26.700
Seldom we developed the tools to engineer them.

09:26.700 --> 09:31.140
And it depends on the question that we are interested in.

09:31.140 --> 09:34.900
If we are interested in connecting the biology and geology

09:34.900 --> 09:38.900
to understand the early life and fundamental innovations

09:38.900 --> 09:40.640
across billions of years,

09:40.640 --> 09:43.580
there are really good candidates like cyanobacteria.

09:43.580 --> 09:48.660
So we use cyanobacteria very frequently in the lab.

09:48.660 --> 09:50.260
We can engineer its genome,

09:50.260 --> 09:54.660
we can perturb its function by poking its own DNA

09:54.660 --> 09:58.820
with the foreign DNA that we engineer in the lab.

09:58.820 --> 10:00.940
We work with E. coli.

10:00.940 --> 10:05.580
It's the most simple in terms of model systems goes.

10:05.580 --> 10:10.380
Organism that one can study well-established sort of a pet,

10:10.380 --> 10:14.220
lab pet, that we use it a lot for cloning

10:14.220 --> 10:18.620
and for understanding basic functions of the cell,

10:18.620 --> 10:20.620
given that it's really well-studied.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.340
So, and what you do with that E. coli,

10:23.340 --> 10:25.620
you said that you inject it with foreign DNA?

10:25.620 --> 10:28.540
We inject pretty much all the bacteria that we work with,

10:28.540 --> 10:29.460
with foreign DNA.

10:29.460 --> 10:31.260
We also work with diazotrophs.

10:31.260 --> 10:33.380
These are azotobacteria.

10:33.380 --> 10:36.660
They're one of the prime nitrogen fixers,

10:36.660 --> 10:39.140
nitrogen fixing bacteria.

10:39.140 --> 10:40.100
Can you explain what that is?

10:40.100 --> 10:43.680
Nitrogen fixing, is the source of its energy?

10:43.680 --> 10:46.780
So nitrogen is a triple bond gas

10:46.780 --> 10:49.260
that's pretty abundant in the atmosphere,

10:49.260 --> 10:52.820
but nitrogen itself cannot be directly utilized by cells,

10:52.820 --> 10:54.340
given it is triple bond.

10:55.300 --> 10:57.580
It needs to be converted to ammonia

10:57.580 --> 11:02.580
that is then used for the downstream cellular functions.

11:04.140 --> 11:07.220
And that's what causes nitrogen fixing.

11:07.220 --> 11:09.300
Yes, so nitrogen needs to be fixed

11:09.300 --> 11:11.820
before our cells can make use of it.

11:11.820 --> 11:13.220
And it's-

11:13.220 --> 11:14.420
No offense to nitrogen either.

11:14.420 --> 11:17.580
Well, it's actually a very important element.

11:17.580 --> 11:21.340
It's one of the most abundant elements on our planet

11:21.340 --> 11:22.780
that is used by biology.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.540
It's in ATP.

11:24.540 --> 11:29.540
It's in chlorophyll that relies on nitrogen.

11:30.060 --> 11:34.020
So it's a very important enzyme for a lot of cell functions.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.780
And there's just one mechanism

11:35.780 --> 11:39.900
that evolution invented to fix it?

11:39.900 --> 11:43.700
So far we know there's only one nitrogen fixation pathway

11:43.700 --> 11:45.300
as opposed to say carbon.

11:45.300 --> 11:49.140
You can find up to seven or eight different carbon-based

11:49.140 --> 11:51.380
microbes invented to fix carbon.

11:51.380 --> 11:53.060
That's not the case for nitrogen.

11:53.060 --> 11:56.300
It's a singularity across geologic time.

11:56.300 --> 11:59.860
We think it evolved around to 0.7 maybe,

11:59.860 --> 12:04.620
roughly three, probably less than three billion years ago.

12:04.620 --> 12:07.940
And that's the only way that nature invented

12:07.940 --> 12:10.780
to fix the nitrogen in the atmosphere

12:10.780 --> 12:12.500
for the subsequent use.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.780
Would we still have life as we know it today

12:14.780 --> 12:17.740
if we didn't invent that nitrogen fixing step?

12:17.740 --> 12:19.380
I cannot think of it, no.

12:19.380 --> 12:22.340
It's essential to life as we know.

12:22.340 --> 12:24.220
You and I are having this conversation

12:24.220 --> 12:27.820
because life found a way to fix nitrogen.

12:27.820 --> 12:29.420
Is that one of the tough ones?

12:29.420 --> 12:34.420
If you put it sort of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon,

12:35.660 --> 12:40.420
what are, in terms of being able to work with these elements,

12:41.420 --> 12:43.340
what is the hardest thing?

12:43.340 --> 12:45.260
What is the most essential for life?

12:45.260 --> 12:46.260
Just to give context.

12:46.260 --> 12:48.500
Well, we think of this as the cocktail.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.500
You may hear schnapps. What's in the cocktail?

12:50.500 --> 12:51.660
It's the schnapps, right?

12:51.660 --> 12:54.940
Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur.

12:54.940 --> 12:59.020
So there are five elements that life relies on.

12:59.020 --> 13:02.700
We don't quite know whether that's the only,

13:02.700 --> 13:06.500
out of many options, that life necessarily needs

13:06.500 --> 13:09.300
to operate on, but that's just how it happened

13:09.300 --> 13:10.740
on our own planet.

13:10.740 --> 13:15.060
And there are many abiotic ways to fix nitrogen

13:15.060 --> 13:16.900
and like lightning, right?

13:16.900 --> 13:19.580
Lightning can accumulate ammonia.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.660
Humans found a way about a hundred years ago,

13:23.660 --> 13:28.660
I think around World War I, the Haber-Bosch process

13:29.100 --> 13:33.980
that we can abiotically convert nitrogen into ammonia.

13:33.980 --> 13:37.620
Actually, 50% of the nitrogen in our bodies

13:37.620 --> 13:42.620
comes from the human conversion of nitrogen to ammonia.

13:42.660 --> 13:46.340
It's helped, it's the fertilizer that we use, urea,

13:46.340 --> 13:48.380
comes from that process.

13:48.380 --> 13:49.620
It's in our food.

13:49.620 --> 13:54.020
So we helped, we found a way to fix our own nitrogen

13:54.020 --> 13:55.180
for ourselves.

13:55.180 --> 13:59.740
Yeah, but that's way after the original invention

13:59.740 --> 14:01.500
of how to fix nitrogen. Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

14:01.500 --> 14:05.420
And without that, we wouldn't have all the steps

14:05.420 --> 14:06.660
of evolution along the way.

14:06.660 --> 14:10.180
So absolutely, we tried to replicate

14:10.180 --> 14:15.180
in the most simplest way what nature has come up with, right?

14:15.220 --> 14:18.540
We do this by taking nitrogen using a lot of pressure

14:18.540 --> 14:20.380
and then generating ammonia.

14:20.380 --> 14:22.980
Life does this in a more sophisticated way,

14:22.980 --> 14:26.260
relying on one single enzyme called nitrogenase.

14:26.260 --> 14:29.420
It's the nitrogen that is used together

14:29.420 --> 14:33.180
with eight electron donor and ATP,

14:33.180 --> 14:35.820
together with a lot of hydrogen.

14:36.020 --> 14:41.020
Life pushes this metabolism down to create fixed nitrogen.

14:41.420 --> 14:42.620
It's quite remarkable.

14:42.620 --> 14:45.380
So the lab pet, E. coli, inject them with DNA,

14:45.380 --> 14:48.660
so E. coli does nitrogen fixing in part,

14:48.660 --> 14:50.180
or is that a different one?

14:50.180 --> 14:54.020
So some biological engineers engineered E. coli

14:54.020 --> 14:57.740
to fix nitrogen, I believe, not us.

14:57.740 --> 15:02.580
We use the nature's nitrogen fixing bug

15:02.620 --> 15:07.420
and engineer it with the nitrogen fixing metabolism

15:07.420 --> 15:10.260
that we resurrected using our computational

15:10.260 --> 15:11.940
and phylogenetic tools.

15:11.940 --> 15:13.940
How complicated are these little organisms?

15:13.940 --> 15:15.300
What are we talking about?

15:15.300 --> 15:18.060
Depends on how we define complication.

15:18.060 --> 15:23.060
Okay, so I could tell that you appreciate

15:23.060 --> 15:25.100
and respect the full complexity

15:25.100 --> 15:29.780
of even the most seemingly primitive organisms,

15:29.780 --> 15:31.540
because none of them are primitive.

15:31.540 --> 15:36.140
Okay, that said, what are we talking about?

15:36.140 --> 15:40.820
What kind of machineries do they have

15:40.820 --> 15:41.660
that you're working with

15:41.660 --> 15:43.340
when you're injecting them with DNA?

15:43.340 --> 15:47.020
So I will start with one of the most fascinating

15:47.020 --> 15:48.340
machineries that we target,

15:48.340 --> 15:50.940
which is the translation machinery.

15:50.940 --> 15:55.940
It is a very unique subsystem

15:55.940 --> 16:00.940
of cellular life in comparison to, I would say, metabolism.

16:01.180 --> 16:06.180
And we used to, when we are thinking about cellular life,

16:07.420 --> 16:12.420
we think of cell as the basic unit or the building block.

16:13.020 --> 16:17.820
But from a key perspective, that's not the case.

16:17.820 --> 16:20.300
That one may argue that everything that happens

16:20.300 --> 16:23.900
inside the cell serves the translation

16:23.900 --> 16:26.660
and the translation machinery.

16:26.660 --> 16:28.620
There's a nice paper that called this

16:28.660 --> 16:32.380
that the entire cell is hopelessly addicted

16:32.380 --> 16:37.380
to this main informatic computing biological chemical system

16:39.660 --> 16:42.340
that it is operating at the heart of the cell.

16:42.340 --> 16:43.700
Which is the translation?

16:43.700 --> 16:44.540
It is the translation.

16:44.540 --> 16:47.220
What's the translation from what to what?

16:47.220 --> 16:49.300
So RNA to enzymes.

16:49.300 --> 16:53.140
It converts a linear sequence of mRNA

16:53.140 --> 16:56.500
into a later folded protein.

16:57.380 --> 17:01.820
That's when the, that's the core processing center

17:01.820 --> 17:04.340
for information for life.

17:04.340 --> 17:06.500
It has multiple steps.

17:06.500 --> 17:11.020
It initiates, it elongates, it terminates,

17:11.020 --> 17:12.980
and it recycles.

17:12.980 --> 17:17.980
It operates discrete bits of information.

17:19.540 --> 17:22.780
It itself is like a chemical decoding device.

17:22.780 --> 17:26.900
And that is incredibly unique for translation

17:26.900 --> 17:29.980
that I don't think you will find anywhere else

17:29.980 --> 17:31.860
in the cell that does this.

17:31.860 --> 17:34.660
So even though it's called translation,

17:34.660 --> 17:39.660
it's really like a factory that reads the schematic

17:40.420 --> 17:43.380
and builds a three dimensional object.

17:43.380 --> 17:44.700
It's like a printer.

17:44.700 --> 17:48.100
I would divide it into actually even four more

17:48.100 --> 17:50.260
additional steps or disciplines

17:50.260 --> 17:52.820
than what would it take to study it

17:52.820 --> 17:54.580
by the way you described it.

17:54.580 --> 17:56.820
It's a chemical system.

17:56.820 --> 17:59.820
It's the compounds that make it up are chemicals.

17:59.820 --> 18:00.780
It's physical.

18:00.780 --> 18:05.780
It tracks the energy to make its job, to do its job.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.220
It's informatic.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.420
What is processed are the bits.

18:10.420 --> 18:12.460
It's computational.

18:12.460 --> 18:16.180
The discrete states that the system is placed

18:16.180 --> 18:17.780
when the information is being processed,

18:17.780 --> 18:20.140
that's itself is computational.

18:20.980 --> 18:22.420
And it's biological.

18:22.420 --> 18:25.460
There's variability and inheritance that come

18:25.460 --> 18:30.460
from imperfect replication even and imperfect computation.

18:30.740 --> 18:31.860
Oh man, that's so good.

18:31.860 --> 18:35.140
So from the biology comes the,

18:35.140 --> 18:38.380
like when you mess up, the bugs are the features.

18:38.380 --> 18:39.940
That's the biology.

18:39.940 --> 18:41.700
Informatics is obvious in the RNA.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.340
That's the several information there.

18:44.340 --> 18:47.260
The different steps along the way is actually

18:47.260 --> 18:49.620
kind of what the computer does with bits.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.780
It's done computation, physical.

18:51.780 --> 18:56.780
There's a, I guess, almost like a mechanical process

18:57.220 --> 18:59.180
to the whole thing that requires energy

18:59.180 --> 19:03.020
and actually it's manipulating actual physical objects

19:03.020 --> 19:06.580
and chemicals because you have to,

19:06.580 --> 19:08.060
ultimately it's all chemistry.

19:08.060 --> 19:09.900
Yeah, and it tracks this information.

19:09.900 --> 19:13.900
So it is almost a mini computer device inside ourselves.

19:13.900 --> 19:18.340
And that's the oldest computational device of life.

19:18.340 --> 19:23.340
It's likely the key operation system

19:24.660 --> 19:28.660
that had to evolve for life to emerge.

19:28.660 --> 19:33.660
It's more interesting or it's more complicated

19:34.060 --> 19:36.820
in interesting ways than the computers we have today.

19:36.820 --> 19:39.420
I mean, everything you said, which is really, really nice.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.980
I mean, I guess our computers have the informatic

19:41.980 --> 19:43.980
and they have the computational,

19:43.980 --> 19:45.580
but they don't have the chemical,

19:45.580 --> 19:46.660
the physical or the biology.

19:46.660 --> 19:49.620
Exactly, and the computers don't have,

19:49.620 --> 19:52.940
don't link information to function, right?

19:52.940 --> 19:54.340
They are not tightly coupled,

19:54.340 --> 19:57.180
nowhere close to what translation

19:57.180 --> 19:59.740
and all the way translation does it.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.580
So that's the number one, I think,

20:01.580 --> 20:03.580
difference between the two.

20:03.580 --> 20:08.580
And yes, it's informatic and we can discuss this further too.

20:10.060 --> 20:11.660
100%.

20:11.660 --> 20:13.900
Let's please discuss this further.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.220
Which part are we discussing further?

20:15.260 --> 20:17.140
Each one of those are fascinating worlds.

20:17.140 --> 20:18.540
Each of the five.

20:18.540 --> 20:21.020
Yeah, so well, we can start with the more,

20:21.020 --> 20:23.700
I guess, the ones that are more established,

20:23.700 --> 20:28.300
which is the chemical aspect of the translation machinery.

20:28.300 --> 20:33.180
It's the specific compounds make up the assembly of RNA.

20:33.180 --> 20:36.780
Chemists showed this in many different ways.

20:36.780 --> 20:39.100
We can rip apart the entire machinery.

20:39.100 --> 20:40.940
We know that at the core of it,

20:40.980 --> 20:45.780
there's an RNA that operates,

20:45.780 --> 20:48.540
not only as an information system itself

20:48.540 --> 20:51.180
or information itself, but also as an enzyme.

20:51.180 --> 20:54.900
And Origin of Life chemists make these molecules easily.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.740
Now, we know we can manipulate RNA.

20:56.740 --> 21:00.100
We can make even with single pot chemistries,

21:00.100 --> 21:01.420
we can create compounds.

21:01.420 --> 21:02.940
What's a single pot chemistry?

21:04.940 --> 21:07.100
I would say when you add all the recipes

21:07.100 --> 21:10.020
that you know that will lead you to the final product.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.060
This is what Origin of Life chemists do

21:12.060 --> 21:13.860
is they come up with this pot,

21:13.860 --> 21:15.300
they throw a bunch of chemicals in,

21:15.300 --> 21:20.060
and they try to, they're basically chefs of a certain kind.

21:20.060 --> 21:21.500
I'm not sure if that's what they call it,

21:21.500 --> 21:22.660
but that's how I think of it.

21:22.660 --> 21:24.740
Because it is all combined in a test tube

21:24.740 --> 21:26.180
and you know the outcome.

21:26.180 --> 21:28.860
And it's very mathematical.

21:28.860 --> 21:30.860
Once you know the right environment

21:30.860 --> 21:32.420
and the right chemistry that needs to get

21:32.420 --> 21:34.860
into this container or this pot,

21:34.860 --> 21:36.020
you know what the outcome is.

21:36.020 --> 21:37.820
There is no luck there anymore.

21:37.820 --> 21:42.380
It's a pretty rigid, established input-output system

21:42.380 --> 21:43.780
and it's all chemistry.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.580
So you actually wear a lot of hats.

21:45.580 --> 21:48.420
Is one of them Origin of Life chemists?

21:48.420 --> 21:49.820
My PhD is in chemistry,

21:49.820 --> 21:52.540
but I don't do Origin of Life chemistry.

21:52.540 --> 21:54.220
But you're interested in Origin of Life.

21:54.220 --> 21:55.340
Yes, absolutely.

21:55.340 --> 21:58.940
So some of your best friends are Origin of Life chemists.

21:58.940 --> 22:01.340
Just make sure that you have good chemist friends

22:01.340 --> 22:03.340
if you're interested in Origin of Life.

22:03.340 --> 22:05.780
That's 100% required.

22:05.780 --> 22:06.940
It should be mandatory.

22:07.980 --> 22:09.860
Okay, so chemistry.

22:09.860 --> 22:11.300
So what else about this machinery

22:11.300 --> 22:12.660
that we need to know chemically?

22:12.660 --> 22:15.660
Well, chemically, I think that's it.

22:15.660 --> 22:17.740
You have enzymes, you have proteins.

22:17.740 --> 22:19.220
Enzymes are doing their thing.

22:19.220 --> 22:23.300
They know how to chew energy using ATP or GTP.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.740
They know what to do in their own way.

22:26.740 --> 22:28.940
They do their enzymatic thing.

22:28.940 --> 22:31.420
So it's not just the ribosome

22:31.420 --> 22:33.380
that is at the heart of the transition,

22:33.380 --> 22:35.580
but there are a lot of different proteins.

22:35.580 --> 22:38.300
You're looking at about 100 different components

22:38.300 --> 22:40.580
that compose this machinery.

22:40.580 --> 22:41.940
Well, let me ask kind of,

22:41.940 --> 22:43.300
maybe it's a ridiculous question,

22:43.300 --> 22:47.940
but did the chemistry make this machine,

22:47.940 --> 22:52.940
or did the machine use chemistry to achieve a purpose?

22:54.540 --> 22:58.900
So like, I guess there's a lot

22:58.900 --> 23:01.460
of different chemical possibilities on earth.

23:02.340 --> 23:05.580
Is this translation machinery just like

23:07.140 --> 23:10.980
picking and choosing different chemical reactions

23:10.980 --> 23:12.980
that it can use to achieve a purpose?

23:14.700 --> 23:16.860
Or did the chemistry basically,

23:18.260 --> 23:19.620
there's like a momentum,

23:19.620 --> 23:20.980
like a constraint to the thing

23:20.980 --> 23:24.460
that can only build a certain kind of machinery.

23:24.460 --> 23:27.540
Basically, is chemistry fundamental,

23:27.540 --> 23:30.300
or is it just emergent?

23:30.300 --> 23:33.260
How important is chemistry to this whole process?

23:33.260 --> 23:35.820
You cannot have life without chemistry.

23:35.820 --> 23:40.540
You cannot have any cellular process without chemistry.

23:40.540 --> 23:41.820
What makes life interesting

23:41.820 --> 23:44.100
is that even if the chemistry is imperfect,

23:44.100 --> 23:46.340
even if there are accidents along the way,

23:46.340 --> 23:50.860
if something binds to another chemical

23:50.860 --> 23:53.340
in a way it shouldn't,

23:53.340 --> 23:55.380
there is resilience within the system

23:55.380 --> 23:58.100
that it can maybe not necessarily repair itself,

23:58.100 --> 23:59.300
but it moves on.

23:59.300 --> 24:02.660
However imperfect mistakes can be handled.

24:02.660 --> 24:04.780
That's where the biology comes in.

24:04.780 --> 24:05.940
But in terms of chemistry,

24:05.940 --> 24:08.180
you absolutely cannot have a translation machinery

24:08.180 --> 24:09.300
without chemistry.

24:09.300 --> 24:12.620
And so, as I said, there are four main steps.

24:12.620 --> 24:15.700
These are the core steps that are conserved

24:15.700 --> 24:17.020
in all translation machinery.

24:17.020 --> 24:20.900
And I should say all life has this machine, right?

24:20.900 --> 24:22.580
Every cell, everything.

24:22.580 --> 24:23.420
On earth.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.260
On earth.

24:24.260 --> 24:25.500
Yeah.

24:25.500 --> 24:26.340
Yes.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.140
When you think of this machine,

24:28.220 --> 24:29.420
do you think very specifically

24:29.420 --> 24:31.900
about the kind of machinery that we're talking about,

24:31.900 --> 24:34.180
or do you think more philosophically,

24:34.180 --> 24:37.700
a machine that converts information into function?

24:37.700 --> 24:40.020
It's, I cannot separate the two.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.740
I think what makes this machinery fascinating

24:42.740 --> 24:45.500
is that those five components that I listed are,

24:45.500 --> 24:47.220
they co-exist.

24:47.220 --> 24:49.260
So for instance, if we,

24:49.260 --> 24:50.100
let's just,

24:51.700 --> 24:53.900
talking about the chemistry part,

24:54.740 --> 24:59.740
we know the certain rate constant,

25:00.420 --> 25:02.820
all these proteins that operate in this machinery

25:02.820 --> 25:07.820
needs to harbor in order to get the mechanism going, right?

25:09.660 --> 25:12.740
If you are bringing the information

25:12.740 --> 25:14.220
to the translation machinery,

25:14.220 --> 25:18.340
and you are the initiator of this computation system,

25:18.340 --> 25:20.060
you need to have,

25:20.980 --> 25:23.540
you can only afford a certain range of mistakes.

25:24.180 --> 25:25.260
If you're too fast,

25:25.260 --> 25:27.900
then the next message cannot be delivered fast.

25:27.900 --> 25:30.980
If you're too slow, then you may stall the process.

25:30.980 --> 25:34.620
So there is definitely a chemistry constant going on

25:34.620 --> 25:36.580
within the machinery.

25:36.580 --> 25:39.940
Again, it's not perfect, far from it,

25:39.940 --> 25:44.540
but they all have their own margin of error

25:44.540 --> 25:46.300
that they can tolerate versus they cannot,

25:46.300 --> 25:48.060
otherwise the system collapses.

25:48.060 --> 25:52.300
So it's like a jazz ensemble, the notes of the chemistry,

25:52.300 --> 25:53.140
but you can be a little offbeat.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.540
It's definitely true.

25:54.540 --> 25:56.820
It's a party and it's like everybody's invited

25:56.820 --> 26:00.580
and they need to operate together, right?

26:00.580 --> 26:03.860
And what's really cool about it, I think,

26:03.860 --> 26:06.180
there are many things that are very interesting

26:06.180 --> 26:07.020
about this thing,

26:07.020 --> 26:09.740
but if you remove it from the cell

26:09.740 --> 26:11.740
and put it in a cell-free environment,

26:11.740 --> 26:14.100
it works just fine, right?

26:14.100 --> 26:17.740
So you can get cell-free translation systems,

26:18.820 --> 26:21.700
put this translation in a test tube

26:21.700 --> 26:24.060
and it is doing its thing.

26:24.060 --> 26:26.020
It doesn't need the rest of the cell

26:26.020 --> 26:27.940
to translate information.

26:27.940 --> 26:31.220
Of course, you need to feed the information at least so far,

26:32.180 --> 26:36.220
but because we are far from evolving a translation,

26:36.220 --> 26:40.660
maybe not so far, evolving a translation in the lab

26:40.660 --> 26:43.820
or a machine that can process information

26:43.820 --> 26:46.660
as it generates it, we have not done that yet.

26:46.660 --> 26:48.060
That's a pretty complicated machinery,

26:48.140 --> 26:51.900
which is hard for those origin of life chemists

26:51.900 --> 26:53.580
to find a pot that generates.

26:53.580 --> 26:55.660
Because it's far more than chemistry.

26:55.660 --> 26:59.020
You need biology, obviously.

26:59.020 --> 27:00.660
You need biochemistry.

27:00.660 --> 27:04.940
You need to think as a network systems folk.

27:04.940 --> 27:06.340
You need to think about computation.

27:06.340 --> 27:07.820
You need to think about information

27:07.820 --> 27:10.180
and that is not happening yet,

27:10.180 --> 27:14.220
except we are trying to bring this perspective,

27:14.220 --> 27:18.020
but the more you understand how information systems

27:19.020 --> 27:20.780
work, once you see it, you cannot unsee it.

27:20.780 --> 27:22.220
It's one of those things.

27:22.220 --> 27:25.100
But you can still rip it out and the chemistry happens.

27:25.100 --> 27:29.060
Yes, and chemistry can happen even if you strip

27:29.060 --> 27:31.620
some of the parts out.

27:31.620 --> 27:36.620
You can get very minimal level of information processing

27:37.380 --> 27:39.980
that does not look anything like the translation

27:39.980 --> 27:44.700
that cells relies on, but chemists showed from linear,

27:44.740 --> 27:48.060
you can generate information that arrives

27:48.060 --> 27:52.620
to the processing center in the form of a linear polymer.

27:52.620 --> 27:55.740
But the informatic part of this system

27:55.740 --> 27:59.300
that I think sets the parts from computation

27:59.300 --> 28:01.820
and from metabolism comes in,

28:01.820 --> 28:05.300
if you think about the information itself, right?

28:05.300 --> 28:09.940
So we have four nucleotide letters that compose DNA

28:09.940 --> 28:14.380
and they are processed in the translation in triplets.

28:14.420 --> 28:18.260
So you have in triplet codon fragments.

28:18.260 --> 28:21.100
So you have four times four times four.

28:21.100 --> 28:25.420
So you have 64 possible states that can be encoded

28:26.260 --> 28:28.860
by four letters in three positions.

28:29.980 --> 28:30.820
All right, so-

28:30.820 --> 28:32.100
It's so amazing.

28:32.100 --> 28:33.220
Yeah. It's so amazing.

28:33.220 --> 28:36.340
There is only one code that says start,

28:36.340 --> 28:40.340
that there's only one, and then there's two,

28:40.340 --> 28:42.980
if not three, that says stop.

28:42.980 --> 28:45.420
So that's what you work with,

28:45.420 --> 28:48.780
but you can have 64 possible states,

28:48.780 --> 28:52.780
but life only uses 20 amino acids.

28:52.780 --> 28:56.980
So we use, life uses 64 possible states minus four

28:56.980 --> 29:00.820
of the starts and stops to code for 20 amino acids

29:00.820 --> 29:02.260
in different combinations.

29:03.340 --> 29:05.380
That is really amazing.

29:05.380 --> 29:08.500
If you think about there are 500 different amino acids

29:08.500 --> 29:09.780
life can choose, right?

29:09.780 --> 29:12.500
It's narrowed it down to 20.

29:13.020 --> 29:13.860
We don't know why.

29:13.860 --> 29:15.980
A lot of people think about this genetic code

29:15.980 --> 29:17.340
is quite fascinating.

29:17.340 --> 29:18.500
So far, right?

29:18.500 --> 29:20.260
I mean, it didn't do it for four billion years.

29:20.260 --> 29:21.100
I don't know.

29:21.100 --> 29:22.620
We may wait for another four billion years, but-

29:22.620 --> 29:24.100
But you didn't have those amino acids

29:24.100 --> 29:25.500
in the very beginning, right?

29:25.500 --> 29:26.340
We don't know.

29:26.340 --> 29:28.580
So we would be fooling ourselves if we said

29:28.580 --> 29:32.900
we know exactly how many amino acids existed early on,

29:32.900 --> 29:37.340
but there's no reason to think that it wasn't the same-

29:37.340 --> 29:38.300
Or similar.

29:38.300 --> 29:40.860
Yeah. We don't have a good reason,

29:40.900 --> 29:45.900
but because roughly 20 out of 60 states are used,

29:46.260 --> 29:50.220
you're using one third of your possible states

29:50.220 --> 29:52.300
in your information system.

29:52.300 --> 29:57.260
So this may seem like a waste, but informatically

29:57.260 --> 29:59.300
it's important because it's abundant

29:59.300 --> 30:02.380
and it is redundant, right?

30:02.380 --> 30:07.060
So this code degeneracy, you see this in,

30:07.060 --> 30:09.220
that's implemented by this translation machinery

30:09.220 --> 30:10.100
inside the cell.

30:11.140 --> 30:13.220
So it means you can make errors, right?

30:13.220 --> 30:16.460
You can make errors, but the message will still get through.

30:16.460 --> 30:20.060
You can speak, missing some letters to the information

30:20.060 --> 30:22.700
can miss some parts, but the message will still get through.

30:22.700 --> 30:26.180
So that's two thirds of the not used states

30:26.180 --> 30:28.980
gives you that robustness and resilience within the system.

30:28.980 --> 30:32.220
So at the informatic level, there's room for error.

30:32.220 --> 30:33.380
There's probably room for error,

30:33.380 --> 30:38.380
probably in all five categories that we're talking about.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.060
There's probably room for error in the computation.

30:40.060 --> 30:41.740
There's probably room for error in the physical.

30:41.740 --> 30:42.740
Yes, exactly.

30:42.740 --> 30:44.060
Everywhere there's room for error.

30:44.060 --> 30:47.260
Because the informatic capacity is made possible

30:47.260 --> 30:50.020
together with the other components.

30:50.020 --> 30:55.020
And not only that, but also the product yields function,

30:55.860 --> 31:00.620
no, in this case, enzyme or protein, right?

31:00.620 --> 31:04.500
So that's really amazing to me.

31:04.500 --> 31:06.780
It is, I mean, in my head, just so you know,

31:06.780 --> 31:10.060
because I'm a computer science AI person,

31:10.060 --> 31:13.900
the parallels between even like language models

31:13.900 --> 31:17.740
that encode language, or now they're able to encode

31:17.740 --> 31:22.740
basically any kind of thing, including images and actions

31:22.860 --> 31:24.980
all in this kind of way.

31:24.980 --> 31:29.980
The parallel in terms of informatic and computation

31:30.860 --> 31:32.340
is just incredible.

31:32.340 --> 31:36.260
Actually, I have a image, maybe I can send you.

31:36.300 --> 31:37.380
Can we pull it up now?

31:37.380 --> 31:40.820
If you just do genetic codon charts, we can pull that up.

31:40.820 --> 31:43.900
Yeah, it's a very standard table.

31:43.900 --> 31:47.380
So I can explain why this is so amazing.

31:47.380 --> 31:50.380
So you're looking at, this is life's alphabet, right?

31:50.380 --> 31:52.900
And so I also want to make a very quick link now

31:52.900 --> 31:55.140
to your first question, the tree of life.

31:56.420 --> 32:01.420
When we try to understand ancient languages,

32:01.420 --> 32:06.420
or the cultures that use these extinct languages,

32:07.780 --> 32:10.260
we start with the modern languages, right?

32:10.260 --> 32:14.460
So we look at Indo-European languages

32:14.460 --> 32:17.340
and try to understand certain words

32:17.340 --> 32:20.620
and make trees to understand, you know,

32:20.620 --> 32:25.620
this is what Slavic word is for snow, something like snig.

32:25.620 --> 32:27.820
Now we jump to languages that humans spoke.

32:27.820 --> 32:29.140
Humans spoke, exactly.

32:29.140 --> 32:31.300
So we make trees to understand

32:31.300 --> 32:33.660
what is the original ancestor,

32:33.660 --> 32:36.020
what did they use to say snow?

32:36.020 --> 32:38.740
And if you have a lot of cultures who use the word snow,

32:38.740 --> 32:41.780
you can imagine that it was snowy,

32:41.780 --> 32:43.500
that's why they needed that word.

32:43.500 --> 32:46.300
It's the same thing for biology, right?

32:46.300 --> 32:49.380
If they have some, if we understand some function

32:49.380 --> 32:52.620
about that enzyme, we can understand the environment

32:52.620 --> 32:53.620
that they lived in.

32:53.620 --> 32:56.300
It's similar in that sense.

32:56.300 --> 32:59.420
So now you're looking at the alphabet of life.

32:59.420 --> 33:02.740
In this case, it's not 20 or 25 letters.

33:02.740 --> 33:04.860
You have four letters.

33:04.860 --> 33:08.780
So what is really interesting that stands out to me

33:08.780 --> 33:11.060
when I look at this, on the outer shell,

33:11.060 --> 33:14.100
you're looking at the 20 amino acids that compose life,

33:14.100 --> 33:14.940
right?

33:14.940 --> 33:19.060
The one, the methionine that you see, that's the start.

33:19.060 --> 33:21.060
So the start is always the same.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.700
To me, that is fascinating

33:22.700 --> 33:24.980
that all life starts with the same starts.

33:24.980 --> 33:26.860
There's no other start code.

33:26.860 --> 33:31.620
So you sent the A-U-G to the cell,

33:31.620 --> 33:33.580
that when that information arrives,

33:33.580 --> 33:36.540
the translation knows, all right, I gotta start,

33:36.540 --> 33:37.540
function is coming.

33:38.580 --> 33:41.020
Following this is a chain of information

33:41.020 --> 33:43.500
until the stop code arrives,

33:43.500 --> 33:46.340
which are highlights in black squares.

33:46.340 --> 33:47.540
So for people just listening,

33:47.540 --> 33:50.300
we're looking at a standard RNA colored table

33:50.300 --> 33:51.780
organized in a wheel.

33:51.780 --> 33:54.060
There's an outer shell and there's an inner shell

33:54.060 --> 33:56.140
all using the four letters that we're talking about.

33:56.140 --> 33:59.260
And with that, we can compose all of the amino acids

33:59.260 --> 34:01.980
and there's a start and there's a stop.

34:01.980 --> 34:06.780
And presumably you put together with these letters,

34:06.780 --> 34:09.900
you walk around the wheel to put together the words,

34:09.900 --> 34:10.820
the sentences that make-

34:10.820 --> 34:12.100
Yeah, the words, the sentences.

34:12.100 --> 34:15.540
And you, again, you get one start,

34:15.540 --> 34:18.220
you get three, there are three different ways to stop this,

34:18.220 --> 34:19.820
one way to start it.

34:19.820 --> 34:24.060
And for each letter, you have multiple options.

34:24.060 --> 34:26.340
So you say you have a code A,

34:26.340 --> 34:28.860
the second code can be another A,

34:28.860 --> 34:30.620
and even if you messed that up,

34:30.620 --> 34:32.140
you still can rescue yourself.

34:32.140 --> 34:33.660
So you can get, for instance,

34:33.660 --> 34:35.900
I'm looking at the lysine K,

34:35.900 --> 34:38.460
you get an A and you get an A and then you get an A

34:38.460 --> 34:40.460
that gives you the lysine, right?

34:40.460 --> 34:43.100
But if you get an A and if you get an A and then get a G,

34:43.100 --> 34:44.100
you still get the lysine.

34:44.100 --> 34:47.020
So there are different combinations.

34:47.020 --> 34:48.380
So even if there's an error,

34:48.380 --> 34:49.740
we don't know if these are selected

34:49.740 --> 34:51.380
because they were error-ness

34:51.380 --> 34:53.060
and somehow they got locked down.

34:53.060 --> 34:56.700
We don't know if there's a mechanism behind this too,

34:56.700 --> 35:00.420
or we certainly don't know this definitively.

35:00.420 --> 35:03.260
But this is the informatic part of this.

35:03.260 --> 35:05.260
And notice that the colors,

35:05.260 --> 35:06.260
and in some tables too,

35:06.260 --> 35:08.340
the colors will be coded in a way

35:08.340 --> 35:13.340
that the type of the nucleotides can be similar chemically,

35:13.700 --> 35:16.220
but the point is that you will still end up

35:16.220 --> 35:19.300
with the same amino acids or something similar to it,

35:19.300 --> 35:20.780
even if you mess up the code.

35:20.780 --> 35:22.180
Do we understand the mechanism

35:22.180 --> 35:24.620
how natural selection interplays

35:24.620 --> 35:27.500
with this resilience to error?

35:28.820 --> 35:32.820
Which errors result in the same output,

35:34.340 --> 35:37.620
like the same function and which don't,

35:37.620 --> 35:40.660
which actually results in a dysfunction or which are-

35:40.660 --> 35:44.580
We understand to some degree how translation

35:44.580 --> 35:47.140
and the rest of the cell work together,

35:47.140 --> 35:50.140
how an error at the translation level,

35:50.140 --> 35:54.100
this is the really core level, can impact entire cell.

35:54.100 --> 35:56.540
But we understand very little about

35:56.540 --> 35:58.700
the evolutionary mechanisms

35:58.700 --> 36:01.540
behind the selection of the system.

36:01.540 --> 36:04.300
It's thought to be as one of the hardest problems

36:04.300 --> 36:07.700
in biology, and it is still the dark side of biology,

36:07.700 --> 36:11.100
even though it is so essential.

36:11.100 --> 36:16.100
So this is, yeah, you're looking at the language of life,

36:16.340 --> 36:20.020
so to speak, and how it's found ways

36:20.020 --> 36:23.980
rather to tolerate its own mistakes.

36:23.980 --> 36:26.020
So the entire phylogenetic tree

36:26.940 --> 36:31.940
can be deconstructed with this wheel of language.

36:32.980 --> 36:35.820
Because all the final letters,

36:35.820 --> 36:38.300
that's the 20 amino acids, that's our alphabet.

36:38.300 --> 36:40.580
They are all brought together

36:40.580 --> 36:43.340
with these bits of information, right?

36:43.340 --> 36:44.820
So when you look at the genes,

36:44.820 --> 36:46.180
you're looking at those four letters.

36:46.180 --> 36:47.460
When you look at the proteins,

36:47.460 --> 36:50.020
you're looking at the 20 amino acids,

36:50.020 --> 36:52.180
which may be a little easier way

36:52.180 --> 36:55.980
to track the information when we create the tree.

36:55.980 --> 36:58.100
So using this language,

36:58.100 --> 37:01.100
we can describe all life that's lived on Earth.

37:02.140 --> 37:02.980
I wish.

37:02.980 --> 37:04.500
It's one perspective.

37:04.500 --> 37:06.980
We are not that good at it yet, right?

37:06.980 --> 37:11.460
So in theory, this is one way to look at life on Earth.

37:11.460 --> 37:14.740
If you're a biologist and you want to understand

37:15.700 --> 37:18.900
how life evolved from a molecular perspective,

37:18.900 --> 37:21.180
this would be the way to do it.

37:21.180 --> 37:25.180
And this is what nature narrowed its code down to.

37:25.180 --> 37:26.860
So when we think of nitrogen,

37:26.860 --> 37:28.180
when we think of carbon,

37:28.180 --> 37:29.820
when we think of sulfur,

37:29.820 --> 37:31.300
it's all in this,

37:31.300 --> 37:34.700
that all these nucleotides are built

37:34.700 --> 37:36.620
based on those elements.

37:36.620 --> 37:39.060
And this is fundamentally the informatic perspective.

37:39.060 --> 37:39.900
Exactly.

37:39.900 --> 37:41.820
That's the informatic perspective.

37:41.820 --> 37:43.860
And it's important to emphasize

37:43.860 --> 37:47.340
that this is not engineered by humans.

37:47.340 --> 37:49.700
This evolved by itself.

37:51.380 --> 37:52.220
Right.

37:52.220 --> 37:55.020
Humans didn't invent this just because we're just describing,

37:55.020 --> 37:56.380
we're trying to find,

37:56.380 --> 37:58.060
trying to describe the language of life.

37:58.060 --> 37:58.900
Yeah.

37:58.900 --> 38:02.460
It appears to be a highly optimized

38:02.460 --> 38:04.460
chemical and information code.

38:05.700 --> 38:10.700
It may indicate that a great deal of chemical evolution

38:10.780 --> 38:15.780
and this may indicate that a lot of selection pressure

38:16.220 --> 38:18.020
and Darwinian evolution happened

38:18.020 --> 38:20.860
prior to the rise of last universal common ancestor.

38:20.860 --> 38:23.260
Because this is almost a bridge

38:23.260 --> 38:24.860
that connects the earliest cells

38:24.860 --> 38:26.460
to the last universal common ancestor.

38:26.460 --> 38:27.300
Okay.

38:27.300 --> 38:29.460
Can you describe what the heck you just said?

38:29.460 --> 38:34.460
So this mechanism evolved before the what common ancestor?

38:36.740 --> 38:38.540
The last universal common ancestor.

38:38.540 --> 38:39.580
When we talk about the tree,

38:39.580 --> 38:41.060
when we think about the root,

38:41.060 --> 38:46.060
if you ideally included all the living information

38:48.220 --> 38:49.700
or all the available information

38:49.700 --> 38:52.780
that comes from living organisms on your tree,

38:52.780 --> 38:54.380
then on the root of your tree

38:54.380 --> 38:57.620
lies the last universal common ancestor, Luca, right?

38:57.620 --> 38:58.740
Why last?

38:58.740 --> 39:00.620
Last universal?

39:00.620 --> 39:02.500
Because the earlier universal,

39:02.500 --> 39:04.900
it also had trees, but they all died off.

39:04.900 --> 39:06.180
We call it the last

39:06.180 --> 39:09.940
because it is sort of the first one that we can track

39:11.740 --> 39:14.980
because we cannot, we don't know what we cannot track.

39:14.980 --> 39:15.820
Right?

39:15.820 --> 39:19.620
So there was one organism that started the whole thing.

39:19.620 --> 39:22.780
It's more like, I would think of it as more like a population,

39:22.780 --> 39:24.300
a group of organisms than a single.

39:24.300 --> 39:25.140
Okay, hold on a second.

39:25.140 --> 39:27.380
I tweeted this so I wanna know the accuracy of my tweet.

39:27.380 --> 39:28.220
All right.

39:29.900 --> 39:31.340
Sometimes early in the morning,

39:31.340 --> 39:33.900
I tweet very pothead like things.

39:33.900 --> 39:38.900
I said that we all evolved from one common ancestor

39:41.860 --> 39:46.860
that was a single cell organism 3.5 billion years ago.

39:47.540 --> 39:49.300
Something like this.

39:49.300 --> 39:51.460
How true is that tweet?

39:51.460 --> 39:52.460
Do I need to delete it?

39:52.460 --> 39:54.980
No, that's actually correct.

39:54.980 --> 39:58.940
I mean, I think of course there's a lot to say,

39:58.940 --> 40:01.540
which is like, we don't know exactly,

40:01.580 --> 40:05.140
but to what degrees the single organism aspect

40:05.140 --> 40:09.220
is that true versus multiple organisms?

40:09.220 --> 40:10.820
Do you want me to be?

40:10.820 --> 40:11.660
Brutally honest?

40:11.660 --> 40:12.500
Yes, please.

40:13.620 --> 40:16.340
There's still time.

40:17.660 --> 40:19.900
This is how we get like caveats and tweets.

40:19.900 --> 40:21.020
All right, so first of all,

40:21.020 --> 40:25.500
it's not 3.5 is still a very conservative estimate.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.380
That's what- English direction.

40:27.380 --> 40:30.740
I would say it's 3.8 is probably safer

40:30.740 --> 40:31.980
to say at this point.

40:31.980 --> 40:34.620
A bunch of people said it probably way before.

40:34.620 --> 40:36.860
If you put an approximately, I'll take that.

40:36.860 --> 40:37.700
I didn't.

40:37.700 --> 40:42.100
I just love the idea that I was once,

40:42.100 --> 40:46.260
first of all, as a single organism, I was once a cell.

40:46.260 --> 40:49.100
Well, you're still as, you're a group of cells.

40:49.100 --> 40:51.260
No, but I started from a single cell.

40:52.140 --> 40:53.100
Me, Lex.

40:53.100 --> 40:55.380
You mean like you versus Luca?

40:55.380 --> 40:57.180
Are you relating to Luca right now?

40:57.180 --> 40:58.980
No, no, no, I'm relating to my-

40:58.980 --> 40:59.900
Your own development.

40:59.940 --> 41:02.660
My own development, I started from a single cell.

41:02.660 --> 41:05.540
It's like built up and stuff, okay.

41:05.540 --> 41:09.860
That, and then so that's for a single biological organism.

41:09.860 --> 41:13.060
And then from an evolutionary perspective, the Luca,

41:13.060 --> 41:16.580
like I start, like my ancestor is a single cell.

41:16.580 --> 41:20.220
And then here I am sitting half asleep, tweeting.

41:21.380 --> 41:23.820
Like I started from a single cell,

41:23.820 --> 41:26.740
evolved a ton of murder along the way

41:26.740 --> 41:31.740
to this like brutal search for adaptation

41:33.900 --> 41:37.380
through the 3.5.8 billion years.

41:37.380 --> 41:40.020
So you defy the code of Douglas Adams.

41:40.020 --> 41:41.300
You are proud of your ancestors

41:41.300 --> 41:42.860
and you invite them over to dinner

41:42.860 --> 41:44.580
and you invite them over to your Twitter.

41:44.580 --> 41:47.820
Yeah, and it's amazing that this intelligence,

41:47.820 --> 41:49.620
to the degree you can call it intelligence,

41:49.620 --> 41:52.740
emerged to be able to tweet whatever the heck I want.

41:52.740 --> 41:55.700
Yes, it's almost intelligence at the chemical level

41:55.700 --> 41:59.580
and this is also probably one of the first

41:59.580 --> 42:01.780
chemically intelligent system

42:01.780 --> 42:04.140
that evolved by itself in nature.

42:04.140 --> 42:06.060
Yeah, so you see that translation

42:06.060 --> 42:10.140
is fundamentally like a intelligent mechanism.

42:10.140 --> 42:12.900
In its own way, and again,

42:14.060 --> 42:18.980
if we manage to figure out how to drive life's evolution,

42:20.260 --> 42:25.260
it can, if it can evolve a sophisticated

42:25.260 --> 42:30.260
sort of informatic processing system like this,

42:30.340 --> 42:34.820
you may ask yourself what might chemical systems

42:34.820 --> 42:37.940
be capable of independently doing

42:37.940 --> 42:40.940
under different circumstances.

42:40.940 --> 42:43.940
Yeah, so like locally, they're intelligent locally.

42:43.940 --> 42:45.580
They don't need the rest of the shebang.

42:45.580 --> 42:47.860
Like they don't need the big picture.

42:47.860 --> 42:52.860
So that's a great segue into what makes this biological.

42:53.540 --> 42:57.500
The heart of the cellular activities are translation.

42:57.500 --> 42:59.860
You kill translation, you kill the cell.

42:59.860 --> 43:01.460
Not only the translation itself,

43:01.460 --> 43:05.740
you kill the component that initiates it,

43:05.740 --> 43:06.580
you kill the cell.

43:06.580 --> 43:09.180
You remove the component that elongates it,

43:09.180 --> 43:10.460
you kill the cell.

43:10.460 --> 43:13.340
So there are many different ways to disrupt this machinery.

43:13.340 --> 43:16.180
All the parts are important.

43:16.180 --> 43:19.500
Now it can vary across different organisms.

43:19.500 --> 43:21.820
We see variation between bacteria

43:21.820 --> 43:24.020
versus eukaryotes versus archaea, right?

43:24.020 --> 43:26.740
So it is not the same exact steps,

43:26.740 --> 43:29.900
but it can get more crowded

43:29.900 --> 43:32.740
as we get closer to eukaryotes, for instance.

43:32.740 --> 43:34.140
But you are still computing

43:34.140 --> 43:38.180
about 20 amino acids per second, right?

43:38.180 --> 43:40.740
This is what you're generating every second.

43:40.740 --> 43:43.140
That's a single machinery is doing 20 a second?

43:43.140 --> 43:47.700
21 for bacteria, I believe eight for eukaryotes or nine.

43:47.700 --> 43:49.140
21 a second.

43:49.140 --> 43:51.700
I mean, that's super inefficient or super efficient,

43:52.540 --> 43:53.740
depending on how you think about it.

43:53.740 --> 43:54.980
I think it's great.

43:54.980 --> 43:55.820
I mean, I can-

43:55.820 --> 43:58.300
Yeah, but it's way slower than a computer

43:58.300 --> 44:00.460
could generate a third simulation.

44:00.460 --> 44:03.820
I think if you can show me a computer that does this,

44:03.820 --> 44:04.660
we are done here.

44:04.660 --> 44:06.220
Well, this is the big,

44:06.220 --> 44:09.180
this includes the five things, not just,

44:09.180 --> 44:10.300
but I could show you a computer

44:10.300 --> 44:13.100
that's doing the informatic, right?

44:13.100 --> 44:14.580
Yes, you can show me that,

44:14.580 --> 44:16.620
but you cannot show me the one that has all.

44:16.620 --> 44:17.860
For now.

44:17.860 --> 44:18.700
For now.

44:18.700 --> 44:22.140
I'm gonna ask you about probably what alpha fold, right?

44:23.140 --> 44:24.500
I think the more we learn about,

44:24.500 --> 44:27.420
and this is why early life and origin

44:27.420 --> 44:29.980
is also very fascinating and applicable

44:29.980 --> 44:32.460
to many different disciplines.

44:32.460 --> 44:35.660
There is no way you see this the way we just described it,

44:35.660 --> 44:39.660
unless you think about early life and early geochemistry

44:39.660 --> 44:42.980
and earliest emergent systems.

44:42.980 --> 44:47.780
But going back to the biological component,

44:49.020 --> 44:53.620
all of these attributes that we think about life

44:53.620 --> 44:55.780
or that we associate with biology

44:55.780 --> 45:00.340
stems from translation and as well as metabolism.

45:00.340 --> 45:04.460
But I see metabolism as a way to keep translation going

45:04.460 --> 45:07.140
and translation keeps metabolism going,

45:07.140 --> 45:11.100
but translation is arguably a bit more sophisticated process

45:11.100 --> 45:14.140
for the reasons that I just described.

45:14.140 --> 45:15.980
So metabolism is a source of energy

45:15.980 --> 45:17.660
for this translation process.

45:18.660 --> 45:21.260
It's a way to process materials

45:21.260 --> 45:25.460
and it is inherently dynamic and it is flexible,

45:25.460 --> 45:29.900
but it is not focused on repetition as translation does.

45:29.900 --> 45:30.940
So that's the main difference.

45:30.940 --> 45:34.180
Translation is the kind of in a way just it's repeats, right?

45:34.180 --> 45:38.300
So you have the metabolism that can synthesize materials,

45:38.300 --> 45:41.660
it creates or benefits from available energy.

45:41.660 --> 45:44.380
And again, it's a dynamic system.

45:44.420 --> 45:45.940
And then you have computation

45:45.940 --> 45:49.260
that is inherently repetitive, right?

45:49.260 --> 45:51.220
Needs to carry out repetitive processes

45:52.260 --> 45:56.020
and it does the tasks and it implements an algorithm,

45:56.020 --> 45:57.540
but it is not dynamic.

45:57.540 --> 45:59.980
So you see both of those attributes

45:59.980 --> 46:01.420
in translation combined.

46:01.420 --> 46:04.860
It is repetitive and it is dynamic

46:04.860 --> 46:07.700
and it also processes this information.

46:07.700 --> 46:10.260
So they are fundamentally different.

46:10.260 --> 46:14.220
I don't know if you can get life

46:14.220 --> 46:15.900
if you don't find a way

46:15.900 --> 46:18.220
to process the information around you.

46:19.180 --> 46:20.900
In a repetitive dynamic way.

46:20.900 --> 46:25.500
Yeah, and somehow that's what got selected,

46:25.500 --> 46:28.820
maybe not selected, I don't know if it was accidental,

46:28.820 --> 46:31.900
but that's what it seems to be conserved

46:31.900 --> 46:35.700
for 4 billion years, that's what life established.

46:35.700 --> 46:37.580
What's the connection between translation

46:37.580 --> 46:39.340
and the self-replication,

46:39.340 --> 46:42.300
which seems to be another weird thing

46:42.300 --> 46:44.140
that life just started doing,

46:44.140 --> 46:45.540
wanting to just replicate itself.

46:45.540 --> 46:48.260
I think when we truly understand the answer to that question,

46:48.260 --> 46:50.500
we may have just made ourselves life, right?

46:50.500 --> 46:54.460
I don't think we know quite how translation machinery

46:54.460 --> 46:57.180
as a whole fits into equation.

46:57.180 --> 47:02.180
Because we try to understand ribosomes, RNA,

47:02.660 --> 47:05.620
how the linear information is processed,

47:05.940 --> 47:10.940
how the genetic code, why this codon is not others,

47:12.220 --> 47:14.580
why 20 not more, not less.

47:14.580 --> 47:17.140
And we are sort of moving towards translation.

47:17.140 --> 47:19.740
That's what we're working on anyway.

47:19.740 --> 47:21.740
To finally look at the patterns

47:21.740 --> 47:25.420
in which this system operates itself.

47:25.420 --> 47:27.020
And if you understand that,

47:27.020 --> 47:30.060
you're really unlocking a very emergent behavior.

47:31.260 --> 47:34.580
One of the things you didn't mention is physical.

47:34.580 --> 47:36.460
Is there something to mention about that component

47:36.460 --> 47:37.380
that's interesting?

47:37.380 --> 47:41.380
There's actually a paper published in 2013.

47:41.380 --> 47:44.660
I want to say the first author is Zirnoff.

47:44.660 --> 47:47.420
So they surveyed

47:49.540 --> 47:54.300
computational, engineered systems level,

47:54.300 --> 47:56.780
computation, energy consumption.

47:57.980 --> 48:01.380
And they tried to understand whether the universe

48:01.380 --> 48:05.780
is using its own, or life is using its full capacity

48:05.780 --> 48:07.340
of energy consumption.

48:07.340 --> 48:10.780
And whether if different planets in the universe

48:10.780 --> 48:14.100
had life, the capacity would increase or decrease.

48:14.100 --> 48:17.340
Does life operate at its energy maximum?

48:17.340 --> 48:20.940
And they think that it does.

48:20.940 --> 48:23.500
That it actually operates at an efficiency

48:23.500 --> 48:27.460
that is far more above and beyond any computational system.

48:27.460 --> 48:29.380
How is that possible to determine at all?

48:29.380 --> 48:30.460
That you tell me.

48:30.540 --> 48:32.220
That's why I dropped the citation.

48:32.220 --> 48:33.740
I found the citation.

48:33.740 --> 48:35.020
It's quite an interesting paper.

48:35.020 --> 48:36.540
It's a bit, you know, it's a,

48:39.220 --> 48:42.540
obviously you can only calculate in for these things.

48:42.540 --> 48:43.380
But-

48:43.380 --> 48:44.740
It's a good question to ask.

48:44.740 --> 48:47.820
Is the life that we see here on earth

48:47.820 --> 48:49.700
and life elsewhere in the universe,

48:49.700 --> 48:54.020
is it using the energy most efficiently?

48:54.020 --> 48:55.300
Yeah, yeah.

48:55.300 --> 48:57.140
It seems to be very efficient.

48:57.140 --> 48:58.660
Again, if we compare to computers,

48:58.660 --> 49:01.380
it seems to be incredibly efficient.

49:01.380 --> 49:04.260
I think they look at the theoretical optimum

49:04.260 --> 49:05.980
for electronic devices,

49:05.980 --> 49:09.540
and then try to understand where life falls on this.

49:09.540 --> 49:12.060
And life is certainly more efficient.

49:12.060 --> 49:13.540
And that's ultimately the physical side.

49:13.540 --> 49:16.100
How well are you using for this entire mechanism,

49:16.100 --> 49:18.500
the energy available to you?

49:18.500 --> 49:22.580
And so given all the resilience to errors

49:22.580 --> 49:23.420
and all that kind of stuff,

49:23.420 --> 49:26.100
it seems that it's close to its maximum.

49:26.100 --> 49:30.340
And this paper aside, it does seem that life,

49:30.340 --> 49:33.460
obviously that's the constraint we have on earth, right?

49:33.460 --> 49:35.500
Is the amount of energy.

49:35.500 --> 49:36.340
Yeah.

49:36.340 --> 49:38.340
So that's one way to define life.

49:39.300 --> 49:44.300
Well, the input is energy and the output is what?

49:44.420 --> 49:45.820
I don't know.

49:45.820 --> 49:47.380
Self-replicating.

49:48.780 --> 49:50.260
Wait, okay, let's go there.

49:50.260 --> 49:52.500
How do you personally define life?

49:52.500 --> 49:55.380
Do you have a favorite definition

49:55.380 --> 49:57.180
that you try to sneak up on?

49:59.260 --> 50:02.700
Is it possible to define life on earth?

50:02.700 --> 50:03.540
I don't know.

50:03.540 --> 50:05.620
It depends on what you are defining it for.

50:05.620 --> 50:08.900
If you're defining it for finding different life forms,

50:08.900 --> 50:12.820
then it probably needs to have some quantification in it

50:12.820 --> 50:17.820
so that you can use it in whatever the mission

50:18.220 --> 50:19.060
that you're operating.

50:19.060 --> 50:20.500
So you mean like it's not binary,

50:20.500 --> 50:25.420
it's like a seven out of 10 on the-

50:25.420 --> 50:26.740
Life-like?

50:26.740 --> 50:27.580
Life-like.

50:27.580 --> 50:28.620
I don't know.

50:28.620 --> 50:32.380
I don't think that defining is that essential.

50:32.380 --> 50:34.500
I think it's a good exercise,

50:34.500 --> 50:39.500
but I'm not sure if we need to agree

50:39.500 --> 50:43.380
a universally defined way of understanding life.

50:43.380 --> 50:44.980
Because the definition itself

50:44.980 --> 50:46.860
seems to be ever evolving anyway, right?

50:46.860 --> 50:48.380
We have the NASA's definition.

50:48.380 --> 50:53.260
It has its minuses and pluses,

50:53.260 --> 50:55.140
but it seems to be doing its job.

50:55.140 --> 50:56.420
Well, what are the different-

50:56.420 --> 50:59.740
If there is a line and it's impossible

50:59.740 --> 51:01.780
or unproductive to define that line,

51:01.780 --> 51:03.860
nevertheless, we know when we see it

51:05.460 --> 51:09.420
is one definition that the Supreme Court likes.

51:09.420 --> 51:12.220
And that's kind of an important thing

51:12.220 --> 51:17.220
to think about when we look at life on other planets.

51:18.500 --> 51:23.500
So how do we try to identify if a thing is living

51:23.780 --> 51:24.660
when we go to Mars,

51:24.660 --> 51:29.540
when we go to the different moons in our solar system,

51:29.540 --> 51:31.060
when we go outside our solar system

51:31.060 --> 51:33.380
to look for life on other planets?

51:33.380 --> 51:37.580
It's unlikely to be a sort of smoking gun event, right?

51:37.580 --> 51:39.700
It's not gonna be, hey, I found this.

51:39.700 --> 51:40.540
You don't think so?

51:40.540 --> 51:41.380
I don't think so.

51:41.380 --> 51:44.340
Unless you find an elephant on some exoplanet,

51:44.340 --> 51:46.340
then I can say, yeah, there's life here.

51:46.340 --> 51:49.980
No, but isn't there a dynamic nature to the thing?

51:49.980 --> 51:54.620
Like it moves, it has a membrane

51:54.620 --> 51:57.620
that looks like there's stuff inside.

51:57.620 --> 51:58.900
It doesn't need to move, right?

51:58.900 --> 52:00.500
I mean, like look at plants.

52:00.500 --> 52:02.620
I mean, they grow, but there are plants

52:02.620 --> 52:04.660
that can be also pretty dormant.

52:04.660 --> 52:08.420
And arguably, they do everything

52:08.420 --> 52:12.500
that one of my favorite professors once said,

52:12.500 --> 52:14.580
that the plant does everything that a giraffe does

52:14.580 --> 52:15.820
without moving.

52:15.820 --> 52:19.300
So movement is not necessarily.

52:19.300 --> 52:21.540
But on a certain time scale,

52:21.540 --> 52:24.180
the plant does move, it just moves slower.

52:24.180 --> 52:25.020
Yes.

52:25.020 --> 52:25.860
It moves pretty quickly.

52:25.860 --> 52:28.900
I would say that it's hard to quantify this

52:28.900 --> 52:29.740
or even measure it,

52:29.740 --> 52:33.220
but it is, life is definitely

52:34.340 --> 52:36.700
chemistry finding solutions, right?

52:36.700 --> 52:39.980
So it is chemistry exploring itself

52:41.500 --> 52:45.060
and maintaining this exploration for billions of years.

52:45.300 --> 52:49.500
Okay, so a planet is a bunch of chemistry

52:49.500 --> 52:52.380
and then you run it and say, all right,

52:52.380 --> 52:56.140
figure out what cool stuff you can come up with.

52:56.140 --> 52:58.100
That's essentially what life is.

52:58.100 --> 52:59.380
Given a chemistry,

52:59.380 --> 53:01.140
what is the cool stuff I can come up with?

53:01.140 --> 53:06.140
If that chemistry or the solutions that it embarks upon

53:06.580 --> 53:10.260
are maintained in a form of memory, right?

53:10.260 --> 53:12.540
So you don't just need to have

53:12.540 --> 53:16.740
the exploring chemical space,

53:16.740 --> 53:18.780
but you need to also maintain a memory

53:18.780 --> 53:23.780
of some of those solutions for over long periods of time.

53:23.860 --> 53:26.100
So that's the memory component

53:27.620 --> 53:29.540
makes it more living to me.

53:29.540 --> 53:32.020
Because chemistry can always sample, right?

53:32.020 --> 53:34.020
So chemistry is chemistry,

53:34.020 --> 53:36.420
but are you just constantly sampling

53:36.420 --> 53:39.540
or are you building on your former solutions

53:39.540 --> 53:42.020
and then maintaining a memory of those solutions

53:42.020 --> 53:43.140
over billions of years?

53:43.140 --> 53:45.700
Or at least that's what happened here.

53:45.700 --> 53:47.380
Chemistry can't build life

53:47.380 --> 53:49.500
if it's always living in the moment.

53:49.500 --> 53:51.980
The physicist will be very upset with you.

53:51.980 --> 53:56.980
Okay, so memory could be a fundamental requirement of life.

53:59.020 --> 54:02.820
I mean, life is obviously the chemistry and physics

54:02.820 --> 54:04.980
leading to biology.

54:04.980 --> 54:08.260
So this is not a disciplinary problem

54:08.260 --> 54:11.540
of one discipline trying playing other discipline.

54:11.540 --> 54:14.500
But what you need to have is definitely,

54:14.500 --> 54:15.620
chemistry is everywhere, right?

54:15.620 --> 54:19.180
I tend to think you can be a chemist,

54:19.180 --> 54:20.980
you can study chemistry, you can study physics,

54:20.980 --> 54:23.460
you can study geology anywhere in the universe,

54:23.460 --> 54:26.300
but this is the only place you can study biology.

54:26.300 --> 54:27.900
This is the only place to be a biologist.

54:27.900 --> 54:29.340
Earth. That's it.

54:29.340 --> 54:30.180
Yeah.

54:30.180 --> 54:32.860
So definitely something very fundamental happened here

54:32.860 --> 54:35.180
and you cannot take biology out of the equation.

54:35.180 --> 54:38.420
If you wanna understand how that vast chemistry space,

54:38.420 --> 54:43.140
how that general sequence space got narrowed down

54:43.140 --> 54:47.780
to what is available or what is used by life,

54:47.780 --> 54:50.500
you need to understand the rules of selection.

54:50.500 --> 54:52.940
And that's when evolution and biology comes into play.

54:52.940 --> 54:56.220
So the rules of natural selection operate to you

54:56.220 --> 54:57.620
on the level of biology?

54:58.940 --> 55:02.060
Rules, I don't know if there are any rules like that.

55:02.060 --> 55:04.140
That would be fascinating to find

55:04.140 --> 55:06.540
in terms of the biology's rules.

55:06.540 --> 55:08.180
That's a very interesting

55:08.180 --> 55:12.460
and it's a very fascinating area of study now.

55:12.460 --> 55:15.700
And probably we will hear more about that decades to come.

55:15.700 --> 55:19.860
But if you wanna go from the broad to specific,

55:19.860 --> 55:22.140
you need to understand the rules of selection.

55:22.140 --> 55:26.020
And that is gonna come from understanding biology, yes.

55:26.020 --> 55:28.980
Well, actually, let me ask you about selection.

55:28.980 --> 55:33.100
You have a paper on evolutionary stalling

55:33.100 --> 55:34.500
where you describe that evolution

55:34.500 --> 55:36.500
is not good at multitasking

55:36.500 --> 55:41.180
or like in populations that evolve quickly.

55:41.180 --> 55:42.580
I mean, it's a very specific thing,

55:42.580 --> 55:46.340
but there could be a generalizable fundamental thing to this

55:46.340 --> 55:49.820
that evolution is not able to improve multiple modules

55:49.820 --> 55:51.700
simultaneously.

55:51.700 --> 55:54.980
I guess the question is what part of the organism

55:54.980 --> 55:58.780
does evolution quote unquote focus on to improve?

55:59.620 --> 56:01.540
Yeah, that was the driving question.

56:01.540 --> 56:04.820
We meddled with the part

56:04.820 --> 56:07.380
where you shouldn't be messing up with translation.

56:07.380 --> 56:08.460
This is the...

56:08.460 --> 56:09.700
Should or should not?

56:09.700 --> 56:10.540
You shouldn't.

56:10.540 --> 56:12.300
As I said, there are many ways to break it

56:12.300 --> 56:14.100
and all life needs it.

56:14.100 --> 56:16.740
That's one of your favorite things to do

56:16.740 --> 56:19.180
is to break life, see what happens.

56:20.100 --> 56:23.260
It's, yeah, because that's how kids learn, right?

56:23.260 --> 56:26.260
So you have to break something and see how it will...

56:26.260 --> 56:27.420
Then you do it over and over again

56:27.580 --> 56:29.460
to fix itself in the same ways.

56:29.460 --> 56:31.500
So it's our, I don't know,

56:31.500 --> 56:33.140
it's the most fundamental properties

56:33.140 --> 56:35.500
of ourselves as human beings.

56:35.500 --> 56:37.060
So if we shouldn't break translation,

56:37.060 --> 56:38.580
then we should try to break it

56:38.580 --> 56:39.900
to see how it will repair.

56:39.900 --> 56:41.220
So which part did you break?

56:41.220 --> 56:43.020
I broke elongation.

56:43.020 --> 56:43.860
So...

56:43.860 --> 56:46.580
What's the role of elongation in this process?

56:46.580 --> 56:50.660
So we have four steps of the translation

56:50.660 --> 56:51.940
to initiate, elongate.

56:51.940 --> 56:55.020
So to elongate the chain of the information chain

56:55.020 --> 56:57.740
that you're now creating, the peptide chain,

56:59.180 --> 57:01.940
or let's say broadly polymer chain.

57:01.940 --> 57:05.380
And there's the termination step and there's the recycling.

57:05.380 --> 57:09.340
So all of these steps are carried out by proteins

57:09.340 --> 57:11.660
that are also named after these steps.

57:11.660 --> 57:14.420
Initiation is the initiation factor,

57:14.420 --> 57:17.540
protein elongation is the elongator protein.

57:18.380 --> 57:23.380
We broke elongation.

57:23.460 --> 57:27.140
So the cell, the starting codon could still arrive

57:27.140 --> 57:29.260
to where it's supposed to go,

57:29.260 --> 57:34.140
but the following information couldn't get carried out

57:34.140 --> 57:36.820
because we replaced elongation

57:36.820 --> 57:39.540
with its own ancestral version.

57:39.540 --> 57:44.540
So we inserted roughly 700 million year old

57:45.260 --> 57:47.140
elongation factor protein

57:48.460 --> 57:53.260
after removing the modern gene.

57:54.140 --> 57:57.620
So we made this ancient, modern, hybrid organism.

57:57.620 --> 57:59.940
And that essentially creates in some way

57:59.940 --> 58:01.860
the ancient version of that organism.

58:02.700 --> 58:04.060
I wouldn't say so.

58:04.060 --> 58:06.380
It's a hybrid organism.

58:06.380 --> 58:09.460
It's not necessarily, because the rest of the cell,

58:09.460 --> 58:14.460
the rest of the genome is still modern.

58:14.620 --> 58:17.340
And that goes back to the difference between Jurassic Park.

58:17.340 --> 58:19.300
There are many differences, obviously,

58:19.300 --> 58:21.420
given that this is not fiction, we're doing it.

58:21.460 --> 58:24.780
But also we are not necessarily,

58:24.780 --> 58:28.580
I think in Jurassic Park, they are taking an ancient,

58:28.580 --> 58:29.940
they find an ancient organism

58:29.940 --> 58:32.740
and then put a modern gene inside the ancient organism.

58:32.740 --> 58:35.420
In our case, we are still working with what we got,

58:35.420 --> 58:38.500
but putting an ancestral DNA inside the modern organism.

58:38.500 --> 58:40.100
So you're like taking a new car

58:40.100 --> 58:42.620
and putting an old engine into it?

58:42.620 --> 58:43.940
In a way, yeah, yes.

58:43.940 --> 58:45.220
Seeing what happens.

58:45.220 --> 58:47.660
Yes, but in our case, it's more like a transformer

58:47.660 --> 58:49.180
than just a regular car.

58:49.180 --> 58:51.060
It is doing things.

58:52.340 --> 58:54.220
Yeah, so it's a more complicated organism

58:54.220 --> 58:55.060
than just a car.

58:55.060 --> 58:56.540
Yeah.

58:56.540 --> 58:57.380
I got it.

58:57.380 --> 59:00.020
So what does that teach you?

59:01.220 --> 59:02.900
We wanted to understand multiple things.

59:02.900 --> 59:07.100
One is how does the cell respond to perturbation?

59:07.100 --> 59:09.460
And we didn't just put the ancient DNA,

59:09.460 --> 59:14.460
we inserted, we sampled DNA from currently existing organisms,

59:14.460 --> 59:16.700
so the cousins of this microbe,

59:16.700 --> 59:21.020
and collected DNA sequences from the cousins as well.

59:21.540 --> 59:25.660
So both ancestor and the current cousin DNA, so to speak,

59:25.660 --> 59:28.900
and engineered all of these things to the modern bacteria

59:28.900 --> 59:32.460
and generated a collection of microbes

59:32.460 --> 59:35.140
that either have the ancient component

59:35.140 --> 59:38.700
or the variant elongator component

59:38.700 --> 59:41.020
that's still alive today,

59:41.020 --> 59:43.980
but coming from a different part of the tree.

59:43.980 --> 59:45.940
So you broke elongation.

59:47.020 --> 59:49.740
Was that something you did as part of the paper

59:49.740 --> 59:52.860
on evolutionary stalling to try to figure out

59:52.860 --> 59:55.900
how evolution figures out what to try to improve?

59:55.900 --> 59:56.980
Did that help?

59:56.980 --> 59:59.740
Yes, because we were not supposed to

59:59.740 --> 01:00:01.100
mess with the translation.

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:02.940
That's exactly what we did.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:07.500
And we altered elongation by changing it

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.940
with different versions of elongation

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:13.140
that are either coming from species

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:16.180
that still are around today.

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:19.260
You can imagine them as sitting on the tips of the tree,

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:22.540
near branch, far branch,

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:25.340
compared to the organism that we're working with,

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.860
cousins, distant cousins,

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.180
as well as the ancestors of the bacteria

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:33.300
that we are now modifying.

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:35.700
How much different variation is there

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.100
in that elongation step?

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:39.180
What are the different flavors of elongation?

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:40.100
That's a very good question.

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.900
So mechanistically or mechanically, it's the same.

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.380
It's very conserved.

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.180
So all life elongates the same way.

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:49.780
It's nothing but a shuttle.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:54.780
You just carry the chemical with you, the bit,

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:58.260
to the heart of the machine.

01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:01.020
Is it essentially doing like a copy paste operation?

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:06.020
It has its tail that's attached to the code,

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:11.420
which is then carried biochemically to the linear chain,

01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.260
to the core of ribosome.

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:15.540
And it sits on there.

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:18.100
It's released and the peptides click,

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.620
the codes rather click.

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:23.940
Once that chemistry that is at the tail end occurs,

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:28.700
the protein leaves the center.

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.500
So you can imagine it's like it's hops in there

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.700
and hops out.

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.020
And when it hops in, hops out,

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:34.980
it leaves the information behind.

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:36.700
That's all it does is bring the information,

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:37.740
get out of there.

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:42.060
And it's all triggered by biophysics, biochemistry,

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.580
because of the way the enzyme choose energy,

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:48.660
in this case, GTP, how the phosphor leaves the center,

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:53.220
that gives the additional kick to the enzyme

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:55.260
to leave the center.

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:57.380
So which parts are different then?

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.860
Where's the different flavors of the location?

01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:03.500
Usually the parts that matter don't change over time.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:07.140
Nature conserves the sites of these proteins

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.860
that are important for its job.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:12.980
If there's a difference, then we wanna know,

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:17.020
especially if there's a difference between two cousins.

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:20.540
And we look at the sites that interact

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:24.700
with the most important parts of this machinery.

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.900
If we see any difference, we tend to mutate

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.180
or we revert, we engineer that part,

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.980
we alter that part because it gives us a clue

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.580
that there must be something interesting

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:34.020
going on here or not.

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:37.380
Okay, so that's not the fundamental part of the machinery,

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.020
but it's some flavorful characteristic

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:40.860
that you can play with.

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:43.380
So now you stripped the machinery down to its parts,

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.140
and now you are looking at the parts of the parts.

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:49.820
And it depends where you're looking

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:52.100
and how you're looking and what you're looking at.

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:57.100
But usually we see up to 70% level conserved identity

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:02.260
across all modern versions.

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:05.300
When you travel back in time, the identity decreases.

01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:08.180
So elongation likely existed.

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:10.340
We have good reason to think that it existed

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:11.260
at the dawn of life.

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:14.940
So you're looking at a 3.8-billion-year-old mechanism.

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:19.020
And when we look at the ancestors that we resurrect,

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.660
we see about 40% identity.

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:25.060
So the identity definitely decreases as you go back in time,

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:29.580
but still 60% shared information over four billion year.

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:30.660
It's pretty good.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:31.940
Is that just for elongation

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:33.060
or for the entire translation?

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.300
Depends on what you do.

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:37.780
So for initiation, we've also recently published this.

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:40.220
It's a different story.

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:45.020
But overall, you see high level of identity

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:46.460
that is kept intact,

01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:49.380
especially if the component is essential for life.

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:53.540
Okay, so 40% and 70% you said.

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:57.540
But from generation to generation, how does evolution,

01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.820
and presumably that's what that paper is looking at

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.220
is the parts of the parts.

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:06.220
How does it able to say, like mess with the parts

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:08.340
and try to come up with a cooler,

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.780
improved version of the organism?

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.940
Yeah, so let me describe to you

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:13.140
what we did in that experiment.

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:15.820
We took bacteria.

01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:18.980
We perturbed the elongation in all of these

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.220
with different variants.

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:25.220
So we had an initial set of a group of bacteria that we had.

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:29.420
We then subjected these bacteria to evolution in the lab.

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.500
All right, so first of all, we knew we broke it

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.740
because upon engineering, we measured

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:36.060
what's going on with the cell.

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:37.140
It's not growing as well.

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:37.980
They're not healthy.

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:39.300
We can see it with our eyes.

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:42.100
We can measure it that if they were generating

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:45.220
an offspring every 20 minutes, now it is 40 minutes, right?

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:46.380
So we really messed them up.

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:48.660
They don't want to work with this thing.

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:51.140
They don't want each other, but they need each other.

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.780
So we created that situation for them,

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:58.780
which is good because we wanted to see

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:02.980
how they will cooperate with each other

01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:06.540
to fix this problem because we know

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:09.500
that that's not the condition that they want to live in,

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.740
especially when they know what they can do.

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:15.260
So with that, we subjected these organisms

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:17.220
to evolution in the lab.

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:21.660
We refer to this as experimental evolution.

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:26.660
We subject bacteria to different selection pressure,

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:30.580
project them through bottlenecks.

01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:35.420
Every day, we randomly collect a handful of bacteria

01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:38.780
from the flask, put them in a new fresh environment

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:41.420
with fresh food, keep them in this environment

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:45.100
for 24 hours until they reach a more dormant state,

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:48.540
and then we subject, introduce them to a new environment.

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:53.540
So we repeated this for about it, I will say 150 days.

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:58.260
So every day, nonstop, we repeated this experiment.

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:02.300
Some kind of, how many different kinds

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.340
of environments are there?

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:06.180
We kept the environments to the same,

01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:08.060
because we had different initial conditions.

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:10.940
We kept the environment constant, same temperature,

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:14.220
same food, same source of carbon,

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:19.220
but we created replicates for each lineage.

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:22.780
So in some ways, we created our own fossil record

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:25.900
in the lab by evolving and generating these flasks,

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:30.700
and every step of the way, we also froze these cells

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:33.740
and took stocks of them in the cryo-freezer.

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:35.740
How long does it take to go from one generation

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:37.380
to the next of bacteria?

01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:41.300
If you, for E. coli, it's usually 20 minutes.

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:43.500
Okay, great.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.460
So that's the experiment.

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:46.300
That's the experiment.

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:50.500
And you're always messing with it in the same way

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.740
for the initial condition?

01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:52.620
It's the same way.

01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:55.700
So we introduced variation at the elongation level,

01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:59.900
so because we perturbed it with different elongations,

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:03.340
we found that if we introduce a different protein

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:06.580
that is very different, the cells don't like that, right?

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.460
So if the distance is larger,

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:11.860
the consequences also large,

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.660
meaning that you hit them harder

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:16.260
if you introduce a variant that is really foreign to them,

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:17.940
that's really distant.

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:19.540
In our case, it was the ancestor.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.340
They really did not like the ancestor,

01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:23.660
but they were okay with their nearest cousin.

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:25.980
Right, okay, great.

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:27.820
So you did vary in the distance.

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:29.660
We varied the evolutionary distance,

01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:33.380
and then we kept the experimental conditions the same,

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:38.260
and we propagated these populations every day for 150 days,

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:42.860
and we collected bacteria every step of the way

01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:44.900
and looked at the sequence.

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:47.180
We wanted to understand what sort of changes

01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:48.980
may have happened in the genome

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:53.940
to respond to the variation that we've introduced.

01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:56.180
So what kind of changes would you be seeing

01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:57.660
depending on the evolutionary distance

01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:59.100
or the thing you shoved into it?

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.060
Exactly, so we knew where we punched, right?

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:02.540
We punched right at the heart, right?

01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:03.940
We punched the translation.

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:08.780
So we expected, is it gonna be, is it translation?

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:10.660
Are we gonna see a change?

01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:13.860
Will translation respond to this by fixing itself right away?

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:18.340
Or will it be another outside of translation,

01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:20.300
something completely different, a different module,

01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:22.980
because translation itself is a module,

01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:25.460
or will it be within elongation,

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:28.060
a really sub-protein level thing?

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:33.060
So we had a strategy to identify the mutational pathways

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:37.620
by categorizing what we expected to find or where.

01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:43.260
Okay, so why does it not do multitasking?

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:47.620
Why is it not improving multiple things simultaneously?

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:48.460
Why?

01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:49.300
Simultaneously.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.980
It turned out that what we observed in general

01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:54.980
is that first of all, the harder we hit the cells,

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:57.500
the more likely they were to respond by changes, right,

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.820
at where we hit it.

01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:02.260
When you say hit it, you mean like changing something?

01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:03.380
I like to think of it as hitting,

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:06.260
because I like to think of this as breaking the cell, right?

01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:08.300
I mean, not breaking enough to kill it,

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:10.500
but we still, because they're still alive,

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.340
they're not doing their job well.

01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:16.020
So the bigger the evolutionary distance

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:17.940
of the thing you put in there,

01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:21.020
the harder the hit is how you think about it.

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:24.380
The bigger the hammer, the hit it with, okay.

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:25.460
That's what it turned out to be,

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:26.820
because that's what the data told us,

01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:30.220
that if the variation is higher,

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:34.180
then the consequences will also be higher,

01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:36.620
in the sense that the cells will not grow as healthy

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:40.620
compared to a variant that is coming from a near,

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:41.820
or a variant that is coming

01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.420
from a near evolutionary distance.

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:45.900
Is it wrong to think of this kind of hitting

01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:49.980
as akin to a mutation, or no?

01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:51.580
What are we supposed to learn from this hitting?

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:55.780
Like how the thing evolves after it's being hit in this way?

01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:56.780
What does that teach us?

01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:00.420
Because we see translation machinery as almost,

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:03.740
it is so conserved and so essential.

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:06.500
It is not even clear whether we can remove some of the parts,

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.740
or whether the entire translation will need

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:11.060
all of the same parts in the same efficiency.

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:14.500
We don't understand the rules of this machinery.

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:16.940
So the first thing we all understand is that,

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:17.820
what is the resilience?

01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:19.260
What are we really talking about here,

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:22.100
when we talk about you cannot mess with this translation?

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.460
Is this true?

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:26.180
Because it is so conserved and so similar,

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:29.300
and functions in the most conserved ways,

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:31.140
that was the first thing that we wanted to understand.

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:33.260
Did you learn anything interesting about the resilience

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.820
at the chemical, physical, informatic, computational?

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:37.340
No, I wouldn't say that.

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:39.500
I think the biological level, yes,

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:42.820
because we found that the different modules

01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:46.540
started responding to the changes that we've introduced,

01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:50.340
and that we could never recover the translation

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:51.980
as effectively as it used to be.

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:56.980
So that it never reached to its optimality,

01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:58.660
that it was always suboptimal.

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:01.460
It needed, say, one more mutation, perhaps, to get there.

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:04.660
It accumulated four mutations that was,

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.700
we did a lot of experiments to understand this, of course.

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.460
It was accumulating mutations.

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:11.660
It was getting better at its task.

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.740
Maybe it needed a couple other mutations

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:14.940
to get really good at it,

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:16.860
but somehow those mutations never happened.

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:18.820
And before those mutations happened,

01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:23.260
we saw another module emerging through mutations

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.620
and getting better at its own different task,

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:27.300
that is not translation.

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:30.420
You can think of cell as a web of networks, right?

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:34.140
And we think of this as multiple, almost, airports,

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:36.820
that are proteins that are more central hubs,

01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:37.820
versus there are proteins

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:39.220
that maybe are not as important hub.

01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:43.260
If you introduce a problem in the most populated hub,

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:46.340
you're gonna mess up the traffic system more drastically.

01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:49.020
And that's what we were messing with

01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:51.740
in the biological terms as well.

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.020
So when we say module,

01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:54.660
like translation would be one of the modules.

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:55.500
Translation would be one.

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:59.140
So you're basically saying when you mess with translation,

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:04.140
the organism would choose to either try to fix that module

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.900
or another module, depending.

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:07.740
Exactly.

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.060
But it wouldn't do multiple modules.

01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.540
It focused on one module at a time.

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:13.540
And right before that module maybe reached

01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:17.540
to its own maximum, it stalled its optimality

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:18.380
at a certain degree.

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:22.580
So you never get to a degree that is more optimal

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:23.780
than you can achieve,

01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:26.300
even though perhaps another mutation could get you there.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:29.140
Since you messed with the translation,

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.820
from a sort of optimal perspective,

01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:32.660
wouldn't it make sense for the cell

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:35.140
to try to start fixing the translation?

01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:36.980
That's exactly what we thought.

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:38.980
And it was not the case

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:41.260
for all the broken translation missionaries.

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:43.700
For instance, if the variant was coming

01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:45.860
from a near ancestor, that didn't happen.

01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:49.020
It was almost cruising around trying different modules

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:51.940
and sort of living its best life still without,

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:53.740
because there is no real urgency in the system

01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:56.020
to fix the most important problem.

01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:58.660
And there's also not a direction,

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:02.540
maybe to you it's obvious that's the problem,

01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:05.340
but to the cell, maybe you're the problem.

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.700
I'm living, like you said, my best life.

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.300
We don't, I mean, I guess that's the thing about evolution

01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:14.100
is we don't know what the right direction to...

01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:15.860
Yeah, it's almost like you can imagine

01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:19.060
that you have this messy closet and you can...

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:19.900
Go on.

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:25.060
Happens to be an accurate representation of my life.

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:28.460
So you take a look at it and you see all the sweaters

01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:30.740
or jeans all over the place.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.860
And then you look at a drawer that has socks

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:34.700
coming out of it.

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:35.900
And you think that's the most important one.

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:37.620
I'm just gonna fix that one.

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:38.460
And then you fix that one.

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:40.180
And then you think you will get to the other one,

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:42.980
but you don't because you just fix the most important one.

01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:46.020
That is the, whatever that was getting into your way.

01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:47.300
That's really what evolution is.

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.140
It's quite lazy.

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:50.540
It fixes the problem that seems to be the most immediate

01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:53.300
and it doesn't go beyond what it really needs to.

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:55.140
It seems like at least for our experimental setup

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:56.820
that was the case.

01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:59.660
Especially for rapidly evolving systems.

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:02.020
So like, or is the environment they're operating

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:03.860
in pretty constrained?

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:05.380
Is there urgency?

01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:08.540
I would say that we definitely constrain the environment.

01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:13.540
It's definitely removed from their natural setup.

01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:16.100
We are not evolving them in a gut.

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:18.580
It's a very homogeneous system.

01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:21.540
Very controlled temperature, controlled food,

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:22.860
controlled carbon.

01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:26.180
So just looking at that, let me ask the romantic question.

01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:29.740
How did evolution create so much beautiful complex variety

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:30.580
on earth?

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:34.260
Like from that, you're saying that we're talking about

01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:36.380
improving different modules, but if we step back

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:37.820
and look at the entirety of the tree

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:39.740
of the different organisms it created

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:41.740
all throughout history.

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:46.100
The stuff that's fun to you with the first few billion

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:49.460
and the stuff that's fun to me when I watch on YouTube,

01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:53.300
which is like the lion versus gorilla fights and so on.

01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:55.220
But the whole thing is fun.

01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:57.540
So with all that beautiful variety from the predator

01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:01.660
and the prey, from the self-replicating bacteria

01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:04.580
and all that kind of stuff, how did it do it?

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:07.260
How is a very difficult question,

01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:11.300
especially when we don't understand the past

01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:13.100
with clarity at all.

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:17.460
I can tell you that there seems to be very critical

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:21.340
innovations that happened throughout the history of life

01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:26.340
that are each themselves very sophisticated singularities

01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:30.380
that emerged once and then they set the tone.

01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:34.180
One of which is emergence of translation.

01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:37.620
It seems like it happened once, it had to happen once.

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:41.500
It seems like that's all it took, 3.8 billion year,

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:46.500
maybe older, clearly subjected to a lot of chemical evolution

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:50.140
even prior to last universal common ancestor.

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:55.140
And then you jump and you see emergence of

01:15:56.420 --> 01:16:00.620
cyanobacteria that's undeniably changed the course

01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:05.620
of those planets in the subsequent aerobic photosynthesis

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:11.820
that life learned how to utilize what's available

01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:14.420
in this environment in the most profound way.

01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:17.300
And then you move forward, you see the emergence

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:22.300
of eukaryotes, endosymbiosis, also another singular event.

01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:25.980
And then you move forward and then comes the plants.

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:29.900
These are, I counted, I think six different things

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:32.940
that seems to have happened just once.

01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:35.940
And singularity events in the history of evolution

01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:37.340
of life on earth.

01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:40.220
So what's really fascinating here is that there seems

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:43.460
to be two different courses, the time course.

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:46.540
Evolution is operating at the molecular level.

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:49.060
We're talking about seconds.

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:51.380
We're talking about mutations that happen every second.

01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:54.020
We're talking about selection that's also happening

01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:55.260
under a minute.

01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:57.580
So that is a very fast process.

01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:00.820
The fact that I can evolve bacteria in a lab

01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:03.980
and I say almost complaining, oh my goodness,

01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:06.180
it took me 150 days.

01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:10.140
I mean, that's pretty rapid for a change to be seen.

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:14.420
But then the big changes and the ones that I'm talking,

01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:18.580
the really big innovations that caused an increase

01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:22.180
of oxygen on this planet or even its own mere presence

01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:24.660
are due to these molecular innovations.

01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:27.340
Seems to only happen a handful of times

01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:29.460
over billions of years of time scale.

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:31.500
Let me ask you this question having to do

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:34.140
with my half asleep tweet.

01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:37.940
So saying that we all originated from one common ancestor,

01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:43.580
that's just one of the miraculous things

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:45.700
about life on earth.

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:48.060
Of course you could say there's multiple common ancestors

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:50.540
in the beginning, multiple organisms and so on.

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:52.500
But the other stuff that you're talking about

01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:56.820
is these singular events, these leaps of invention

01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:58.860
throughout evolutionary history.

01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:01.860
Now there's a bunch of people who were commenting,

01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:03.620
a bit surprising to me,

01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:06.900
who were basically skeptical of this idea.

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:07.900
The idea of?

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:10.820
Well, I would say evolution, honestly.

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.060
The process of evolution,

01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:16.820
but when you just actually focus in on like, holy crap.

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:20.620
Eukaryotes were invented.

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:23.700
Holy crap, photosynthesis were invented.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:25.420
Those are incredible inventions.

01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:29.820
And also we can even go to homo sapiens, intelligence.

01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:30.900
Where did that come from?

01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:33.620
There's these mysteries.

01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:37.220
I think where that skeptical comments were coming from

01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:40.780
were also just the general skepticism of science.

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.980
I think from the pandemic,

01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:46.700
people may be a failure of institutions and so on.

01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:51.900
Like there's been a growing distrust of science

01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:55.220
and it's not so much that it's anti-evolution.

01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:59.180
It's more of a stepping back and saying, wait a minute,

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:01.820
maybe scientists don't have it all figured out.

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:06.820
And I think to steal man that case

01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:09.820
is almost a step back into realize

01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:13.460
there's so much mystery to each of these leaps.

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:14.940
So it makes you wonder,

01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:17.020
is there something that in 100, 200 years

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:20.060
we'll figure out that we totally don't understand yet?

01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:25.780
I talked to a bunch of people about another mystery,

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:27.460
which is consciousness.

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:29.500
And there's people called panpsychists

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.540
who believe consciousness

01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:34.060
is one of the fundamental laws of the universe.

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:37.700
So there could be, like we have laws of physics,

01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:42.340
that could be something that's like a consciousness field

01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:45.220
or something that permeates all matter.

01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:47.500
And so like there might be,

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.180
it's kind of like Newtonian physics

01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:50.980
versus general relativity.

01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:54.620
Like we have a good understanding of how things happen,

01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:57.460
but we need another layer of understanding

01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:00.460
to fill in the gaps of the mysteries of it all.

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:03.980
And that sort of is a sobering reality

01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:05.660
that maybe there is something

01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:07.500
we really deeply don't understand.

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:11.940
Do you have a sense of where the biggest mysteries here are?

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:14.540
Is it at the origin of life itself?

01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:18.380
Is it the leaps that we're talking about?

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:20.660
So you see the beauty,

01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:23.180
you're fascinated about the translation mechanism.

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:27.780
What are the deep mysteries there to you?

01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:33.220
We are nothing but chemical systems

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:36.940
capable of formulating or answering questions

01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:38.900
about our own existence.

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:42.980
We humans or all of life, you think?

01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:43.820
Oh, you don't know.

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.900
Humans are, I mean, the fact that we can,

01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:50.820
we even have this conversation about our place

01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:54.300
in the universe is, at least to our knowledge,

01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:58.140
it's quite specific to our own chemical species.

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.300
But.

01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:02.260
Yeah, it's kind of wild.

01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:05.700
We're introspecting on our evolutionary history

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:08.220
and we're just a couple of organisms.

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:11.540
With like another organism listening to this

01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:13.980
and like they're mind blown.

01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:16.020
There's like three organisms,

01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:18.820
two of them talking and the third one's like, holy shit.

01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:22.940
I think that understanding the,

01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:24.380
what I really find interesting

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.100
about understanding origin of life

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:29.700
or even contemplating about our own place in the universe,

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:33.740
if at the end of this would come down to appreciating

01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:36.060
or even before appreciating,

01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:39.740
really truly comprehending what it is that we got here.

01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:43.540
That to me is a huge gain

01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:47.620
because there's no single question in biology,

01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:49.900
I think that will give that,

01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:51.580
that will deliver that magnitude

01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:53.580
of that message and understanding.

01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:57.380
But understanding how life here started at first place,

01:21:57.380 --> 01:22:00.260
if we truly comprehend that.

01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:03.780
This is not a concept that is well thought in schools.

01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:07.220
We asked students to memorize these concepts.

01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:09.700
If they are lucky, they learned RNA world,

01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:13.260
chicken and egg problem, et cetera.

01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:14.940
That's the extent to which that,

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:17.580
maybe their biology teacher was personally interested

01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:20.220
in the subject matter, if they're lucky.

01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:25.220
You know the saying that the brains are evenly distributed

01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:30.220
across any metric you can imagine,

01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:31.900
but opportunities are not.

01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:38.380
So if people aren't understanding the importance of this

01:22:38.380 --> 01:22:40.940
is because that's a lack of opportunity right there.

01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:45.940
That was skipped through the proper education and training

01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:49.980
in the delivery of why science matters

01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:51.100
or how science actually works.

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:56.100
Yeah, but how do you even begin to seriously think

01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:57.900
about the origin of life?

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:03.740
I mean, every problem of existence of life has its time.

01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:11.980
So I don't know if it's time to understand consciousness yet.

01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:14.940
We might be a hundred years away from that.

01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:17.580
The origin of life, I don't know if it's time

01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:18.860
for us to understand that yet.

01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:22.420
Maybe we need to solve so many more problems along the way.

01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:23.260
And so-

01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:24.980
It's not a competition of problems, right?

01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:26.980
So there are all kinds of problems

01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:28.860
and it takes a lot of people to make the world.

01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:31.900
So you will always have some interesting brain

01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:35.180
going after an interesting problem to their own.

01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:38.780
The issue here is that we need to first of all understand

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:43.780
that what we have going on on this planet is pretty good.

01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:46.300
Good planets are hard to find.

01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:49.700
If we are alone in the universe, that's huge.

01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:53.420
We need to take care of what we got here.

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:57.980
And we are incredibly vulnerable to the changes

01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:00.900
that our own species also helped create

01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:04.260
at the biosphere, at the ecosystem level.

01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:05.980
We take it for granted.

01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:09.020
We take what we created for granted because of the fact

01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:12.700
that we think we are some sort of ultimate end point,

01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:14.380
the most sophisticated, amazing thing

01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:16.060
that nature could generate.

01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:21.340
I think understanding, not even understanding,

01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:25.860
but asking these questions of where did this even come from?

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:28.060
How did this even begin?

01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:32.940
And attempting to understand that using chemistry

01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:36.460
and physics and biology, and because we can,

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.420
that's the ultimate gift we can give back

01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:41.580
to the entire species on this planet.

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:44.580
Yeah, I mean, it's humbling.

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:46.980
It's humbling to realize the complexity

01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:48.060
of this whole mechanism.

01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:51.260
It certainly puts humans in their proper perspective

01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:54.620
that we're not, just because we have brains

01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:56.100
and brains are intelligent,

01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:59.580
doesn't mean we're the most intelligent thing

01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:02.060
because ultimately the whole mechanism of nature

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:04.540
seems to be orders and magnitude more intelligent.

01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:06.620
All of it, like we're a bunch,

01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:09.260
we're like a hierarchy of organisms

01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:12.140
that have a history of several billion years

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:14.860
and that all somehow came together to make a human.

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:18.900
And there'll be life after us, just as was life before us.

01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:21.140
And something that comes after will be,

01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:22.660
perhaps even more fascinating.

01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:25.700
I think when you understand the magnitude

01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:29.140
of what happened here, there is no room for arrogance.

01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:31.300
It should overwhelm you and humiliate,

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:32.620
it's pretty humiliating.

01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:33.460
Yeah.

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:38.220
You know, it's quite amazing what happened here.

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:42.500
And there is no other discipline that will deliver that,

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:47.060
but exploring our own origins and looking at life

01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:49.420
as a more planetary system phenomena,

01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:54.180
rather than one single species at a time, a collective look.

01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:58.180
You mentioned in this question in your TED Talk

01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:03.180
is the two possibilities of the universe being full of life

01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:07.060
and the universe being empty

01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:09.180
and we're the only life in the universe.

01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:12.820
How do you feel about both options?

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:17.020
Just actually you as a single chemical organism

01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:21.020
introspecting about its existence in this world.

01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:23.820
It's having a planet full of life is interesting

01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:28.820
because we talked about life being all about chemistry,

01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:30.500
exploring solutions.

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:33.380
And having solutions in front of you is great.

01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:35.500
It's beneficial, right?

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.140
Solutions being different organisms.

01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:38.980
Like other humans, you see them as a solution

01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:39.820
to a chemistry problem.

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:41.140
Different, yeah.

01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:42.660
Oh, that's an interesting solution.

01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:44.420
That's not, next time, we're in Austin,

01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:45.580
so there's a bunch of weirdos.

01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:47.020
Every time I see a weirdo, I'll be like,

01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:48.740
oh, that's an interesting solution

01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:50.180
to this chemistry problem.

01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:54.940
Now you think like an origin of life science.

01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:57.500
It's funny that that one worked out.

01:26:57.500 --> 01:26:58.820
Let's see where else it goes.

01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:03.060
But having this emptiness and the unpredictability

01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:05.860
of uncovering a novel solution

01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:07.980
can also have its own benefits.

01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:12.980
And we should be open to what other solutions

01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:16.100
might be out there and exploring those solutions.

01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:17.540
Or to different chemistry problems.

01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:20.380
So that's where you see the other planets out there

01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:21.500
as different chemistry problems.

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.300
To their own local environment, yes.

01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:28.300
So how many chemistry problems have solutions

01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:33.180
that are lifelike to you out there in the universe?

01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:35.540
It's a wide open palette, if you think about it.

01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:37.260
I don't quite know.

01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:39.500
We know the chemistry is chemistry.

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:41.700
I don't think the chemistry will be different elsewhere.

01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.820
But again, what is selected by chemistry

01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:46.500
will be determined by the environment, most likely.

01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:51.500
See, I think there is life everywhere out there.

01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:57.660
So there's a guy named Nick Lane whose gut,

01:27:57.820 --> 01:27:59.420
and it's interesting to me.

01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:01.300
I wonder what you think about it.

01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:04.220
His gut is, there's life everywhere out there,

01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:06.860
but it stops at like the bacteria stage.

01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:11.860
So he says the eukaryotes is like the biggest invention

01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:13.380
and the hardest one.

01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:16.460
I wonder if he thinks that's an accidental outcome.

01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:19.500
If he thinks that's inevitable, I wonder what that means.

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:24.500
But it's a likely possibility that the bacterial

01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:27.220
or microbial life is definitely more attainable.

01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:32.580
So that's a weird world where our entire galaxy

01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:34.820
just says bacteria everywhere.

01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:37.340
So if you don't like microbes,

01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:39.300
you aren't on the wrong planet.

01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:42.260
No, I know, yeah, and viruses.

01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:44.460
I don't know which one there's more of,

01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:48.100
but they're both, and most of them are productive.

01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:48.940
They're fascinating.

01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:50.380
They do everything for us.

01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:53.820
If you don't like microbes, you're on the wrong planet.

01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:54.860
You're full of good lines.

01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:56.580
Okay, right, right.

01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:00.540
I just can't, there's like an imperative to the whole thing.

01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:05.540
To me, the origin is the hard question.

01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:11.140
But once it gets going, I just don't see the way.

01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:13.220
It seems like it's constantly creating

01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:18.220
more intelligent things, more fascinating complex things.

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.140
They're able to solve complicated problems.

01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:23.180
That's a very interesting, like that's,

01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:26.740
I definitely agree that the initial steps

01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:28.140
may be the ultimate determinants.

01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:31.380
You cannot stop it once it starts.

01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:33.420
It's possible, right?

01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:34.340
And-

01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:37.900
I just have never unearthed, but maybe,

01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:42.940
whenever I see life, it seems to flourish.

01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:45.340
Everywhere.

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:50.620
The thing is, I don't, the only thing I haven't seen

01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:51.780
is the start of it.

01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:56.420
Exactly, and how are we gonna understand that

01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:58.660
if we don't know the origin of life science?

01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:03.060
I mean, that's the, and the question here isn't exactly

01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:05.620
our ability to recapitulate everything that happened

01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:08.340
in the exact way that it happened, right?

01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:11.460
This is about what can happen rather than,

01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:12.940
or maybe how it can happen.

01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:15.380
You think it's possible to study

01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:19.180
the origin of language using English.

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:22.740
So, like there's a very particular chemistry here.

01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:25.180
There's a particular set of assumptions,

01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:28.300
understanding about what life is, what everything is.

01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:32.980
Our perception of reality is very specifically constructed

01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:34.700
through the evolutionary process.

01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:38.660
I wonder if it's possible to get to some first principles,

01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:42.100
deep understanding of how life originates

01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:44.180
in such a way that you can actually

01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:46.780
construct it on other planets.

01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:49.180
Ultimately, it feels like if you're doing it

01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:53.380
in a lab on Earth, you're always going to be using

01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:56.860
some aspect of the life that's already here.

01:30:56.860 --> 01:31:01.860
So, that's what I sort of talked about in my talk as well.

01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:04.420
And-

01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:08.860
Everyone should go watch the TED Talks, very good.

01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:11.020
The annoying thing to me about TED Talks,

01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:13.380
I guess it's by design is they're too short.

01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:14.940
It's like, come on.

01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:19.740
And did you know that there's no prompter involved?

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:21.540
There's no, wait, there is or there isn't?

01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:22.460
There isn't.

01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:24.340
Yeah, you have to memorize stuff.

01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:26.260
Yeah, it must be a grueling process.

01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:28.900
And thanks to my amazing editor

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:31.380
who probably is watching this too, David Bielo,

01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:33.220
that it was very, very helpful.

01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:34.740
But I would say that-

01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:35.580
Very professional organization.

01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:36.580
I like this podcast.

01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:38.900
It's a very professional organization.

01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:40.780
I respect that medium.

01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:46.660
Yeah, anyway, in the TED Talk about life, life creating life.

01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:51.860
So, it's a likely scenario that once we understand

01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:57.100
how life as a chemical system

01:31:57.300 --> 01:32:02.300
is capable of formulating its own expression

01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:06.940
and generating a memory and manages its existence

01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:10.980
on a planetary body for billions of years.

01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:15.980
Once we understand what conditions gave rise to that,

01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:21.180
we may be very likely to understand

01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:26.060
whether a different planet also be likely

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:29.500
to instigate its own chemical revolution

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:34.500
if it was provided through some missing ingredients.

01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:37.540
You can think of it as a sending fertilizer

01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:39.300
to a different planet that is missing

01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:41.900
its own chemical composition or lacking,

01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:45.500
or that it needs more of what it has.

01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:50.140
The difference between making that planet Earth-like,

01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:52.100
which this is not what that's about.

01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:53.940
We're not talking about terraforming,

01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:56.100
or if you're not talking about turning that planet

01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:58.460
into Earth-like system,

01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:02.020
we are talking about first understanding that planet,

01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:03.340
studying its chemistry,

01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:07.820
studying its properties well enough to understand

01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:11.140
whether it is close to its own chemical revolution,

01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:14.300
and maybe giving it that extra nudge.

01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:19.180
This is obviously a pretty big speculation and suggestion.

01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:22.140
And it's a very interesting proposition

01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:25.220
because this is a yes or no question.

01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:27.020
This is the ultimate would you rather.

01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:31.620
I think it says a lot about the perception

01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:34.100
of the person who's answering this question.

01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:37.180
That if the answer is no, no, no, absolutely not,

01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:39.020
that's not something we wanna do,

01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:41.020
I wanna know why that is the case.

01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:42.660
So just to be clear, what we're talking about

01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:45.500
is looking at the chemical cocktail of a particular planet

01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:51.700
and having like tasting it and seeing what's missing.

01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:56.100
So having a very systematic, rigorous scientific process

01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:58.380
for understanding what is missing,

01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:00.780
not what is missing in terms of to make it Earth-like,

01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:05.380
but what is missing in order to be sufficiently,

01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:09.060
have the spark or the capacity of the spark

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:13.380
to launch the evolution revolution,

01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:15.020
the evolutionary process.

01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:15.860
Exactly.

01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:16.780
And then the question is,

01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:21.580
do we want to then complete the cocktail?

01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:24.740
The proposition is to also make us think

01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:28.220
that we will likely have this capacity at some point,

01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:32.420
especially when we understand origin of life

01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:34.380
better and better, right?

01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:37.460
So we will be asking ourselves this question.

01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:40.420
I guess I wanted to bring this to daylight a little bit

01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:44.940
because maybe in 10, 20 years, maybe more.

01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:46.820
So you wanted to ask the ethical question,

01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:51.820
should we basically start life elsewhere on another planet?

01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:59.900
Or enable the chemical capacity of that planet

01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:03.820
that it may one day itself get there.

01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:07.340
Okay, so for me, the answer is yes.

01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:10.860
If you were to try to argue against my yes,

01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:11.700
what would you say?

01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:12.660
Why not?

01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:14.820
What's the worst that can happen

01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:17.820
if we seed another planet with life?

01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:19.660
What are the things we should think about?

01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:23.260
Is your main concern a chemical biological one

01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:25.300
or is it an ethical one?

01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:26.140
What do you think about?

01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:27.420
Well, the worst thing that can happen

01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:29.180
is that it wouldn't work, right?

01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:34.180
So that it's not likely that an attempt like this would work.

01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:36.500
That's probably, because how do you,

01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:39.020
you gotta be very, you know,

01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:40.700
you have to have an understanding that

01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:42.780
I don't think we have just yet.

01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:44.860
I see, because if it doesn't work,

01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:47.220
then we could try again, right?

01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:51.140
To me, the worst case,

01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:56.140
the thing I would be worried about is we create life.

01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:59.380
I mean, the same stuff I worry about, like with plants are,

01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:02.700
is things that might have a conscious experience.

01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:07.700
And then the dark aspect of life is life

01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:11.340
is increasingly a complex life.

01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:12.980
Maybe I'm anthropomorphizing,

01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:16.060
but it seems to have the capacity to suffer.

01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:16.900
Huh.

01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:20.540
And so we're creating something.

01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:22.460
It's like when you have children,

01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:25.740
you put creatures into this world,

01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:31.220
that will suffer, can suffer, and may suffer,

01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:35.220
depending on how you view life, may likely suffer.

01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:37.700
And so now you carry this responsibility

01:36:37.700 --> 01:36:40.540
for doing your best to alleviate any suffering

01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:41.700
that might go through.

01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:46.700
And that perhaps is romanticizing this notion of life.

01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:50.180
Perhaps bacteria are not capable of suffering,

01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:53.020
but perhaps we're not capable of suffering.

01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:55.260
Bacteria are not capable of suffering,

01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:58.060
but perhaps it'll create more complex life forms

01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:00.660
that would be able to suffer.

01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:05.380
And that feels like a responsibility as well.

01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:07.740
Of course, other people would be concerned.

01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:10.420
The more obvious concern is like,

01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:12.060
well, you just created a life form.

01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:14.940
How do you know it's not gonna be a super deadly virus

01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:17.780
that somehow is able to hurt humans?

01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:19.220
Yeah, my concern is more,

01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:21.260
I feel like that's a solvable problem.

01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:24.780
The problem of creating conscious beings

01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:27.300
that are able to suffer, that's a tricky one.

01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:29.300
Yeah, I can see why.

01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:32.660
Because it goes back to, again, would we,

01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:37.260
first of all, do we have a responsibility

01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:41.980
to propagate more of this chemistry

01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:45.020
that we have on this planet elsewhere,

01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:48.980
given that we know ultimately we will be vanished.

01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:51.900
By we, I mean, entire planet.

01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:58.220
And if this is, in fact, a very rare chemical event

01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:02.100
that happens because all the right circumstances

01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:05.420
came together and we were the lucky one,

01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:10.020
do we have a responsibility to sponsor it?

01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:12.780
This is, if we were to back up-

01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:14.740
Sponsor, I like it.

01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:16.300
That's a good way to put it.

01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:21.020
If we try to back up remnants of our civilization,

01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:26.020
so we wanna potentially create conditions

01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:29.580
on the different planets so that humans can survive,

01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:32.340
given that we know, or we want to,

01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:35.500
just for the sake of growing.

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:39.220
Yeah, propagating, becoming multi-planetary species.

01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:42.340
Exactly, but what really is at stake here,

01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:44.860
I think is actually, or what is really more interesting

01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:48.900
is what we don't see, which is, again,

01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:51.420
the chemical behavior that enabled everything

01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:52.460
at first place.

01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:56.340
That's different than sending potato crops

01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:58.980
or engineering bacteria to live on a different planet.

01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:00.580
That's very different.

01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:02.940
You're really stripping it down

01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:07.940
to what is possible at the chemical level.

01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:12.020
So even if you are instigating the chemistry

01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:14.060
on different planets, you are letting

01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:16.700
that very planet to do its thing.

01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:19.300
You're not necessarily contaminating this planet

01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:22.860
with different chemistry because the idea behind this,

01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:26.100
at least the way I thought about,

01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:28.300
is that you understand that planet,

01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:29.540
you understand the conditions,

01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:32.460
you understand the chemistry of the planet really well

01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:37.460
before choosing the planet as a candidate at first place.

01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:41.980
And then it's not about sending a missing ingredient,

01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:45.820
per se, but again, just sending more of what it already has.

01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:50.300
That will be respecting that planet's condition too.

01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:52.460
So I'm not suggesting any occupation.

01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:54.620
I'm not suggesting any colonization.

01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:57.460
I'm not suggesting any, like, let's just strip everything

01:39:57.460 --> 01:39:59.500
and make everything Earth-like.

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:00.860
That's not what I'm saying.

01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:03.380
It's more about empowering that place.

01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:08.380
What you are saying is likely to be the motivator

01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:10.020
behind all this.

01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:13.220
That's not, because I see suffering, I see pain.

01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:14.660
It's very interesting.

01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:17.020
I think this is a question that really reveals

01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:20.020
a lot about the person who's answering it.

01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:24.980
Well, okay, so the pushback on my pushback.

01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:28.820
If I still am deeply troubled by suffering,

01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:30.780
then I should be probably paralyzed

01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:32.500
about the history of life on Earth.

01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:36.580
And, you know, there's...

01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:37.420
Can you elaborate?

01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:38.540
What do you mean?

01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:42.860
Most of life who's ever lived suffered in ways

01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:45.380
that are almost unimaginable to me.

01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:48.340
You mean, like, our own species?

01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:50.220
Our own species and before.

01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:51.900
And animals living today.

01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:54.380
And we're not even talking about factory farms.

01:40:56.140 --> 01:41:01.140
We're just animals living in extreme poverty in the jungle.

01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:04.260
You don't, people think, like, in a natural environment,

01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:06.140
animals live in a happy place.

01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:10.260
No, it's a brutal place of desperately trying to survive,

01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:12.460
of desperately trying to look for food.

01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:15.540
And it's just, like, all of that life, that's just mammals.

01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:17.460
And we understand mammals, but, like,

01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:20.780
throughout, like, trillions of organisms

01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:22.460
that led up to those mammals,

01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:24.380
and the organisms living everywhere,

01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:27.340
like even bacteria, there's death everywhere.

01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:31.620
So maybe this idea of death, this idea of suffering,

01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:35.180
is actually, this thing that we see as a bug,

01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:37.300
is actually a feature.

01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:40.580
I don't think suffering is a linear property like that

01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:42.060
with life.

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:44.180
And I may be with Nick Lane on this one,

01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:46.620
that the likeliness of anything similar

01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:49.940
to what we got here evolving in another planetary body,

01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:51.820
I think is quite low.

01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:55.940
Where would you say is the biggest unlikely thing?

01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:57.620
Do you mean humans, or do you mean

01:41:57.620 --> 01:41:59.220
even multicellular organisms?

01:41:59.220 --> 01:42:01.740
Probably multicellularly.

01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:07.460
But I understand both sides of the equation, right?

01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:13.540
In one level, I can see that we may not have any other choice,

01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:18.540
but to back up this chemistry somewhere else.

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:22.620
So you would be saving, it's the ultimate saving,

01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:24.900
or our own record.

01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:29.660
It's not about, you know, yes, let's also save Beatles

01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:31.140
and all the amazing songs,

01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:35.740
but this would be the ultimate repository of life.

01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:39.620
But I can also see your point of view, for sure.

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:40.780
It's really interesting.

01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:44.460
So like, don't see the plan with the missing ingredient.

01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:47.660
Try to understand what the ingredients it has.

01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:49.660
Is it possible to construct life?

01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:53.740
For me, from a computer person,

01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:54.780
it just feels like something

01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:56.820
that could be solved computationally.

01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:00.300
We can learn from the mistakes that we've done here,

01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:03.780
and aspire not to repeat them.

01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:05.340
It is possible.

01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:07.100
We do amazing things as humans.

01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:09.620
There's a lot of suffering, but there's also a lot of beauty.

01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:14.620
And we could choose what we want to be,

01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:20.540
or what we want to see, right?

01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:23.420
So these attempts don't need not to come from,

01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:25.860
need not to come from a place of fear,

01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:27.100
but it can be ultimately,

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:29.180
can come from a piece of hope and love.

01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:32.100
I think we're just very recently figuring out stuff.

01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:33.900
Like we've even just a century ago,

01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:34.980
we're doing atrocities

01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:38.500
that weren't seen as atrocities at the time.

01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:42.140
I mean, I think we're learning very quickly

01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:43.380
of what is right and wrong.

01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:45.500
Yes, and I work with a lot of,

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.260
maybe because I'm at the university,

01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:50.740
I get to teach young people every day.

01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:56.620
Even at the time of four year or three, few years,

01:43:56.620 --> 01:44:00.780
you see generational difference

01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:03.420
already unfolding in front of you.

01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:05.980
And maybe that's why I see hope,

01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:10.980
because I think what we get to interact with in classrooms

01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:14.060
every year, it's just getting better.

01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:16.580
They are aware of issues in a way

01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:19.820
that I sure wasn't at their age.

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:23.620
Some levels I was, but in many levels I didn't think about.

01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:26.020
I wasn't concerned of the problems.

01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:28.380
They maybe have to be concerned

01:44:28.380 --> 01:44:31.380
because it's hitting the reality, it's hitting them hard.

01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:34.820
But younger people are not afraid of these things.

01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:37.540
An 18 year old can face these brutal facts

01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:39.420
about the planet in ways that

01:44:39.420 --> 01:44:41.940
I don't think any other generation before them did.

01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:42.860
Yeah, it's super cool.

01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:47.500
And there's all these cool technologies

01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:51.980
that aid in the process of a human being,

01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:55.820
being able to see the truth at deeper, deeper levels.

01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:58.420
Wikipedia and just the internet in general

01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:00.420
is enabling education at a level

01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:02.180
that was unimaginable before the internet.

01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:05.060
Yes, and I think space exploration,

01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:07.420
even contemplating about these possibilities,

01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:10.580
ultimately, and I will emphasize this again,

01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:14.460
should make us think about our own place in the universe.

01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:17.340
If we are alone, that is quite fascinating.

01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:19.300
And we definitely have a responsibility

01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:22.220
to guard what we got better and protect it better

01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:24.100
and don't take it for granted.

01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:25.740
If we are not the only one,

01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:27.380
that's also a lot of responsibility

01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:30.300
to understand what else is out there.

01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:33.900
So either proposition, as famously being told,

01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:38.620
is fascinating, but as a scientist, I think,

01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:41.820
and I think that's a general behavior,

01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:44.380
maybe not my fellow scientists listening to this

01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:45.780
can correct me if they aren't like this,

01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:49.980
but you need to have a level of optimism and hope.

01:45:50.980 --> 01:45:54.660
That's something that things are worth working for,

01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:57.140
worth dreaming, worth imagining,

01:45:57.140 --> 01:45:59.700
and we cannot just have fear of suffering

01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:04.700
or fear of pain stopping us from doing marvelous things.

01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:07.980
I've talked to quite a few people in my life

01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:10.820
who've gotten a lot of shit done,

01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:13.060
have helped a lot of people,

01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:15.580
and I don't know a single one of them

01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:17.540
who's not an optimist.

01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:19.300
Now, there's a place for critics

01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:20.940
and cynicism in this world,

01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:24.180
but in terms of actually building things

01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:26.180
and creating things in this world

01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:27.660
that help a lot of people,

01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:31.380
I think optimism is a requirement,

01:46:31.380 --> 01:46:33.820
is a precondition in almost all cases

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:38.180
in my limited, humble human experience.

01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:40.300
But I tend to, when I look out there,

01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:41.900
think that aliens are everywhere.

01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:47.260
To me, I have a humility about,

01:46:47.340 --> 01:46:51.380
I tend to see us humans as being very limited cognitively.

01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:55.860
There's so many things we don't understand.

01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:58.340
I think eventually we'll understand,

01:46:58.340 --> 01:47:01.220
of course we don't know this, but my gut says,

01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:04.540
we'll understand that alien signals

01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:08.100
and life has been all around us,

01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:09.700
and we're too dumb to see it.

01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:14.100
Whatever life is, whatever the life force is,

01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:16.300
whatever consciousness is, whatever intelligence,

01:47:16.300 --> 01:47:21.220
whatever the mechanism that led to the origin

01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:23.780
of life on Earth was everywhere,

01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:25.620
and we were just too dumb to see it.

01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:27.500
It's in the physics, it's somewhere,

01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:29.500
we'll find it somewhere in the physics.

01:47:30.540 --> 01:47:34.940
I think that's one of the most humbling parts

01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:37.260
of also being a scientist,

01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:41.140
that we know that we never know for sure.

01:47:41.140 --> 01:47:45.260
And for the outsiders perhaps,

01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:50.260
that may be a very strange way of living,

01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:55.460
especially when your pursuit is about creating knowledge,

01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:59.380
and that you'll know that what you created can also be,

01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:02.820
and hopefully will be disproven

01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:05.020
so that another level will rise.

01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:11.820
I think we've seen that, this lack of maybe connection

01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:14.660
between the approach to science or knowledge

01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:17.580
versus folks who are maybe not thinking

01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:19.220
about these problems every day,

01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:21.620
that we are okay with being wrong.

01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:23.900
In fact, we know that that's the only way

01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:26.180
to push the limits of knowledge.

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:29.500
How do you think life originated on Earth?

01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:31.860
We've talked about this a bit.

01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:34.420
Do you have a gut feeling about,

01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:36.460
first of all, actually even to step back,

01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:39.740
do you think, because you were flirting with this idea,

01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:42.820
that the translation mechanism came before life?

01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:44.700
I think that you cannot separate

01:48:44.700 --> 01:48:47.620
from emergence of translation machinery

01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:48.860
from emergence of life,

01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:51.260
or something like translation machinery,

01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:55.780
this whole informatic chemical computing system

01:48:55.780 --> 01:49:00.620
that is also capable of dynamism and evolvability

01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:04.140
that comes with biology, biological behavior

01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:06.340
from emergence of life itself.

01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:08.780
We've definitely took a lot of steps

01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:10.060
towards understanding origins.

01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:15.060
We are able to create molecules from right environments,

01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:20.700
lightning, heat, and you make amino acids.

01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:23.260
So we are able to create the building blocks,

01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:25.700
the Miller-Urey experiment.

01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:27.900
That's now like 60 years ago.

01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:32.420
We are able to create the building blocks.

01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:34.780
We are able to make them interact with one another.

01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:35.940
They can get more complex.

01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:37.700
Some call this messy.

01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:39.220
There's all this chemistry that's going on.

01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:43.500
We are able to have these chemicals interact with one another,

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:48.500
maybe have even some emergent properties

01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:49.900
that we can quantify.

01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:53.260
Definitely there is this trend

01:49:53.260 --> 01:49:57.380
towards more systems-level approach to origins,

01:49:57.380 --> 01:50:00.580
more introduction of systems-level chemistry,

01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:02.740
more network-level chemistry,

01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:05.060
and complex system integration

01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:07.260
in order to understand how,

01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:08.780
now that we can make these building blocks,

01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:10.220
we can make them interact with one another,

01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:11.780
but how do we make them interact with one another

01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:12.900
in more intelligent ways

01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:16.900
that will have the properties of a biological system,

01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:17.900
will be heritable,

01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:20.180
it will be responding to the environment,

01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:23.020
it will mutate, and it will sustain itself.

01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:25.140
That is the final bit, I think,

01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:29.540
in our original life adventure.

01:50:29.540 --> 01:50:31.380
And we are extremely close.

01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:33.620
I'm very optimistic that our community

01:50:33.620 --> 01:50:36.900
will get a handle of this problem in this decade.

01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:38.340
This is, in fact, I think,

01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:41.060
one of the most exciting times to be doing this work.

01:50:41.060 --> 01:50:44.100
What would be super convincing to you,

01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:48.420
incredibly amazing, would blow your mind

01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:52.460
if it was done, X was done in a lab?

01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:55.580
Like what would, I mean,

01:50:55.580 --> 01:50:58.020
I don't know if you would call it origin of life,

01:50:58.020 --> 01:51:00.500
but something really, truly remarkable

01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:01.860
and special done in a lab.

01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:03.420
What would that look like to you?

01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:05.500
The properties that I listed,

01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:08.220
this was five properties that I listed about

01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:11.500
in the machinery that is capable of sensing

01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:13.180
and responding the environment.

01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:17.540
If we can, I would imagine,

01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:19.820
it's similar to Miller-Urey experiment

01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:23.500
where they only sparked

01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:26.140
in particular environmental forces

01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:29.380
and were able to produce a chemical

01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:30.580
that is important for life,

01:51:30.580 --> 01:51:33.780
or a mix of chemicals important for life,

01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:35.500
or building blocks rather.

01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:39.460
I would, if I saw that a similar experiment

01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:43.020
where a well-defined geochemical parameter

01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:46.900
was subjected on a mix of chemistry,

01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:51.340
which led that chemistry to form

01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:53.140
some level of computation,

01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:55.580
informatic, biological property.

01:51:55.580 --> 01:51:58.180
And by biological, I'm gonna keep it to very minimum,

01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:01.380
as I defined early on.

01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:04.260
That would be super exciting to me,

01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:06.980
is self-organizing chemistry

01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:09.740
that we can create experimentally in a flask

01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:13.180
by simulating the conditions of early earth,

01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:16.980
be it radiation, be it temperature, mix of both.

01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:19.820
That would be very cool.

01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:21.060
And doing all the five,

01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:24.420
the chemical, physical, informatic, computational biology.

01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:25.820
Yes.

01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:29.380
So like simulation and a computer would not?

01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:30.220
No.

01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:31.060
Would not be good enough?

01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:32.420
It would be great,

01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:36.460
because they help to understand the parameters,

01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:39.660
maybe formulate, maybe quantify, create models,

01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:41.660
but ultimately you need to experiment.

01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:43.660
Unless it's quantum mechanical simulation,

01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:45.500
but that's going to be extremely difficult.

01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:47.660
So simulating from the physics up,

01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:49.860
that's going to be very difficult,

01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:53.460
because you're gonna have to simulate the physical,

01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:54.900
the chemical, the informatic.

01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:59.020
I mean, honestly, it's very difficult

01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:01.100
to start the quantum mechanics

01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:04.420
and end up in biology all through simulation.

01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:06.820
But the stuff that DeepMind did with alpha fold

01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:08.700
and the protein folding is really inspiring.

01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:13.420
It's inspiring in that you're able to do,

01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:14.820
to solve a difficult biology problem.

01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:15.860
Yeah, absolutely.

01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:19.180
That's why there's definitely a lot of benefits

01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:21.300
to those models, predictions,

01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:25.500
because they at least help the experimentalist

01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:27.700
to come up with the priors

01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:29.300
and parameterize things better,

01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:33.180
maybe eliminate very obvious dead ends early on,

01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:35.500
given that experiments take such a long time

01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:36.900
and it's a huge investment.

01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:42.540
And no one's a better experimentalist than nature, so.

01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:46.820
Let me ask you perhaps a depressing, sad for you question.

01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:47.660
You really want to make me sad.

01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:48.500
You're not gonna win.

01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:50.300
No, I know.

01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:52.180
There's a flame of optimism in you

01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:53.420
that will never be extinguished.

01:53:53.420 --> 01:53:54.240
Okay.

01:53:55.580 --> 01:53:57.140
The idea of paths permeate.

01:53:58.140 --> 01:54:02.580
You mentioned, would we seed another planet with life?

01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:04.900
Is it possible that our planet

01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:06.940
was seeded with life from elsewhere?

01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:10.140
So what the proposition I made,

01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:12.660
I like to think of it as protospermia

01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:13.780
rather than panspermia,

01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:18.780
because it's even more proto-state than acknowledging.

01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:23.460
Because in panspermia, you still have a cell, right?

01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:25.540
You still have something that is very,

01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:28.620
even the cell to me would be very Earth-like, right?

01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:31.700
I'm talking at sub-sabler level

01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:36.700
in the proposition of spreading chemistry.

01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:40.420
So spreading chemical ingredients, not spreading life.

01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:41.260
Exactly.

01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:43.180
It will be more like the fertilizer

01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:45.940
that is well-adopted and compatible

01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:46.940
with that planetary body.

01:54:46.940 --> 01:54:49.300
In panspermia, you're still imagining

01:54:49.300 --> 01:54:52.700
either an entire bacteria or microbe or a cell

01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:55.940
or something that is DNA, which is still Terran.

01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:58.620
So in that sense, that would,

01:54:58.620 --> 01:54:59.820
that doesn't matter to you,

01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:02.740
because it's chemistry, that's the initial conditions.

01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:05.140
It doesn't matter how the initial conditions came to be.

01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:07.580
They are what they are, and let's go from there.

01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:11.420
And there's all kinds of fascinatingly different

01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:13.140
initial conditions in terms of chemistry

01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:14.620
on different planets.

01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:16.220
But in terms of panspermia,

01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:19.340
obviously there's gonna be always room

01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:21.580
for those sort of discussions,

01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:26.060
or there will be, those discussions will always be present,

01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:30.140
I think, in any life in universe debates.

01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:33.100
But the problem I have with panspermia

01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:36.900
is that it removes the problem from the planet

01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:38.020
to somewhere else.

01:55:38.020 --> 01:55:43.020
It makes it very difficult to answer scientifically, right?

01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:45.740
You are just, you just took the problem away

01:55:45.740 --> 01:55:50.220
from this planet and formulated in a way

01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:54.140
that I cannot go and try to understand in the lab,

01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:56.180
doing experiments, or even through models.

01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:58.980
Does it though, so I've heard brilliant biologists

01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:02.980
like yourself say that, but I just, to me,

01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:05.220
okay, here's how I think of Earth.

01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:08.140
So I actually am able to hold all these possibilities

01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:11.180
in my head, and all of them are inspiring to me.

01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:12.940
I kind of think there's a possibility

01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:17.140
that Earth is just an experiment by a graduate student,

01:56:17.140 --> 01:56:19.900
by an alien graduate student, like.

01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:21.860
So I know the exact episode of Star Trek

01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:23.620
you're talking about.

01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:26.820
But like, there is some, to me, that's inspiring.

01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:28.140
If we are.

01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:31.540
But that's not what panspermia is about.

01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:33.620
That you're talking about my proposition.

01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:35.340
That's not what panspermia is.

01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:36.180
What's panspermia?

01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:37.020
It is.

01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:39.420
Oh, life just came from elsewhere.

01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:40.500
Still, that's interesting,

01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:44.340
because there's still giant leaps that happened on Earth,

01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:47.980
it seems like, beyond the initial primitive organisms,

01:56:47.980 --> 01:56:49.260
like eukaryotes.

01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:51.660
I don't think panspermia usually

01:56:54.100 --> 01:56:56.140
articulates at the level of eukaryotes.

01:56:56.140 --> 01:57:00.340
I think they talk about bacteria primarily.

01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:01.180
I think so.

01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:02.100
Right.

01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:03.300
So that's still interesting,

01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:05.020
because all the different leaps of evolution

01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:06.060
still happen here on Earth.

01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:06.900
That's still interesting.

01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:10.060
Yeah, but it's, I mean, it's definitely

01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:16.340
interesting to listen to, but I wouldn't place it in,

01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:17.940
I wouldn't know how to place it

01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:20.060
in the studies of origin of life, I guess,

01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:20.900
or early life.

01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:21.740
Here's how we place it.

01:57:21.740 --> 01:57:24.820
You have the initial conditions for the origin of life,

01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:27.900
and you try to create life in that way

01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:30.220
that you've described in the five components,

01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:32.060
and it keeps failing.

01:57:32.060 --> 01:57:35.340
So what panspermia allows you to do

01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:37.660
is to also consider the question,

01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:40.980
maybe there's missing components.

01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:43.180
How do you answer that question?

01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:45.220
Through exploration and through science.

01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:46.060
Yes, yeah.

01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:48.420
Looking outside of Earth,

01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:51.020
looking at the fundamentals of chemistry and physics.

01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:52.420
How do you understand that

01:57:52.420 --> 01:57:55.340
with fundamentals of chemistry and physics?

01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:58.180
How do you understand gravity?

01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:00.300
But you're talking about panspermia, right?

01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:02.660
Just, I don't understand how would you,

01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:03.820
it's different than,

01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:06.460
if you think it's similar to looking for life

01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:08.780
in the universe, is that what you're thinking?

01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:10.700
No, I'm saying there's a missing component

01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:12.180
that came from elsewhere.

01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:13.700
But a whole entire organism

01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:15.540
is not a missing component right there, right?

01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:17.300
I mean, when you're thinking about origin of life.

01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:19.460
No, no, no, that's an assumption.

01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:22.660
Your assumption is all the ingredients

01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:24.820
for the origin of life are here on Earth.

01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:27.980
Now, I tend to believe that most likely that's the case.

01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:30.340
I'm just saying it's inspiring

01:58:30.340 --> 01:58:33.380
to think that there is some ingredients

01:58:33.380 --> 01:58:35.340
you're gonna push back because that's not panspermia.

01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:36.700
That's part of it, but.

01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:41.340
See, okay, so think, but yeah.

01:58:41.340 --> 01:58:43.860
It's also kind of fun to push back on you.

01:58:43.860 --> 01:58:46.420
No, I understand, I understand.

01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:49.860
I understand if actually a living organism

01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:52.020
ended up here from elsewhere.

01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:54.620
That means a lot of the exploration we're doing here

01:58:54.620 --> 01:58:56.580
with the ingredients that we know

01:58:56.580 --> 01:59:01.580
will not give us the clues to the origin of life.

01:59:02.340 --> 01:59:07.180
But it just seems like it's still very useful

01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:10.340
to try to create life here.

01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:12.380
And then we'll see, wait a minute.

01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:15.900
Don't you think we'll be able to prove, not prove,

01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:18.660
but show that panspermia is very likely?

01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:20.460
Like if we just keep failing,

01:59:20.460 --> 01:59:22.100
we understand biology deeply,

01:59:22.100 --> 01:59:23.740
we understand chemistry deeply.

01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:24.580
I don't think so.

01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:29.580
I mean, the failure is not gonna indicate

01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:31.460
that this must have been,

01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:34.340
I don't think anyone will put the problem

01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:37.940
to something else just because our failures,

01:59:37.940 --> 01:59:39.660
our experiments failed.

01:59:39.660 --> 01:59:41.260
So failure means we don't understand

01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:42.300
the chemistry deeply enough.

01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:45.580
And given the progress we made

01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:46.980
and how many brilliant people

01:59:46.980 --> 01:59:49.100
are working on this right now,

01:59:49.100 --> 01:59:51.740
and it's definitely more,

01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:53.980
I would say that we are approaching this problem

01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:57.540
in more broader ways, different ways possible.

01:59:57.540 --> 01:59:59.500
I'm confident that we will get there.

01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:04.260
For us, again, we are interested in early cells

02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:06.180
and first cells and what followed origin of life,

02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:09.020
but we cannot be given that it's a continuum

02:00:09.020 --> 02:00:13.740
that's between the origin and emergence of first cells.

02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:17.540
It's hard to separate these two ends from one another.

02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:21.380
So given that life is a solution to a chemistry problem,

02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:25.140
if we re-ran earth a million times,

02:00:25.140 --> 02:00:29.220
how different would the results be?

02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:31.780
If we look at that wheel,

02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:34.500
how different would be the tree of life, do you think?

02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:35.980
Like what's your gut say?

02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:41.940
My mind asks, are you imagining

02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:45.100
if we're repeating the planet one million times,

02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:50.100
are we seeing, are these things that happened,

02:00:50.380 --> 02:00:52.180
I'm not talking at the chemical level,

02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:53.940
but at the environment level,

02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:57.100
do they happen at the same time, at the same frequency,

02:00:57.100 --> 02:00:58.780
at the same intensity,

02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:01.940
every time you're running this tape over and over again?

02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:04.140
Yes, you mean like geological stuff?

02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:05.300
Yeah, like so is the same-

02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:06.540
So you're saying those are important.

02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:09.580
I mean, the fact that you would ask that question

02:01:09.580 --> 02:01:10.460
is also fascinating.

02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:13.260
So that's important, the timing, the frequency,

02:01:13.260 --> 02:01:15.020
the intensity of geological events?

02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:16.980
Yeah, so when we run this imaginary

02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:19.380
rewind and replay experiments in our minds,

02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:22.100
I wanna know whether we are positioning

02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:23.620
all the same geologic events

02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:25.900
at the same chronological order as well,

02:01:25.900 --> 02:01:28.900
or whether we are also giving them more randomness.

02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:31.740
So if the volcano erupted, is it happening at the same time?

02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:35.260
If you have a, our dinosaurs getting wiped off every time

02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:38.060
with the same meteorites hitting the same-

02:01:38.060 --> 02:01:39.700
But also like temperature changes and all that-

02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:41.540
Temperature changes everything.

02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:43.540
That's actually, I've heard you say somewhere

02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:45.980
that one of the things that's fascinating to you

02:01:45.980 --> 02:01:48.260
about this whole process of evolution

02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:53.260
is that the process of evolution,

02:01:53.980 --> 02:01:56.300
all the mechanisms were invented and developed

02:01:57.460 --> 02:02:00.620
despite all the variation geologically,

02:02:00.620 --> 02:02:03.060
through the hardship that Earth has gone through.

02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:06.580
That the biological innovations persisted despite that?

02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:09.740
Yeah, despite that, which is interesting.

02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:12.460
You kind of think of the biological innovations

02:02:12.460 --> 02:02:13.860
kind of happening on their own.

02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:17.220
Because we, so we actually have a center

02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:18.500
exploring this problem.

02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:21.740
We wanna understand whether,

02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:24.060
it's almost like judging a book by its cover, right?

02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:25.820
Do you just look at an environment

02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:28.300
and then see whatever is present

02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:29.980
or scarce in that environment,

02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:32.340
and then think that, okay, the life form

02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:34.060
that will exist in this environment

02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:38.220
will obviously have a lot of molybdenum in its system.

02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:40.500
Look at all this molybdenum around there.

02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:43.740
Or will it be, because if you say that,

02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:45.460
you are now putting the environment

02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:49.900
in the more prime driver role, right?

02:02:49.900 --> 02:02:51.980
You're saying that environment will determine

02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:54.420
what biology will or will not use.

02:02:55.260 --> 02:02:59.620
But we've done studies that show

02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:02.660
that it's not necessarily this straightforward.

02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:06.260
That for instance, we looked at going back to nitrogen.

02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:09.460
One thing that's fascinating about the way cells

02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:13.100
fix nitrogen, the ones that can do,

02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:16.580
is that they also do this through a lot of help

02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:19.660
of a lot of metals, a lot of elemental support really.

02:03:20.620 --> 02:03:25.620
And which geologists use to understand

02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:29.140
where did this metabolism even evolve,

02:03:29.140 --> 02:03:30.820
where at first place?

02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:32.260
So we look at ancient oceans,

02:03:32.260 --> 02:03:34.260
we try to understand the elemental composition

02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:35.860
of ancient oceans.

02:03:35.860 --> 02:03:39.500
And what we see is that in some cases,

02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:42.500
the metabolisms, even though they prefer a certain metal

02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:44.500
or an element that is in the environment,

02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:48.620
that metal wasn't abundant in the environment,

02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:51.020
but still life chose that.

02:03:51.020 --> 02:03:53.900
So it's not that straightforward as though whatever,

02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:56.740
you are what you eat,

02:03:56.740 --> 02:03:59.860
but you don't necessarily eat what is obvious to you.

02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:01.580
Just because there's a lot of that food around you

02:04:01.580 --> 02:04:03.300
doesn't mean life will ultimately go there.

02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:05.140
Maybe most of the time it will,

02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:07.540
but it seems like in the case of nitrogen fixation,

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:09.460
it didn't and maybe that made the difference.

02:04:09.460 --> 02:04:11.260
It's so cool that, right,

02:04:11.260 --> 02:04:12.500
it's not the abundant resource

02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:13.740
that's going to be the definition

02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:15.740
of what kind of life flourishes.

02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:21.260
So it's not a straightforward thing,

02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:24.940
but your sense is that the different timing

02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:26.780
of the different conditions of the environment

02:04:26.780 --> 02:04:29.900
would change the way evolution happens.

02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:31.100
Yeah, for instance, I mean,

02:04:31.100 --> 02:04:35.060
I think it's in the 80s, maybe earlier than that,

02:04:35.060 --> 02:04:37.860
Stephen Jay Gould's book, Wonderful Life,

02:04:37.860 --> 02:04:41.740
which changed, I think, a lot of scientists' life,

02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:42.780
including mine.

02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:48.500
He contemplates on this notion of the tape of life.

02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:51.380
Of course, I hope people still know what tape is,

02:04:51.380 --> 02:04:53.500
but I think your listeners will know what tape is.

02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:54.420
I don't know.

02:04:54.420 --> 02:04:55.940
It's the tape.

02:04:55.940 --> 02:04:58.140
Go on, tell me about the tape.

02:04:58.140 --> 02:04:59.860
Is it like a TikTok?

02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:01.100
Can you swipe on it?

02:05:02.740 --> 02:05:04.060
I'm sorry, go ahead.

02:05:04.060 --> 02:05:06.740
I apologize for my rude interruption.

02:05:06.740 --> 02:05:07.860
I kind of asked for it,

02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:12.580
but he speculated or suggested this hypothetical experiment,

02:05:13.420 --> 02:05:18.180
if life was recorded or can be imagined to be recorded

02:05:18.180 --> 02:05:22.820
on a linear, is a linear chain of events recorded on a tape,

02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:24.460
and if we were to rewind this tape,

02:05:24.460 --> 02:05:26.380
would we listen to the same song, right?

02:05:26.380 --> 02:05:28.100
So this was, and in his proposition,

02:05:28.100 --> 02:05:32.740
I also thought, yeah, but are we replaying the tape

02:05:32.740 --> 02:05:33.900
in the same exact manner,

02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:36.820
or are we meaning all the geological

02:05:36.820 --> 02:05:38.020
and environmental events,

02:05:38.020 --> 02:05:39.620
are they happening at the same time?

02:05:39.620 --> 02:05:41.940
Because then you removed the randomness

02:05:41.940 --> 02:05:43.620
from equation a little bit, right?

02:05:43.620 --> 02:05:45.900
You just removed it,

02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:47.700
because you're assuming everything will happen

02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:49.020
at the same time, at the same intensity.

02:05:49.020 --> 02:05:50.620
So that's not too contingent.

02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:53.820
That means that the natural selection you're thinking

02:05:53.820 --> 02:05:55.140
is really operating it more,

02:05:55.140 --> 02:06:00.140
or evolution is operating it under more random forces,

02:06:00.220 --> 02:06:02.260
then that can be dictated by the environment.

02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:04.900
So in our way of understanding

02:06:04.900 --> 02:06:06.460
or thinking about rewinding, replaying,

02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:08.420
I don't think we're thinking about the role

02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:09.860
of the environment as clearly,

02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:13.220
or don't seem to be integrated as much.

02:06:13.220 --> 02:06:15.820
But I also wonder if it's possible

02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:19.620
that the chemistry ultimately defines the destination,

02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:23.540
that despite all the environmental changes,

02:06:23.540 --> 02:06:26.260
despite all the randomness,

02:06:26.260 --> 02:06:28.300
we'll end up in something.

02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:29.420
But we are not talking about

02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:31.980
whether life will emerge and sustain itself.

02:06:31.980 --> 02:06:33.740
We are talking about whether life will emerge

02:06:33.740 --> 02:06:36.060
and sustain itself in the shape and form

02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:38.260
that is similar to what we have right now.

02:06:39.140 --> 02:06:40.700
You are chemistry, I'm chemistry.

02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:41.940
We're having this conversation,

02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:43.820
and your plants are chemistry too.

02:06:43.820 --> 02:06:45.740
They're also having their own conversation.

02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:47.540
These plants are fake, but yes.

02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:48.380
I knew that.

02:06:48.380 --> 02:06:51.100
I didn't want to say that, but they're fake.

02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:52.060
Do you look at my place?

02:06:52.060 --> 02:06:53.220
Of course they would be fake.

02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:54.500
Otherwise they would die.

02:06:54.500 --> 02:06:56.420
What's wrong with this place?

02:06:56.420 --> 02:06:57.380
It's wonderful.

02:06:58.780 --> 02:07:01.060
I'm Alice, and this is Wonderland.

02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:02.260
This is great.

02:07:02.260 --> 02:07:03.100
This is great.

02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:06.100
It's just that this is a place where robots flourish,

02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:09.380
and those plants are fake.

02:07:09.380 --> 02:07:10.340
Are you saying that you and I

02:07:10.340 --> 02:07:11.460
are the only living organisms?

02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:14.380
Well, obviously there are microbes in this room, but.

02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:16.700
Yeah, we are the only living organisms.

02:07:16.700 --> 02:07:18.900
I was thinking of getting a dog.

02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:21.020
This is not a clean room, so you have microbes here.

02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:22.180
Yes, many, millions.

02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:25.300
Yes, so you and I and all the microbes in this room,

02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:27.660
your chemical systems that are operating

02:07:27.660 --> 02:07:29.300
in a way that we can respond in sense

02:07:29.300 --> 02:07:31.700
and our environments and whatnot.

02:07:31.700 --> 02:07:34.460
But if you are asking if you're gonna be here,

02:07:34.460 --> 02:07:36.980
then you're imagining that another solution

02:07:36.980 --> 02:07:39.740
is also possible, which is different

02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:41.980
than the fundamentals of life,

02:07:41.980 --> 02:07:43.180
because life will do always.

02:07:43.180 --> 02:07:44.620
Life will do its life thing.

02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:48.860
I guess it goes all the way back

02:07:48.860 --> 02:07:51.380
to the things we were talking about, translation,

02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:53.900
and the stuff you were messing with is figuring out

02:07:53.900 --> 02:07:56.100
what is the important stuff and what isn't.

02:07:57.340 --> 02:07:59.060
Makes me wonder about, you know,

02:07:59.060 --> 02:08:04.100
just like with the translation machinery,

02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:06.220
with human beings, I wonder what's the important stuff.

02:08:06.220 --> 02:08:07.900
Is it important to have two limbs?

02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:10.540
Is it important to have eyes?

02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:13.900
Like it was obvious that the sensory mechanism of eyes,

02:08:13.900 --> 02:08:16.500
like sight, were to develop.

02:08:16.500 --> 02:08:18.420
How many times, if you were here on Earth,

02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:21.900
would the sensory mechanism of sight develop?

02:08:21.900 --> 02:08:22.980
And what would it look like?

02:08:22.980 --> 02:08:26.220
Would it be one giant eye, or would it be two?

02:08:26.220 --> 02:08:27.180
What's with the symmetry?

02:08:27.180 --> 02:08:29.380
Why are we so damn symmetrical?

02:08:29.380 --> 02:08:32.380
In response to Steve Jay Gould's proposition,

02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:38.180
most people who argue that life is convergent

02:08:38.180 --> 02:08:42.820
and it will in fact lead to a few determined outcomes,

02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:46.620
or it's not that the outcome is determined per se,

02:08:46.620 --> 02:08:49.580
but the pathways are restricted

02:08:49.580 --> 02:08:54.340
and the mutational trajectories that life can act upon

02:08:54.340 --> 02:08:56.300
are already very limited,

02:08:56.300 --> 02:08:58.940
so that the final outcomes are a few,

02:08:59.900 --> 02:09:01.380
and eyes being one of them.

02:09:01.380 --> 02:09:06.380
So the convergence at the eye level

02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:11.660
was presented as an example of why life may actually

02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:14.420
embark on the same solution over and over again,

02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:17.620
given that many species evolved it independently

02:09:17.620 --> 02:09:18.460
from one another.

02:09:18.460 --> 02:09:20.940
Do you think there's any inkling of truth to that?

02:09:20.940 --> 02:09:24.620
Like is it just us humans thinking we're special?

02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:28.620
I think those innovations came again so far after the,

02:09:28.700 --> 02:09:31.700
I know it's the fun stuff, yes.

02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:33.220
Because it's-

02:09:33.220 --> 02:09:34.060
Thank you.

02:09:34.060 --> 02:09:34.900
I mean, thank you.

02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:37.980
I think we humans tend to talk about the later stuff,

02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:39.180
but without the earlier stuff.

02:09:39.180 --> 02:09:41.660
Yeah, so when we think of earlier there's,

02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:44.260
and I ask this to my students too.

02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:46.020
I want them to close their eyes

02:09:46.020 --> 02:09:48.540
and think about just nothingness but dust.

02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:50.900
We don't have trees, we don't have plants.

02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:54.220
When we say an empty place, or visually at least,

02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:56.980
we are talking about a place where there's nothingness,

02:09:56.980 --> 02:09:58.940
at least to, we are talking about a planet

02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:00.620
that is really alien.

02:10:00.620 --> 02:10:03.100
So understanding our own past is similar

02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:05.660
to understanding an alien planet altogether.

02:10:05.660 --> 02:10:07.820
Given that it is a very different planet

02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:11.100
that did not have any oxygen for two billion years,

02:10:11.100 --> 02:10:13.700
we, there's nothing that is familiar to us

02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:17.900
that we would even think about when we think about life

02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:20.820
that is present in our past, yet here we are.

02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:23.900
So cool, that from that came this,

02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:25.140
like houses and people-

02:10:25.140 --> 02:10:26.700
And we are very, very,

02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:30.100
we are the super late arrivals to the party, right?

02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:33.060
So this is definitely not our planets.

02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:35.020
It's the microbial planets that we live in.

02:10:35.020 --> 02:10:38.380
But the potential to create us was always there.

02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:40.700
Like this- How do you know that?

02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:42.060
Because we were created.

02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:45.940
Oh, I don't know.

02:10:45.940 --> 02:10:48.700
What is, you think it's possible this,

02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:50.740
even for the early stuff,

02:10:50.740 --> 02:10:53.220
yeah, maybe if it's super unlikely, yeah,

02:10:53.220 --> 02:10:54.660
that we just got super,

02:10:54.660 --> 02:10:56.740
this is the planet that got really lucky

02:10:56.740 --> 02:10:57.860
given the chemistry.

02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:02.980
Like maybe to create the bacteria is not so lucky,

02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:05.180
but to create complex organisms

02:11:05.180 --> 02:11:07.740
all the way up to mammals, that's super lucky.

02:11:07.740 --> 02:11:10.820
Yes, and it may all come down to a few innovations

02:11:10.820 --> 02:11:12.660
that happened at the molecular level

02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:15.780
that may or may not be inevitable.

02:11:17.660 --> 02:11:22.220
That's, so all these molecular tricks may have enabled

02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:27.060
the sort of mere existence of whatever you are able to define

02:11:27.060 --> 02:11:28.660
is familiar to yourself.

02:11:28.660 --> 02:11:32.140
And you have a hope that science can answer these questions

02:11:32.140 --> 02:11:33.780
to reconstruct.

02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:35.340
Science is answering these questions.

02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:40.340
I mean, we are limited to going back to the beginning

02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:41.860
in our ways, right?

02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:45.380
So we rely on biology, it's this overwritten,

02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:47.860
you're talking about four billion year old records

02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:50.380
that is ever changing, that again makes it beautiful,

02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:52.100
but also makes it difficult.

02:11:52.100 --> 02:11:53.900
It's not tractable.

02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:58.900
Geology has some degree, to some degree,

02:11:59.940 --> 02:12:04.940
it has a record of a more static, frozen state record

02:12:06.780 --> 02:12:11.300
that is embedded on itself, on the surface of this planet,

02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:13.020
if we can find them.

02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:18.020
And that's the key that most of these recorded remnants are,

02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:20.700
if we are lucky, we find them.

02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:22.380
They are not naturally selected.

02:12:23.700 --> 02:12:26.980
They're found, they need to be found for us to read them.

02:12:26.980 --> 02:12:30.460
So we work with a very handful set of samples,

02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:34.380
especially when we talk about the deep past,

02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:37.100
the planet with no oxygen,

02:12:37.100 --> 02:12:39.580
when we passed the great oxidation event threshold,

02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:41.780
that is about 2.5 billion years.

02:12:41.780 --> 02:12:44.100
So the earliest life is even harder.

02:12:44.100 --> 02:12:46.140
You are trying to write a book,

02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:49.860
even harder, you are trying to write the story of life

02:12:49.860 --> 02:12:53.420
based on a handful of rocks and what is recorded on them.

02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:58.420
Speaking of finding select remnants of our deep past,

02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:02.980
you said that you've been thinking about Nick Mieland's

02:13:02.980 --> 02:13:05.900
essay on scientific knowledge and scientific abstraction.

02:13:05.900 --> 02:13:06.740
So let me ask you,

02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:09.940
where do you think scientific questions and answers

02:13:09.940 --> 02:13:11.860
or in general ideas come from?

02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:15.060
You're a scientist.

02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:17.500
You ask very good questions

02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:19.940
and try systematically and rigorously

02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:22.260
to answer them through experiment.

02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:24.380
Where do you think ideas come from?

02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:26.700
So ideas come all the time, right?

02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:28.460
There are all kinds of ideas, there are good ideas,

02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:29.980
there are not so good ideas.

02:13:31.300 --> 02:13:34.980
There are really exciting ideas, maybe some boring ones.

02:13:34.980 --> 02:13:39.980
But if you are really interested in doing something different,

02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:45.060
then you need to be willing to take the risk to be wrong.

02:13:46.060 --> 02:13:48.660
And that's incredibly difficult.

02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:53.220
Even though we talked about the idealist sort of notion

02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:56.460
behind science that we ultimately want to be rejected

02:13:56.460 --> 02:13:58.020
or our ideas need to be rejected

02:13:58.020 --> 02:14:01.780
for the entire infrastructure to move forward.

02:14:03.580 --> 02:14:06.580
There is a level of risk-taking, I think,

02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:11.420
behind any creative idea.

02:14:11.420 --> 02:14:14.220
And I mean that in a true sense.

02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:18.100
If you are disappointed that your idea didn't work,

02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:20.260
then it wasn't a risk

02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:23.220
because you still hoped that it will work.

02:14:23.220 --> 02:14:25.860
True risk is that you accept that this may not work

02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:28.300
so that the failure shouldn't also surprise you.

02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:30.780
Yeah.

02:14:30.780 --> 02:14:33.220
Is it when you embark on stuff,

02:14:33.220 --> 02:14:35.060
when you embark on an idea,

02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:40.060
do you actually contemplate and accept failure?

02:14:41.260 --> 02:14:42.100
Like as a possibility?

02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:43.620
Not consciously, I wouldn't say so.

02:14:43.620 --> 02:14:48.620
But I eliminated a lot of the things out of my work line

02:14:51.620 --> 02:14:55.940
by simply not feeling like studying them.

02:14:55.940 --> 02:14:59.220
I was bored, chasing certain questions.

02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:04.260
So you trusted the signal of boredom as a good sign

02:15:04.380 --> 02:15:06.220
and it's not a good question.

02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:09.300
It should definitely be,

02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:11.180
whatever you're doing should be exciting to you.

02:15:11.180 --> 02:15:14.100
If there's only one person that should be ever excited

02:15:14.100 --> 02:15:16.860
about what you're doing, that should be you.

02:15:16.860 --> 02:15:19.740
And that's enough for that idea to go somewhere.

02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:22.140
I think that you need to believe in the idea.

02:15:22.140 --> 02:15:23.700
But at the same time,

02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:26.700
I think it's important to not fall in love

02:15:26.700 --> 02:15:28.020
with your mistakes.

02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:32.740
That if something isn't working,

02:15:32.740 --> 02:15:35.420
you should let it go.

02:15:35.420 --> 02:15:37.420
Instead of trying to fix it,

02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:39.260
even though you feel that this is a mistake

02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:41.380
or you know that it's a mistake,

02:15:41.380 --> 02:15:46.380
in order to, sorry, instead of trying to fix it,

02:15:47.860 --> 02:15:51.620
you should wrap it up and move on to something else,

02:15:51.620 --> 02:15:52.980
which is incredibly hard.

02:15:52.980 --> 02:15:54.260
Good advice for science,

02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:56.260
but also good advice for relationships.

02:15:58.300 --> 02:16:00.940
But okay, so that's actually really hard,

02:16:00.940 --> 02:16:02.940
especially, I mean, this is like PhD stuff.

02:16:02.940 --> 02:16:06.140
Like if you sink in so much of your time,

02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:09.380
not even PhD, the entire scientific careers,

02:16:09.380 --> 02:16:11.340
it's really tough to let go.

02:16:11.340 --> 02:16:15.460
Yes, and there is not a lot of room for true freedom,

02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:19.620
maybe at this certain degree.

02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:22.020
So first you need to be trained, right?

02:16:22.020 --> 02:16:25.900
It's not that scientists are just brilliant, amazing humans.

02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:28.220
I mean, they just know and learn how,

02:16:28.580 --> 02:16:29.740
they know how to do science

02:16:29.740 --> 02:16:32.460
because they're trained in how to do science.

02:16:32.460 --> 02:16:35.940
So that is important because as someone

02:16:35.940 --> 02:16:39.020
who wants to definitely,

02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:41.820
I'm hoping that I'm giving the message

02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:43.500
that this is for everybody,

02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:45.900
that there's this notion of science,

02:16:45.900 --> 02:16:47.260
scientists being super smart people,

02:16:47.260 --> 02:16:50.780
that's definitely not true, right?

02:16:50.780 --> 02:16:53.980
It is a method that you learn to solve a problem.

02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:55.780
That's really what science is.

02:16:55.780 --> 02:17:00.020
And some are really good at it and they get better at it

02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:02.700
under really good guidance, maybe good mentorship.

02:17:03.780 --> 02:17:06.740
And ultimately everyone finds their own style

02:17:06.740 --> 02:17:09.460
of problem solving and what sort of problems they solve.

02:17:09.460 --> 02:17:10.820
But I have not met a scientist

02:17:10.820 --> 02:17:13.460
that finds their own pursue boring.

02:17:16.020 --> 02:17:18.380
Well, it can happen, but they're not going to be affected.

02:17:18.380 --> 02:17:21.500
Just like you said, I think it's kind of interesting

02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:24.260
because in the age of social media

02:17:24.260 --> 02:17:26.820
and attention economies and stuff like that,

02:17:27.780 --> 02:17:29.740
I've interacted with a lot of folks

02:17:29.740 --> 02:17:32.140
like YouTubers and so on.

02:17:32.140 --> 02:17:34.260
I think a lot of their work is driven

02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:36.100
by what others find exciting.

02:17:37.340 --> 02:17:39.500
And I think that ultimately leads

02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:41.860
to a life that's not fulfilling.

02:17:41.860 --> 02:17:44.500
I can see the reason behind it,

02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:48.860
or perhaps there's again, fear of failure

02:17:48.860 --> 02:17:53.820
that can be a major determinant of that pattern, right?

02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:57.900
So you try to do something that's accepted by others

02:17:57.900 --> 02:18:02.900
because that's maybe unlikely to give results right away.

02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:06.060
But it's a long game, it's a very long game.

02:18:06.060 --> 02:18:08.860
And if you are aiming a long-term change

02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:10.620
and long-term impact,

02:18:10.620 --> 02:18:12.980
you got to be very, very patient about it

02:18:12.980 --> 02:18:16.940
and you better tame your ego.

02:18:17.900 --> 02:18:20.900
I mean, on YouTube and those kinds of places,

02:18:20.900 --> 02:18:23.140
on the internet, on social media,

02:18:23.140 --> 02:18:26.580
you get feedback like right away.

02:18:26.580 --> 02:18:29.260
And so it's even harder to be patient.

02:18:29.260 --> 02:18:30.980
Yes.

02:18:30.980 --> 02:18:34.060
Because yeah, the change in ideas develop

02:18:34.060 --> 02:18:37.580
over a period of months and years, not decades.

02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:40.300
And the response from social media and so on

02:18:40.300 --> 02:18:43.260
is on the rate of seconds, minutes, and hours.

02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:46.460
So I recommend actual physical libraries

02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:49.580
for people who may want to appreciate

02:18:49.580 --> 02:18:52.220
or remember the sense of time

02:18:52.220 --> 02:18:55.620
and how long it takes to build something.

02:18:55.620 --> 02:18:58.020
I think it is, you're right,

02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:01.500
that's the immediacy and the right response of,

02:19:01.500 --> 02:19:05.780
and the fact that these places are,

02:19:05.780 --> 02:19:07.980
the algorithm wants you to respond right away

02:19:07.980 --> 02:19:09.780
and interact with itself, right?

02:19:09.780 --> 02:19:13.140
So I can see the appeal.

02:19:13.140 --> 02:19:17.100
But true innovation, I think, doesn't even scream.

02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:20.420
It doesn't, it's not shiny, especially in the beginning.

02:19:21.420 --> 02:19:23.460
But it's also important to not fool ourselves

02:19:23.460 --> 02:19:25.660
and think that everything that people criticize

02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:28.220
has some super important meaning behind it.

02:19:29.260 --> 02:19:32.260
So it's a mix of the technique, the methods,

02:19:32.260 --> 02:19:33.620
and your gut feeling.

02:19:35.420 --> 02:19:38.420
Yeah, and a weird dance between learning

02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:43.500
and accepting the ideas of the current science

02:19:43.500 --> 02:19:48.500
and at times trusting your gut and rejecting those.

02:19:49.300 --> 02:19:52.620
Because science progresses by sometimes rejecting

02:19:52.620 --> 02:19:55.220
the ideas of the past or sometimes building on them

02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:57.220
in a way that changes them, transforms them.

02:19:57.220 --> 02:20:02.220
Yes, and I think what is hard is to really drill down

02:20:03.780 --> 02:20:04.900
into a concept, right?

02:20:04.900 --> 02:20:07.780
So you can create a new thing

02:20:07.780 --> 02:20:12.660
and then it may be appealing and gain a lot of traction,

02:20:12.660 --> 02:20:15.500
but to sustain that, to continue that,

02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:17.940
you really need to show the true expertise.

02:20:17.940 --> 02:20:20.340
And so it's not only about defining a problem,

02:20:20.340 --> 02:20:23.460
but then really systematically solve that problem

02:20:25.020 --> 02:20:26.860
maybe over the course of decades.

02:20:28.660 --> 02:20:30.420
You mentioned the library.

02:20:30.420 --> 02:20:33.300
I've also saw that you've translated scientific documents

02:20:33.300 --> 02:20:35.500
or at least like mentioned that you did it

02:20:35.500 --> 02:20:37.140
at some point in your life.

02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:41.020
So let me ask you, how much do you think is lost

02:20:41.020 --> 02:20:44.340
in translation, in science and in life?

02:20:46.060 --> 02:20:47.740
How many languages do you speak?

02:20:47.740 --> 02:20:49.300
Two. Two.

02:20:49.300 --> 02:20:53.860
How much is lost in translation, in science,

02:20:53.860 --> 02:20:55.140
and in life between those two?

02:20:55.140 --> 02:20:56.580
It's actually three because science

02:20:56.580 --> 02:20:58.500
is like another language, right?

02:20:58.500 --> 02:20:59.340
It is.

02:20:59.340 --> 02:21:01.940
I speak Russian, a little bit of French,

02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:04.060
and it's always fascinating to see how much is lost.

02:21:04.060 --> 02:21:07.220
And the Soviet Union has a tradition of science

02:21:07.620 --> 02:21:09.220
and mathematics and so on.

02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:12.620
And it's interesting that a lot of the wisdom gained

02:21:12.620 --> 02:21:16.540
from that part of the world is lost,

02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:19.260
basically because of it was never translated.

02:21:20.700 --> 02:21:24.780
Well, I'm not sure if it is lost per se.

02:21:24.780 --> 02:21:28.860
I mean, maybe it's more like a gain in some sense, right?

02:21:28.860 --> 02:21:33.860
Because you understand science is ultimately a human pursue.

02:21:34.140 --> 02:21:37.700
So you cannot separate as much as,

02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:41.980
maybe it's the best system that humans ever came up with

02:21:41.980 --> 02:21:46.020
to seek knowledge, to generate and make sense of the world.

02:21:46.020 --> 02:21:48.660
It works most of the time.

02:21:48.660 --> 02:21:50.700
It doesn't mean it's perfect.

02:21:50.700 --> 02:21:52.540
Did the kind of translation you do, by the way,

02:21:52.540 --> 02:21:54.260
was for scientific work?

02:21:54.260 --> 02:21:57.700
I directly translated it for scientific work, yes.

02:21:57.700 --> 02:22:02.700
I think that, again, I don't know.

02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:06.420
Brains are equally distributed,

02:22:06.420 --> 02:22:08.620
but opportunities are not, right?

02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:13.580
So if you want to include,

02:22:13.580 --> 02:22:16.260
if you want to benefit from all human power,

02:22:16.260 --> 02:22:18.140
whatever we can generate as human beings,

02:22:18.140 --> 02:22:20.780
you need to include everybody on the table.

02:22:20.780 --> 02:22:24.020
And that is by extending the opportunity.

02:22:24.020 --> 02:22:28.180
I think most of us that make it tend to think that we did

02:22:28.180 --> 02:22:30.900
because of something special about ourselves.

02:22:30.900 --> 02:22:33.220
But it is important to know that,

02:22:33.380 --> 02:22:35.460
no, we were given opportunities,

02:22:35.460 --> 02:22:36.580
and that's why we are here.

02:22:36.580 --> 02:22:40.940
Not because there was something inherently special about us

02:22:40.940 --> 02:22:45.460
or that the system truly selects for the ones

02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:46.980
that really are.

02:22:46.980 --> 02:22:49.460
Yeah, and language is a part of the opportunity.

02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:50.780
Yeah, language is an opportunity

02:22:50.780 --> 02:22:53.740
because it comes with, similar to bacteria, right?

02:22:53.740 --> 02:22:55.460
They speak these languages.

02:22:56.820 --> 02:22:59.700
Even we call this, we call culturing the bacteria.

02:22:59.700 --> 02:23:01.180
We call it culturing, right?

02:23:01.180 --> 02:23:03.420
When we grow bacteria that we isolate

02:23:03.420 --> 02:23:05.340
from the environment in the lab,

02:23:05.340 --> 02:23:07.780
meaning that you create an environment for them to grow

02:23:07.780 --> 02:23:10.420
and thrive and sustain themselves.

02:23:10.420 --> 02:23:14.820
That's what we say, but culture is for microbiologists.

02:23:14.820 --> 02:23:18.140
For language, with language comes a different culture,

02:23:18.140 --> 02:23:23.140
a different perspective, and you bring that to the table.

02:23:23.540 --> 02:23:26.540
I mean, it brings the sense of diversity

02:23:26.540 --> 02:23:30.100
that can only be achieved by clashing perhaps

02:23:30.140 --> 02:23:32.620
two different cultures, two different languages,

02:23:32.620 --> 02:23:33.820
two different approaches,

02:23:33.820 --> 02:23:36.940
maybe in some cases, four different approaches.

02:23:36.940 --> 02:23:39.500
Yeah, I think language is not just

02:23:39.500 --> 02:23:41.220
a mechanism of communication.

02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:46.220
It's a way to, it's a dynamic system of exploring ideas,

02:23:46.780 --> 02:23:49.020
and it's interesting to see that different languages

02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:50.820
explore ideas differently.

02:23:50.820 --> 02:23:52.220
Yes, and I think that,

02:23:52.220 --> 02:23:55.500
so when I said science is like a language itself,

02:23:55.500 --> 02:23:56.580
I said it in two different ways.

02:23:56.580 --> 02:23:59.900
One is very literal meaning,

02:24:00.740 --> 02:24:01.580
that you can speak English,

02:24:01.580 --> 02:24:02.940
but that doesn't mean you will understand

02:24:02.940 --> 02:24:04.700
the scientific paper.

02:24:04.700 --> 02:24:06.260
That it's a different level of English

02:24:06.260 --> 02:24:08.220
that you need to learn to understand.

02:24:08.220 --> 02:24:10.500
Even, not just for scientific papers,

02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:12.700
even from discipline to discipline,

02:24:12.700 --> 02:24:15.740
I challenge any chemist to read

02:24:15.740 --> 02:24:18.900
an evolutionary biology paper, and vice versa.

02:24:18.900 --> 02:24:21.300
It may sound extremely different,

02:24:21.300 --> 02:24:23.180
a different language altogether.

02:24:23.180 --> 02:24:25.900
But there's also the language of communicating,

02:24:25.900 --> 02:24:28.900
and because words matter, how we talk matter,

02:24:28.900 --> 02:24:30.860
how we represent our science matters.

02:24:30.860 --> 02:24:34.380
So yes, just learning English as a second language alone

02:24:34.380 --> 02:24:37.740
is not gonna make you fluent in science either.

02:24:37.740 --> 02:24:40.260
And it's interesting, because in that sense,

02:24:40.260 --> 02:24:42.220
you speak many more than three languages,

02:24:42.220 --> 02:24:45.260
because you're pretty cross-disciplinary.

02:24:45.260 --> 02:24:49.700
It seems like you have a foot in a lot of disciplines.

02:24:49.700 --> 02:24:52.900
I mean, you're mentioning geology, biology,

02:24:52.900 --> 02:24:57.500
evolutionary biology, I mean, there's chemistry.

02:24:58.380 --> 02:25:02.380
Biochemistry, biophysics, even, we do a lot of statistics.

02:25:02.380 --> 02:25:04.460
So there's a lot of mathematics to what we do as well.

02:25:04.460 --> 02:25:06.620
Yes, we like to think of it as this

02:25:08.540 --> 02:25:11.100
NOS astrobiology program, I repeat it,

02:25:11.100 --> 02:25:16.020
because it's fun that it is not a fruit salad,

02:25:16.020 --> 02:25:17.660
but it's a smoothie.

02:25:17.660 --> 02:25:19.260
That that's what we're generating.

02:25:21.540 --> 02:25:23.180
It's not a fruit salad, it's a smoothie.

02:25:23.180 --> 02:25:28.180
So a smoothie is a successful combination

02:25:28.380 --> 02:25:30.420
of those fields, and a fruit salad is not.

02:25:30.420 --> 02:25:32.460
I wouldn't say it's success unnecessarily.

02:25:32.460 --> 02:25:35.940
It's some, if you put the wrong ingredient

02:25:35.940 --> 02:25:38.780
and you press the blender, and you've made it a smoothie,

02:25:38.780 --> 02:25:41.580
you mean, it can ruin the entire mix.

02:25:41.580 --> 02:25:43.460
Can it though, because I feel like every-

02:25:43.460 --> 02:25:45.660
Yes, I can definitely assess that for ginger first.

02:25:45.660 --> 02:25:47.100
It ruins every smoothie.

02:25:47.100 --> 02:25:47.980
I don't like it. Ginger?

02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:50.060
I think so, but it's just a personal thing.

02:25:50.060 --> 02:25:52.020
And also, I don't like cinnamon.

02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:54.700
Oh, ginger has a cinnamon-y taste?

02:25:54.700 --> 02:25:55.540
Because I thought ginger was-

02:25:55.540 --> 02:25:57.500
No, I don't think they do, but I also don't like-

02:25:57.500 --> 02:25:59.860
Wasn't that a thing they add in a lot of smoothies?

02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:01.620
I was forced a smoothie.

02:26:01.620 --> 02:26:04.460
I went to Malibu with a good friend of mine, Dan Reynolds,

02:26:04.460 --> 02:26:06.980
and he forced me to consume a smoothie.

02:26:06.980 --> 02:26:10.420
And it's probably the first smoothie I've ever had,

02:26:10.420 --> 02:26:12.140
because I always was very judgmental

02:26:12.140 --> 02:26:14.540
of the kind of places and people that drink smoothies,

02:26:14.540 --> 02:26:16.060
but it was good, it was good.

02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:17.980
Well, smoothie is very American, so I-

02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:19.100
Yeah, it is an American thing.

02:26:19.100 --> 02:26:20.660
I wouldn't say success per se,

02:26:20.660 --> 02:26:23.460
but it is true that when you dance

02:26:23.460 --> 02:26:25.300
at the edge of different disciplines,

02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:29.260
that's when the, inevitably, the innovation will rise,

02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:33.460
because you will see things maybe a little differently

02:26:33.460 --> 02:26:34.860
when you're on the edge, right?

02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:38.820
But it will probably take longer,

02:26:38.820 --> 02:26:41.500
and it may not be understood right away.

02:26:41.500 --> 02:26:45.380
It may not come into final form quickly,

02:26:45.460 --> 02:26:48.460
given that it is a new concept rising.

02:26:51.940 --> 02:26:55.340
So therefore, the patience will make more sense.

02:26:55.340 --> 02:26:57.340
I'm sorry, patience will be even more important.

02:26:57.340 --> 02:26:59.940
So if you are, in other words,

02:26:59.940 --> 02:27:04.420
if you are into immediate appreciation,

02:27:05.580 --> 02:27:07.340
that's probably not the way to go.

02:27:09.380 --> 02:27:11.260
You're one chemical organism,

02:27:12.300 --> 02:27:14.820
so let me ask maybe a little bit more of a personal thing.

02:27:14.980 --> 02:27:18.060
Where did your life form originate,

02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:21.140
and what fond memory do you have

02:27:21.140 --> 02:27:23.060
from the early days of childhood

02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:28.340
that are representative of your bacteria culture?

02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:34.700
I was born in Istanbul, so I grew up in Turkey.

02:27:36.700 --> 02:27:39.260
It's a city that has two continents,

02:27:39.260 --> 02:27:41.300
which is quite interesting.

02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:45.180
You see a welcome to Europe sign,

02:27:45.180 --> 02:27:48.540
and then welcome to Asia sign the same day,

02:27:48.540 --> 02:27:50.780
depending on which part of the bridge you are.

02:27:52.060 --> 02:27:53.780
So that's where I was born,

02:27:53.780 --> 02:27:57.340
and I spent roughly 20 years of my life,

02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:00.420
and then I immigrated to the United States.

02:28:00.420 --> 02:28:01.820
And it's a very proud culture.

02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:03.300
It's a beautiful culture.

02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:05.020
It's a very flavorful culture.

02:28:05.980 --> 02:28:09.940
What aspects of it is part of who you are?

02:28:09.940 --> 02:28:11.620
What are the beautiful aspects

02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:13.580
that you carry with you in your heart?

02:28:15.540 --> 02:28:20.540
I think we are very sincerely human as a culture.

02:28:21.460 --> 02:28:26.140
I think we have the saying that don't go to bed full

02:28:26.140 --> 02:28:29.860
if your neighbor is hungry.

02:28:29.860 --> 02:28:34.700
So you wouldn't eat any food in front of someone

02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:38.580
where I come from without offering to share the bite.

02:28:38.620 --> 02:28:41.340
So I think those things, however small they may sound,

02:28:42.540 --> 02:28:47.500
a really big deal, especially when you are put in a,

02:28:47.500 --> 02:28:51.060
or move to a place that may not have those attributes.

02:28:51.060 --> 02:28:55.900
So I think that culturally, there be a lot of conscious,

02:28:58.420 --> 02:29:00.420
just raw, deep human.

02:29:01.420 --> 02:29:02.260
The connection.

02:29:02.260 --> 02:29:04.140
The value of the connection between human beings.

02:29:04.140 --> 02:29:05.100
I think so, yeah.

02:29:05.100 --> 02:29:07.060
I think I definitely carried that with me.

02:29:07.060 --> 02:29:08.900
We talk a lot about biology.

02:29:08.900 --> 02:29:11.220
Let me ask you about the romantic question.

02:29:11.220 --> 02:29:15.020
What role does love play in the human condition

02:29:15.020 --> 02:29:18.780
or in the entirety of life on Earth?

02:29:20.380 --> 02:29:25.380
It's not easy to learn how to love if you're not loved.

02:29:30.340 --> 02:29:32.460
But the good news is that it is something

02:29:32.460 --> 02:29:36.020
that you can learn, I think.

02:29:36.020 --> 02:29:40.500
You can practice and teach yourself

02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:42.780
how to maybe give yourself the thing

02:29:42.780 --> 02:29:43.940
that wasn't given to you

02:29:43.940 --> 02:29:46.380
and then ultimately give it to others.

02:29:46.380 --> 02:29:49.700
I think it would be quite arrogant to think

02:29:49.700 --> 02:29:52.860
that we will be capable of loving.

02:29:52.860 --> 02:29:54.660
It could be anything really.

02:29:55.580 --> 02:29:56.780
So just like translation,

02:29:56.780 --> 02:29:59.540
it's a repeating and a dynamical process.

02:29:59.540 --> 02:30:00.540
That you can learn.

02:30:00.540 --> 02:30:01.620
Yeah, that you can learn.

02:30:01.620 --> 02:30:03.340
Yes, and you should learn.

02:30:03.340 --> 02:30:06.980
We should even, there's no excuse to not learning.

02:30:06.980 --> 02:30:07.940
To love. Yeah.

02:30:07.940 --> 02:30:09.380
Because that's a deeply human thing.

02:30:09.380 --> 02:30:10.420
It is a deeply human thing.

02:30:10.420 --> 02:30:15.220
It is a very sad thing if any one of us passes this planet

02:30:15.220 --> 02:30:18.300
without knowing what love is.

02:30:18.300 --> 02:30:21.780
And that could be a love to a pet, a love to a plant.

02:30:21.780 --> 02:30:22.620
To a robot.

02:30:23.780 --> 02:30:24.620
Just kidding.

02:30:26.500 --> 02:30:27.580
Or a fake plant.

02:30:29.260 --> 02:30:30.940
We can't help who we love.

02:30:31.220 --> 02:30:33.860
What advice would you give to a young person today?

02:30:33.860 --> 02:30:35.340
High school, college?

02:30:38.500 --> 02:30:42.060
How to have a career they can be proud of

02:30:42.060 --> 02:30:44.460
or how to have a life they can be proud of?

02:30:44.460 --> 02:30:46.580
You said an interesting thing about brains

02:30:46.580 --> 02:30:49.900
being distributed evenly but opportunities not.

02:30:49.900 --> 02:30:52.620
It's really interesting to think about.

02:30:52.620 --> 02:30:55.020
I've talked to folks from Africa.

02:30:55.020 --> 02:30:58.420
You realize that there's whole areas of this earth

02:30:58.420 --> 02:31:00.900
that have so much brilliance.

02:31:01.860 --> 02:31:03.980
But unfortunately so little opportunity.

02:31:03.980 --> 02:31:06.820
And one of the exciting things about the 21st century

02:31:06.820 --> 02:31:09.140
is more and more opportunities are created.

02:31:09.140 --> 02:31:10.580
And so the brilliance is unlocked

02:31:10.580 --> 02:31:12.020
in all those different places.

02:31:13.020 --> 02:31:15.940
And so all these young people now have the opportunity

02:31:15.940 --> 02:31:19.620
to like do something to change the world.

02:31:19.620 --> 02:31:24.620
I had a chance to visit Bosnia.

02:31:24.820 --> 02:31:28.940
So I was invited to give a talk

02:31:28.940 --> 02:31:33.940
in a very northern most part of the country

02:31:35.060 --> 02:31:38.540
that was impacted by the war tremendously.

02:31:38.540 --> 02:31:42.660
And it was a public talk.

02:31:42.660 --> 02:31:45.220
It was open to everybody in the village.

02:31:45.220 --> 02:31:48.820
And I was told even people drew from Sarajevo to attend.

02:31:49.860 --> 02:31:52.860
Whenever I think about our role as a scientist

02:31:53.860 --> 02:31:58.380
or the beneficiaries of the knowledge that we create,

02:31:58.380 --> 02:32:00.460
I always think about that night.

02:32:00.460 --> 02:32:03.140
That's how many people were in that room.

02:32:03.140 --> 02:32:06.500
It was incredibly crowded.

02:32:06.500 --> 02:32:11.500
And lots of young people who were trying

02:32:11.780 --> 02:32:16.780
to start everything new and not do or not carry

02:32:16.980 --> 02:32:21.980
and replace whatever maybe the feeling

02:32:26.060 --> 02:32:30.220
that was taken from them with hope and love starts

02:32:30.220 --> 02:32:33.740
a new beginning, be the seed for the next generation.

02:32:33.740 --> 02:32:36.540
And it moved me so much that they all came

02:32:36.540 --> 02:32:40.260
to hear about early life space,

02:32:40.260 --> 02:32:41.820
something maybe different for them

02:32:41.820 --> 02:32:43.660
that maybe they were always interested in

02:32:43.660 --> 02:32:44.820
and never thought about.

02:32:45.820 --> 02:32:50.020
But what stayed with me was just the look and the feeling,

02:32:50.020 --> 02:32:52.660
the look on their faces and the feeling in the room,

02:32:52.660 --> 02:32:55.180
the energy just was really moving to me.

02:32:55.180 --> 02:32:57.980
Their willingness to be the seed,

02:32:57.980 --> 02:33:01.020
the first of their family and generation

02:33:01.020 --> 02:33:02.340
to do that big new thing.

02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:07.340
Yes, and that's exactly why I'm telling this whole story

02:33:08.140 --> 02:33:13.140
because for most of us, we may have to be that seed

02:33:13.420 --> 02:33:16.660
in our families, that the first one to do something new,

02:33:18.300 --> 02:33:21.420
to break that cycle, whatever it is that you want

02:33:21.420 --> 02:33:25.460
to break free from, I would want the young people

02:33:25.460 --> 02:33:27.460
to know that you can be that,

02:33:27.460 --> 02:33:32.460
that there are just wonderful things to learn

02:33:34.940 --> 02:33:39.020
from this life and it's just incredible to be living.

02:33:39.020 --> 02:33:42.260
And I would want them to know that their voice matters

02:33:42.260 --> 02:33:47.260
and they need to use it, especially those who think

02:33:47.860 --> 02:33:49.460
that their voice doesn't matter.

02:33:51.300 --> 02:33:54.100
And ultimately, I think what it comes down to

02:33:54.100 --> 02:33:59.100
is to trusting yourself, trusting and respecting your voice.

02:33:59.100 --> 02:34:01.580
If you're not loved, learn how to love.

02:34:01.580 --> 02:34:04.540
If you were not respected, start by respecting yourself.

02:34:04.540 --> 02:34:05.780
Learn how to respect yourself.

02:34:05.780 --> 02:34:08.140
You can teach yourself things.

02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:11.300
Yeah, it's really difficult when you're surrounded

02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:14.180
by people that don't believe in you.

02:34:14.180 --> 02:34:17.900
Yes, I definitely know the feeling

02:34:17.900 --> 02:34:20.500
and I would just want them to know

02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:23.500
that they don't need to be defined

02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:29.060
or reduced down to what others see in them.

02:34:30.540 --> 02:34:32.340
Believe in yourself, have the respect,

02:34:32.340 --> 02:34:35.740
try to develop the respect and the love for yourself.

02:34:35.780 --> 02:34:38.340
And then from that, it flourishes.

02:34:38.340 --> 02:34:40.100
You'll find others that'll give you love.

02:34:40.100 --> 02:34:41.380
It may not.

02:34:41.380 --> 02:34:42.860
I mean, life is not fair.

02:34:42.860 --> 02:34:43.700
It's true.

02:34:43.700 --> 02:34:44.540
Yeah.

02:34:44.540 --> 02:34:49.540
Be prepared that it's not very fair, unfortunately.

02:34:49.940 --> 02:34:53.340
And so I don't wanna depict this Disney story that,

02:34:53.340 --> 02:34:56.300
and then yes, and everything will be just fine.

02:34:56.300 --> 02:34:58.500
It's mostly isn't, but you learn a way.

02:34:58.500 --> 02:35:00.860
Learn, you know, life does it all the time.

02:35:01.140 --> 02:35:02.180
Speaking of which,

02:35:02.180 --> 02:35:04.940
what do you think is the meaning of all this?

02:35:04.940 --> 02:35:06.460
What's the meaning of life?

02:35:07.940 --> 02:35:09.060
Why are we here?

02:35:09.060 --> 02:35:10.900
Why we are here.

02:35:10.900 --> 02:35:12.900
All the beauty you've discussed.

02:35:13.740 --> 02:35:18.740
Why is the translational mechanism machinery here?

02:35:20.380 --> 02:35:21.220
Why?

02:35:21.220 --> 02:35:22.060
I don't think there is.

02:35:22.060 --> 02:35:23.380
Why so much beauty?

02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:24.700
Why so much beauty?

02:35:25.900 --> 02:35:28.060
It is because we choose to see it that way.

02:35:28.060 --> 02:35:29.380
That's why we're here.

02:35:29.380 --> 02:35:30.940
Because we choose to see it that way.

02:35:30.940 --> 02:35:32.460
It's beautiful.

02:35:32.460 --> 02:35:34.460
But there is no meaning.

02:35:34.460 --> 02:35:35.300
I don't think no.

02:35:35.300 --> 02:35:36.580
Yeah.

02:35:36.580 --> 02:35:38.180
But why is it so beautiful?

02:35:38.180 --> 02:35:39.700
Why did we choose?

02:35:39.700 --> 02:35:40.540
Why?

02:35:40.540 --> 02:35:44.100
From where is the imperative to see it,

02:35:45.420 --> 02:35:48.980
to see so much beauty in a thing that,

02:35:48.980 --> 02:35:51.100
scientifically speaking,

02:35:51.100 --> 02:35:53.660
or from a rational perspective,

02:35:53.660 --> 02:35:55.820
is void of beauty.

02:35:55.820 --> 02:35:57.540
It's just, it just is.

02:35:58.540 --> 02:36:01.500
Not everybody chooses to see the beauty.

02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:04.900
Hate is gonna hate.

02:36:07.020 --> 02:36:09.020
I mean, we have the capacity to see the beauty.

02:36:09.020 --> 02:36:10.100
We have the capacity,

02:36:10.100 --> 02:36:12.500
so why not use it to the fullest, right?

02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:14.060
We have the capacity.

02:36:14.060 --> 02:36:16.660
But that capacity, isn't that fascinating?

02:36:16.660 --> 02:36:17.980
That we developed that?

02:36:17.980 --> 02:36:20.780
It feels like that was always laid in there,

02:36:20.780 --> 02:36:23.340
in the whole process of life.

02:36:23.420 --> 02:36:27.060
This ability to find,

02:36:27.060 --> 02:36:29.380
to introspect ourselves.

02:36:29.380 --> 02:36:31.980
I mean, it's definitely soothing to think like that.

02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:35.980
But I don't think there is a meaning like that way.

02:36:35.980 --> 02:36:38.540
It's fascinating that we can understand it.

02:36:40.140 --> 02:36:41.460
But why is it soothing?

02:36:43.300 --> 02:36:44.940
There's a desire, there's a longing for it.

02:36:44.940 --> 02:36:48.940
But soothing doesn't mean that there's a meaning.

02:36:48.940 --> 02:36:51.420
Why is soothing a meaning?

02:36:51.420 --> 02:36:52.780
Let me just put it this way.

02:36:52.820 --> 02:36:54.460
Because there is just, I think,

02:36:54.460 --> 02:36:56.340
so much unfairness going on,

02:36:57.700 --> 02:36:59.140
I wouldn't even dare myself

02:36:59.140 --> 02:37:00.780
to think that there's a meaning

02:37:00.780 --> 02:37:03.540
out of respect to the ones that are suffering.

02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:05.900
I see.

02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:07.860
I think,

02:37:09.140 --> 02:37:12.540
I think out of suffering emerges flourishing in beauty.

02:37:12.540 --> 02:37:13.980
I mean, that's what I see.

02:37:13.980 --> 02:37:15.100
I agree with you.

02:37:15.100 --> 02:37:17.020
When I went to Ukraine,

02:37:17.020 --> 02:37:20.620
it's all the people suffering in their eyes

02:37:20.620 --> 02:37:23.980
and in their stories is a hope for the future,

02:37:23.980 --> 02:37:28.380
is a love for the people who are still living,

02:37:28.380 --> 02:37:29.540
is a love for life.

02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:32.100
So it's there and that's the dark thing,

02:37:32.100 --> 02:37:34.300
is the suffering and the loss

02:37:34.300 --> 02:37:37.380
somehow intensifies your appreciation

02:37:37.380 --> 02:37:39.460
of the life that is still left.

02:37:39.460 --> 02:37:40.300
That's a weird thing too.

02:37:40.300 --> 02:37:44.380
I think that there is something about

02:37:46.020 --> 02:37:48.860
still doing your best and believing

02:37:48.860 --> 02:37:53.860
that there's whatever the goodness

02:37:53.900 --> 02:37:56.420
is worth working for

02:37:59.580 --> 02:38:03.180
is beyond and to do that without a meaning,

02:38:04.180 --> 02:38:06.380
that there's something more humbly,

02:38:06.380 --> 02:38:09.460
humbling and profound about that.

02:38:16.940 --> 02:38:18.660
This will come out very random.

02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:23.660
Okay, so just in Turkish bathrooms,

02:38:24.100 --> 02:38:27.780
there is this sign that says,

02:38:29.660 --> 02:38:32.260
leave it as you want to find it.

02:38:34.380 --> 02:38:35.220
Yeah.

02:38:35.220 --> 02:38:38.620
And I think that's a pretty good.

02:38:38.620 --> 02:38:41.260
That's your meaning of life found in Turkey.

02:38:41.260 --> 02:38:42.460
There's wisdom to that.

02:38:42.460 --> 02:38:43.300
There's wisdom to that,

02:38:43.300 --> 02:38:46.660
but it also is because the however you leave

02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:49.260
defines you, right?

02:38:49.260 --> 02:38:52.460
So I think there's some profound meaning to that too,

02:38:52.460 --> 02:38:57.180
that just leave it as you would want to find it.

02:38:58.660 --> 02:39:03.620
So that your little scribble in the long story

02:39:03.620 --> 02:39:06.740
of life on earth is one that ultimately

02:39:06.740 --> 02:39:08.140
did a pretty good job.

02:39:09.060 --> 02:39:11.620
It at least kept it the same as you found it.

02:39:12.580 --> 02:39:15.820
Or at least I left it in the way that I wish I found it.

02:39:15.820 --> 02:39:17.020
Yeah, yeah, right.

02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:20.420
Oh man.

02:39:20.420 --> 02:39:22.620
Yes, that's the wisdom from Turkish bathroom.

02:39:22.620 --> 02:39:25.260
That's where I search for wisdom as well.

02:39:25.260 --> 02:39:29.860
And as we started with the origin of life

02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:33.180
and ended with the wisdom in a Turkish bathroom,

02:39:33.180 --> 02:39:34.740
I think that's a perfect conversation.

02:39:34.740 --> 02:39:36.180
You're an incredible person.

02:39:37.220 --> 02:39:38.780
The humor, the humanity,

02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:40.740
but also the brilliance of your work.

02:39:41.700 --> 02:39:43.340
I really appreciate that you would talk with me today.

02:39:43.340 --> 02:39:44.820
This was really fun.

02:39:44.820 --> 02:39:46.820
Thanks for having me.

02:39:46.820 --> 02:39:48.420
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:39:48.420 --> 02:39:49.940

And now let me leave you with one of my favorite quotes

02:39:56.860 --> 02:39:58.060
from Robert Frost.

02:39:59.140 --> 02:39:59.980
In three words,

02:39:59.980 --> 02:40:03.020
I can sum up everything I've ever learned about life.

02:40:03.020 --> 02:40:05.020
It goes on.

02:40:05.940 --> 02:40:07.300
Thank you for listening.

02:40:07.300 --> 02:40:09.100
I hope to see you next time.

Thank you.
