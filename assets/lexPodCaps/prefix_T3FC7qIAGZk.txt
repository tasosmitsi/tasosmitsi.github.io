00:00.000 --> 00:01.600
Mossad will do anything.

00:01.600 --> 00:05.440
Mossad has no qualms doing what it takes

00:05.440 --> 00:08.720
to ensure the survival of every Israeli citizen

00:08.720 --> 00:09.760
around the world.

00:09.760 --> 00:12.940
Most other countries will stop at some point,

00:12.940 --> 00:14.240
but Mossad doesn't do that.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.960
The following is a conversation with Andrew Bustamante,

00:19.960 --> 00:22.520
former CIA covert intelligence officer

00:22.520 --> 00:24.800
and US Air Force combat veteran,

00:24.800 --> 00:27.760
including the job of operational targeting

00:27.760 --> 00:31.240
in cryptic communications and launch operations

00:31.240 --> 00:36.240
for 200 nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles.

00:36.280 --> 00:39.920
Andrew's over seven years as a CIA spy

00:39.920 --> 00:43.760
have given him a skillset and a perspective on the world

00:43.760 --> 00:45.660
that is fascinating to explore.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.640
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:50.840 --> 00:52.120
in the description.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.740
And now, dear friends, here's Andrew Bustamante.

00:56.740 --> 00:58.740
The Central Intelligence Agency

00:58.740 --> 01:01.540
was formed almost 75 years ago.

01:01.540 --> 01:03.020
What is the mission of the CIA?

01:03.020 --> 01:04.140
How does it work?

01:04.140 --> 01:07.400
The mission of the CIA is to collect intelligence

01:07.400 --> 01:08.240
from around the world

01:08.240 --> 01:10.500
that supports a national security mission

01:10.500 --> 01:12.420
and be the central repository

01:12.420 --> 01:14.620
for all other intelligence agencies

01:14.620 --> 01:17.360
so that it's one collective source

01:17.360 --> 01:20.220
where all intelligence can be synthesized

01:20.220 --> 01:23.060
and then passed forward to the decision makers.

01:23.060 --> 01:26.140
That doesn't include domestic intelligence.

01:26.140 --> 01:29.440
It's primarily looking outward outside the United States.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.280
Correct.

01:30.280 --> 01:34.340
CIA is the foreign intelligence collection

01:35.660 --> 01:37.380
kingspoke, if you will.

01:37.380 --> 01:38.940
FBI does domestic

01:38.940 --> 01:41.620
and then Department of Homeland Security does domestic.

01:41.620 --> 01:45.300
Law enforcement essentially handles all things domestic.

01:45.300 --> 01:46.740
Intelligence is not law enforcement.

01:46.740 --> 01:50.000
So we technically cannot work inside the United States.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.460
Is there clear lines to be drawn between,

01:52.500 --> 01:56.020
like you just said, the FBI, CIA, FBI,

01:56.020 --> 01:58.300
and the other US intelligence agencies

01:58.300 --> 02:01.900
like the DIA, Defense Intelligence Agency,

02:01.900 --> 02:05.300
Department of Homeland Security, NSA,

02:05.300 --> 02:08.140
National Security Agency, and there's a list.

02:08.140 --> 02:09.780
There's a list of about 33

02:09.780 --> 02:11.140
different intelligence organizations.

02:11.140 --> 02:13.060
Yeah, you're right. So like the Army, the Navy has,

02:13.060 --> 02:14.820
all the different organizations

02:14.820 --> 02:16.780
have their own intelligence groups.

02:16.780 --> 02:19.780
So is there clear lines here to be drawn?

02:19.780 --> 02:23.220
Or is the CIA the giant integrator of all of these?

02:23.220 --> 02:24.580
It's a little bit of both, to be honest.

02:24.580 --> 02:26.300
So yes, there are absolutely lines

02:26.300 --> 02:28.380
and more so than the lines.

02:28.380 --> 02:30.980
There are lines that divide what our primary mission is.

02:30.980 --> 02:32.780
Everything's got to be prioritized.

02:32.780 --> 02:34.100
That's one of the benefits

02:34.100 --> 02:36.140
and the superpowers of the United States

02:36.140 --> 02:38.660
is we prioritize everything.

02:38.660 --> 02:41.100
So different intelligence organizations are prioritized

02:41.100 --> 02:43.580
to collect certain types of intelligence.

02:43.580 --> 02:47.140
And then within the confines of how they collect,

02:47.140 --> 02:49.380
they're also given unique authorities,

02:49.900 --> 02:53.500
or a term that's directed by the executive branch.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.540
Different agencies have different authorities

02:55.540 --> 02:58.660
to execute missions in different ways.

02:58.660 --> 03:01.260
FBI can't execute the same way CIA executes,

03:01.260 --> 03:05.500
and CIA can't execute the same way NGA executes.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.940
But then at the end, excuse me, when it's all collected,

03:08.940 --> 03:11.780
then yes, CIA still acts

03:11.780 --> 03:15.100
as a final synthesizing repository

03:15.100 --> 03:17.740
to create what's known as the President's Daily Brief,

03:17.740 --> 03:18.580
the PDB.

03:18.580 --> 03:20.820
The only way CIA can create the PDB

03:20.820 --> 03:24.900
is by being the single source of all source intelligence

03:24.900 --> 03:28.420
from around the IC, the intelligence community,

03:28.420 --> 03:33.420
which are those 30 some odd and always changing organizations

03:33.540 --> 03:36.020
that are sponsored for intelligence operations.

03:36.020 --> 03:38.940
What is the PDB, the President's Daily Brief look like?

03:38.940 --> 03:39.780
How long is it?

03:39.780 --> 03:41.620
What does it contain?

03:41.620 --> 03:44.460
So first of all, it looks like the most expensive book report

03:44.460 --> 03:45.340
you can ever imagine.

03:45.340 --> 03:46.860
It's got its own binder.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.020
It's all very high end.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.140
It feels important, it looks important.

03:51.140 --> 03:53.260
It's not like a cheap trapper keeper.

03:54.260 --> 03:56.060
It's somewhere between,

03:56.060 --> 03:59.380
I would give it probably between 50 and 125 pages a day.

03:59.380 --> 04:02.540
It's produced every day around two o'clock in the morning

04:02.540 --> 04:04.540
by a dedicated group of analysts.

04:04.540 --> 04:09.540
And each page is essentially a short paragraph

04:09.920 --> 04:13.460
to a few paragraphs about a priority happening

04:13.460 --> 04:16.540
that affects national security from around the world.

04:16.540 --> 04:19.700
The President rarely gets to the entire briefing in a day.

04:19.700 --> 04:22.820
He relies on a briefer instead to prioritize

04:22.820 --> 04:25.100
what inside the briefing needs to be shared

04:25.100 --> 04:25.940
with the President.

04:25.940 --> 04:28.620
Because some days the PDB will get briefed in 10 minutes

04:28.620 --> 04:30.620
and some days it'll be briefed over the course of two hours.

04:30.620 --> 04:32.860
It depends on the President's schedule.

04:32.860 --> 04:36.260
How much competition is there for the first page?

04:36.260 --> 04:39.700
And so how much jockeying there is for attention?

04:41.100 --> 04:44.540
I imagine for all the different intelligence agencies

04:44.580 --> 04:45.820
and within the CIA,

04:45.820 --> 04:47.740
there's probably different groups that are modular

04:47.740 --> 04:50.740
and they're all care about different nations

04:50.740 --> 04:53.420
or different cases.

04:53.420 --> 04:58.420
And do you understand how much competition there is

04:58.740 --> 05:00.660
for the attention, for the limited attention

05:00.660 --> 05:01.540
of the President?

05:01.540 --> 05:05.340
You're 100% correct in how the agency

05:05.340 --> 05:09.700
and how officers and managers at the agency handle the PDB.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.020
There's a ton of competition.

05:11.020 --> 05:12.700
Everybody wants to be the first on the radar.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.420
Everybody wants to be on the first page.

05:15.260 --> 05:17.260
The thing that we're not baking into the equation

05:17.260 --> 05:19.140
is the President's interests.

05:19.140 --> 05:21.460
The President dictates what's on the first page of his PDB

05:21.460 --> 05:23.780
and he will tell them usually the day before,

05:23.780 --> 05:25.420
I want to see this on the first page tomorrow.

05:25.420 --> 05:26.580
Bring this to me in the beginning.

05:26.580 --> 05:28.700
I don't want to hear about what's happening in Mozambique.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.860
I don't really care about what's happening in Saudi Arabia.

05:30.860 --> 05:32.820
I want to see one, two, three.

05:32.820 --> 05:34.220
And regardless of whether or not

05:34.220 --> 05:37.020
those are the three biggest things in the world,

05:37.020 --> 05:39.300
the President's the executive, he's the one.

05:39.300 --> 05:40.660
He's the ultimate customer.

05:40.660 --> 05:42.580
So we do what the customer says.

05:42.580 --> 05:44.620
That has backfired in the past.

05:44.620 --> 05:46.500
If you haven't already started seeing

05:46.500 --> 05:49.260
how that could go wrong, that has backfired in the past,

05:49.260 --> 05:51.220
but that is essentially what happens

05:51.220 --> 05:53.340
when you serve in the executive branch.

05:53.340 --> 05:55.100
You serve the executive.

05:55.100 --> 05:58.060
So what's the role of the director of the CIA

05:58.060 --> 05:59.820
versus the President?

05:59.820 --> 06:01.300
What's that dance like?

06:01.300 --> 06:06.060
So the President really leads the focus of the CIA?

06:06.060 --> 06:09.300
The President is the commander in chief for the military,

06:09.300 --> 06:12.660
but the President is also the executive

06:12.660 --> 06:16.220
for the entirety of the intelligence community.

06:16.220 --> 06:19.540
So he's the ultimate customer.

06:19.540 --> 06:22.820
If you look at it like a business, the customer,

06:22.820 --> 06:25.580
the person spending the money is the President

06:25.580 --> 06:27.500
and the director is the CEO.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.580
So if the director doesn't create what the President wants,

06:30.580 --> 06:31.620
there's going to be a new director.

06:31.620 --> 06:32.900
That's why the director of CIA

06:32.900 --> 06:34.540
is a presidential appointed position.

06:34.540 --> 06:36.220
Sometimes they're extremely qualified

06:36.220 --> 06:37.620
intelligence professionals.

06:37.620 --> 06:39.580
Sometimes they're just professional politicians

06:39.580 --> 06:41.500
or soldiers that could put into that seat

06:41.500 --> 06:44.460
because the President trusts them to do

06:44.460 --> 06:46.740
what he wants them to do.

06:46.740 --> 06:51.740
Another gaping area that causes problems,

06:52.380 --> 06:54.220
but that's still the way it is.

06:54.220 --> 06:57.260
So you think this is a problematic configuration

06:57.260 --> 06:58.100
of the whole system?

06:58.100 --> 06:59.460
Massive flaw in the system.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.860
It is a massive flaw in the system

07:00.860 --> 07:03.860
because if you're essentially appointing a director

07:03.860 --> 07:05.500
to do what you want them to do,

07:05.500 --> 07:08.620
then you're assigning a crony.

07:08.620 --> 07:10.860
And that's what we define corruption as

07:10.860 --> 07:11.700
within the United States.

07:11.700 --> 07:13.300
And inside the United States, we say,

07:13.300 --> 07:15.060
if you pick somebody outside of merits

07:15.060 --> 07:16.700
for any other reason other than merit,

07:16.700 --> 07:19.540
then it's cronyism or it's nepotism.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.740
Here, that's exactly what our structure is built on.

07:21.740 --> 07:23.980
All presidential appointees are appointed

07:23.980 --> 07:25.100
on something other than merit.

07:25.100 --> 07:27.500
So for an intelligence agency to be effective,

07:27.500 --> 07:31.780
it has to discover the truth and communicate that truth.

07:31.780 --> 07:34.740
And maybe if you're appointing the director of that agency,

07:35.700 --> 07:38.340
they're less likely to communicate the truth to you

07:38.340 --> 07:39.980
unless the truth aligns perfectly

07:39.980 --> 07:41.740
with your desired worldview.

07:41.740 --> 07:43.060
Well, not necessarily perfectly

07:43.060 --> 07:44.820
because there are other steps, right?

07:44.820 --> 07:46.900
They have to go in front of Congress

07:46.900 --> 07:48.420
and they have to have the support

07:48.420 --> 07:51.940
of multiple legislatures or legislators.

07:51.940 --> 07:55.820
But the challenge is that the short list of people

07:55.820 --> 07:59.260
who even get the opportunity aren't a meritorious list.

07:59.260 --> 08:01.540
It's a short list based off of who the president is picking

08:01.540 --> 08:03.340
or who the would be president is picking.

08:03.340 --> 08:05.100
Now, I think we've proven

08:05.100 --> 08:10.100
that an intelligence organization can be extremely effective

08:10.580 --> 08:13.300
even within the flawed system.

08:13.300 --> 08:16.300
The challenge is how much more effective could we be

08:16.300 --> 08:17.740
if we improved?

08:17.740 --> 08:20.180
And I think that's the challenge

08:20.180 --> 08:21.940
that faces a lot of the US government.

08:21.940 --> 08:24.860
I think that's a challenge that has resulted

08:24.860 --> 08:28.540
in what we see today when it comes to the decline

08:28.540 --> 08:31.140
of American power and American influence,

08:31.140 --> 08:35.420
the rise of foreign influence, authoritarian powers,

08:35.420 --> 08:39.460
and a shrinking US economy, a growing Chinese economy.

08:39.460 --> 08:42.420
And it's just, we have questions, hard questions

08:42.420 --> 08:43.340
we need to ask ourselves

08:43.340 --> 08:45.220
about how we're gonna handle the future.

08:45.220 --> 08:46.980
What aspect of that communication

08:46.980 --> 08:49.540
between the president and the CIA could be fixed

08:50.540 --> 08:54.540
to help fix the problems that you're referring to

08:54.540 --> 08:57.580
in terms of the decline of American power?

08:57.580 --> 09:02.580
So when you talk about the president wanting to prioritize

09:02.620 --> 09:04.620
what the president cares about,

09:04.620 --> 09:07.580
that immediately shows a break

09:07.580 --> 09:09.740
between what actually matters

09:09.740 --> 09:12.340
to the long-term success of the United States

09:12.340 --> 09:15.580
versus what benefits the short-term success

09:15.580 --> 09:16.540
of the current president.

09:16.540 --> 09:20.180
Because any president is just a human being

09:20.180 --> 09:21.940
and has a very narrow focus.

09:21.940 --> 09:24.740
And narrow focus is not a long-term calculation.

09:24.740 --> 09:26.700
Exactly, what's the maximum amount of years

09:26.700 --> 09:28.260
a president can be president?

09:28.260 --> 09:29.220
Eight.

09:29.220 --> 09:30.580
He has to be, he or she.

09:30.580 --> 09:31.580
In the United States.

09:31.580 --> 09:32.660
In the United States,

09:32.660 --> 09:34.220
according to our current constitution.

09:34.220 --> 09:35.060
Yeah.

09:35.060 --> 09:39.340
But they're very limited

09:39.340 --> 09:41.580
in terms of what they have to prioritize.

09:41.580 --> 09:44.020
And then if you look at a four-year cycle,

09:44.020 --> 09:45.700
two years of that is essentially preparing

09:45.700 --> 09:47.100
for the next election cycle.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.140
So that's only two years of really quality attention

09:49.140 --> 09:49.980
you get from the president,

09:49.980 --> 09:53.060
who is the chief executive of all the intelligence community.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.220
So the most important thing to them

09:55.220 --> 09:57.020
is not always the most important thing

09:57.020 --> 09:59.660
to the long-term survival of the United States.

09:59.660 --> 10:02.020
What do you make of the hostile relationship

10:02.020 --> 10:04.660
that to me at least stands out of the presidents

10:04.660 --> 10:07.340
between Donald Trump and the CIA?

10:07.340 --> 10:11.460
Was that a very kind of personal bickering?

10:11.460 --> 10:13.260
I mean, is there something interesting to you

10:13.260 --> 10:16.300
about the dynamics between that particular president

10:16.300 --> 10:17.980
and that particular instantiation

10:17.980 --> 10:19.380
of the intelligence agency?

10:19.380 --> 10:21.700
Man, there were lots of things fascinating to me

10:21.700 --> 10:23.700
about that relationship.

10:24.380 --> 10:26.100
What's the good and the bad, Sergeant Trump?

10:26.100 --> 10:27.980
So let me start with the good first,

10:27.980 --> 10:28.820
because there's a lot of people

10:28.820 --> 10:30.900
who don't think there was any good.

10:30.900 --> 10:35.700
So the good thing is we saw that the president,

10:35.700 --> 10:40.340
who's the chief customer, the executive to the CIA,

10:40.340 --> 10:43.940
when the president doesn't want to hear what CIA has to say,

10:43.940 --> 10:45.500
he's not gonna listen.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.540
I think that's an important lesson

10:46.540 --> 10:49.100
for everyone to take home.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.580
If the president doesn't care what you have to say,

10:51.580 --> 10:54.620
he's gonna take funding away or she will take funding away.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.220
They're gonna take attention away.

10:56.220 --> 11:01.220
They're going to shut down your operations, your missions.

11:02.580 --> 11:04.740
They're gonna kill the careers of the people working there.

11:04.740 --> 11:05.580
Think about that.

11:05.580 --> 11:08.460
For the four years that President Trump was the president,

11:08.460 --> 11:11.940
basically everybody at CIA, their career was put on pause.

11:11.940 --> 11:13.620
Some people's careers were ended.

11:13.620 --> 11:16.260
Some people voluntarily left their career there

11:16.260 --> 11:20.340
because they found themselves working for a single customer

11:20.340 --> 11:21.900
that didn't want what they had to produce.

11:21.900 --> 11:24.460
So for people who don't know,

11:24.460 --> 11:26.940
Donald Trump did not display significant,

11:26.940 --> 11:28.820
deep interest in the output.

11:29.780 --> 11:30.860
He did not trust it, yeah.

11:30.860 --> 11:32.420
He was a disinterested customer.

11:32.420 --> 11:33.260
Exactly right.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.380
Of the information.

11:34.380 --> 11:36.980
And then what do disinterested customers do?

11:36.980 --> 11:39.700
They go find someone else to create their product.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.140
And that's exactly what Donald Trump did.

11:41.140 --> 11:43.300
And he did it through the private intelligence world,

11:43.300 --> 11:45.500
funding private intelligence companies

11:45.500 --> 11:46.940
to run their own operations

11:46.940 --> 11:49.580
that brought him the information he cared about

11:49.580 --> 11:50.900
when CIA wouldn't.

11:50.900 --> 11:53.540
It also didn't help that CIA stepped outside

11:53.540 --> 11:54.540
of their confines, right?

11:54.540 --> 11:56.620
CIA is supposed to collect foreign intelligence

11:56.620 --> 11:58.700
and not comment on domestic matters.

11:58.700 --> 12:00.380
They went way outside of that

12:00.380 --> 12:02.340
when they started challenging the president,

12:02.340 --> 12:04.140
when they started questioning the results,

12:04.140 --> 12:08.300
when they started publicly claiming Russian influence.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.740
That's all something the FBI could have handled by itself.

12:10.740 --> 12:12.540
The Justice Department could have handled by itself.

12:12.540 --> 12:16.300
CIA had no place to contribute to that conversation.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.180
And when they did,

12:17.180 --> 12:19.660
all they did was undermine the relationship they had

12:19.660 --> 12:21.700
with their primary customer.

12:21.700 --> 12:26.260
Let me sort of focus in on this relationship

12:26.260 --> 12:29.140
between the president or the leader

12:29.140 --> 12:31.140
and the intelligence agency

12:31.140 --> 12:33.140
and look outside the United States.

12:34.140 --> 12:36.540
It seems like authoritarian regimes

12:36.540 --> 12:37.900
or regimes throughout history,

12:37.900 --> 12:39.820
if you look at Stalin and Hitler,

12:39.820 --> 12:42.740
if you look at today with Vladimir Putin,

12:42.740 --> 12:44.460
the negative effects of power

12:44.460 --> 12:48.620
corrupting the mind of a leader manifest itself

12:48.620 --> 12:51.740
is that they start to get bad information

12:51.740 --> 12:53.460
from the intelligence agencies.

12:53.460 --> 12:55.700
So this kind of thing that you're talking about,

12:55.700 --> 12:58.700
over time, they start hearing information

12:58.700 --> 13:00.780
they want to hear.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.860
The agency starts producing only

13:03.940 --> 13:05.660
the kind of information they want to hear

13:05.660 --> 13:09.940
and the leader's worldview starts becoming distorted

13:09.940 --> 13:13.900
to where the propaganda they generate

13:13.900 --> 13:17.300
is also the thing that the intelligence agencies

13:17.300 --> 13:18.620
provide to them.

13:18.620 --> 13:19.780
And so they start getting this,

13:19.780 --> 13:21.580
they start believing in their own propaganda

13:21.580 --> 13:23.780
and they start getting distorted view of the world.

13:23.780 --> 13:27.500
Sorry for the sort of walking through in a weird way,

13:27.500 --> 13:29.860
but I guess I want to ask, do you think,

13:29.860 --> 13:32.620
let's look at Vladimir Putin specifically,

13:32.620 --> 13:37.620
do you think he's getting accurate information

13:37.820 --> 13:38.660
about the world?

13:38.660 --> 13:40.860
Do you think he knows the truth of the world,

13:40.860 --> 13:42.660
whether that's the war in Ukraine,

13:42.700 --> 13:45.180
whether that's the behavior of the other nations

13:45.180 --> 13:47.500
in NATO, the United States in general?

13:47.500 --> 13:49.100
What do you think?

13:49.100 --> 13:52.620
It's rare that I'll talk about just thinking.

13:52.620 --> 13:55.460
I prefer to share my assessment,

13:55.460 --> 13:57.020
why I assess things a certain way

13:57.020 --> 13:59.620
rather than just what's my random opinion.

13:59.620 --> 14:02.980
In my assessment, Vladimir Putin is winning.

14:02.980 --> 14:04.180
Russia is winning.

14:04.180 --> 14:05.780
They're winning in Ukraine,

14:05.780 --> 14:07.980
but they're also winning the battle of influence

14:07.980 --> 14:08.860
against the West.

14:08.860 --> 14:11.180
They're winning in the face of economic sanctions.

14:11.180 --> 14:12.380
They're winning.

14:12.380 --> 14:15.500
Empirically, when you look at the math, they're winning.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.180
So when you ask me whether or not Putin

14:18.180 --> 14:20.580
is getting good information from his intelligence services,

14:20.580 --> 14:22.940
when I look at my overall assessment

14:22.940 --> 14:24.500
of multiple data points,

14:24.500 --> 14:26.980
he must be getting good information.

14:26.980 --> 14:28.580
Do I know how or why?

14:28.580 --> 14:29.740
I do not.

14:29.740 --> 14:31.260
I don't know how or why it works there.

14:31.260 --> 14:35.060
I don't know how such deep cronyism,

14:35.060 --> 14:40.060
such deep corruption can possibly yield true real results.

14:40.900 --> 14:43.700
And yet somehow there are real results happening.

14:43.700 --> 14:47.220
So it's either excessive waste and an accidental win,

14:47.220 --> 14:49.340
or there really is a system and a process there

14:49.340 --> 14:50.380
that's functioning.

14:50.380 --> 14:52.820
So this winning idea is very interesting.

14:52.820 --> 14:56.420
In what way, short term and long term, is Russia winning?

14:56.420 --> 14:58.260
Some people say there was a miscalculation

14:58.260 --> 14:59.900
of the way the invasion happened.

15:00.780 --> 15:03.540
There was an assumption that you would be able

15:03.540 --> 15:06.020
to successfully take Kiev,

15:06.020 --> 15:09.740
you'd be able to successfully capture the East, the South,

15:09.740 --> 15:11.700
and the North of Ukraine,

15:11.700 --> 15:15.060
and with what now appears to be

15:15.060 --> 15:17.340
significantly insufficient troops

15:17.340 --> 15:20.780
spread way too thin across, way too large of a front.

15:21.860 --> 15:24.700
So that seems to be like an intelligence failure.

15:26.380 --> 15:29.620
And that doesn't seem to be like winning.

15:29.620 --> 15:31.700
In another way, it doesn't seem like winning

15:31.700 --> 15:34.820
if we put aside the human cost of war.

15:34.820 --> 15:37.220
It doesn't seem like winning

15:37.260 --> 15:39.580
because the hearts and minds of the West

15:40.700 --> 15:43.220
were completely on the side of Ukraine.

15:43.220 --> 15:46.060
This particular leader in Volodymyr Zelensky

15:46.060 --> 15:48.060
captured the attention of the world

15:48.060 --> 15:52.100
and the hearts and minds of Europe, the West,

15:52.100 --> 15:54.420
and many other nations throughout the world,

15:54.420 --> 15:57.340
both financially, in terms of military equipment,

15:57.340 --> 16:01.420
and in terms of sort of social and cultural

16:01.420 --> 16:03.180
and emotional support

16:03.180 --> 16:05.860
for the independence fight of this nation.

16:05.860 --> 16:08.660
That seems to be like a miscalculation.

16:08.660 --> 16:12.100
So against that pushback,

16:12.100 --> 16:17.100
why do you think there's still kernels of winning

16:18.300 --> 16:19.860
in this on the Russian side?

16:19.860 --> 16:21.900
What you're laying out isn't incorrect,

16:21.900 --> 16:26.260
and the miscalculations are not unexpected.

16:26.260 --> 16:28.820
Anybody who's been to a military college,

16:28.820 --> 16:30.660
including the Army War College in Pennsylvania,

16:30.660 --> 16:34.860
where so many of our military leaders are brought up,

16:34.900 --> 16:37.940
when you look at the conflict in Ukraine,

16:37.940 --> 16:40.420
it fits the exact mold

16:40.420 --> 16:44.860
of what an effective long-term military conflict,

16:44.860 --> 16:46.220
protracted military conflict,

16:46.220 --> 16:49.580
would and should look like for military dominance.

16:49.580 --> 16:52.420
Now, did Zelensky and did the Ukrainians

16:52.420 --> 16:53.260
shock the world?

16:53.260 --> 16:54.220
Absolutely.

16:54.220 --> 16:57.820
But in that, they also shocked American intelligence,

16:57.820 --> 17:00.180
which, like you said, miscalculated.

17:00.180 --> 17:01.540
The whole world miscalculated

17:01.540 --> 17:03.220
how the Ukrainians would respond.

17:03.220 --> 17:05.580
Putin did not move in there accidentally.

17:05.580 --> 17:06.820
He had an assessment.

17:06.820 --> 17:09.420
He had high likelihood of a certain outcome,

17:09.420 --> 17:11.460
and that outcome did not happen.

17:11.460 --> 17:13.100
Why did he have that calculation?

17:13.100 --> 17:15.980
Because in 2014, it worked.

17:15.980 --> 17:19.780
He invaded, he took Crimea in 14 days.

17:19.780 --> 17:24.780
He basically created an infiltration campaign

17:25.060 --> 17:26.900
that turned key leaders over

17:26.900 --> 17:29.220
in the first few days of the conflict.

17:29.220 --> 17:30.700
So essentially, there was no conflict.

17:30.700 --> 17:33.220
It worked in 2008 when he took Georgia.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.020
Nobody talks about that.

17:35.020 --> 17:38.300
He invaded Georgia the exact same way, and it worked.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.380
So in 2008, it worked.

17:39.380 --> 17:40.340
In 2014, it worked.

17:40.340 --> 17:41.180
There was no reason to believe

17:41.180 --> 17:43.140
it wasn't going to work again.

17:43.140 --> 17:45.500
So he just carried out the same campaign.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.540
But this time, something was different.

17:47.540 --> 17:49.660
That was a miscalculation, for sure,

17:49.660 --> 17:51.060
on the part of Putin.

17:51.060 --> 17:52.940
And the reason that there was no support from the West,

17:52.940 --> 17:55.380
because let's not forget, there is no support.

17:55.380 --> 17:58.660
There is nothing other than the Lend-Lease Act,

17:59.540 --> 18:01.540
which is putting Ukraine in massive debt

18:01.540 --> 18:03.340
right now to the West.

18:03.340 --> 18:05.180
That's the only form of support they're getting

18:05.180 --> 18:07.060
from NATO or the United States.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.820
So if somebody believed Ukraine would win,

18:10.820 --> 18:12.300
if somebody believed Ukraine had a chance,

18:12.300 --> 18:13.700
they would have gotten more material support

18:13.700 --> 18:15.540
than just debt.

18:15.540 --> 18:17.780
And we can jump into that anytime you want to.

18:17.780 --> 18:19.460
But the whole world miscalculated.

18:19.460 --> 18:21.420
Everybody thought Russia was going to win in 14 days.

18:21.420 --> 18:23.540
I said that they would win in 14 days,

18:23.540 --> 18:26.340
because that was the predominant calculation.

18:26.340 --> 18:28.980
Once the first invasion didn't work,

18:28.980 --> 18:32.780
then the military does what professional militaries do, man.

18:32.780 --> 18:37.780
They reevaluate, they reorganize leaders,

18:38.100 --> 18:40.340
and then they take a new approach.

18:40.340 --> 18:41.740
You saw three approaches.

18:41.740 --> 18:43.740
The first two did not work.

18:43.740 --> 18:46.220
The first two campaigns against Ukraine did not work

18:46.220 --> 18:47.660
the way they were supposed to work.

18:47.660 --> 18:51.260
The third has worked exactly like it's supposed to work.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.780
You don't need Kiev to win Ukraine.

18:53.780 --> 18:56.540
You don't need hearts and minds to win Ukraine.

18:56.540 --> 19:00.780
What you need is control of natural resources,

19:00.780 --> 19:02.700
which they're taking in the East,

19:02.700 --> 19:05.900
and you need access to the heartbeat,

19:05.900 --> 19:09.140
the blood flow of food and money into the country,

19:09.140 --> 19:10.900
which they're taking in the South.

19:10.900 --> 19:14.740
The fact that Ukraine had to go to the negotiation table

19:14.740 --> 19:19.380
with Russia and Turkey in order to get exports

19:19.380 --> 19:21.740
out of the Black Sea approved, again,

19:21.740 --> 19:24.180
demonstrates just how much Ukraine is losing.

19:25.220 --> 19:29.500
The aggressor had a seat at the negotiation table

19:29.500 --> 19:32.420
to allow Ukraine the ability to even export

19:32.420 --> 19:33.860
one of its top exports.

19:33.860 --> 19:35.500
If Russia would have said no,

19:35.500 --> 19:37.100
then they would not have had that.

19:37.100 --> 19:39.620
Russia has, that's like someone holding your throat.

19:39.620 --> 19:41.820
It's like somebody holding your jugular vein

19:41.820 --> 19:46.460
and saying, if you don't do what I tell you to do,

19:46.460 --> 19:48.340
then I'm not gonna let you breathe.

19:48.340 --> 19:50.100
I'm not gonna let blood flow to your brain.

19:50.100 --> 19:52.180
So do you think it's possible

19:52.180 --> 19:56.140
that Russia takes the South of Ukraine?

19:56.140 --> 20:01.140
It takes, so starting from Mariupol, the Kherson region.

20:03.620 --> 20:04.500
All the way to Odessa.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.740
All the way to Odessa.

20:05.740 --> 20:09.700
And into Moldova.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.900
I believe all of that will happen before the fall.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.660
Fall of this year? Fall of this year.

20:14.660 --> 20:16.580
Before winter hits Europe,

20:16.620 --> 20:21.540
NATO wants Germany needs to be able to have sanctions lifted

20:21.540 --> 20:23.740
so they can tap into Russian power.

20:23.740 --> 20:26.140
There's no way they can have those sanctions lifted

20:26.140 --> 20:28.260
unless Russia wins.

20:28.260 --> 20:31.260
And Russia also knows that all of Europe,

20:31.260 --> 20:33.420
all of NATO is the true,

20:33.420 --> 20:36.020
the true people feeling the pain of the war

20:36.020 --> 20:39.220
outside of Ukraine are the NATO countries

20:39.220 --> 20:42.700
because they're so heavily reliant on Russia.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.460
And as they have supported American sanctions

20:45.460 --> 20:47.900
against Russia, their people feel the pain.

20:47.900 --> 20:50.580
Economically, their people feel the pain.

20:50.580 --> 20:51.980
What are they gonna do in the winter?

20:51.980 --> 20:54.740
Because without Russian gas,

20:54.740 --> 20:56.900
their people are gonna freeze to death.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.060
Ukrainian people.

20:58.060 --> 20:59.340
People all over NATO.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.060
Ukraine, everybody knows Ukraine's at risk.

21:03.060 --> 21:05.220
Everybody knows Ukrainians are dying.

21:05.220 --> 21:08.620
The game of war isn't played just,

21:08.620 --> 21:10.260
it isn't even played majoratively

21:10.260 --> 21:11.980
by the people who are fighting.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.660
The game of war is played by everyone else.

21:13.660 --> 21:14.660
It's an economic game.

21:14.660 --> 21:16.060
It's not a military game.

21:16.060 --> 21:18.420
The flow of resources and energy.

21:18.420 --> 21:19.260
Attention.

21:19.260 --> 21:20.100
Food.

21:20.100 --> 21:21.460
Exactly right.

21:21.460 --> 21:24.660
I was on the front in the Kherson region,

21:24.660 --> 21:26.900
the very area that you're referring to.

21:26.900 --> 21:29.060
And I spoke to a lot of people

21:29.060 --> 21:33.300
and the morale is incredibly high.

21:33.300 --> 21:37.740
And I don't think the people in that region,

21:37.740 --> 21:42.740
soldiers, volunteer soldiers, civilians

21:42.980 --> 21:47.340
are going to give up that land without dying.

21:47.340 --> 21:48.660
I agree with you.

21:48.660 --> 21:51.940
I mean, in order to take Odessa,

21:51.940 --> 21:56.940
would require huge amount of artillery

21:57.500 --> 22:00.340
and slaughter of civilians essentially.

22:00.340 --> 22:01.820
They're not gonna use artillery in Odessa

22:01.820 --> 22:05.380
because Odessa is too important to Russian culture.

22:06.260 --> 22:07.860
It's gonna be even uglier than that.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.300
It's going to be clearing of streets,

22:10.300 --> 22:13.420
clearing of buildings, person by person, troop by troop.

22:13.420 --> 22:16.100
It'll be a lot like what it was in Markov.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.140
Just shooting at civilians.

22:18.140 --> 22:20.940
Because they can't afford to just do bombing raids

22:20.940 --> 22:21.780
because they're gonna destroy

22:21.780 --> 22:24.620
a cultural significant architecture

22:24.620 --> 22:26.700
that's just too important to the Russian culture.

22:26.700 --> 22:29.500
And that's gonna demoralize their own Russian people.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.500
I have to do a lot of thinking to try to understand

22:31.500 --> 22:32.580
what I even feel.

22:32.580 --> 22:37.460
I don't know, but in terms of information,

22:37.460 --> 22:39.380
the thing that the soldiers are saying,

22:39.420 --> 22:40.780
the Russian soldiers are saying,

22:40.780 --> 22:43.660
the thing the Russian soldiers really believe

22:43.660 --> 22:45.460
is that they're freeing,

22:45.460 --> 22:50.460
they're liberating the Ukrainian people from Nazis.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.460
And they believe this.

22:56.580 --> 22:57.860
Because I visited Ukraine,

22:57.860 --> 23:00.780
I spoke to over a hundred,

23:00.780 --> 23:02.580
probably a couple hundred Ukrainian people

23:02.580 --> 23:04.460
from different walks of life.

23:04.460 --> 23:07.900
It feels like the Russian soldiers,

23:07.900 --> 23:11.260
at least under a cloud of propaganda,

23:11.260 --> 23:15.540
they're not operating on a clear view of the whole world.

23:15.540 --> 23:20.540
And given all that,

23:20.540 --> 23:25.540
I just don't see Russia taking the South

23:28.140 --> 23:31.780
without committing war crimes.

23:32.780 --> 23:36.500
And if Vladimir Putin is aware of what's happening

23:36.500 --> 23:39.420
in terms of the treatment of civilians,

23:39.420 --> 23:43.180
I don't see him pushing forward all the way

23:43.180 --> 23:44.780
to take the South,

23:44.780 --> 23:49.780
because that's not going to be effective strategy

23:49.820 --> 23:54.060
for him to win the hearts and minds of these people.

23:54.060 --> 23:56.780
Autocracies don't need to win hearts and minds.

23:56.780 --> 24:00.220
That's a staunchly democratic point of view.

24:00.220 --> 24:02.060
Hearts and minds mean very little

24:02.060 --> 24:07.060
to people who understand core basic needs and true power.

24:11.980 --> 24:13.740
You don't see Xi Jinping worrying

24:13.740 --> 24:14.940
about hearts and minds in China.

24:14.940 --> 24:17.620
You don't see it in North Korea.

24:17.620 --> 24:20.140
You don't see it in Congo.

24:20.140 --> 24:22.460
You don't see it in most of the world.

24:22.460 --> 24:24.700
Hearts and minds are a luxury.

24:24.700 --> 24:27.300
In reality, what people need is food, water, power.

24:27.300 --> 24:31.580
They need income to be able to secure a lifestyle.

24:31.580 --> 24:34.060
It is absolutely sad.

24:34.060 --> 24:37.100
I am not in any way, shape or form

24:37.100 --> 24:42.100
saying that my assessment on this is enriching

24:42.420 --> 24:46.340
or enlightening or hopeful.

24:46.340 --> 24:48.700
It's just fact.

24:48.700 --> 24:52.660
It's just calculatable empirical evidence.

24:52.660 --> 24:56.300
If Putin loses in Ukraine, the losses,

24:56.300 --> 24:59.420
the influential losses, the economic losses,

24:59.420 --> 25:03.740
the lives lost, the power lost is too great.

25:03.740 --> 25:07.540
So it is better for him to push and push and push

25:07.540 --> 25:09.380
through war crimes, through everything else.

25:09.380 --> 25:10.620
War crimes are something defined

25:10.620 --> 25:12.380
by the international court system.

25:12.380 --> 25:14.620
The international court system has Russia

25:14.620 --> 25:18.180
as part of its board and the international court system

25:18.180 --> 25:21.380
is largely powerless when it comes

25:21.380 --> 25:23.180
to enforcing its own outcomes.

25:23.180 --> 25:27.820
So the real risk gain scenario here for Russia

25:27.820 --> 25:32.820
is significantly in favor of gain over risk.

25:34.340 --> 25:36.820
The other thing that I think is important to talk about

25:36.820 --> 25:40.340
is we, everybody is trapped in the middle

25:40.340 --> 25:42.860
of a gigantic information war.

25:42.860 --> 25:46.020
Yes, there's battlefield bullets and cannons and tanks

25:46.020 --> 25:48.540
but there's also a massive informational war.

25:48.540 --> 25:53.540
The same narrative that you see these ground troops

25:54.260 --> 25:56.780
in Ukraine, these Russian ground troops in Ukraine

25:56.780 --> 25:59.820
believing they're clearing the land of Nazis.

25:59.820 --> 26:02.540
That information is being fed to them

26:02.540 --> 26:04.140
from their own home country.

26:05.020 --> 26:06.500
I don't know why people seem to think

26:06.500 --> 26:08.140
that the information that they're reading in English

26:08.140 --> 26:10.340
is any more or less true.

26:10.340 --> 26:13.060
The entire, every piece of news coming out of the West,

26:13.060 --> 26:14.860
every piece of information coming out

26:14.860 --> 26:18.460
in the English language is also a giant narrative

26:18.460 --> 26:22.300
being shared intentionally to try to undermine

26:22.300 --> 26:26.100
the morale and the faithfulness of English speaking Russians

26:26.100 --> 26:27.940
which somebody somewhere knows exactly

26:27.940 --> 26:29.540
how many of those there are.

26:29.540 --> 26:32.060
So we have to recognize that we're not getting

26:32.060 --> 26:33.860
true information from other side

26:33.860 --> 26:36.020
because there is a strategic value in making sure

26:36.020 --> 26:37.940
that there is just the right amount

26:37.940 --> 26:40.340
of miss or disinformation out there.

26:40.340 --> 26:42.580
Not because someone's trying to lie to Americans

26:42.580 --> 26:44.460
but because someone is trying to influence

26:44.460 --> 26:47.100
the way English speaking Russians think.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.900
And in that world, that's exactly why you see

26:49.900 --> 26:54.420
so many news articles cited to anonymous sources,

26:54.420 --> 26:56.580
government officials who do not wanna be named.

26:56.580 --> 26:59.740
There's nothing that links back responsibility there, right?

26:59.740 --> 27:01.980
There's nothing that can go to court there

27:01.980 --> 27:04.180
but the information still gets released

27:04.180 --> 27:08.260
and that's enough to make Ukrainians believe

27:08.260 --> 27:10.020
that the United States is gonna help them

27:10.020 --> 27:11.300
or that the West is gonna help them.

27:11.300 --> 27:13.100
It's enough to make Russians think

27:13.100 --> 27:17.020
that they're going to lose and maybe they should just,

27:17.020 --> 27:18.020
they should just give up now

27:18.020 --> 27:19.660
and leave from the battlefield now.

27:19.660 --> 27:20.900
We have to understand.

27:20.900 --> 27:24.020
We are in the middle of a giant information war.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.420
Maybe you can correct me

27:25.420 --> 27:27.380
but it feels like in the English speaking world,

27:27.380 --> 27:29.420
it's harder to control.

27:29.420 --> 27:32.300
It's harder to fight the information war

27:32.300 --> 27:36.060
because of some people say there's not really

27:36.060 --> 27:37.580
a freedom of speech in this country

27:37.580 --> 27:40.180
but I think if you compare,

27:40.180 --> 27:41.780
there's a lot more freedom of speech

27:41.780 --> 27:44.300
and it's just harder to control narratives

27:44.300 --> 27:48.460
when there's a bunch of guerrilla journalists

27:48.460 --> 27:50.380
that are able to just publish anything they want

27:50.380 --> 27:52.020
on Twitter or anything.

27:52.020 --> 27:53.980
It's just harder to control narratives.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.100
People don't understand what freedom of speech is.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.580
That's the first major problem

27:57.580 --> 28:00.340
and it's shameful how many people in the United States

28:00.340 --> 28:03.740
do not understand what freedom of speech actually protects.

28:03.740 --> 28:06.580
So that aside, you're absolutely right.

28:06.580 --> 28:09.140
Fighting the information war in the West

28:09.140 --> 28:14.140
is extremely difficult because anyone with a blog,

28:14.260 --> 28:17.180
anyone with a Twitter account, anyone,

28:17.180 --> 28:19.540
I mean anyone can call themselves a journalist essentially.

28:19.540 --> 28:21.740
We live in a world, we live in a country

28:21.740 --> 28:23.260
where people read the headline

28:23.300 --> 28:26.620
and they completely bypass the author line

28:26.620 --> 28:28.260
and they go straight into the content

28:28.260 --> 28:30.180
and then they decide whether the content's real or not

28:30.180 --> 28:31.460
based on how they feel

28:31.460 --> 28:34.020
instead of based on empirical measurable evidence.

28:35.180 --> 28:37.580
So you mentioned the Len Lise Act

28:37.580 --> 28:39.780
and the support of the United States,

28:39.780 --> 28:42.380
support of Ukraine by the United States.

28:42.380 --> 28:44.740
Are you skeptical to the level of support

28:44.740 --> 28:46.820
that the United States is providing

28:46.820 --> 28:50.020
and is going to provide over time?

28:50.020 --> 28:51.660
The strategy that the United States has taken

28:51.660 --> 28:53.900
to support Ukraine is similar to the strategy

28:53.900 --> 28:57.500
we took to support Great Britain during World War II.

28:57.500 --> 28:58.700
The enactment of the Len Lise Act

28:58.700 --> 29:00.020
is a perfect example of that.

29:00.020 --> 29:02.660
The Len Lise Act means that we are lending

29:02.660 --> 29:06.060
or leasing equipment to the Ukrainian government

29:06.060 --> 29:07.940
in exchange for future payment.

29:08.780 --> 29:10.700
So every time a rocket is launched,

29:10.700 --> 29:13.020
every time a drone crashes into a tank,

29:13.020 --> 29:18.020
that's a bill that Ukraine is just racking up.

29:18.580 --> 29:19.620
It's like when you go to a restaurant

29:19.620 --> 29:21.100
and you start drinking shots.

29:21.100 --> 29:23.500
Sometime the bill will come due.

29:23.500 --> 29:26.220
This is exactly what we did when Europe

29:26.220 --> 29:30.100
and when Great Britain was in the face of Nazi invasion.

29:30.100 --> 29:32.020
We signed the same thing into motion.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.980
Do you know that the UK did not pay off the debt

29:34.980 --> 29:37.860
from World War II until 2020?

29:37.860 --> 29:41.940
They've been paying that debt since the end of World War II.

29:41.940 --> 29:45.260
So what we're doing is we're indebting Ukraine

29:45.260 --> 29:47.380
against the promise that perhaps

29:47.380 --> 29:48.740
they will secure their freedom,

29:48.740 --> 29:50.300
which nobody seems to want to talk about

29:50.300 --> 29:52.940
what freedom is actually gonna look like for Ukrainians.

29:52.940 --> 29:55.460
What are the true handful of outcomes,

29:55.460 --> 29:57.260
the realistic outcomes that could come of this

29:57.260 --> 29:59.180
and which of those outcomes

29:59.180 --> 30:01.340
really looks like freedom to them,

30:01.340 --> 30:02.660
especially in the face of the fact

30:02.660 --> 30:05.420
that they're going to be trillions of dollars in debt

30:05.420 --> 30:09.540
to the West for supplying them with the training

30:09.540 --> 30:11.460
and the weapons and the food and the med kits

30:11.460 --> 30:12.820
and everything else that we're giving them,

30:12.820 --> 30:14.500
because none of it's free.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.140
It's all coming due.

30:16.140 --> 30:17.820
It's all, we're a democracy,

30:17.820 --> 30:20.420
but we're also a capitalist country.

30:20.420 --> 30:23.220
We can't afford to just give things away for free,

30:23.220 --> 30:24.860
but we can give things away at a discount.

30:24.860 --> 30:27.060
We can give things away, lay away,

30:27.060 --> 30:28.900
but the bill will come due.

30:28.900 --> 30:31.500
And unfortunately, that is not part of the conversation

30:31.500 --> 30:32.940
that's being had with the American people.

30:32.940 --> 30:37.420
So debt is a way to establish some level of control.

30:37.420 --> 30:39.780
Power is power.

30:39.780 --> 30:44.180
That said, having a very close relationship

30:44.180 --> 30:45.500
between Ukraine and the United States

30:45.500 --> 30:50.500
does not seem to be a negative possibility

30:51.140 --> 30:53.020
when the Ukrainians think about their future

30:53.020 --> 30:54.060
in terms of freedom.

30:54.060 --> 30:54.900
That's one thing.

30:54.900 --> 30:57.860
And the other, there's some aspect of this war

30:57.860 --> 31:01.540
that I've just noticed that one of the people I talked to

31:01.540 --> 31:06.540
said that all great nations have a independence war,

31:08.700 --> 31:10.700
have to have a war for their independence.

31:10.700 --> 31:12.820
In order, there's something, it's dark,

31:12.980 --> 31:16.780
there's something about war just being a catalyst

31:16.780 --> 31:19.420
for finding your own identity as a nation.

31:19.420 --> 31:22.460
So you can have leaders, you can have sort of signed

31:22.460 --> 31:24.340
documents, you can have all this kind of stuff,

31:24.340 --> 31:26.140
but there's something about war that really brings

31:26.140 --> 31:28.900
the country together and actually try to figure out

31:28.900 --> 31:31.780
what is at the core of the spirit of the people

31:31.780 --> 31:32.820
that defines this country.

31:32.820 --> 31:37.620
And they see this war as that, as the independence war

31:37.620 --> 31:39.300
to define the heart of what the country is.

31:39.300 --> 31:42.860
So there's been before the war, before this invasion,

31:43.780 --> 31:46.340
there was a lot of factions in the country.

31:46.340 --> 31:50.460
There was a lot of influence from oligarchs

31:50.460 --> 31:51.980
and corruption and so on.

31:51.980 --> 31:56.220
A lot of that was, the factions were brought together

31:56.220 --> 32:00.020
under one umbrella effectively to become one nation

32:00.020 --> 32:01.460
because of this invasion.

32:01.460 --> 32:04.780
So they see that as a positive direction

32:04.780 --> 32:09.780
for the defining of what a free democratic country

32:10.340 --> 32:13.140
looks like after the war, in their perspective,

32:13.140 --> 32:14.780
after the war is won.

32:14.780 --> 32:19.260
It's a difficult situation because I'm trying to make sure

32:19.260 --> 32:22.180
that you and all, everybody listening understands

32:22.180 --> 32:25.460
that what's happening in Ukraine among Ukrainians

32:25.460 --> 32:30.460
is noble and brave and courageous and beyond the expectations

32:30.460 --> 32:33.300
of anyone.

32:35.540 --> 32:38.900
The fact is there is no material support

32:38.900 --> 32:40.140
coming from the outside.

32:40.140 --> 32:44.660
The American Revolution was won because of French involvement,

32:44.660 --> 32:47.940
French ships, French troops, French generals,

32:47.940 --> 32:49.740
French military might.

32:49.740 --> 32:54.740
The independence of communist China was won

32:55.540 --> 32:58.740
through Russian support, Russian generals, Russian troops

32:58.740 --> 33:01.060
on the ground fighting with the communists.

33:01.060 --> 33:03.700
That's how revolutions are won.

33:03.700 --> 33:06.380
That's how independent countries are born.

33:06.380 --> 33:08.380
Ukraine doesn't get any of that.

33:08.380 --> 33:12.580
No one is stepping into that because we live in a world

33:12.580 --> 33:17.580
right now where there simply is no economic benefits

33:17.820 --> 33:21.620
to the parties in power to support Ukraine to that level.

33:21.620 --> 33:24.540
And war is a game of economics.

33:24.540 --> 33:28.940
The economic benefit of Ukraine is crystal clear

33:28.940 --> 33:31.460
in favor of Russia, which is why Putin cannot lose.

33:31.460 --> 33:33.580
He will not let himself lose.

33:33.580 --> 33:36.620
Short of something completely unexpected, right?

33:36.620 --> 33:40.140
I'm talking 60%, 70% probability Ukraine loses,

33:40.140 --> 33:42.580
but there's still 20%, 30% probability

33:42.580 --> 33:44.740
of the unimaginable happening.

33:44.740 --> 33:45.900
Who knows what that might be?

33:45.900 --> 33:48.100
An oligarch assassinates Putin

33:48.100 --> 33:50.540
or a nuclear bomb goes off somewhere

33:50.540 --> 33:52.980
or who knows what, right?

33:52.980 --> 33:55.540
There's still a chance that something unexpected will happen

33:55.540 --> 33:57.580
and change the tide of the war.

33:57.580 --> 34:01.580
But when it comes down to the core calculus here,

34:01.580 --> 34:06.260
Ukraine is the agricultural bed to support a future Russia.

34:06.260 --> 34:09.580
Russia knows they know they have to have Ukraine.

34:09.580 --> 34:11.740
They know that they have to have it to protect themselves

34:11.740 --> 34:13.580
against military pressure from the West.

34:13.580 --> 34:15.620
They have to have it for agricultural reasons.

34:15.620 --> 34:20.140
They have major oil and natural gas pipelines

34:20.140 --> 34:22.620
that flow through Eastern Ukraine.

34:23.060 --> 34:25.580
They cannot let Ukraine fall

34:25.580 --> 34:27.260
outside of their sphere of influence.

34:27.260 --> 34:28.500
They cannot.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.100
The United States doesn't really have

34:31.100 --> 34:33.700
any economic vested interests in Ukraine.

34:33.700 --> 34:37.780
Ideological points of view and promises aside,

34:37.780 --> 34:39.300
there's no economic benefit.

34:39.300 --> 34:41.300
And the same thing goes for NATO.

34:41.300 --> 34:44.460
NATO has no economic investments in Ukraine.

34:44.460 --> 34:49.220
Ukrainian output, Ukrainian food

34:49.220 --> 34:51.100
goes to the Middle East and Africa.

34:51.100 --> 34:53.860
It doesn't go to Europe.

34:53.860 --> 34:58.340
So the whole, the West siding with Ukraine

34:58.340 --> 35:00.380
is exclusively ideological

35:00.380 --> 35:02.460
and it's putting them in a place

35:02.460 --> 35:04.140
where they fight a war with Russia

35:04.140 --> 35:06.580
so the whole world can see Russia's capabilities.

35:06.580 --> 35:09.700
Ukraine is a, as sad as it is to say, man,

35:09.700 --> 35:13.260
Ukraine is a pawn on a table

35:13.260 --> 35:17.460
for superpowers to calculate each other's capacities.

35:17.460 --> 35:19.740
Right now, we've only talked about Russia and United States.

35:19.740 --> 35:21.180
We haven't even talked about Iran.

35:21.180 --> 35:23.780
We haven't even talked about China, right?

35:23.780 --> 35:25.020
It is a pawn on a table.

35:25.020 --> 35:27.380
This is a chicken fight so that people get to watch

35:27.380 --> 35:29.660
and see what the other trainers are doing.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.620
Well, a lot of people might've said the same thing

35:31.620 --> 35:34.180
about the United States back in the independence fight.

35:34.180 --> 35:38.460
So there is possibilities, as you've said.

35:38.460 --> 35:41.940
We're not saying zero percent chance

35:41.940 --> 35:44.660
and it could be a reasonably high percent chance

35:44.660 --> 35:48.140
that this becomes one of the great democratic nations

35:48.140 --> 35:50.220
that the 21st century is remembered by.

35:50.220 --> 35:51.060
Absolutely.

35:51.060 --> 35:55.140
And so you said American support.

35:55.140 --> 35:57.620
So ideologically, first of all,

35:57.620 --> 36:02.620
you don't assign much long-term power to that,

36:03.220 --> 36:06.060
that US could support Ukraine

36:06.060 --> 36:09.220
purely on ideological grounds.

36:09.220 --> 36:12.900
Just look in the last four years, the last three years.

36:12.900 --> 36:14.540
Do you remember what happened in Hong Kong

36:14.540 --> 36:15.540
right before COVID?

36:16.540 --> 36:20.580
China swooped into Hong Kong violently,

36:21.620 --> 36:23.900
beating protesters, killing them in the street,

36:23.900 --> 36:26.780
imprisoning people without just cause.

36:26.780 --> 36:29.060
And Hong Kong was a democracy.

36:30.180 --> 36:32.700
And the whole world stood by and let it happen.

36:32.700 --> 36:35.660
And then what happened in Afghanistan just a year ago?

36:35.660 --> 36:37.820
And the whole world stood by

36:37.820 --> 36:41.780
and let the Taliban take power again after 20 years of loss.

36:42.340 --> 36:46.500
We are showing a repeatable point of view.

36:46.500 --> 36:49.620
We will talk, American politicians,

36:49.620 --> 36:52.980
American administrations, we will say a lot of things.

36:52.980 --> 36:56.380
We will promise a lot of ideological pro-democracy,

36:56.380 --> 36:58.460
rah-rah statements.

36:58.460 --> 36:59.860
We will say it.

36:59.860 --> 37:02.780
But when it comes down to putting our own people,

37:02.780 --> 37:07.260
our own economy, our own GDP at risk,

37:07.260 --> 37:09.260
we step away from that fight.

37:09.340 --> 37:12.500
America is currently supplying military equipment

37:12.500 --> 37:13.500
to Ukraine. Absolutely.

37:13.500 --> 37:15.020
And a lot of that military equipment

37:15.020 --> 37:18.860
has actually been the thing that turned the tides of war

37:18.860 --> 37:20.580
a couple of times already.

37:20.580 --> 37:22.660
Currently, that's the high-mars systems.

37:23.540 --> 37:27.740
So you mentioned sort of Putin can't afford to lose,

37:27.740 --> 37:30.020
but winning can look in different ways.

37:30.020 --> 37:32.220
So you've kind of defined so on.

37:32.220 --> 37:36.020
At this moment, the prediction is that winning

37:36.020 --> 37:38.940
looks like capturing not just the East,

37:38.940 --> 37:41.260
but the South of Ukraine.

37:41.260 --> 37:44.580
But you can have narratives of winning

37:44.580 --> 37:48.860
that return back to what was at the beginning of this year

37:48.860 --> 37:50.340
before the invasion. Correct.

37:50.340 --> 37:53.860
That Crimea is still with Russia.

37:53.860 --> 37:56.700
There's some kind of negotiated thing about Donbass

37:56.700 --> 37:59.620
where it still stays with Ukraine, but there's some-

37:59.620 --> 38:01.300
Puppet government. Yeah.

38:01.300 --> 38:03.780
Just like that's what they have in Georgia right now.

38:03.780 --> 38:07.340
And that could still be defined through mechanisms-

38:07.340 --> 38:08.380
As Russia winning.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.980
As Russia winning for Russia,

38:09.980 --> 38:12.180
and then for Ukraine as Ukraine winning,

38:13.060 --> 38:17.060
and for the West as democracy winning,

38:17.060 --> 38:19.140
and you kind of negotiate.

38:19.140 --> 38:22.340
I mean, that seems to be how geopolitics works

38:22.340 --> 38:25.940
is everybody can walk away with a win-win story,

38:25.940 --> 38:29.060
and then the world progresses with the lessons learned.

38:29.060 --> 38:29.940
That's the high likely.

38:29.940 --> 38:31.620
That's the most probable outcome.

38:31.620 --> 38:35.860
The most probable outcome is that Ukraine remains,

38:35.860 --> 38:38.820
in air quotes, a sovereign nation.

38:38.820 --> 38:41.420
It's not going to be truly sovereign

38:41.420 --> 38:46.420
because it will have to have new government put in place.

38:47.500 --> 38:50.700
Zelensky, it's extremely unlikely he will be president

38:50.700 --> 38:54.020
because he has gone too far to demonstrate

38:54.020 --> 38:57.060
his power over the people and his ability

38:57.060 --> 38:59.340
to separate the Ukrainian people

38:59.340 --> 39:02.420
from the autocratic power of Russia.

39:02.460 --> 39:04.660
So he would have to be unseated,

39:04.660 --> 39:06.460
whether he goes into exile

39:06.460 --> 39:09.460
or whether he is peacefully left alone

39:09.460 --> 39:11.140
is all going to be part of negotiations.

39:11.140 --> 39:12.980
But the thing to keep in mind also

39:13.900 --> 39:15.860
is that a negotiated peace

39:15.860 --> 39:17.780
really just means a negotiated ceasefire.

39:17.780 --> 39:19.100
We've seen this happen all over the world.

39:19.100 --> 39:20.860
North Korea and South Korea are technically still

39:20.860 --> 39:23.140
just in negotiated cease power.

39:23.140 --> 39:27.220
What you end up having is Russia will allow Ukraine

39:27.220 --> 39:29.660
to call itself Ukraine, to operate independently,

39:29.660 --> 39:32.060
to have their own debt to the United States.

39:32.100 --> 39:34.460
Russia doesn't want to take on that debt.

39:34.460 --> 39:36.700
And then in exchange for that,

39:36.700 --> 39:38.740
they will have firmer guidelines

39:38.740 --> 39:41.700
as to how NATO can engage with Ukraine.

39:41.700 --> 39:43.180
And then that becomes an example

39:43.180 --> 39:45.220
for all the other former Soviet satellite states,

39:45.220 --> 39:48.140
which are all required economically by Russia,

39:48.140 --> 39:50.700
not required economically by the West.

39:51.700 --> 39:53.820
And then you end up seeing how it just,

39:53.820 --> 39:55.500
you can see how the whole thing plays out

39:55.500 --> 39:59.260
once you realize that the keystone is Ukraine.

40:00.140 --> 40:02.100
There is something about Ukraine,

40:02.100 --> 40:05.500
the deep support by the Ukrainian people of America,

40:05.500 --> 40:09.780
that is in contrast with, for example, Afghanistan,

40:10.860 --> 40:14.060
that it seems like, ideologically,

40:14.060 --> 40:17.180
Ukraine could be a beacon of freedom

40:17.180 --> 40:20.180
used in narratives by the United States

40:20.180 --> 40:24.180
to fight geopolitical wars on that part of the world,

40:24.180 --> 40:26.100
that they would be a good partner

40:26.100 --> 40:28.940
for this idea of democracy, of freedom,

40:29.300 --> 40:31.500
of all the values that America stands for.

40:31.500 --> 40:32.820
They're a good partner.

40:32.820 --> 40:36.020
And so it's valuable if you sort of have

40:36.020 --> 40:38.780
a cynical, pragmatic view,

40:38.780 --> 40:41.540
sort of like Henry Kissinger type of view,

40:41.540 --> 40:43.940
it's valuable to have them as a partner,

40:43.940 --> 40:47.420
so valuable that it makes sense to support them

40:47.420 --> 40:50.140
in achieving a negotiated ceasefire

40:50.140 --> 40:52.020
that's on the side of Ukraine.

40:52.020 --> 40:54.460
But because of this particular leader,

40:54.460 --> 40:56.300
this particular culture,

40:56.300 --> 41:00.620
this particular dynamics of how the war unrolled

41:00.620 --> 41:02.660
and things like Twitter

41:02.660 --> 41:05.140
and the way digital communication currently works,

41:05.140 --> 41:08.100
it just seems like this is a powerful symbol of freedom

41:08.100 --> 41:09.980
that's useful for the United States

41:09.980 --> 41:12.700
if we're sort of to take the pragmatic view.

41:12.700 --> 41:16.540
Don't you think it's possible

41:16.540 --> 41:20.580
that United States supports Ukraine

41:20.580 --> 41:22.740
financially and militarily enough

41:22.740 --> 41:25.300
for it to get an advantage in this war?

41:25.300 --> 41:27.380
I think they've already gotten advantage in the war.

41:27.380 --> 41:28.860
The fact that the war is still going on

41:28.860 --> 41:30.860
demonstrates the asymmetrical advantage.

41:30.860 --> 41:33.460
The fact that Russia has stepped up

41:33.460 --> 41:36.500
to the negotiating table with them several times

41:36.500 --> 41:41.220
without just turning to Chechen,

41:41.220 --> 41:43.220
I mean, you remember what happened in Chechnya,

41:43.220 --> 41:45.100
without turning to Chechnya level,

41:45.100 --> 41:48.580
just mass blind destruction,

41:48.580 --> 41:50.060
which was another Putin war.

41:51.580 --> 41:53.220
To see that those things have happened

41:53.220 --> 41:54.900
demonstrates the asymmetric advantage

41:54.900 --> 41:56.140
that the West has given.

41:56.140 --> 42:01.140
I think the true way to look at the benefit of Ukraine

42:01.860 --> 42:06.740
as a shining example of freedom in Europe for the West

42:06.740 --> 42:08.980
isn't to understand whether or not they could,

42:08.980 --> 42:10.660
they absolutely could.

42:10.660 --> 42:14.940
It's the question of how valuable is that in Europe?

42:14.940 --> 42:16.780
How valuable is Ukraine?

42:16.780 --> 42:19.820
Which before January, before February,

42:20.660 --> 42:22.380
nobody even thought about Ukraine

42:22.380 --> 42:24.380
and the people who did know about Ukraine

42:24.380 --> 42:28.900
knew that it was a extremely corrupt former Soviet state

42:28.900 --> 42:30.980
with 20% of its national population

42:30.980 --> 42:32.500
self-identifying as Russian.

42:33.660 --> 42:35.460
There's a reason Putin went into Ukraine.

42:35.460 --> 42:38.420
There's a reason he's been promising he would go into Ukraine

42:38.420 --> 42:40.540
for the better part of a decade

42:40.540 --> 42:43.700
because the circumstances were aligned.

42:43.700 --> 42:45.620
It was a corrupt country that self-identified

42:45.620 --> 42:47.460
as Russian in many ways.

42:47.460 --> 42:52.020
It was supposed to be an easier of multiple marks

42:52.060 --> 42:55.060
in terms of the former Soviet satellite states to go after.

42:55.980 --> 42:57.980
That's all part of the miscalculation

42:57.980 --> 42:59.940
that the rest of the world saw too

42:59.940 --> 43:02.980
when we thought it would fall quickly.

43:02.980 --> 43:05.940
So to think that it could be a shining example of freedom

43:05.940 --> 43:10.340
is accurate, but is it as shining a star as Germany?

43:10.340 --> 43:11.980
Is it as shining a star as the UK?

43:11.980 --> 43:14.060
Is it as shining a star as Romania?

43:14.060 --> 43:17.940
Is it as shining a star as France?

43:17.940 --> 43:22.460
It's got a lot of democratic freedom-based countries

43:22.460 --> 43:23.740
in Europe to compete against

43:23.740 --> 43:26.860
to be the shining stellar example.

43:26.860 --> 43:29.980
And in exchange, on counterpoint to that,

43:29.980 --> 43:33.620
it has an extreme amount of strategic value to Russia

43:33.620 --> 43:36.140
which has no interest in making it a shining star

43:36.140 --> 43:38.540
of the example of democracy and freedom.

43:38.540 --> 43:41.780
Outside of research in terms of the shininess of the star,

43:41.780 --> 43:43.180
I would argue yes.

43:43.180 --> 43:45.220
If you look at how much it captivated

43:45.220 --> 43:46.540
the attention of the world.

43:46.540 --> 43:47.620
The attention of the world has made

43:47.620 --> 43:49.100
no material difference, man.

43:49.100 --> 43:50.340
That's what I'm saying.

43:50.340 --> 43:53.660
That's your estimation, but are you sure we can,

43:53.660 --> 43:57.260
we can't, if you can convert that

43:57.260 --> 44:00.580
into political influence, into money,

44:00.580 --> 44:03.580
don't you think attention is money?

44:03.580 --> 44:07.580
Attention is money in democracies and capitalist countries.

44:07.580 --> 44:08.420
Yes.

44:08.420 --> 44:09.500
Which serves as a counterweight

44:09.500 --> 44:11.500
to sort of authoritarian regimes.

44:11.500 --> 44:14.580
So for Putin, resources matter.

44:14.620 --> 44:16.580
The United States also resources matter,

44:16.580 --> 44:21.300
but the attention and the belief that people also matter

44:21.300 --> 44:24.740
because that's how you attain and maintain political power.

44:24.740 --> 44:27.020
So going to that exact example,

44:27.020 --> 44:29.420
then I would highlight that our current administration

44:29.420 --> 44:33.700
has the lowest approval ratings of any president in history.

44:33.700 --> 44:36.820
So if people were very fond of the war going on in Ukraine,

44:36.820 --> 44:39.300
wouldn't that counterbalance some of our upset,

44:39.300 --> 44:42.040
some of the distant coming from the economy

44:42.040 --> 44:45.840
and some of the descent coming from the great recession

44:45.840 --> 44:48.720
or the second great, or the great resignation

44:48.720 --> 44:50.080
and whatever's happening with the draw,

44:50.080 --> 44:51.440
with the down stock market,

44:51.440 --> 44:52.760
you would think that people would feel like

44:52.760 --> 44:54.680
they're sacrificing for something

44:54.680 --> 44:58.000
if they really believed that Ukraine mattered,

44:58.000 --> 45:00.400
that they would stand next to the president

45:00.400 --> 45:05.120
who is so staunchly driving and leading the West

45:05.120 --> 45:06.840
against this conflict.

45:06.840 --> 45:09.880
Well, I think the opposition to this particular president,

45:09.920 --> 45:12.720
I personally believe has less to do with the policies

45:12.720 --> 45:17.000
and more to do with a lot of the other human factors.

45:19.280 --> 45:20.920
But again, empirically,

45:20.920 --> 45:23.040
I look at things through a very empirical lens,

45:23.040 --> 45:26.960
a very cold fact-based lens.

45:26.960 --> 45:29.560
And there are multiple data points that suggest

45:29.560 --> 45:32.480
that the American people ideologically sympathize

45:32.480 --> 45:34.480
with Ukraine, but they really just want

45:34.480 --> 45:36.080
their gas prices to go down.

45:36.080 --> 45:38.240
They really just want to be able to pay less money

45:38.240 --> 45:40.040
at the grocery store for their food.

45:40.040 --> 45:42.880
And they most definitely don't want their sons and daughters

45:42.880 --> 45:46.160
to die in exchange for Ukrainian freedom.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.960
It does hurt me to see the politicization

45:47.960 --> 45:49.040
of this war as well.

45:50.400 --> 45:53.960
I think that maybe has to do

45:53.960 --> 45:56.320
with the kind of calculation you're referring to,

45:56.320 --> 45:58.760
but it seems like it doesn't.

45:58.760 --> 46:00.720
It seems like there's a cynical,

46:00.720 --> 46:05.240
whatever takes attention of the media for the moment,

46:05.240 --> 46:07.160
the red team chooses one side

46:07.160 --> 46:09.000
and the blue team chooses another.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.320
And then I think, correct me if I'm wrong,

46:12.320 --> 46:17.320
but I believe the Democrats went into full support

46:17.440 --> 46:20.200
of Ukraine on the ideological side.

46:20.200 --> 46:22.240
And then I guess Republicans are saying,

46:22.240 --> 46:23.320
why are we wasting money?

46:23.320 --> 46:25.920
The gas prices are going up.

46:25.920 --> 46:27.720
That's a very crude kind of analysis,

46:27.720 --> 46:29.800
but they basically picked whatever argument

46:29.800 --> 46:30.840
on whatever side.

46:30.840 --> 46:33.720
And now more and more and more,

46:33.760 --> 46:36.160
this particular war in Ukraine

46:36.160 --> 46:40.120
is becoming a kind of pawn in the game of politics

46:40.120 --> 46:42.800
that's first the midterm elections,

46:42.800 --> 46:44.960
then building up towards the presidential elections,

46:44.960 --> 46:49.960
and stops being about the philosophical, the social,

46:50.040 --> 46:53.840
the geopolitical aspects, parameters of this war,

46:53.840 --> 46:55.960
and more about just like whatever the heck

46:55.960 --> 46:58.960
captivates Twitter, and we're gonna use that for politics.

46:58.960 --> 47:02.400
You're right in the sense of the fact that it's,

47:02.440 --> 47:04.040
I wouldn't say that the red team and the blue team

47:04.040 --> 47:05.400
picked opposite sides on this.

47:05.400 --> 47:08.960
What I would say is that media discovered

47:08.960 --> 47:12.400
that talking about Ukraine wasn't as profitable

47:12.400 --> 47:14.080
as talking about something else.

47:14.080 --> 47:17.680
People simply, the American people who read media

47:17.680 --> 47:20.920
or who watch media, they simply became bored

47:20.920 --> 47:24.040
reading about news that didn't seem to be changing much.

47:24.040 --> 47:26.640
And we turned back into wanting to read

47:26.640 --> 47:27.800
about our own economy,

47:27.800 --> 47:29.440
and we wanted to hear more about cryptocurrency,

47:29.440 --> 47:31.080
and we wanted to hear more about the Kardashians,

47:31.320 --> 47:32.440
that's what we care about,

47:32.440 --> 47:33.880
so that's what media writes about.

47:33.880 --> 47:37.440
That's how a capitalist market-driven world works,

47:37.440 --> 47:38.480
and that's how the United States works.

47:38.480 --> 47:41.160
That's why in both red papers and blue papers,

47:41.160 --> 47:42.760
red sources and blue sources,

47:42.760 --> 47:44.720
you don't see Ukraine being mentioned very much.

47:44.720 --> 47:47.240
If anything, I would say that your Republicans

47:47.240 --> 47:48.720
are probably more in support

47:48.720 --> 47:50.120
of what's happening in Ukraine right now

47:50.120 --> 47:52.160
because we're creating new weapons systems,

47:52.160 --> 47:53.720
our military is getting stronger,

47:53.720 --> 47:55.000
we're sending these,

47:55.000 --> 48:00.000
we get to test military systems in combat in Ukraine.

48:00.240 --> 48:02.960
That's priceless in the world

48:02.960 --> 48:05.400
of the military industrial complex.

48:05.400 --> 48:10.120
Being able to field test, combat test a weapon

48:10.120 --> 48:12.600
without having to sacrifice your own people

48:12.600 --> 48:13.760
is incredibly valuable.

48:13.760 --> 48:15.840
You get all the data, you get all the performance metrics,

48:15.840 --> 48:17.600
but you don't have to put yourself at risk.

48:17.600 --> 48:21.200
That is one of the major benefits of what we're seeing

48:21.200 --> 48:23.800
from supporting Ukraine with weapons and with troops.

48:23.800 --> 48:26.640
The long-term benefit to what will come of this

48:26.640 --> 48:27.920
for the United States.

48:29.720 --> 48:32.800
Practically speaking, in the lens of national security,

48:32.800 --> 48:34.480
through military readiness,

48:34.480 --> 48:36.880
through future economic benefits,

48:36.880 --> 48:38.640
those are super strong.

48:38.640 --> 48:42.280
The geopolitical fight is essentially moot

48:42.280 --> 48:45.160
because Ukraine is not a geopolitical player.

48:45.160 --> 48:48.960
It was not for 70 years,

48:48.960 --> 48:51.520
and after this conflict is over, it will not again.

48:51.520 --> 48:53.320
Just think about what you were just saying

48:53.320 --> 48:55.600
with the American people's attention span

48:55.600 --> 48:57.400
to Twitter and whatever's currently going on.

48:57.400 --> 49:00.560
If the Ukraine conflict resolved itself today

49:00.560 --> 49:03.080
in either, in any direction,

49:03.080 --> 49:04.520
how many weeks do you think

49:04.520 --> 49:06.320
before no one talked about Ukraine anymore?

49:06.320 --> 49:07.840
Do you think we would make it two weeks?

49:07.840 --> 49:09.600
Or do you think we'd make it maybe seven days?

49:09.600 --> 49:11.840
It would be headline news for one or two days,

49:13.200 --> 49:15.080
and then we'd be onto something else.

49:15.080 --> 49:17.760
It's just an unfortunate reality

49:17.760 --> 49:22.040
of how the world works in a capitalist democracy.

49:23.000 --> 49:26.600
Yeah, it just breaks my heart how much,

49:27.560 --> 49:32.080
you know, I know that there's Yemen and Syria and-

49:32.080 --> 49:33.760
That nobody talks about anymore.

49:33.760 --> 49:35.640
Still raging conflicts going on.

49:37.480 --> 49:38.760
It just, it breaks my heart

49:38.760 --> 49:42.320
how much generational hatred is born.

49:42.320 --> 49:44.120
I happen to be from,

49:45.040 --> 49:47.680
my family is from Ukraine and from Russia,

49:47.680 --> 49:49.600
and so for me, just personally,

49:49.600 --> 49:51.920
it's a part of the world I care about

49:52.760 --> 49:54.400
in terms of its history.

49:54.400 --> 49:57.000
Because I speak the language,

49:57.000 --> 49:58.960
I can appreciate the beauty of the literature,

49:58.960 --> 50:00.360
the music, the art,

50:00.360 --> 50:02.680
the cultural history of the 20th century.

50:02.680 --> 50:04.600
Through all the dark times,

50:04.600 --> 50:09.040
through all the hell of the dark sides

50:09.040 --> 50:12.320
of authoritarian regimes, the destruction of war,

50:12.320 --> 50:14.480
there's still just the beauty that I'm able to appreciate

50:14.480 --> 50:17.720
that I can't appreciate about China, Brazil,

50:17.720 --> 50:19.720
other countries because I don't speak their language.

50:19.720 --> 50:20.920
This one I can appreciate.

50:20.920 --> 50:22.720
And so in that way,

50:22.720 --> 50:24.520
this is personally really painful to me

50:24.520 --> 50:26.960
to see so much of that history,

50:26.960 --> 50:28.560
the beauty in that history,

50:28.560 --> 50:31.040
suffocated by the hatred that is born

50:31.040 --> 50:35.040
through this kind of geopolitical game

50:36.280 --> 50:40.040
fought mostly by the politicians, the leaders.

50:40.040 --> 50:41.560
People are beautiful,

50:41.560 --> 50:42.880
and that's what you're talking about.

50:42.880 --> 50:47.240
People are just, people are beautiful creatures.

50:47.240 --> 50:52.040
Culture and art and science,

50:52.040 --> 50:53.720
like these are beautiful, beautiful things

50:53.720 --> 50:55.960
that come about because of human beings.

50:55.960 --> 50:58.240
And the thing that gives me hope

50:58.240 --> 51:02.640
is that no matter what conflict the world has seen,

51:02.640 --> 51:04.560
and we've seen some devastating,

51:04.560 --> 51:07.400
horrible crimes against humanity already.

51:07.400 --> 51:10.080
We saw nuclear bombs go off in Japan.

51:10.080 --> 51:13.800
We saw genocide happen in Rwanda.

51:13.800 --> 51:16.320
We've seen horrible things happen.

51:16.320 --> 51:18.280
But people persevere.

51:18.280 --> 51:21.480
Language, culture, arts, science, they all persevere.

51:21.480 --> 51:23.640
They all shine through.

51:23.640 --> 51:25.480
Some of the most, people don't even realize

51:25.480 --> 51:29.080
how gorgeous the architecture in the culture is inside Iran.

51:29.080 --> 51:30.200
People have no idea.

51:31.640 --> 51:35.840
Chinese people in the rural parts of China

51:35.840 --> 51:37.080
are some of the kindest,

51:37.080 --> 51:39.640
most amazing people you'll ever meet.

51:39.640 --> 51:44.640
And Korean arts and Korean dance, Korean drumming,

51:45.040 --> 51:47.320
nobody has ever even heard of Korean drumming.

51:47.320 --> 51:50.400
Korean drumming is this magical, beautiful thing.

51:50.400 --> 51:53.040
And the North, in North Korea does it better

51:53.040 --> 51:54.440
than anybody in the world.

51:54.440 --> 51:57.640
Taekwondo in North Korea is just exceptional to watch.

51:57.640 --> 51:58.480
In North Korea?

51:58.480 --> 51:59.480
In North Korea.

51:59.480 --> 52:00.320
Nobody knows these things.

52:00.320 --> 52:02.400
How do you know about Taekwondo in North Korea?

52:02.400 --> 52:03.400
I have questions.

52:04.680 --> 52:05.520
That's fascinating.

52:05.520 --> 52:08.160
That's, people don't think about that,

52:08.160 --> 52:09.800
but the culture, the beauty of the people

52:09.800 --> 52:11.680
still flourishes even in the toughest of places.

52:11.680 --> 52:13.720
Absolutely, and we always will.

52:13.720 --> 52:16.360
We always will because that is what people do.

52:16.360 --> 52:18.520
And that is just the truth of it.

52:18.520 --> 52:21.160
And it breaks my heart to see travesties

52:21.160 --> 52:23.880
that people commit against people.

52:23.880 --> 52:26.440
But whether you're looking at a micro level,

52:26.440 --> 52:30.120
like what happens with shootings here in the United States,

52:30.120 --> 52:31.920
or whether you look at a macro level,

52:31.920 --> 52:35.040
like geopolitical power exchanges

52:35.040 --> 52:37.520
and intra and interstate conflicts,

52:37.520 --> 52:40.400
like what you see in Syria and what you see in Ukraine,

52:40.400 --> 52:42.200
those are disgusting, terrible things.

52:42.200 --> 52:43.840
War is a terrible thing.

52:43.840 --> 52:45.320
That is a famous quote.

52:47.080 --> 52:49.800
But people will persevere.

52:49.800 --> 52:52.080
People will come through.

52:53.120 --> 52:54.320
I hope so.

52:54.320 --> 52:55.520
I hope so.

52:55.520 --> 52:58.120
And I hope we don't do something

53:00.000 --> 53:03.320
that I'll probably also ask you about later on,

53:03.320 --> 53:08.200
is things that destroy the possibility of perseverance,

53:08.200 --> 53:09.880
which is things like nuclear war,

53:10.240 --> 53:14.320
things that can do such tremendous damage

53:14.320 --> 53:17.080
that we will never recover.

53:17.080 --> 53:21.080
But yeah, amidst your pragmatic pessimism,

53:22.120 --> 53:25.800
I think both you and I have a kind of maybe small flame

53:25.800 --> 53:28.080
of optimism in there about the perseverance

53:28.080 --> 53:30.560
of the human species in general.

53:30.560 --> 53:33.800
Let me ask you about intelligence agencies

53:33.800 --> 53:35.240
outside of the CIA.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.560
Can you illuminate

53:39.160 --> 53:42.760
what is the most powerful intelligence agency in the world?

53:42.760 --> 53:47.760
The CIA, the FSB, formerly the KGB, the MI6, Mossad.

53:48.760 --> 53:51.720
I've gotten a chance to interact with a lot of Israelis

53:51.720 --> 53:53.040
while in Ukraine.

53:53.040 --> 53:55.520
Just incredible people.

53:55.520 --> 53:58.640
In terms of both training and skill, just all under,

53:58.640 --> 54:03.160
American soldiers too, just American military is incredible.

54:04.160 --> 54:07.360
I just, the competence and skill of the military,

54:08.400 --> 54:10.920
the United States, Israeli I got to interact,

54:10.920 --> 54:12.520
and Ukrainian as well.

54:12.520 --> 54:13.360
It's striking.

54:13.360 --> 54:14.360
It's striking, it's beautiful.

54:14.360 --> 54:16.800
I just love people, I love carpenters

54:16.800 --> 54:19.240
or people that are just extremely good at their job

54:19.240 --> 54:21.360
and that take pride in their craftsmanship.

54:21.360 --> 54:22.720
It's beautiful to see.

54:22.720 --> 54:24.520
And I imagine the same kind of thing happens

54:24.520 --> 54:27.200
inside of intelligence agencies as well

54:27.200 --> 54:29.880
that we don't get to appreciate because of the secrecy.

54:29.880 --> 54:31.440
Same thing with like Lockheed Martin.

54:31.440 --> 54:34.200
I interviewed the CTO of Lockheed Martin.

54:34.200 --> 54:37.160
It breaks my heart as a person who loves engineering.

54:38.400 --> 54:41.120
Because of the cover of secrecy,

54:41.120 --> 54:43.280
we'll never get to know some of the incredible engineering

54:43.280 --> 54:45.840
that happens inside of Lockheed Martin, Boeing.

54:45.840 --> 54:46.680
Raytheon.

54:46.680 --> 54:47.960
Yeah.

54:47.960 --> 54:50.920
There's kind of this idea that these are,

54:50.920 --> 54:53.840
people have conspiracy theories and kind of assign evil

54:53.840 --> 54:56.800
to these companies in some part,

54:56.800 --> 54:59.320
but I think there's beautiful people inside those companies,

54:59.360 --> 55:02.680
brilliant people and some incredible science

55:02.680 --> 55:04.440
and engineering is happening there.

55:04.440 --> 55:09.440
Anyway, that said, the CIA, the FSB, the MI6, Mossad, China,

55:10.720 --> 55:13.440
I know very little about the-

55:13.440 --> 55:14.840
MSS, Ministry of State Security.

55:14.840 --> 55:16.520
I don't know how much you know.

55:17.960 --> 55:19.800
Or just other intelligence agencies.

55:19.800 --> 55:21.840
And India, Pakistan, I've also heard-

55:21.840 --> 55:26.080
Yeah, RAW is powerful and so is ISS or ISSI.

55:26.920 --> 55:28.680
And then of course, European nations

55:28.680 --> 55:30.680
and Germany and France and yeah.

55:30.680 --> 55:33.720
So what can you say about the power,

55:33.720 --> 55:35.920
the influence of the different intelligence agencies

55:35.920 --> 55:37.680
within their nation and outside?

55:37.680 --> 55:41.480
Yeah, so to answer your question, your original question,

55:41.480 --> 55:42.480
which is the most powerful,

55:42.480 --> 55:44.800
I'm gonna have to give you a few different answers.

55:44.800 --> 55:49.280
So the most powerful intelligence organization in the world

55:49.280 --> 55:53.200
in terms of reach is the Chinese MSS,

55:53.200 --> 55:54.840
the Ministry of State Security,

55:54.840 --> 55:59.400
because they have created a single,

55:59.400 --> 56:02.760
solitary intelligence service that has global reach

56:02.760 --> 56:06.160
and is integrated with Chinese culture

56:06.160 --> 56:08.800
so that essentially every Chinese person

56:08.800 --> 56:11.520
anywhere in the world is an informant to the MSS

56:11.520 --> 56:15.480
because that's their way of serving the middle kingdom,

56:15.480 --> 56:18.800
Zhongguo, the central kingdom, the Chinese word for China.

56:19.760 --> 56:21.040
So they're the strongest,

56:21.040 --> 56:23.960
they're the most powerful intelligence service

56:23.960 --> 56:26.480
in terms of reach, most assets, most informants,

56:26.480 --> 56:27.320
most intelligence.

56:27.320 --> 56:29.320
So it's deeply integrated with the citizenry.

56:29.320 --> 56:30.840
Correct, with their culture.

56:30.840 --> 56:33.000
You know what a Chinese person who lives in Syria

56:33.000 --> 56:34.360
thinks of themselves as?

56:34.360 --> 56:35.520
A Chinese person.

56:35.520 --> 56:36.760
Do you know what a Chinese person,

56:36.760 --> 56:38.960
a Chinese national living in the United States

56:38.960 --> 56:40.120
thinks of themselves as?

56:40.120 --> 56:41.640
A Chinese person, right?

56:41.640 --> 56:44.440
Americans living abroad often think of ourselves

56:44.440 --> 56:47.960
as expats, expatriates, living on the local economy,

56:47.960 --> 56:50.000
embracing the local culture.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.640
That is not how Chinese people view

56:51.640 --> 56:52.600
traveling around the world.

56:52.600 --> 56:54.480
And by the way, if I may mention,

56:54.480 --> 56:59.480
I believe the way Masada operates

56:59.480 --> 57:01.120
is a similar kind of thing

57:01.120 --> 57:04.520
because people from Israel living abroad

57:04.520 --> 57:07.800
still think of themselves as Jewish and Israeli.

57:07.800 --> 57:08.960
First.

57:08.960 --> 57:11.800
First, so that allows you to integrate the-

57:11.800 --> 57:13.880
Culture and, yep, the faith-based aspects.

57:13.880 --> 57:14.720
Exactly right.

57:14.720 --> 57:17.200
But the number of people in Israel is much, much smaller.

57:17.200 --> 57:18.040
Exactly right.

57:18.040 --> 57:18.880
The number of people in China.

57:18.880 --> 57:21.360
So when it comes to reach, China wins that game.

57:21.360 --> 57:23.920
When it comes to professional capability,

57:23.920 --> 57:26.480
it's the CIA by far,

57:26.480 --> 57:29.400
because budget-wise, capability-wise,

57:29.400 --> 57:31.480
weapon system-wise, modern technology-wise,

57:31.480 --> 57:34.080
CIA is the leader around the world,

57:34.080 --> 57:36.320
which is why every other intelligence organization

57:36.320 --> 57:38.920
out there wants to partner with CIA.

57:38.920 --> 57:40.800
They want to learn from CIA.

57:40.800 --> 57:42.080
They want to train with CIA.

57:42.080 --> 57:45.320
They want to partner on counter-narcotics

57:45.320 --> 57:47.040
and counter-drug and counter-terrorism

57:47.040 --> 57:49.120
and counter-weager, you name it.

57:49.120 --> 57:50.360
People want to partner with CIA.

57:50.360 --> 57:51.520
So CIA is the most powerful

57:51.520 --> 57:53.680
in terms of capability and wealth.

57:54.560 --> 57:59.560
And then you've got the idea, you've got tech.

57:59.840 --> 58:04.640
So tech alone, meaning corporate espionage,

58:04.640 --> 58:09.040
economic espionage, nothing beats DGSE in France.

58:09.040 --> 58:10.680
They're the top.

58:10.680 --> 58:11.880
They've got a massive budget

58:11.880 --> 58:14.760
that almost goes exclusively to stealing foreign secrets.

58:14.760 --> 58:16.760
They're the biggest threat to the United States,

58:16.760 --> 58:19.600
even above Russia and above China.

58:19.600 --> 58:22.200
DGSE in France is a massively powerful

58:22.200 --> 58:23.520
intelligence organization,

58:23.520 --> 58:26.000
but they're so exclusively focused

58:26.000 --> 58:29.640
on a handful of types of intelligence collection

58:29.640 --> 58:31.960
that nobody even really thinks that they exist.

58:31.960 --> 58:35.680
And then in terms of just terrifying violence,

58:35.680 --> 58:36.720
you have Mossad.

58:36.720 --> 58:38.320
Mossad will do anything.

58:38.320 --> 58:42.200
Mossad has no qualms doing what it takes

58:42.200 --> 58:45.480
to ensure the survival of every Israeli citizen

58:45.480 --> 58:46.520
around the world.

58:46.520 --> 58:49.680
Most other countries will stop at some point,

58:49.680 --> 58:51.440
but Mossad doesn't do that.

58:51.440 --> 58:54.800
So it's the lines you're willing to cross.

58:54.800 --> 58:57.600
And the reasons that you're willing to cross them.

58:57.600 --> 59:02.600
There's CIA will let an American stay in jail in Russia,

59:02.720 --> 59:06.160
unlawfully, and seek a diplomatic solution.

59:06.160 --> 59:07.880
I mean, the United States has let people,

59:07.880 --> 59:10.600
there are two gentlemen from the 1950s

59:10.600 --> 59:12.960
who were imprisoned in China for 20 years,

59:12.960 --> 59:16.680
waiting for diplomatic solutions to their release.

59:16.680 --> 59:21.680
So that's, we do not kill to save a citizen,

59:22.560 --> 59:23.560
but Mossad will.

59:26.640 --> 59:28.400
And then they'll not just kill,

59:28.400 --> 59:31.680
they'll like do large scale infiltration.

59:31.680 --> 59:32.800
They'll do amazing things.

59:32.800 --> 59:35.680
There is no, they spare no expense

59:35.680 --> 59:38.360
because it's a demonstration to their own people.

59:38.360 --> 59:40.640
Again, going back to the whole idea of influence.

59:40.640 --> 59:45.640
Every intelligence operation that sees the light of day

59:45.960 --> 59:47.840
has two purposes.

59:47.840 --> 59:51.400
The first purpose is the intelligence operation.

59:51.400 --> 59:53.560
But if it was just the intelligence operation,

59:53.560 --> 59:54.960
it would stay secret forever.

59:54.960 --> 59:56.800
The second purpose of every successful

59:56.800 --> 59:59.440
intelligence operation, when they become public,

59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.160
is to send a signal to the world.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.400
If you work against us, we will do this to you.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:09.080
If you work for us, we will take care of you in this way.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.840
It's a massive information campaign.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.440
Do you think in that way CIA is not doing a good job?

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.880
Because there's, you know, the FSB,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000
perhaps much less so GRU, but the KGB did this well,

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:28.720
which is to send a signal, like basically communicate

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:33.560
that this is a terrifying organization with a lot of power.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.800
So Mossad is doing a good job of that.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:36.880
Correct.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.800
The psychological information warfare.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:44.800
And it seems like the CIA also has a lot of kind of myths

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.480
about it, conspiracy theories about it,

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.560
but much less so than the other agencies.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.960
CIA does a good job of playing to the mythos.

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:58.880
So when General Petraeus used to be the director of CIA,

01:00:58.880 --> 01:00:59.720
2010.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:02.360
And your workout partner, I read about this.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.280
So I loved and hated those workouts with Petraeus

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.920
because he is a physical beast.

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.760
He's a strong fit at the time, 60 something year old man.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.000
Let me take a tangent on that

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.160
because he's coming out of his pocket.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.400
Oh, excellent man.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:20.400
So can you say what you learned from the man

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:25.200
in terms of, or like what you think is interesting

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:28.360
and powerful and inspiring about the way he sees the world,

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:31.800
or maybe what you learned in terms of how to get strong

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.040
in the gym or anything about life.

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:34.880
Two things right away.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.160
And one of them I was gonna share with you anyway.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.480
So I'm glad that you asked the question.

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:42.480
So the first is that on our runs and man, he runs fast

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.680
and we would go for six mile runs through Bangkok.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.280
And he talked openly about, I asked him,

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:56.400
how do you keep this mystery, this epic mythology

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.480
about your fitness and your strength?

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:04.760
How do you keep all of this alive with the troops?

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.040
And he had this amazing answer and he was like,

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.800
I don't talk about it.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:13.360
Myths are born not from somebody orchestrating the myth,

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:16.960
but from the source of the myth, simply being secretive.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.640
So he's like, I don't talk about it.

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:19.880
I've never talked about it.

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.200
I've never exacerbated it.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.960
I just do what I do and I let the troops talk.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.480
And he's like, when it's in favor,

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.520
when it goes in favor of discipline

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.800
and loyalty and commitment, I let it run.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.360
If it starts getting destructive or damaging,

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.880
then I have my leadership team step in to fix it.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.440
But when it comes to the mythos,

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:43.000
the myth of him being super powered soldier,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.440
that's what he wants every soldier to be.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.720
So he lets it run.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.960
And it was so enlightening when he told me

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.440
when there's a myth that benefits you, you just let it go.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.240
You let it happen because it gets you further

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.200
without you doing any work.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.040
It costs no investment for you.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:58.520
So the catalyst of the virality of the myth

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.240
is just being mysterious.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.000
And that's what CIA does well,

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.280
to go back to your first question.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.680
What does CIA do?

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.520
They don't answer any questions.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.280
They don't say anything.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.000
And wherever the myth goes, the myth goes,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.080
whether it's that they sold drugs

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.840
or used child prostitutes or whatever else,

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:17.120
wherever the myth goes, they let it go.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.840
Because at the end of the day,

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:22.200
everybody sits back and says, wow, I really just don't know.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.840
Now, the second thing that I learned from Petraeus,

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:27.160
and I really am a big fan of Petraeus.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.120
I know he made personal mistakes.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:30.600
You don't get to be that powerful

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.200
without making personal mistakes.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.440
But when I worked out with him,

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:38.440
the one thing that my commanding officer

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.920
told me not to ask about,

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.240
he was like, never ask the general about his family.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.240
I'm a family guy.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.160
So as soon as I met General Petraeus,

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.920
one of the first things I asked him was,

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.720
hey, what was it like raising a family

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:55.280
and being the commander of forces in the Middle East?

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.080
Like you weren't with your family very much.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.080
And the thing I love about the guy,

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.400
he didn't bite off my head.

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.040
He didn't snap at me.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:02.880
He didn't do anything.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.760
He openly admitted that he regretted

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:06.600
some of the decisions that he made

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:11.120
because he had to sacrifice his family to get there.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.560
Relationships with his children,

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.560
absentee father, missing birthdays,

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.120
missing, we all say how sad it is

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.040
to miss birthdays and miss anniversaries, yada, yada, yada.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.040
Everybody knows what that feels like.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.920
Even business people know what that feels like.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.000
The actual pain that we're talking about

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.280
is when you're not there to handle

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:31.640
your 13-year-old's questions when a boy breaks up with her

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.520
or when you're not there to handle the bloody lip

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:35.920
that your nine-year-old comes back with

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.920
from their first encounter with a bully.

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.760
Those are the truly heartbreaking moments

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.360
that a parent lives and dies by.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.600
He missed almost all of those

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.240
because he was fighting a war that we forgot

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.160
and we gave up on 20 years later, right?

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.280
It's, he's so honest about that.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.000
And it was really inspiring to me

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.160
to be told not to ask that question.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.920
And when I broke that guidance, he didn't reprimand me.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:05.560
He just, he was authentic.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.440
And it was absolutely one of the big decisions

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.600
that helped me leave CIA on my own in 2014.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:15.080
And he was honest on the sacrifice you make.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:17.760
The same man, the same man who just taught me a lesson

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.440
about letting a myth live,

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.400
that same guy was willing to be so authentic

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.960
about this personal mistake.

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.800
I like complicated people like that.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.400
So what did you, what do you make of that calculation,

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.520
a family versus job?

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:40.680
You've given a lot of your life and passion

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.680
to the CIA, to that work.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.680
It, you've spoken positively about that world,

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.040
the good it does.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.920
And yet you're also a family man and you value that.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.240
What's that calculation like?

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.080
What's that trade-off like?

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.880
I mean, for me, the calculation is very clear.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.800
It's family.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:03.240
I left CIA because I chose my family.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:06.560
And when my son was born, my wife and I found out

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.360
that we were pregnant while we were still on mission.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:09.280
We were a tandem couple.

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:12.640
My wife is also a former CIA officer, undercover like me.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.960
We were operating together overseas.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.080
We got the positive pregnancy tests,

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:21.800
like so many people do, and she cried.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.280
My wife was a badass.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:26.360
I was just, I was like the accidental spy,

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.320
but my wife was really good at what she does.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.080
And she cried and she was like, what do we do now?

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.880
Like it's what we've always wanted, a child,

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.840
but we're in this thing right now.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.280
There's no space for a child.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:44.960
So long story short, we had our baby.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:48.080
We, CIA brought us back to have the baby.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.600
And when we started having the conversations about,

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.160
hey, what do we do next?

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.520
Because we're not the type of people

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:57.600
to wanna just sit around and be domestic.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.800
What do we do next?

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:00.920
But keep in mind, we have a child now.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.640
So here's some of our suggestions.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.120
We could do this and we can do that.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.440
Let us get our child to a place

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.320
where we can put him into an international school

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:10.480
or we can get him into some sort of program

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:15.480
where we can both operate together again during the day.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.480
But CIA just had no,

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.920
they had no patience for that conversation.

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:23.880
There was no, family is not their priority.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:26.920
So the fact that we were a tandem couple, two officers,

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.640
two operators trying to have a baby was irrelevant to them.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.720
So when they didn't play with us,

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.560
when they did nothing to help us

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:41.480
prioritize parenthood as part of our overall experience,

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.120
that's when we knew that they never would.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:46.520
And what good is it to commit yourself to a career

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.240
if the career is always going to challenge

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.160
the thing that you value most?

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.600
And that was the calculation that we made to leave CIA.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.840
Not everybody makes that calculation.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:00.320
And a big part of why I am so vocal about my time at CIA

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:04.080
is because I am immensely appreciative

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:09.080
of the men and women who to this day have failed marriages

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:12.080
and poor relationships with their children

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.240
because they chose national security.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.360
They chose protecting America over their own family.

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:21.760
And they've done it even though it's made them

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.600
abuse alcohol and abuse substances

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.440
and they've gotten themselves,

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:29.160
they've got permanent diseases and issues

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.480
from living and working abroad.

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:35.440
It's just insane the sacrifice that officers make

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.600
to keep America free.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.360
And I'm just not one of those people, I chose family.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:44.400
You said that your wife misses it.

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.240
Do you miss it?

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.080
We both miss it.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.640
We miss it for different reasons.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.480
We miss it for similar reasons, I guess,

01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.920
but we miss it in different ways.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:55.760
The people, the people at CIA are just amazing.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.200
They're people that, they're everyday people

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.480
like the guy in the gown next door,

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:04.960
but so smart and so dedicated and so courageous

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.840
about what they do and how they do it.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.960
I mean, the sacrifices they make are massive,

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.720
more massive than the sacrifices I made.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.640
So I was always inspired and impressed

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:13.720
by the people around me.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.640
So both my wife and I absolutely miss the people.

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:20.360
My wife misses the work because you know everything.

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:25.200
When you're inside, it's all, I mean, we had top secret.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.120
We had TSSCI clearances at the time.

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:30.440
I had a cat six, cat 12, which makes me nuclear cleared.

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:33.400
My wife had other privy clearances that allowed her

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:37.320
to look into areas that were specialized,

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:40.920
but there wasn't a headline that went out

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:44.240
that we couldn't fact check with a click of a few buttons.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.240
And she misses that because she loved that kind of problem.

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:51.120
And now you're just one of us living in the cloud

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.440
of mystery, not really knowing anything

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.360
about what's going on.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:57.200
Exactly, but for me, I've always been the person

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.080
that likes operating.

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.000
And you know what you still get to do when you leave CIA?

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.440
You still get to operate.

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.320
Operating is just working with people.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.160
It's understanding how people think,

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.680
predicting their actions, driving their direction

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:12.040
with their thoughts, persuading them, winning negotiations.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.080
Like it's, you still get to do that.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.480
You do that every day.

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:18.560
And you can apply that in all kinds of domains.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.000
Well, let me ask you on that.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.280
You were a covert CIA intelligence officer

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.960
for several years.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.000
Maybe can you tell me the story of how it all began?

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.560
Were you recruited and what did the job entail

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.240
to the degree you can speak about it?

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.120
Feel free to direct me if I'm getting too boring

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:36.960
or if the-

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.520
Every aspect of this is super expanded.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:44.520
So I was leaving the United States Air Force in 2007.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.240
I was a lieutenant getting ready to pin on captain.

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:55.080
My five years was up and I was a very bad fit

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.640
for the US Air Force.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.920
I was an Air Force Academy graduate, not by choice,

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.840
but by lack of opportunity, lack of options otherwise.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.760
So I forced myself through the Academy,

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.200
barely graduated with a 2.4 GPA.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.480
And then went on that Air Force taught me how to fly.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.000
And then the Air Force taught me about nuclear weapons.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.000
And I ended up as a nuclear missile commander in Montana.

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.840
And I chose to leave the Air Force

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:23.240
because I didn't like shaving my face.

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.280
I didn't like having short hair.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.320
And I most definitely didn't like shining my shoes.

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.200
And I did not wanna be one of the people

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.400
in charge of nuclear weapons.

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.720
So when I found myself as a person

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.040
in charge of 200 nuclear weapons,

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.680
I knew that I was going down the wrong road.

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:36.240
I have questions about this.

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.440
And more importantly, I have questions about your hair.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.320
So you have short hair at the time?

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.480
I have, yeah, you have to.

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.000
Military regulations, you can't have hair

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
longer than one inch.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Okay, and this, the beautiful hair you have now,

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:52.200
that came to be in the CIA or after?

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:55.400
This, so I discovered I had messy hair in CIA

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.600
because I used to go mooch, we called it mooch.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.400
I used to go Mujahideen style,

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.360
big burly beard and crazy wacky hair

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.640
because an ambiguously brown guy

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.720
with a big beard and long hair

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.520
can go anywhere in the world

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:12.280
without anyone even noticing him.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:14.600
They either think that he's a janitor

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:18.920
or they think that he's like some forgotten part of history,

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:21.640
but nobody ever thinks that that guy is a spy.

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:23.640
So it was the perfect, for me,

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.720
it was one of my favorite disguises.

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.200
It's what's known as a level two disguise.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:30.560
One of my favorite disguises to don

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.960
was just dilapidated brown guy.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:37.720
Can you actually, we'll just take a million tangents.

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.560
What's a level two disguise?

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.000
What are the different levels of disguise?

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.200
What are the disguises?

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.720
Yeah, there's three levels of disguise by and large.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:48.520
Level one is what we also know,

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.880
what we also call light disguise.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:53.600
So that's essentially, you put on sunglasses and a ball cap

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.080
and that's a disguise.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.400
You look different than you normally look.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.720
So it's just different enough

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.400
that someone who's never seen you before,

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:03.000
someone who literally has to see you

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.160
just from a picture on the internet,

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.480
they may not recognize you.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.080
That's why you see celebrities walk around

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:11.920
with ball caps and oversized jackets and baseball hats

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.280
because they just need to not look like they look

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:16.360
in the tabloid or not look like they look in TV.

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.960
That's level one.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.880
Let me jump from level one to level three.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.320
Level three is all of your prosthetics,

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.760
all the stuff you see in Mission Impossible,

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:28.760
your fake ears, your fake faces, your fat suits,

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.400
your stilts inside your feet, all that's level three.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:35.880
Whenever they make any kind of prosthetic disguise,

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.080
that's a level three disguise

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:41.320
because prosthetics are very damning

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.080
if you are caught with a prosthetic.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:47.280
If you're caught wearing a baseball hat and sunglasses,

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.520
nobody's gonna say you're a spy.

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:54.120
But when you're caught with a custom made nose prosthetic

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.520
that changes the way your face looks

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.680
or when someone pops out a fake jaw

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.880
and they see that your top teeth don't look like they did

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:03.320
in this prosthetic, then all of a sudden,

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.640
you've got some very difficult questions to ask

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:06.680
or to answer.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:08.480
So level three is extremely dangerous.

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.560
Level one is not dangerous.

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:12.400
Level two is long-term disguise.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.200
Level two is all the things that you can do

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.160
to permanently change the way you look

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.720
for a long period of time

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.440
so that whether you're aggressed in the street

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.560
or whether someone breaks into your hotel room or whatever,

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:24.760
it's real.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.360
So maybe you get a tattoo.

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.880
Maybe you cut your hair short.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:29.800
Maybe you grow your hair long.

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:31.160
Maybe you go bald.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.600
Maybe you start wearing glasses.

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.160
Well, glasses are technically a prosthetic,

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:38.280
but if you have teeth pulled,

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:42.240
if you gain 20 pounds, really gain 20 pounds

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.320
or lose 15 pounds, whatever you might do,

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.640
all of that is considered level two.

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:48.440
It's designed for a long-term mission

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:52.080
so that people believe you are who you say you are

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.120
in that disguise.

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.960
A lot of that is physical characteristics.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:59.720
What about like what actors do,

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.280
which is the...

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.120
Method acting.

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:03.040
Yeah, the method acting,

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:07.200
sort of developing a backstory in your own mind

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:12.200
and then you start pretending that you host a podcast

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:18.000
and teach at a university and then do research and so on

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
just so that people can believe

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.480
that you're not actually an agent.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.760
Is that part of the disguise levels or no?

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:28.200
So yes, disguise has to do with physical character traits.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.600
That's what a disguise is.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:32.320
What you're talking about is known as a cover legend.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.520
When you go undercover,

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.640
what you claim to be, who you claim to be,

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:38.200
that's called your legend, your cover legend.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.640
Every disguise would theoretically have

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.440
its own cover legend.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.680
Even if it's just to describe

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.320
why you're wearing what you're wearing,

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.120
it's all a cover.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.960
So the method acting,

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.480
this is a fantastic point

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.520
that I don't get to make very often,

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:52.800
so I'm glad you asked.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.320
The difference between CIA officers in the field

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.440
and method actors is that method actors

01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:59.960
try to become the character.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:04.320
They try to shed all vestiges of who they really are

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.920
and become the character.

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.520
And that's part of what makes them so amazing,

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:12.240
but it's also part of what makes them mentally unstable

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:13.200
over long periods of time.

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.760
It's part of what feeds their depression, their anxiety,

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:16.600
their personal issues

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:18.960
because they lose sight of who they really are.

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:20.800
Field officers don't get that luxury.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:24.520
We have to always, always remember

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.000
we are a covert CIA intelligence officer

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.680
collecting secrets in the field.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:29.960
We have to remember that.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.480
So we're taught a very specific skill

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:37.480
to compartmentalize our true self separately,

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:42.840
but make that true self the true identity.

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.000
So then we can still live and act

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.920
and effectively carry out our cover legend

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:49.960
without ever losing sight,

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:52.040
without ever losing that compass true north

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.640
of who we actually are.

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:55.200
And then we can compartmentalize

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.920
and secure all the information that we need,

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:58.320
retain it, remember it,

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.480
but then return to our true self

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:03.200
when we get back to a position of safety.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.480
Is it possible to do that?

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:09.320
So I just have kind of anecdotal evidence for myself.

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.360
I really try to be the exact same person in all conditions,

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.920
which makes it very easy.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:17.280
Like if you're not lying,

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.960
it makes it very easy to,

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.360
first of all, to exist,

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.960
but also to communicate a kind of authenticity

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.480
and a genuineness,

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:26.480
which I think is really important.

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.240
Like trust and integrity around trust

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.480
is extremely important to me.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.400
It's the thing that opens doors

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.800
and maintains relationships.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.680
And I tend to think,

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.440
like when I was in Ukraine,

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.920
so many doors just opened to the very sort of

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:46.160
high security areas and everywhere else too.

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.960
Like I've just interacted with some incredible people

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:52.160
without any kind of concerns.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.000
Who's this guy?

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.480
Is he gonna spread it?

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.320
All that kind of stuff.

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.560
And I tend to believe that

01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:00.880
you're able to communicate a trustworthiness somehow

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:05.120
if you just are who you are.

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.200
And I think, I suppose method actors

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.320
are trying to achieve that by becoming something

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:10.480
and they can,

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:14.320
I just feel like there is very subtle cues

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.960
that are extremely difficult to fake.

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:20.640
Like you really have to become that person,

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.080
be that person.

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:25.120
But you're saying as a CIA agent,

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.440
you have to remember that you are

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.120
there to collect information.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.160
Do you think that gives you a way?

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.960
So one of the flaws in your argument

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:38.240
is that you keep referring to how you feel.

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.720
I feel this, I feel that,

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.640
I feel like this, I feel like that.

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:45.920
That feeling is a predictable character trait

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:46.800
of all human beings.

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.360
It's a pink matter.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.200
We call it pink matter.

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.920
It's a cognitive trait.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:55.040
You are not alone in trusting your feelings.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.800
All people trust their feelings.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.680
But because what CIA teaches us

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:03.400
is how to systematically create artificial relationships

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:05.720
where we're the one in control

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:08.480
of the source that is giving us intelligence.

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:10.880
And the core element

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.280
to being able to control a relationship

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.960
is understanding the pink matter truth of feelings.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.800
What all people feel

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:21.480
becomes their point of view on what reality is.

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:22.400
So when you understand

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.960
and you learn how to manipulate what people feel,

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.760
then you can essentially direct them to feel

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.360
any way you want them to feel.

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.840
So if you want them to feel like they can trust you,

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.160
you can make them feel that way.

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:34.280
If you want them to feel like you're a good guy

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.100
or a bad guy,

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:36.440
if you want them to feel like

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:37.520
they should give you secrets

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.120
even though their government tells them not to,

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.040
you can do that.

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:43.280
There are men who make women feel like they love them

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.240
and just so that the woman will sleep with them.

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.480
There are women who make men feel like they love them

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:49.640
just so the men will give them their money.

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.880
Manipulation is a core behavioral trait

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.800
of all the human species

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.840
because we all understand to some level

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.240
how powerful feelings are.

01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.600
But feelings are not the same thing

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.240
as logical, rational thoughts.

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.440
They're two different sides of the brain.

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:04.600
What CIA teaches us how to do

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:08.560
is systematically tap into the right side,

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.120
emotional side of the brain

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:13.120
so that we can quickly get past

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:14.280
all of the stuff you were just saying,

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.740
all of the, well, don't you have to be convincing

01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:18.200
and don't you have to really know your story

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.440
and don't you have to be able to defend it?

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:21.680
Don't you have to have authenticity

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:25.840
and don't you have to have genuine feelings?

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.640
Yes, all of those things are true

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.840
if you're having a genuine relationship.

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.320
But in an artificial relationship,

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:32.840
there's ways to bypass all of that

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:33.680
and get right to the heart

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.440
of making someone feel comfortable and safe.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.720
I guess the question I'm asking

01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:40.680
and the thing I was implying

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.520
is that creating an artificial relationship

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:45.520
was an extremely difficult skill

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:48.040
to accomplish the level,

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:51.880
like how good I am at being me

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:56.360
and creating a feeling in another person that I create.

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:58.280
For you to do that artificially,

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:00.440
that's gotta be, you gotta be,

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.560
my sense is you gotta be really damn good

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.720
at that kind of thing.

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:05.840
I would venture to say,

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:10.080
I don't know how to measure how difficult the thing is,

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:14.000
but especially when you're communicating with people

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.640
whose job depends on forming trusting relationships,

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.240
they're gonna smell bullshit.

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:26.640
And to get past that bullshit detector is tough.

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:28.400
It's a tough skill.

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:31.000
Well, it's interesting, so I would say that.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.720
Or maybe I'm wrong actually on that.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.640
I would say that once you understand the system,

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:35.560
it's not that hard.

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.040
It makes a lot of sense.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:39.600
But I would also say that to your exact point,

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:42.200
you are right that people smell bullshit.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.760
People smell bullshit.

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:45.120
But here's the thing.

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:48.040
If you come in smelling like goat shit,

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:49.960
you still smell like shit,

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:51.840
but you don't smell like bullshit.

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.840
So they don't count you out right away.

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:57.120
And if you come in smelling like rotten tomatoes,

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.320
or if you come in smelling like lavender,

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.560
or if you come in smelling like vanilla,

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.440
or if you come in without any smell at all,

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:05.680
all that matters is that you don't smell like bullshit.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:10.520
Here's the thing that's one of the secret sauces of CIA.

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:12.480
When you look and act like a spy,

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:14.200
people think you're a spy.

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:16.080
If you look and act in any other way,

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:18.320
you know what they never, ever think you are?

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.080
A spy.

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:22.200
They might think you're an idiot.

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.920
They might think you're a trailer trash.

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:27.720
They might think that you're a migrant worker,

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:30.040
but they never think you're a spy.

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:35.560
And that lesson in everyday life is immensely powerful.

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:39.760
If you're trying to take your boss's job,

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:41.760
as long as you don't ever look like the employee

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:43.320
who's trying to take the boss's job,

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.880
the boss is focused on all the employees

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:46.680
who are trying to take his job.

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:49.000
Everybody's prioritizing whether they know it or not.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.840
The goal is to just not be the one that they're targeting.

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:54.120
Target them without them knowing you're targeting them.

01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:56.400
So people just, when they meet you,

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.200
they put you in a bin.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.080
And if you want to avoid being put

01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:02.480
in a particular bin, just don't act like the person

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:06.200
that will be, just show some kind of characteristics

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.440
that bin you in some other way.

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:08.280
Exactly right.

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.560
You have to be in a bin.

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.640
Just choose the bin.

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:12.600
All right.

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:17.920
You, knowing these methods, when you talk to people,

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.160
especially in civilian life,

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:22.720
how do you know who's lying to you and not?

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:26.640
That gets to be more into the trained skill side of things.

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.600
There's body cues.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.920
There's micro expressions.

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:31.520
I'm not a big fan of,

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:33.960
I don't believe that micro expressions alone do anything.

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.680
I also don't believe that micro expressions

01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:37.840
without an effective baseline do anything.

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:40.200
So don't for a second think that I'm,

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:41.640
all the people out there pitching

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:43.080
that you can tell if someone's lying to you

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:46.080
just by looking at their face, it's all baloney.

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:47.680
In my world, that's baloney.

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.960
Like the way you move your eyes or something like that.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.840
Without knowing a baseline, without knowing-

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:52.680
For that individual.

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:54.400
For that individual, then you actually don't know.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:56.520
And an individual's baseline is based on education,

01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:58.360
culture, life experience, you name it, right?

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.160
So it's huge.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:03.480
But when you combine facial expressions

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:06.920
with body movements, body language, nonverbal cues,

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:10.560
and you add on top of that effective elicitation techniques

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.120
that you are in control of,

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:15.320
now you have a more robust platform

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.520
to tell if someone's lying to you.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:21.520
So there's like a set of interrogation trajectories

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:26.200
you can go down that can help you figure out a person.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.440
Technically, they're interview concepts.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:31.280
Correct.

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.280
Because an interrogation,

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:33.680
an interrogation is something very different

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:34.520
than an interview.

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.160
And in the world of professionals,

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.400
an interrogation is very different.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.240
What's the difference?

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.840
The nature of how relaxed the thing is or what?

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.400
So in an interrogation,

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.120
there's a clear pattern of dominance.

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.640
There's no equality.

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:47.280
Also, there's no escape.

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:49.920
You are there until the interrogator is done with you.

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:51.840
Anybody who's ever been reprimanded by mom and dad

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.160
knows what an interrogation feels like.

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.000
Anybody who's ever been called

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.960
into the principal's office or the boss's office,

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:57.200
that's what interrogation feels like.

01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.560
You don't leave until the boss says you can leave.

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:00.400
And you're there to say,

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.840
it's the answer questions the boss asks questions.

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:05.680
An interview is an equal exchange of ideas.

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:09.680
You are in control of this interview, for sure.

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:11.520
But if we were having coffee,

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:13.400
I could take control if I wanted to take control.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.120
If I wanted to ask you personal questions, I would.

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:17.600
If I wanted to talk to you about your background, I could.

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.400
Why am I in control of this interview exactly?

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:20.600
Because the person in control

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:22.160
is the person asking questions.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.800
I'm sitting here as you've spoken about.

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:29.720
My power here is I'm the quiet one listening.

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:31.600
You're exactly right.

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.720
Guess where this conversation goes?

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:35.080
Anywhere you choose to take it

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.560
because you're the one asking questions.

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.280
Every time I answer a question,

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:41.640
I am creating a pattern of obedience to you,

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:43.240
which subliminally, subconsciously,

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:45.720
makes me that much more apt to answer your questions.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:46.720
Of course, you can always turn that

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.520
and start asking me questions.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:53.960
But you're saying that through conversation,

01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:55.560
you can call it interviewing,

01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:00.560
you can start to see cracks in the story of the person

01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:08.520
and the degree to which they exaggerate or lie

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:13.120
or to see how much they can be trusted, that kind of stuff.

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:15.040
What I'm saying is that through a conversation,

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:16.760
you develop a baseline.

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:20.160
Even just in the first part of our conversation,

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:23.160
I've been able to create some baseline elements about you.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.600
You've been able to create baseline elements about me.

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.640
Maybe they're just not front of mind.

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:28.920
From those baselines,

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:33.080
now we can push through more intentional questions

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:37.000
to test whether or not the person is being truthful

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.120
because they're operating within their baseline

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:42.480
or if you are triggering sensitivities

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:43.480
outside of their baseline

01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.480
and then you can start to see their tells.

01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.320
That's fascinating.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:50.600
Yeah, baseline, even the tells, the eye contact.

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.320
You've probably already formed a baseline

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.560
that I have trouble making eye contact.

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.920
And so if you ask me difficult questions

01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.280
and I'm not making eye contact,

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:01.160
maybe that's not a good signal of me lying or whatever.

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.000
Correct.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.160
Because I always have trouble making eye contact,

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.000
stuff like that.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000
That's really fascinating.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.760
The majority of your eye movement is to the right.

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:08.720
Yeah.

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.560
Your right, my left, which is usually someone who's,

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.440
if you ask micro-expressionists,

01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:15.640
that's someone who's referencing fact.

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:16.480
Yeah.

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:18.080
That's not necessarily what's happening for you

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.840
because you're pulling concepts out of the air.

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:21.240
So it's also a place that you reference

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.120
something other than fact.

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:24.040
It's a place for you to find creativity.

01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:25.440
So if I just thought that you were lying

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.320
because you look up and to the right,

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.160
I would be wrong.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.320
That's so fascinating.

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.400
And a lot of that has to do with like habits

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.160
that are formed and all those kinds of things.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.960
Or maybe some right hand, left hand type of situation.

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:36.880
Right eye dominance.

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:37.720
Yeah, right eye dominance.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:39.080
Is gonna make you look to the right.

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.840
Is this a science or an art?

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:41.800
It's a bit of both.

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:44.200
I would say that like all good art,

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:47.440
art is taught from a foundation of skills.

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:51.080
And those skills are played,

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.640
are taught in a very structured manner.

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:57.280
And then the way that you use the skills after that,

01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:59.440
that's more of the artistic grace.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.760
So I've always called espionage an art.

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.520
Spying is an art.

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:06.040
Being able to hack human beings is an art,

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:08.280
but it's all based in a foundation of science.

01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:10.280
You still have to learn how to mix the color palette

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:11.680
and use certain brushes.

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:15.560
Do you think of that as a kind of

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.560
the study of human psychology?

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:20.520
Isn't that what a psychologist does or a psychiatrist?

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:25.520
What from this process have you learned about human nature?

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:26.680
Human nature, yeah.

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:29.760
I mean, I suppose the answer to that could be a book.

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:32.320
But it probably will be a book.

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.360
I'll save you that, yeah.

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:38.360
But is there things that are surprising about human nature?

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.480
Surprising to us civilians that you could speak to?

01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:46.800
Yes, one thing is extremely surprising about human nature,

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:48.760
which is funny,

01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:49.960
because that's not the answer I would have said.

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:52.880
So I'm glad that you clarified this specific question.

01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:55.920
The thing that's surprising about human nature

01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:59.360
is that human beings long,

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:02.800
like in their soul,

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:06.760
there's like a painful longing to be with other people.

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:08.720
And that's really surprising

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:11.400
because we all wanna pretend like we're strong.

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.080
We all wanna pretend like we're independent.

01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:18.800
We all wanna pretend like we are the masters of our destiny.

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.120
But what's truly consistent in all people

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:27.120
is this longing to commune with others like us.

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:33.160
My more practical answer about what I've learned

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.760
to be the truth is that people,

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:36.520
human nature is predictable.

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:38.920
And that predictability is what gives people

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:41.800
an incredible advantage over other people.

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.440
But that's not the surprising piece.

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:45.080
I mean, even when CIA taught me

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:47.440
that human nature is predictable, it just made sense.

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.080
I was like, oh yeah, that makes sense.

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.520
But what I never ever anticipated

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:54.080
was no matter where I've been in the world,

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:55.000
no matter who I've talked to,

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.280
no matter what socioeconomic bracket is that longing,

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.000
man, it hurts.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.520
Loneliness sucks and togetherness feels good,

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.080
even if you're together with someone you know

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:07.480
isn't the right person.

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:09.280
It still feels better than being alone.

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:11.280
I mean, that's such a deep truth you speak to

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:15.000
and I could talk about that for a long time.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.560
There is, I mean, through these conversations in general,

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.560
whether it's being recorded or not,

01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:26.920
I hunger to discover in the other person that longing.

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.000
You strip away the other things

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.240
and then you share in the longing for that connection.

01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:34.840
And I particularly also have detected that

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:40.320
in people from all walks of life,

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:45.160
including people that others might identify as evil

01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:50.160
or hard as completely cold, it's there.

01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:53.480
It's there.

01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:57.000
They've hardened themselves in their search

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.160
and who knows what dark place their brain is in,

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:03.680
their heart is in, but that longing is still there.

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:05.480
Even if it's an ember, it's there.

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:11.280
It's the reason why in World War I and World War II,

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:13.920
enemy combatants still shared cigarettes

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:17.400
on the front lines during periods of holidays

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.960
or bad weather or whatever else

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:22.880
because that human connection, man, it triumphs overall.

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:27.880
See, that's in part of what I refer to when I say love

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:31.960
because I feel like if political leaders

01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:34.720
and people in conflict at the small scale

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:39.720
and the large scale were able to tune into that longing

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:45.360
to seek in each other that basic longing

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:49.480
for human connection, a lot of problems could be solved.

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:54.480
But of course, it's difficult because it's a game of chicken

01:31:56.360 --> 01:32:00.720
is if you open yourself up to reveal that longing

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:03.760
for connection with others, people can hurt you.

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:04.920
Well, I would go a step farther

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:08.920
and I would say that taking the connection away,

01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:13.920
punishing, penalizing people by removing the connection

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.120
is a powerful tool and that's what we see.

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:20.000
That's why we send people to jail.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.320
That's why we put economic sanctions on countries.

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.240
That's why we ground our children

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:25.840
and send them to their rooms.

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.760
We are penalizing them whether we know it or not.

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:32.240
We're using punitive damage by taking away

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:36.440
that basic human connection, that longing for community.

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:40.440
What was your recruitment process and training process

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:45.440
and things you could speak to in the CIA?

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:50.000
As I was leaving the Air Force, all that was on my mind,

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.560
I don't know what you were like at 27,

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.960
but I was a total dipshit at 27.

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:57.480
I'm not much better now at 42, but.

01:32:57.480 --> 01:32:58.320
You and me both.

01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.160
Yeah.

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:00.320
Take it till you make it.

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:03.520
Yeah, but I was like, I just wanted to be anything

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:05.600
other than a military officer.

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:08.160
So I was actually in the process of applying

01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:10.920
to the Peace Corps through this thing called the internet,

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:14.560
which was still fairly rudimentary in 2007.

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:17.280
I had a computer lab that we went to

01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.800
and it had 10 computers in it.

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.080
You had to log in and log out

01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:21.520
and slow internet and everything else.

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.840
But anyways, I was filling out an online application

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:26.640
to go work in the US Peace Corps.

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:28.120
I wanted to grow my hair out,

01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:31.200
I wanted to stop wearing shoes that were shiny.

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.200
I wanted to meet a hippie chick

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:35.360
and have hippie babies in the wild

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:38.480
teaching Nigerian children how to read.

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:40.560
So that was the path I was going down.

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:43.520
And as I filled in all of my details,

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:45.440
there came this page that popped up

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:48.480
and it was this blinking red page and it said, stop here.

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:51.280
You may qualify for other government positions.

01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:54.000
If you're willing to put your application on hold

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.520
for 72 hours, that gives us a chance to get a job.

01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:59.800
That gives us a chance to reach out to you.

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:02.280
So again, 27 year old dipshit,

01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:05.080
I was like, sure, I'll put myself on hold

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.280
if I might qualify for other government opportunities.

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:09.520
And then about a day later, I got a phone call

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:13.800
from an almost unlisted number, it just said 703,

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:16.280
which was very strange to see on my flip phone at the time,

01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:18.640
just one 703 area code.

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:23.400
And I picked it up and it was a person

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:25.200
from Northern Virginia asking me

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.160
if I would be telling me that I was qualified

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.560
for a position in national security.

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.160
And if I would be interested, they'll pay for my ticket

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:35.120
and fly me up to Langley, Virginia.

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.920
They didn't say CIA, they said Langley.

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:39.320
I put one on one together and I was like,

01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:43.080
maybe this is CIA, how cool is this?

01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:45.320
Or maybe this is all make believe and this is totally fake.

01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:47.640
So either way, it doesn't hurt me at all to say yes,

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.040
they already have my phone number.

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.480
So yes, yes, yes.

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:53.160
And then I remember thinking, there's no way that happened

01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:54.800
and this isn't real.

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:57.600
And then a day later, I got a FedEx

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:00.200
or an overnight delivery of an airplane ticket

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:03.280
and a hotel reservation and a rental car reservation.

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.720
And then I just kept doing the next thing,

01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:07.920
which I found out later on is a form of control.

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:10.600
You just do the next thing that they tell you to do.

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:11.440
And then before I knew it,

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:13.920
I was interviewing in a nondescript building

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:17.160
with a person who only told me their first name

01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:19.400
for a position with the National Clandestine Service.

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:21.320
So you never really got a chance to think about it

01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:23.120
because there's a small steps along the way

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:24.640
and it kind of just leads you.

01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:29.960
And maybe your personality is such that-

01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:30.800
That's an adventure.

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:34.320
It's an adventure and because it's one step at a time,

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.440
you don't necessarily see the negative consequences

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:38.960
of the adventure you don't think about any of that.

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:41.680
You're just stepping into the adventure.

01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:43.680
And it's easy, there's no work involved.

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:44.960
Somebody else is doing all the work,

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:46.400
telling me where to be and when.

01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:48.320
It's a lot like basic training in the military.

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:50.720
Anybody who's ever been through basic training will tell you

01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:52.240
they hated the first few days.

01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:54.520
And then by the end, it was really comforting

01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.440
because you just did what you were told.

01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:57.520
They told you when to eat.

01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:59.280
They made the decision of what to eat.

01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:01.280
Then you just, you marched when they told you to march,

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.040
shined your shoes when they told you to shine your shoes.

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:06.360
Human beings love being told what to do.

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.760
What about the training process

01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:14.920
for becoming a covert CIA agent?

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:19.000
Yeah, so the interview process is-

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.360
Yeah, the interview process too.

01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:22.640
How rigorous was that?

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:23.840
It was very rigorous.

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.080
That was where it became difficult.

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.600
Everything up to the first interview was easy,

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.320
but there's three interviews.

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:32.440
And some people are lucky enough to have four or five

01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:35.480
interviews if something goes wrong or something goes awry

01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:37.640
with the first few interviews.

01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:40.000
And again, this might be dated from what I went through.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.400
But during the interview process is when they start,

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.600
they do your psychological evaluations.

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:50.600
They do personality assessments.

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.080
They do skills assessments.

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:56.640
They'll start sending you back to wherever you're living

01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:59.840
with assignments, not intel assignments,

01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:01.880
but actual homework assignments.

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:05.440
Write an essay about three parts of the world

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:08.080
that you think will be most impacted

01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:09.400
in the next three to five years,

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:12.760
or prioritize the top three strategic priorities

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:13.680
for the United States

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:17.920
and then put it into 250 words or 2,500 words

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:20.600
and whatever else double-spaced in this font,

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.560
yada, yada, yada, like super specific stuff.

01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:24.080
It's kind of stressful,

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:26.080
but it's just like going back to college again.

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:27.840
So you go through all of those acts

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:30.680
and then you submit this stuff to some PO box

01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:33.160
that doesn't have anybody that's ever gonna respond to you.

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:34.280
And then you hope.

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:36.320
You just send it into the ether

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:38.400
and you hope that you sent it right.

01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.080
You hope that you wrote well enough.

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:42.440
You hope that your assessment was right,

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:43.360
whatever else it might be.

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.680
And then eventually get another phone call that says,

01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:46.800
hey, we received your package.

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:49.480
You've been moved to the next level of interview.

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:52.080
And now we need you to go to this other nondescript building

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:53.560
in this other nondescript city.

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:55.640
And then you start meeting,

01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:59.520
you start sitting in waiting rooms

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:00.520
with other groups of people

01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:02.640
who are at the same phase of interview with you,

01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:04.520
which were some of the coolest experiences

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:05.880
that I remember still.

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.360
One of my best friends to this day,

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:08.360
who I don't get to talk to

01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:10.240
because he's still undercover,

01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:12.240
is a guy I met during those interview processes.

01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:14.960
And I was like, oh, we met and I saw what he was wearing.

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:16.800
He saw what I was wearing.

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:17.640
I was brown.

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:18.480
So you're immediately connected

01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:19.760
and you like the people there.

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:20.600
Close.

01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:22.600
More like we immediately judge each other

01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:24.080
because we're all untrained.

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:26.160
So he looked at me and he was like,

01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:27.720
brown dude with crazy hair.

01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:29.800
And I was wearing, dude, I was dressed like a total ass.

01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:32.720
I was dressed in like a clubbing shirt.

01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:33.880
I don't know why I thought it would be a good idea

01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:36.480
to go to a CIA interview in like a clubbing shirt

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:39.160
with my buttons on button down to here.

01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:40.520
And he was like, yeah, you were really...

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:42.120
After we got in, he was like,

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:43.840
yeah, dude, you were always really cool to talk to.

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:46.760
But I was like, there's no way that idiot's getting in.

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.000
And I remember looking at him and being like,

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.160
dude, you were just another white guy in a black suit.

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:52.520
They're not looking for you, but here you are.

01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:54.400
So it was just, those kinds of things were so interesting

01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:55.360
because we were totally wrong

01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:56.760
about what CIA was looking for.

01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:59.840
Until you're in, you have no idea what they're looking for.

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:02.560
And you're just shooting in the dark.

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:05.800
Did they have you do like a lie detector test?

01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:07.320
Yes, it's called a polygraph.

01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.480
Polygraph.

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:09.960
How effective, just interesting,

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.840
or our previous discussion, how effective are those?

01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:14.080
Polygraphs are really interesting.

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:15.160
So one of the things

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:17.240
that people don't understand about polygraphs

01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.440
is that polygraphs aren't meant to detect a lie.

01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:21.400
Like they're called a lie detector,

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:23.840
but they're not actually meant to detect a lie.

01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:27.280
They're built to detect variants

01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:29.680
from your physiological baseline.

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:33.360
So they're essentially meant to identify sensitivities

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.240
to certain types of questions.

01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:37.400
And then as they identify a sensitivity to a question,

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:40.600
it gives the interviewer an additional piece of information

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:43.000
to direct the next round of questions.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:43.840
So then from there,

01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:45.360
they can kind of see how sensitive you are

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:46.840
to a certain level of questions.

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:50.680
And your sensitivity could be a sign of dishonesty,

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:54.480
but it could also be a sign of vulnerability.

01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:57.320
So the interrogator themselves, the interviewer themselves,

01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:59.840
they're the one that have to make the judgment call

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:00.680
as to which one it is,

01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:03.560
which is why you might see multiple interviewers

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:05.840
over the course of multiple polygraphs.

01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:07.360
But that's really what they're all about.

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:11.240
So, I mean, outside of, they're extremely uncomfortable.

01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:13.320
Like they're mentally uncomfortable.

01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:15.720
But then there's also, you sit on a pad

01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:17.240
because the pad is supposed to be able to tell

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:18.240
like your body movements,

01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:22.160
but also like your sphincter contractions or whatever.

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:24.520
So you're sitting on this pad, you're plugged in,

01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:26.240
you're strapped in, you're tied up,

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:28.000
and it takes so much time to get in there.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.040
And then they start asking you questions,

01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:31.200
baseline questions at first,

01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:33.200
and then other questions from there.

01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:35.200
And you're just answering the best you can.

01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:36.320
And you never know what they're seeing

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:37.160
and you don't know what they're doing.

01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:39.640
And it's really hard not to get anxious of that anyways.

01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:40.480
And then-

01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:42.360
Are they the whole time monitoring the readings?

01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:45.000
Yeah, from like a big, they've got multiple screens

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.840
and they've got just, it's all information superiority.

01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:50.000
They have information superiority.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.480
You're the idiot looking away from them

01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:54.680
or looking sideways of them and trying not to move

01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:57.040
because you're afraid that if you like have gas

01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:57.920
or if you move a little bit,

01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:59.640
it's gonna vary you from your baseline.

01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:00.560
And the whole time you're worried,

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:02.400
your heart's racing and your blood pressure's increasing,

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.320
which is a variance from baseline.

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.480
So yeah, that means it's an interesting art.

01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:07.640
Or your baseline.

01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:08.480
Correct.

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:09.560
Maybe there's some people that are just chilling

01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:11.800
the whole time and that's their baseline.

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:12.920
Right, right.

01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:14.040
But that's what they're doing.

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:14.880
They're establishing a base.

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.840
I mean, I guess that means the polygraph

01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:21.840
is a skill that you develop to do it well.

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:24.360
So when people talk about beating a lie detector,

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:26.200
it's not that they're telling an effective lie.

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:27.040
That's not hard.

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:30.200
It's not hard to tell a lie to an interviewer.

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:32.280
And the interviewer doesn't care

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:34.240
if you're being honest or not honest about a topic.

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:36.800
What they're looking for is sensitivity.

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:40.720
If they see no sensitivity, that's a big sign for them.

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:43.520
That's a big sign that you're probably a pathological liar.

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:46.920
If you show sensitivity to many things,

01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:49.320
then that's a sign that you're probably an anxious person

01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:51.680
and they can still reset their baseline

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:53.720
because they can tell how your anxiety

01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:56.760
is increasing in 15 minute increments.

01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:58.560
It's a unique skill.

01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:02.040
I mean, a really good polygrapher is immensely valuable.

01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:04.200
But yeah, it's the misnomers,

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:07.240
the misconceptions about polygraphs are vast.

01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:09.560
You also mentioned personality tests.

01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:10.960
That's really interesting.

01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:14.040
So how effective are personality tests?

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:15.400
One for the hiring process,

01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:17.360
but also for understanding a human being.

01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:19.840
So personality is extremely important

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:20.840
for understanding human being.

01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:22.760
And I would say that there's a thousand different ways

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:23.640
of looking at personality.

01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:28.080
The only one that I count with any significance is the MBTI.

01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:30.520
And the MBTI is what all the leading spy agencies

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:32.440
around the world use as well.

01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.400
Well, that's kind of interesting to hear.

01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:36.520
There's been criticisms of that kind of test.

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:38.400
There have been criticisms for a long time.

01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:40.200
Yeah, and you think there's value.

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:41.360
Absolutely, absolutely.

01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:43.120
And here's, there's a few reasons why, right?

01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:45.520
So first, MBTI makes the claim

01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:48.960
that your core personality doesn't change over time.

01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:51.720
And that's how it's calibrated.

01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:53.280
And one of the big arguments is that people say

01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:55.720
that your personality can change over time.

01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:58.960
Now, what I, in my experience, the MBTI is exactly correct.

01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:01.640
Your core personality does not change

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:04.360
because your core personality is defined

01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:08.840
as your personality when all resources are removed.

01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:13.280
So essentially your emergency mode, your dire conditions,

01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:15.560
that is your core personality.

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:18.240
We can all act a little more extroverted.

01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:21.640
We can all be a little more empathetic

01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:25.000
when we have tons of time and money and patience.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.120
When you strip away all of that time, money and patience,

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.680
how empathetic are you?

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:31.280
How much do you like being around other people?

01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:33.000
How much do you like being alone?

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.080
Do you make judgments or do you analyze information?

01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:38.800
That's what's so powerful about MBTI

01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.560
is it's talking about what people are like

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:42.280
when you strip away resources.

01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:44.240
And then because it's so consistent,

01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:46.320
it's also only four codes.

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:49.720
It's super easy to be able to assess a human being

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:53.960
through a dialogue, through a series of conversations,

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:57.400
to be able to hone in with high accuracy

01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:00.600
what is there for code, four letter code.

01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:04.120
There's only 16 options and it becomes extremely valuable.

01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:06.760
Is it perfectly precise?

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:08.560
And does everybody do it the same?

01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:10.920
I mean, those things are, the answers to those are no,

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:15.200
but is it operationally useful in a short period of time?

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:18.240
That is a resoundingly powerful yes.

01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:20.320
Yeah, I just, I only know, I think the first letter

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:22.120
is introverted and extroverted, right?

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:27.160
I've taken the test before just like a crude version

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:28.760
of the test and that's the same problem

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.280
you have with IQ tests.

01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:33.200
There's the right thorough way of doing it

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:35.920
and then there's like fun internet way.

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:40.920
And do you mind sharing what your personality?

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:43.880
My type index?

01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:44.720
Yes.

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:46.840
I'm an ENTP, that's an extrovert,

01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:51.400
intuitive, perceiver, thinker.

01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:54.360
ENT, thinker, P, perceiver.

01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:59.200
My wife is an ISFJ, which is the polar opposite of me.

01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:01.280
E, I'm extroverted, she's introverted.

01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:03.000
I'm an intuitive, she's a sensor.

01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:05.880
I'm a thinker, she's a feeler.

01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:07.520
I'm a perceiver, she's a judge.

01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:09.080
Is there good science on like

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.080
long-term successful relationships

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:15.120
in terms of the dynamics of that, the 16?

01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.720
I wonder if there's good data on this.

01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:19.640
I don't think there's a lot of good data

01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:21.960
in personalities writ large

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:24.560
because there's not a lot of money to be made

01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:26.600
in personality testing.

01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:28.440
But I would say that there's,

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:32.960
that with experience,

01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:36.440
with a good MBTI test, with a good paid test,

01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:38.840
400, 500 question test,

01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:41.200
once you understand your own code

01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:44.880
and then you're taught how to assess the code of others,

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.640
with those two things kind of combined,

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:48.800
because then you have experience and learning,

01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:52.000
it becomes very useful

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.080
and you can have high confidence

01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:55.800
in the conclusions that you reach

01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:58.040
about people's professions,

01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:00.560
about people's relationships with family,

01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:02.480
about people's relationships professionally,

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:05.080
people's capabilities to deal with stress,

01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:06.840
how people will perform

01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:09.360
when pushed outside of their comfort zones.

01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:11.320
Really, really powerful, useful stuff

01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:14.120
in corporate world and in the espionage world.

01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:16.840
So in terms of compressed representation

01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:18.280
of another human being,

01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:21.960
you can't do much better than those four letters.

01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:23.240
I don't believe you can do much better.

01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:26.360
In my experience, I have not seen anything better.

01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:28.240
Yeah, it is kind of,

01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:32.080
it's difficult to realize that there is a core personality

01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:35.600
or to the degree that's true, it seems to be true.

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:38.040
It's even more difficult to realize

01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:40.920
that there is a stable,

01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:42.720
or at least the science says so,

01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:45.440
a stable, consistent intelligence.

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:51.000
Unfortunately, the G factor that they call,

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.240
that if you do a barrage of IQ tests,

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:57.040
that's going to consistently represent that G factor

01:46:57.040 --> 01:46:59.320
and we're all born with that and we can't fix it.

01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:01.880
And that defines so much of who we are.

01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:03.040
It's sad.

01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:06.280
I don't see it as sad because it's, for me,

01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:07.960
the faster you learn it,

01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:11.480
the faster you learn what your own sort of

01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:14.040
natural strengths and weaknesses are,

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:16.400
the faster you get to stop wasting time

01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:19.200
on things that you're never going to be good at

01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:21.200
and you get to double down on the things

01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:23.600
that you're already naturally skilled or interested in.

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:26.640
So there's always a silver lining to a cloud,

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:30.920
but I know now that I will never be a ballerina or a ballerino.

01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:32.200
I know that I'll never be an artist.

01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.800
I'll never be a musician.

01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:35.320
I'll never be any of those things.

01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:37.680
And when I was 18, that might've made me sad,

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:40.640
but now at 42, I'm like, well, shit, awesome.

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:42.920
I can go be something else good

01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:44.160
instead of always being bad.

01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:46.640
You're not going to be a ballerina, a ballerino.

01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.600
Because I'm not graceful.

01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:51.600
And you've learned this through years of experience.

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:52.600
Yeah, exactly.

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:55.000
Well, I don't know if there's an MBTI equivalent

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.840
for grace of movement.

01:47:56.840 --> 01:47:58.840
I think it's called S, sensor.

01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:00.040
Oh, okay. Yeah.

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:02.800
Because a sensor is someone who's able to interact

01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:03.640
with the world around them

01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:06.120
through their five senses very effectively.

01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:07.440
Like if you talk to dancers,

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:10.720
dancers can actually feel the grace in all of their muscles.

01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:13.520
They know what position their finger is in.

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:14.360
I don't have any idea.

01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:15.920
I don't know what position my feet are in right now.

01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:16.960
I'd have to look to make sure

01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:18.600
I actually feel the floor right.

01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:20.320
Yeah, I definitely have.

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:21.360
Oh, that's good to know.

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.480
So I don't, you know, I'm not a dancer,

01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:25.640
but I do have that.

01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:26.840
You're a musician, man.

01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:29.760
Like to be able to plug the guitar.

01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:30.760
Yeah, that's true.

01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.360
That there is that physical component.

01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:33.800
But I think deeper,

01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:35.880
because there's a technical aspect to that.

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:39.000
That's just like, it's less about feel,

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.280
but I do know jujitsu, you know,

01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:43.520
and grappling I've done all my life.

01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:46.600
I don't, you know, there's some people who are clumsy

01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:47.720
and they drop stuff all the time.

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:49.160
They run into stuff.

01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:51.960
I don't, first of all, I don't know how that happens,

01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:54.720
but to me, I just have an awareness of stuff.

01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:55.760
Like if there's a little-

01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:56.800
There's a spiritual orientation.

01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:00.560
Yeah, like I know that there's a small object

01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:03.800
I have to step over and I have a good sense of that.

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:04.960
It's so interesting.

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:06.480
Yeah, you're just like born with that or something.

01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:09.640
My wife is brilliant and she still walks into doors.

01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:10.480
Yeah.

01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:11.840
I mean, she'll walk in a doorway,

01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:13.360
she'll bang her knee on the same wall

01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:15.320
that's been there for the last 50 years.

01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:17.320
It's for some reason really hilarious.

01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:18.160
That's good.

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:23.400
You've been asked, I think on Reddit,

01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:26.280
are there big secrets that you know that could lend you

01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:28.320
and our country in terrible trouble

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:31.200
if you came out to the public and you answered yes,

01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:32.960
I wish I could forget them.

01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:36.720
So let me ask you just about secrecy in general.

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:39.200
Are these secrets or just other secrets,

01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:43.280
ones that the public will never know

01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:47.400
or will it come out in 10, 20, 50 years?

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:49.560
I guess the deeper question is,

01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:53.520
what is the value of secrecy and transparency?

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:56.880
The standard classification

01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:59.280
for all human intelligence operations

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:03.320
is something called 25X2, 25 by two.

01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:07.680
So 50 years, 25 years times two years or times two rounds.

01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:11.280
So in essence, anything that I've seen

01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:15.120
has the first chance of becoming public domain,

01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:17.360
declassified after 50 years,

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:19.880
unless there's some congressional requirement

01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:22.200
for it to be reviewed and assessed earlier.

01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:24.680
So by then, I'll be 80 something years old

01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:28.760
or potentially dead, which is either way.

01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:31.040
That's when it can come out

01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:34.240
according to its typical classification.

01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:39.040
The value of secrets I have seen

01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:42.840
is that secrets create space.

01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:48.520
Secrets give opportunity for security,

01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:52.080
they give opportunity for thinking, they give space.

01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:55.120
And space is an incredibly advantageous thing to have.

01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:57.080
If you know something somebody else doesn't know,

01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:59.760
even if it's just 15 or 20 minutes different,

01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:02.600
you can direct, you can change the course of faith.

01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:05.440
So I find secrets to be extremely valuable,

01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:06.560
extremely useful.

01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:10.040
Even at the place where secrets

01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:12.360
are being kept from a large mass,

01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:15.520
part of what all Americans need to understand

01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:19.280
is that one of the trade-offs

01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:23.920
to building a system of government

01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:26.120
that allows us to be first world

01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:28.480
and wealthy and secure and successful,

01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:30.680
one of the trade-offs is that we have given up

01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:32.560
a great deal of personal freedom.

01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:34.680
And one of the personal freedoms that we give up

01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:39.000
is the freedom of knowing what we wanna know.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.480
You get to know what the government tells you,

01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:43.080
you get to know what you need to know

01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:44.400
or what you've learned yourself,

01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:47.000
but you don't get to know secrets.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.720
People who do get to know secrets, know them for a reason.

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:51.840
That's why it's called a need to know.

01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:54.480
How difficult is it to maintain secrecy?

01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:58.640
It's surprisingly difficult as technology changes.

01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:00.240
It's also surprisingly difficult

01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:05.240
as our culture becomes one where people want notoriety.

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:09.480
People wanna be the person who breaks the secret.

01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:13.080
25 years ago, 40 years ago, that wasn't the case.

01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:14.360
There was a time in the United States

01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:16.640
where if someone gave you a secret,

01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:20.040
it was a point of personal honor not to share the secret.

01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:22.600
Now we're in a place where someone tells you a secret,

01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:24.920
that could turn into a Twitter post

01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:26.320
that gets you a bunch of thumbs up

01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:27.160
and a bunch of likes or whatever else.

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.080
It's an opportunity.

01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:31.160
Right, so the value of secrets has changed.

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:34.120
And now there's almost a greater value on exposing secrets

01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:36.280
than there is on keeping secrets.

01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:38.360
That makes it difficult to keep secrets,

01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:40.720
especially when technology is going in the same direction.

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:43.080
Yeah, where is the line?

01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:45.040
And by the way, I'm one of those old school people

01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:46.000
with the secrets.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:51.080
I think it's a karma thing.

01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:52.960
Again, back to the trust.

01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:54.320
I think in the short term,

01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:57.280
you can benefit by sharing a secret.

01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:00.280
But in the long term, if people know they can trust you,

01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:05.040
like the juicy of the secret, it's a test of sorts.

01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:07.880
If they know you can keep that secret,

01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:10.080
that means you're somebody that can be trusted.

01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:14.160
And I believe that not just effectiveness in this life,

01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:15.520
but happiness in this life

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:18.680
is in forming a circle of people you can trust.

01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:20.920
Right, we're taught that secrets and lies

01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:24.280
are similar in that they have a limited shelf life.

01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:26.360
If you treat them like food,

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:29.200
secrets and lies have a very limited shelf life.

01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:33.120
So if you cash in on them while they're still fresh,

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.720
you beat them before they spoil.

01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:38.080
You get to take advantage of them before they spoil.

01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:43.080
However, trust has no limit to its shelf life.

01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:46.400
So it's almost like you're trading a short-term victory

01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:48.360
and losing a long-term victory.

01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:50.560
It's always better to keep the secret.

01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:53.600
It's always better to let the lie live

01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:56.040
because it will eventually come to light

01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:57.880
from somebody else, not from you,

01:53:57.880 --> 01:53:59.800
because it already has a limited shelf life.

01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:01.520
But what you win in exchange

01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:03.600
for not being the one that cashed in on the secret

01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:05.480
is immense trust.

01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:12.520
Let me ask you about lying and trust and so on.

01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:15.600
So I don't believe I've been contacted by

01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:19.120
or interacted with the CIA, the MI6,

01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:22.760
the FSB, Mossad, or any other intelligence agency.

01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:25.560
I'm kind of offended.

01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:29.880
But would I know if I was?

01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:31.320
So from your perspective.

01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:33.400
No, you would not know if you were.

01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:35.040
For sure, you've been on their radar.

01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:36.600
Absolutely, you've got a file.

01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:38.080
You've got a dossier somewhere.

01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:39.520
Why would I be on their radar?

01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:40.600
Because you're a-

01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:42.080
Who's interesting?

01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:46.280
It's not necessarily that you are interesting

01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:48.880
to someone as a foreign asset

01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:51.640
or an intelligence collection source.

01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:54.440
But your network is extremely interesting.

01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:55.280
If some-

01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:56.120
Networks are important too.

01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:57.800
Correct, if someone had access to,

01:54:57.800 --> 01:54:59.800
if someone was able to clone your phone,

01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:02.440
every time you cross a border,

01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:04.760
you go through some sort of security.

01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:06.400
If you've ever been pulled into secondary

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:08.040
and separated from your bag,

01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:10.640
that's exactly when and how people clone computers.

01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:12.400
They clone phones.

01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:13.240
They make whatever,

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:17.280
photocopies of your old school planner,

01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:18.400
whatever it might be.

01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:23.120
But for sure, you are an intelligence target.

01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:24.840
It just may be that you're not suitable

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:28.840
to be a person who reports foreign intelligence.

01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:30.880
We've got to understand that all people

01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:33.320
are potential sources of valuable information

01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:35.600
to the national security infrastructure

01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:38.960
of our host country and any country that we visit.

01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:41.480
Someone like you with your public footprint,

01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:43.880
with your notoriety, with your educational background,

01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:46.720
with your national identifications,

01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:50.880
becomes a viable and valuable target of information.

01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:54.200
Yeah, so to speak to that,

01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:58.200
you know, I take security pretty seriously,

01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:03.200
but not to the degree that it runs my life,

01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:05.880
which I'm very careful about.

01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:07.760
That's good, I'm glad to hear that.

01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:11.800
So the moment you start to think about germs, right?

01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:14.120
Like, you start to freak out

01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:17.360
and you become sort of paralyzed by the stress of it.

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:20.240
So you have to balance those two things, you know.

01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:22.640
If you think about all the things

01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:24.000
that could hurt you in this world

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.120
and all the risk you can take is,

01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:29.080
it can overwhelm your life.

01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:32.640
That said, the cyber world is a weird world

01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:35.120
because it doesn't have the same.

01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:38.200
You know, I know not to cross the street

01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:39.320
without looking each way

01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:41.640
because there's a physical intuition about it.

01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:45.040
I'm not sure, you know, I'm a computer science guy,

01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:49.720
so I have some intuition, but the cyber world,

01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:51.600
it's really hard to build up an intuition

01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:53.280
of what is safe and not, you know.

01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:57.640
I've seen a lot of people just logging out of your devices

01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:59.720
all the time, like regularly.

01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:01.760
Just like that physical access step

01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:03.360
is a lot of people don't take.

01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:07.960
I can just like walk in into the offices of a lot of CEOs

01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:10.720
and it's like everything's wide open

01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:13.520
for physical access of those systems,

01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:16.760
which is kind of incredible for somebody,

01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:18.440
that sounds really shady, but it's not.

01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:20.400
I've written key loggers,

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:22.000
like things that record everything you type

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.480
in the mouse you move.

01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:27.680
And like, I did that for, during my PhD,

01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:30.160
I was recording everything you do on your device

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:32.240
and everything you do on your computer

01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:34.200
like people sign up to the study,

01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:37.200
they willingly do this to understand behavior.

01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:38.440
I was trying to use machine learning

01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:42.160
to identify who you are based on different biometric

01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:44.840
and behavioral things, which allows me

01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:46.560
to study human behavior and to see

01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:49.520
which is uniquely identifiable.

01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:53.120
And the goal there was to remove the need for a password.

01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:56.080
But how easy it is to write a thing

01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:58.240
that logs everything you type,

01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:01.680
I was like, wait a minute, like I can probably get

01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:04.280
a lot of people in the world to run this for me.

01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:06.720
I can then get all of their passwords.

01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:10.880
I mean, you could do so much,

01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:13.600
like I can run the entirety of the CIA from,

01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:17.680
just myself if I was, and I imagine there's a lot

01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:20.280
of really good hackers like that out there,

01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:21.400
much better than me.

01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:25.840
So I tried to prevent myself from being

01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:28.400
all the different low hanging fruit attack vectors

01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:29.480
in my life.

01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:33.120
I try to make it difficult to be that.

01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:35.680
But then I'm also aware that there's probably people

01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:37.240
that are like five steps ahead.

01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:40.440
You're doing the right thing.

01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:44.240
What I always advocate is the low hanging fruit

01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:46.800
is what keeps you from being a target of opportunity.

01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:49.960
Because you're half-assed hackers,

01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:53.280
you're lazy hackers, you're unskilled hackers,

01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:54.720
they're looking for low hanging fruit.

01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:57.240
They're looking for the person who gets the Nigeria email

01:58:57.240 --> 01:58:59.120
about how you could be getting $5 million

01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:01.160
if you just give me your bank account.

01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:02.760
That's what they're looking for.

01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:04.800
The thing that's scary is that

01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:06.400
if you're not a target of opportunity,

01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:09.200
if you become a intentional target,

01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:11.840
then there's almost nothing you can do.

01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:14.520
Because once you become an intentional target,

01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:17.840
then your security apparatus,

01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:22.840
they will create a dedicated customized way vector

01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:27.240
of attacking your specific security apparatus.

01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:30.440
Because security is always after, right?

01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:34.160
There's the leading advantage and the trailing advantage.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.320
When it comes to attacks, the leader always has the advantage

01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:40.160
because they have to create the attack

01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:42.680
before anybody else can create a way

01:59:42.680 --> 01:59:44.280
to protect against the attack.

01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:45.680
So the attack always comes first,

01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:47.080
and that means they always have the advantage.

01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:49.760
You are always stuck just leaning on,

01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:52.320
this is the best security that I know of.

01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:53.960
Meanwhile, there's always somebody

01:59:53.960 --> 01:59:55.320
who can create a way of attacking

01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:57.160
the best security out there.

01:59:58.040 --> 02:00:00.240
And once they win, they have a monopoly.

02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:01.640
They have all that time

02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:05.000
until a new defensive countermeasure is deployed.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:08.040
Yeah, I tend to think exactly as you said,

02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:10.480
that the long-hanging fruit protects against,

02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:12.680
yeah, crimes of opportunity.

02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:16.120
And then I assume that people can just hack in

02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:17.720
if they really want.

02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:19.880
Think about how much anxiety we would be able to solve

02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:22.440
if everybody just accepted that.

02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:23.960
Well, there's several things you do.

02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:26.800
First of all, to be honest,

02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:28.680
it keeps me honest.

02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:33.240
Not to be a douchebag or like not,

02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:39.240
yeah, to assume everything could be public.

02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:44.600
And so don't trade in information that could hurt people

02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:46.040
if it was made public.

02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:47.840
So I try to do that.

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:52.240
And the thing I try to make sure is I,

02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:54.600
like Home Alone style, try-

02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:55.440
Booby trap.

02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:58.960
I really would like to know if I was hacked.

02:00:58.960 --> 02:00:59.800
Right.

02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:03.360
And so I try to assume that I will be hacked

02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:05.480
and detect it.

02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:07.200
Yeah, have a tripwire or something.

02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:10.040
Yeah, a tripwire is through everything.

02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:13.440
And not paranoid tripwires, just like open door.

02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:16.920
But I think that's probably the future of life

02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:18.160
on this earth is you're going,

02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:20.680
like everybody of interest is going to be hacked.

02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:22.880
That hopefully inspires,

02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:25.040
no, this is outside of company.

02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:25.960
These are individuals.

02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:30.120
I mean, there's, of course, if you're actually operating,

02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:31.480
like I'm just a, who am I?

02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:36.160
I'm just a scientist person, podcasting person.

02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:41.160
So if I was actually running a company

02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:46.200
or was an integral part of some kind of military operation,

02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:49.560
then you probably have to have an entire team

02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:52.880
that's now doing that battle of like being,

02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:55.880
trying to be ahead of like the best hackers

02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:57.520
in the world that are attacking.

02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:00.280
But that requires a team that like full time

02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:01.800
is their focus.

02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:03.480
And then you still get in trouble.

02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:04.320
Correct, yeah.

02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:06.640
So what I've seen as the norm,

02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:09.960
well, what I've seen as the cutting edge standard

02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:13.280
for corporations and the ultra wealthy

02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:16.960
and even intelligence organizations

02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:19.360
is that we have tripwires.

02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:22.840
It's better if you can't prevent from being hacked,

02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:26.600
the next best thing is to know as soon as you get hacked

02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:28.920
because then you can essentially terminate

02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:30.480
all the information.

02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:31.560
If you know it fast enough,

02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:32.920
you can just destroy the information.

02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:34.240
This is what the ultra wealthy do.

02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:36.040
They have multiple phones.

02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:37.480
So as soon as one phone gets hacked,

02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:38.840
the tripwire goes off,

02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:40.480
the operating system is totally deleted

02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:42.000
along with all data on the phone.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.360
And a second phone is turned on

02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:47.480
with a whole new separate set of metadata.

02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:49.800
And now they, for them, there's no break in service.

02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:52.000
It's just, oh, this phone went black.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.160
It's got a warning on it that says it was hacked.

02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:55.480
So trash it because they don't care

02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:57.520
about the price of the phone, pick up the next phone

02:02:57.520 --> 02:02:58.640
and we move on.

02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:01.080
That's the best thing that you can do essentially

02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:03.920
outside of trying to out hack the hackers.

02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:06.880
And then even in your intelligence and military worlds

02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:09.520
where cyber warfare is active,

02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:11.720
the people who are aggressing

02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:16.400
are not trying to create aggression that beats security.

02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:19.200
They're trying to find aggressive techniques,

02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:21.800
offensive techniques that have no security

02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:23.200
built around them yet.

02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:25.960
Because it's too cost and time intensive

02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:28.720
to protect against what you know is coming.

02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:30.840
It's so much more efficient and cost effective

02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:32.720
to go after new vectors.

02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:34.720
So it just becomes like,

02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:38.760
it becomes almost a silly game of,

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:41.200
your neighbor gets a guard dog.

02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:43.000
So you get a bigger guard dog

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
and then your neighbor gets a fence.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.320
So you're just constantly outdoing each other.

02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:48.560
It's called the security paradigm.

02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:50.640
People just, they just one up each other

02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:53.040
because it's never worth it to just get to the same level.

02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:54.600
You're always trying to outdo each other.

02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:58.080
Yeah, and then maybe like banks have to fight that fight,

02:03:58.080 --> 02:03:59.800
but not everybody can.

02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:00.640
Right.

02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:01.480
Yeah, no.

02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:03.280
So you're saying I operated at the state of the art

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:04.120
with the tripwires.

02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:04.960
This is good to know.

02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:06.200
Absolutely, man.

02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:10.080
And also just not using anybody else's services,

02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:12.600
doing everything myself.

02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:13.960
So that's harder to figure out

02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:15.160
what the heck this person is doing.

02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:17.040
Because if I'm using somebody else's service,

02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:19.960
like I did with QNAP,

02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:24.520
I have a QNAP NAS I use for cold storage

02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:27.320
of unimportant things, but a large videos.

02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:28.360
And I don't know if you know,

02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:32.240
but QNAP is a company that does NAS storage devices

02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:34.040
and they got hacked.

02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:38.840
And everybody that didn't update as of a week ago

02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:41.600
from the point of the zero day hack,

02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:42.560
everybody got hacked.

02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:44.520
It's several thousand machines.

02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:49.520
And they asked, you can get your data back if you pay,

02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:51.560
I forget what it was,

02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:55.400
but it was about a couple thousand dollars.

02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:59.120
And QNAP can get all the data back for their customers

02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:01.080
if they pay, I think, $2 million.

02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:02.000
Wow.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.600
But that came from me relying on the systems

02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:06.480
of others for security.

02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:10.760
I assumed this company would have their security handled,

02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:13.360
but then that was a very valuable lesson to me.

02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:17.400
I now have like layers of security

02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:21.520
and also an understanding which data is really important,

02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:24.320
which is somewhat important, which is not that important

02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:26.520
and layering that all together.

02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:28.480
So just so you know, the US government,

02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:30.360
the military woke up to that exact same thing

02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:31.920
about two years ago.

02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:33.400
It's still very new.

02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:35.360
I mean, they were sourcing,

02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:37.560
take night vision goggles, for example,

02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:40.000
they were sourcing components and engineering

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.720
and blueprints for night vision goggles

02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:44.000
from three, four, five different subcontractors

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.400
all over the country,

02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:48.320
but they never asked themselves what the security status was

02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:50.640
of those self, of those subcontractors.

02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:54.800
So fast forward a few years

02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:57.880
and all of a sudden they start getting faulty components.

02:05:57.880 --> 02:06:00.040
They start having night vision goggles that don't work.

02:06:00.040 --> 02:06:02.080
They start having supply chain issues

02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:04.480
where they have to change their provider

02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:07.760
and the army doesn't know that the provider is changing.

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:09.280
I mean, this is a strategy.

02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:12.720
The idea of going through third party systems

02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:15.360
is identifying the vulnerability in the supply chain.

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:18.720
That's a savvy,

02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:23.440
offensive practice for more than just cyber hackers.

02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:26.560
Let me ask you about physical hacking.

02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:29.200
So I'm now, like I'm an introvert,

02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:31.360
so I'm paranoid about all social interaction,

02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:35.680
but how much truth is there?

02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:37.480
It's kind of a funny question.

02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:40.480
How suspicious should I be when I'm traveling in Ukraine

02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:42.040
or different parts of the world

02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:44.360
when an attractive female walks up to me

02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:46.920
and shows any kind of attention?

02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:49.920
Is that like this kind of James Bond spy movie stuff

02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:54.040
or is that kind of stuff used by intelligence agencies?

02:06:54.040 --> 02:06:55.840
I don't think it's used.

02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:56.720
It's absolutely used.

02:06:56.720 --> 02:06:59.120
It's called sex espionage.

02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:02.720
That's the term that we jokingly call it is sex espionage.

02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:05.960
But yeah, the art of attraction, appeal,

02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:11.320
the manifestation of feelings through sexual manipulation,

02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:14.280
all of that is a super powerful tool.

02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:15.720
The Chinese use it extremely well.

02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:18.000
The Russians use it extremely well.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.240
In the United States,

02:07:19.240 --> 02:07:23.080
we actively train our officers not to use it

02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:26.640
because in the end it leads to complications

02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:28.360
in how you professionally run a case.

02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:30.080
So we train our officers not to use it.

02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:33.280
However, you can't control what other people think.

02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:34.680
So if you're an attractive male

02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:36.040
or an attractive female officer

02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:40.400
and you're trying to talk to an older general

02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:43.280
who just happens to be gay or happens to be straight

02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:44.600
and is attracted to you,

02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:45.920
of course they're gonna be that much more willing

02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:48.800
to talk to an American who is also attractive.

02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:50.680
So it's hard to walk that back.

02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:51.600
In all definitions,

02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:54.320
so it could be all elements of charisma.

02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:00.920
Attractiveness in a dynamic sense of the word.

02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:02.120
So it's visual attractiveness,

02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:05.680
but the smile, the humor, the wit, the flirting,

02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:08.880
all that kind of stuff that could be used to-

02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:09.720
Correct.

02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:10.760
To the art of conversation.

02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:12.480
There's also elements of sexuality

02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:14.720
that people underestimate, right?

02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:17.200
So physical sexuality, physical attraction

02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:18.040
is the most obvious one.

02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:20.560
It's the one that everybody talks about and thinks about.

02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:23.200
But then there's also sapiosexuality,

02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:27.160
which is being sexually attracted to thoughts,

02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:28.520
to intelligence.

02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:31.160
And then you've got all the various varieties

02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:34.080
of personal preferences.

02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:36.680
Some people like people of a certain color skin,

02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:39.120
or they like big noses, they like small noses,

02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:40.760
they like big butts, they like small butts,

02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:42.240
they like tall guys, they like bald guys,

02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:43.920
whatever it might be.

02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:47.240
You can't ever predict what someone's preference is.

02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:50.960
Sexual arousal preferences are going to be.

02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:53.520
So then you end up walking into a situation

02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:56.600
where then you discover, and just imagine,

02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:01.120
imagine being an unattractive, overweight, married guy,

02:09:02.120 --> 02:09:04.760
and you're walking into an asset or a target meeting

02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:07.680
with a middle-aged female who is also not very attractive

02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:09.720
and also married, but then it turns out

02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:11.680
that that person is a sapiosexual

02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:14.560
and gets extremely turned on by intelligent conversation.

02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:16.840
That's exactly what you're there to do.

02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:20.040
Your mission is to have intelligent conversation

02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:22.280
with this person to find out if they have access to secrets.

02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:24.560
And by virtue of you carrying out your mission,

02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:26.720
they become extremely aroused and attracted to you.

02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:29.600
That is a very complicated situation.

02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:31.000
Hard to know or to trust.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.640
How do you know your wife, or how does your wife know

02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:36.120
that you're not a double agent from Russia?

02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:42.040
There's a large element of experience and time

02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.120
that goes into that.

02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:44.320
She's also trained.

02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:47.320
And I think my wife and I also-

02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:48.440
That's what you think.

02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:50.360
My wife and I also have the benefit

02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:55.360
of being recruited young and together where-

02:09:56.680 --> 02:09:58.760
So over time, you can start to figure out things

02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:00.520
that are very difficult to.

02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:03.440
So you form the baseline,

02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:04.800
you start to understand the person's very,

02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:06.120
it becomes very difficult to lie.

02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:08.360
The most difficult thing in the world is consistency.

02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:10.480
It's the most difficult thing in the world.

02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:12.920
Some people say that discipline or self-discipline,

02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:14.800
what they're really talking about is consistency.

02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:17.280
When you have someone who performs consistently

02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:20.560
over long periods of time under various levels of stress,

02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:22.000
you have high, high confidence

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.680
that that is the person that you can trust.

02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:28.000
You can trust, again, you can trust them to behave

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.240
within a certain pattern.

02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:33.200
You can trust an asshole to be an asshole

02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:36.760
without trusting the asshole to take care of your kids.

02:10:36.760 --> 02:10:40.040
So I don't ever wanna mix up the idea of personal trust

02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:42.400
versus trusting the outcome.

02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:44.560
You can always trust a person to operate

02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:45.760
within their pattern of behavior.

02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:49.360
It just takes time for you to get a consistent,

02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:50.560
to get consistent feedback

02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:52.280
as to what that baseline is for them.

02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:55.320
To form a good model, predictive model

02:10:55.320 --> 02:10:57.120
of what their behavior is going to be like.

02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:59.680
Right, and you know what's fascinating is I think

02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:02.440
the challenge is building that model quickly.

02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:05.880
So technology is one of those tools

02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:07.080
that will be able in the future

02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:10.200
to very quickly create a model of behavior

02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:13.720
because technology can pull in multiple data points

02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:15.320
in a very short period of time

02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:17.880
that the human brain simply can't pull in

02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:20.560
at the same period, at the same space, at the same speed.

02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:22.360
That's actually what I did my PhD on.

02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:23.520
That's what I did at Google

02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:26.000
is forming a good representation,

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.320
unique representation across the entire world

02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:31.240
based on the behavior of the person.

02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:34.520
The specific task there is so that you

02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:35.800
don't have to type in the password.

02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:38.120
The idea was to replace the password.

02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:40.720
But it also allows you to actually study human behavior

02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:41.720
and to think, all right,

02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:44.400
what is the unique representation of a person?

02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:48.840
How, because we have very specific patterns

02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:51.320
and a lot of humans are very similar in those patterns.

02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:52.960
What are the unique identifiers

02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:55.120
within those patterns of behavior?

02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:57.560
And I think that's, from a psychology perspective,

02:11:57.560 --> 02:11:59.080
a super fascinating question.

02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:01.000
And from a machine learning perspective,

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.320
it's something that you can,

02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:04.480
as the systems get better and better and better,

02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:07.160
and as we get more and more digital data

02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:08.320
about each individual,

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:11.760
you start to be able to do that kind of thing effectively.

02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:13.200
And it's, I mean, when I think of the fact

02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:15.000
that you could create a dossier on somebody

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:16.920
in a matter of 24 or 48 hours,

02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:21.120
if you could wire them for two days, right?

02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:22.360
Internet of things style.

02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:24.120
You put it in their underwear or whatever, right?

02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:26.440
Some chip that just reads everything.

02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:27.560
How heavy are they walking?

02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:28.960
How much time do they sleep?

02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:30.600
How many times do they open the refrigerator?

02:12:30.600 --> 02:12:32.880
When they log into their computer, how do they do it?

02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:35.320
Which hand do they use when they log in?

02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:36.880
What's their most common swipe?

02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:38.400
What's their most visited website?

02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:42.720
You could collect an enormous amount of normative data

02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:43.680
in a short period of time,

02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:47.800
where otherwise we're stuck the way that we do it now.

02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:50.760
Once or twice a week, we go out for a coffee for two hours.

02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:52.200
And two hours at a time,

02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:54.960
over the course of six, eight weeks, 12 weeks,

02:12:54.960 --> 02:12:58.000
you're coming up with a 50% assessment

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.800
on how you think this person is going to behave.

02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:02.760
Just that time savings is immense.

02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:06.320
Something you've also spoken about is private intelligence

02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:10.600
and the power and the reach and the scale

02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:12.320
and the importance of private intelligence

02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:13.480
versus government intelligence.

02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:17.000
Can you elaborate on the role of what is private intelligence

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.520
and what's the role of private intelligence

02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:22.320
in the scope of all the intelligence

02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:26.360
that is gathered and used in the United States?

02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:27.200
Yeah, absolutely.

02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:30.600
It's something that so few people know about.

02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:33.920
And it became a more mainstream topic

02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:35.800
with the Trump administration

02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:37.560
because Trump made it no secret

02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:40.320
that he was going to hire private intelligence organizations

02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:43.160
to run his intelligence operations and fund them.

02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:44.960
So that really brought it to the mainstream.

02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:46.880
But going all the way back to 9-11,

02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:48.880
going all the way back to 2001,

02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:52.000
when the 9-11 attacks happened,

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.200
there was a commission that was formed

02:13:56.200 --> 02:14:00.720
to determine the reasons that 9-11 happened.

02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:02.520
And among the lists that they determined,

02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:04.200
of course they found out that the intelligence community

02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:06.360
wasn't coordinating well with each other.

02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:08.360
There were fiefdoms and there was infighting

02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:10.360
and there wasn't good intel sharing.

02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:11.960
But more than that, they identified

02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:16.160
that we were operating at Cold War levels,

02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:19.240
even though we were living in a time when terrorism

02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:22.040
was the new biggest threat to national security.

02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:25.560
So the big recommendation coming out of the 9-11 commission

02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:27.440
was that the intelligence organizations,

02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:28.640
the intelligence community,

02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:30.760
significantly increased the presence

02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:33.080
of intelligence operators overseas

02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:36.160
and in terms of analytical capacity

02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:38.200
here in the United States.

02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:42.080
When they made that decision, it completely destroyed,

02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:44.760
it totally was incongruent

02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:46.360
with the existing hiring process

02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:48.760
because the existing hiring process for CIA or NSA

02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:51.080
is a six to nine month process.

02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:55.200
The only way they could plus up their sizes fast enough

02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:57.840
was to bypass their own hiring

02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:00.760
and instead go direct to private organizations.

02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:04.960
So naturally the government contracted with the companies

02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:07.680
that they already had secure contracts with,

02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:12.680
Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, CACI, you name it.

02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:15.360
And then over time from 2001 to now,

02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:17.520
or that started really in 2004

02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:19.840
when they started significantly increasing their private,

02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:22.920
the presence of private intelligence officers.

02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:26.560
From then until now, it's become a budgetary thing,

02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:30.240
it's become a continuity of operations thing.

02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:33.800
And now the reason Northern Virginia

02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:37.640
has become one of the wealthiest zip codes in America

02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:40.200
is because of the incredible concentration

02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:41.560
of private intelligence

02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:44.600
that is supporting CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI,

02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:46.920
and all the slew of IC partners.

02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:49.280
By the way, does Palantir play a role in this?

02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:51.200
Palantir is one of those organizations

02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:54.120
that was trying to pitch their product

02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:56.280
to an intelligence community

02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:59.920
because they have, it's a fantastic product on paper.

02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:05.320
But the challenge was the proprietary services,

02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:07.200
the proprietary systems that we current,

02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:10.880
that we used in CIA prior to Palantir

02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:13.480
continue to outperform Palantir.

02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:16.440
So just like any other business decision,

02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:18.680
if you've got homegrown systems

02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:20.240
that outperform external systems,

02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:23.440
then it's not worth it to share the internal information.

02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:24.280
Got it.

02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:29.280
So what, the close connection between Peter Thiel

02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:33.120
and Donald Trump, did that have a role to play

02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:38.120
in Donald Trump's leveraging of private intelligence

02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:40.680
versus that completely disjoint?

02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:45.560
I think that they're related, but only circumstantially

02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:46.720
because remember Donald Trump

02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:49.040
wasn't really investing in CIA.

02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:51.120
So the last thing he wanted to do

02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:54.480
was spend his network, WASTA,

02:16:54.480 --> 02:16:56.240
WASTA is a term that we call influence.

02:16:56.240 --> 02:16:58.120
It's an Arabic term for influence.

02:16:58.120 --> 02:16:59.880
Trump didn't wanna use his WASTA,

02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:03.800
putting Thiel into CIA only to lose Thiel's contract

02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:04.920
as soon as Trump loft office.

02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:06.520
So instead it was more valuable

02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:09.440
to put Peter Thiel's tool to use in private intelligence.

02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:11.360
And then of course, I think he nominated Peter Thiel

02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:15.400
to be his secretary of defense, secretary of state.

02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:16.240
At some point in time,

02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:19.120
he tried to present like presidentially appoint Peter Thiel

02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:23.120
into a position of government authority.

02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:27.720
What do you think of figures like Peter Thiel?

02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:30.880
Do they wield, and I'm sure there's figures

02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:35.280
of similar scale and reach and power

02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:37.160
in private intelligence.

02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:40.640
What do you think about their role and power

02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:44.440
in this whole like without public accountability

02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:47.240
that you would think directors of CIA perhaps have?

02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:49.920
So this is where private intelligence

02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:52.000
has both a strength and a weakness.

02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:56.160
The ultimate law overriding

02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:58.160
that's overseeing private intelligence

02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:03.160
is not government legislation.

02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:05.560
It's the law of economics.

02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:07.520
If they produce a superior product,

02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:09.320
then they will have a buyer.

02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:11.280
If they do not produce a superior product,

02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:13.440
they will not have a buyer.

02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:16.280
And that's a very simple business principle.

02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:20.800
Whereas in the current national security infrastructure,

02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:22.880
you can create a crap product,

02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:25.680
but the taxpayer dollars are always going to be spent.

02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:28.080
So it's really thrown things for a loop,

02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:29.760
especially during the Trump administration.

02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:32.240
And this is one of the things that I will always say

02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:34.680
I liked about the Trump administration.

02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:38.720
It put a big blazing bright light

02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:41.720
on all of the flaws within our system.

02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:45.680
One of those flaws being this executive power

02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:47.400
over the intelligence organizations

02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:51.520
and the lack of accountability for intelligence organizations

02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:53.040
to produce a superior product.

02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:59.040
When that light got shown down,

02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:01.600
that's when you also saw Trump start to go after,

02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:02.920
if you remember, there was a period

02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:04.680
where he was taking security clearances away

02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:06.480
from retiring officers.

02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:08.760
That became a big hot issue.

02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:11.600
That became something that people were very opposed to

02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:14.880
when they didn't realize that that process

02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:17.160
of taking security clearances away,

02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:19.960
that incentivized seasoned senior officers

02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:21.800
to stay in service.

02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:24.120
Because with private intelligence paying a premium

02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:25.320
during the Trump administration,

02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:26.960
because Trump was paying a premium

02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:29.200
to the private intelligence world,

02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:33.040
when senior officers found that it was more profitable

02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:35.560
to retire early, keep their clearance,

02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:37.240
and go work for Raytheon,

02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:41.480
Trump saw that as bypassing service to the American people.

02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:42.840
You've made a career in CIA.

02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:44.000
You've made a career in NSA.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:44.920
You should stay there.

02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:46.720
If you leave, you lose your clearance

02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:49.280
because you no longer have a need to know.

02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:52.240
He upset the apple cart with that.

02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:54.720
And unfortunately, the narrative that came out in many ways

02:19:54.720 --> 02:19:56.400
was a negative narrative against Trump,

02:19:56.400 --> 02:20:00.120
when in fact, he was actually doing quite a service

02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:01.040
to the American people,

02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:06.040
trying to take away the incentive of senior officials

02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:09.120
leaving their service in order to just profiteer

02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:10.240
in the private intelligence world.

02:20:10.240 --> 02:20:15.240
So in that way, he was kind of supporting the CIA

02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:19.880
in making sure that competent people

02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:22.800
and experienced people stay in CIA,

02:20:22.800 --> 02:20:24.000
incentivize to stay there.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:27.520
Correct, I think that there was definitely,

02:20:27.520 --> 02:20:29.040
he understood incentives.

02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:31.280
I mean, Donald Trump understands incentives.

02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:34.200
So he wasn't trying to incentivize them to stay,

02:20:34.200 --> 02:20:36.840
but I think he was also playing a safety card

02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:40.200
because he didn't want former CIA officials

02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:42.160
who were not listening to him

02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:44.160
to then move into private intel organizations

02:20:44.160 --> 02:20:45.680
that he may be hiring,

02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:47.800
only to then have them undermine him

02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:49.480
from both sides of the coin.

02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:53.200
So there was a little bit of offensive calculation

02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:54.040
in there as well.

02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:56.720
But do the dynamics and the incentives of economics

02:20:56.720 --> 02:20:57.560
that you referred to,

02:20:57.560 --> 02:21:00.120
that the private intelligence operates under,

02:21:00.120 --> 02:21:03.960
is that more or less ethical than the forces

02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:07.600
that maybe government agencies operate under?

02:21:07.600 --> 02:21:08.600
What's your intuition?

02:21:08.600 --> 02:21:11.200
Is capitalism lead?

02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:14.960
So you mentioned it leads to maximizations

02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:16.920
of efficiency and performance,

02:21:16.920 --> 02:21:20.000
but is that correlated with ethical behavior?

02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:24.080
When we're talking about such hairy activities

02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:26.200
like collection of intelligence.

02:21:26.200 --> 02:21:27.920
The question of ethics is a great question.

02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:31.680
So let me start this whole thing out by saying,

02:21:31.680 --> 02:21:36.640
CIA hires people on a spectrum

02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:40.120
of our ability to be morally flexible,

02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:41.880
ethically flexible.

02:21:41.880 --> 02:21:45.320
All people at their heart are ethically flexible.

02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:48.080
I would never punch somebody in the face, right?

02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:49.040
Some people out there would say,

02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:51.200
I would never hurt another human being.

02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:53.760
But as soon as a human being posed a direct threat

02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:56.880
to their daughter or their son or their mother,

02:21:56.880 --> 02:21:58.120
now all of a sudden they're gonna change

02:21:58.120 --> 02:22:01.560
their ethical stance in self-defense, right?

02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:02.400
But at the end of the day,

02:22:02.400 --> 02:22:05.320
it's still hurting another person.

02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:07.560
So what CIA looks for is people who are able

02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:12.560
to swing across that spectrum for lesser offenses, right?

02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:16.320
More flexibility.

02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:21.320
I do not believe that private intelligence

02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:24.520
and the laws of economics lend themselves

02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:28.520
to increased ethics or increased ethical behavior

02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:29.600
in the short term.

02:22:30.480 --> 02:22:34.080
But what ends up happening is that in the long term,

02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:37.440
in order to scale economic benefits,

02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:42.440
you are forced to act within norms of your customer base.

02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:45.840
So as the norms of that customer base

02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:48.080
dictate certain requirements,

02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:50.520
the company has to adapt to those requirements

02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:52.920
in order to continue to scale.

02:22:52.920 --> 02:22:56.920
So if a company tries to ostracize LGBTQ,

02:22:58.680 --> 02:23:02.720
or if they try to ostracize men or ostracize women,

02:23:02.720 --> 02:23:05.600
they're limiting their ability to grow economically.

02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:09.680
They have to adapt to whatever is the prevailing

02:23:09.680 --> 02:23:12.440
ethical requirement of their customer base.

02:23:12.440 --> 02:23:13.720
That's such an interesting question,

02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:15.400
because you look at big pharma

02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:17.760
and pharmaceutical companies,

02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:22.760
and they have quite a poor reputation in the public eye,

02:23:23.520 --> 02:23:27.280
and some of it, maybe much of it is deserved,

02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:29.560
at least historically speaking.

02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:31.120
And so you start to wonder,

02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:36.120
well, can intelligence agencies use some of the same technique

02:23:36.520 --> 02:23:38.920
to manipulate the public,

02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:42.920
like what they believe about those agencies

02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:45.040
in order to maximize profit as well?

02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:49.920
Sort of finding shortcuts or unethical paths

02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:54.120
that allow you to not be ultimately responsible

02:23:54.120 --> 02:23:55.040
to the customer.

02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:57.440
Absolutely, and I would go a step further

02:23:57.440 --> 02:24:01.880
to say that the covert nature of intelligence operations

02:24:02.720 --> 02:24:07.480
is really attractive when it comes to the private sector,

02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:10.120
because now they have all the same money

02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:11.960
with none of the oversight,

02:24:11.960 --> 02:24:14.360
and all they have to do is deliver.

02:24:14.360 --> 02:24:18.520
So without the oversight, what's holding you back?

02:24:18.520 --> 02:24:21.600
And in a lot of, for anybody who's ever run a business,

02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:22.800
anybody who's ever started a startup

02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:24.160
or tried to make something succeed,

02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:26.520
we all know that there come those times

02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:29.960
where you have to skirt the boundaries

02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:34.960
of propriety or morality or commitments

02:24:35.480 --> 02:24:36.920
or promises to other people,

02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:38.840
because at the end of the day,

02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:41.240
if your business fails, it's on you.

02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:45.120
So if you promise to deliver something to a client,

02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:46.280
you've got to deliver it to the client,

02:24:46.280 --> 02:24:48.560
even if that means you stay up late,

02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:51.040
or if you lie on your taxes, whatever it might be,

02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:53.520
there's a certain level of do or die.

02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:56.560
Yeah, I personally have a sort of optimistic view

02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:59.360
that ultimately the best way

02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:01.240
is to stay within ethical bounds,

02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:02.720
kind of like what you suggested.

02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:05.840
If you want to be a company that's extremely successful

02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:09.840
is win with competence, not with cheating,

02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:14.120
because cheating won't, I believe, win in the long term.

02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:20.200
But in terms of being publicly responsible

02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:25.200
to your decisions, I've already been supposed to talk

02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:27.200
to Peter Thiel twice on this podcast,

02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:28.680
and it's just been complicated.

02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:32.160
If I were to put myself into his shoes,

02:25:33.320 --> 02:25:35.440
why do podcasts?

02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:40.040
The risk is too high to be a public person at all.

02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:42.320
And so I totally understand that.

02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:47.320
At the same time, I think if you're doing things by the book

02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:53.400
and you're the best in the world at your job,

02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:56.680
then you have nothing to worry about.

02:25:56.680 --> 02:25:59.880
And you can advertise that, and you help recruit.

02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:02.800
I mean, that's the work of capitalism,

02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:07.160
is you want to advertise that this is the place

02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:10.440
where the best people in the world at this thing work.

02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:14.200
True, I think that your point of view is accurate.

02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:19.200
I would also say that the complexities

02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:21.080
of what makes somebody make a decision

02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:26.200
can only really be properly calculated with a baseline.

02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:28.360
So because there is no baseline that you or I have

02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:31.880
on Peter Thiel, it's difficult to really ascertain

02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:34.040
why he does or doesn't accept invites

02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:35.480
or why he does or doesn't appear.

02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:40.480
Well, let me ask your opinion on the NSA.

02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:45.280
And then maybe we can mention about bulk collection

02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:49.480
in general in the CIA, but let's look at some history

02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:51.200
with the NSA and Snowden.

02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:55.920
What's your opinion on the mass surveillance

02:26:55.920 --> 02:27:00.920
that is reported to have been conducted by the NSA?

02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:04.760
We talked about ethics.

02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:09.760
Are you troubled by the, from a public perception,

02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:15.040
the unethical nature of mass surveillance

02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:17.960
of especially American citizens?

02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:21.920
This is a topic that I never get tired of talking about,

02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:25.360
but it's very rare that anyone ever really agrees with me,

02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:26.200
just so you know.

02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:29.520
I see where you're, well,

02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:31.000
I think there's a nuance thing here.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:32.480
Maybe we'll find some agreement.

02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:37.480
The truth is that the American experience after 9-11

02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:40.680
is nothing like the American experience now.

02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:45.120
So all the terminology, all the talk about privacy

02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:47.160
and privacy laws and mass surveillance

02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:48.280
and all this other stuff,

02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:50.560
it was a completely different time then.

02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:52.080
And that's not to say it was an excuse

02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:55.960
because to this day, I will still say mass,

02:27:55.960 --> 02:27:58.560
mass collection, bulk collection of data

02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:02.200
that allows for an expedient identification

02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:06.600
of a threat to national security benefits all of us,

02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:09.600
but people don't understand what they want.

02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:10.480
Like people don't understand

02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:13.240
what the value of their own privacy is.

02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:14.360
First of all, the fact that people think

02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:17.600
that they have personal privacy is laughable.

02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:19.160
You have no privacy.

02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:20.640
The cell phone that you carry in your pocket,

02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:22.600
you're giving permission to those apps constantly.

02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:24.320
You're giving commercial organizations,

02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:25.640
what you and I have already said,

02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:28.760
are less tied to ethical responsibility.

02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:30.920
You're giving them permission to collect

02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:34.240
enormous amounts of private data from you all the time.

02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:37.560
And do you know what happens if AT&T or Verizon

02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:40.880
sees some nefarious activity on your account?

02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:42.160
They do nothing.

02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:44.840
They might send a note to FBI

02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:47.240
because they have to according to some checklist.

02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:49.680
But when NSA was collecting intelligence

02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:51.880
on metadata from around the United States,

02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:53.920
they were very specifically looking

02:28:53.920 --> 02:28:56.640
for terrorist threats that would harm American lives.

02:28:58.280 --> 02:29:00.520
Man, NSA can clone my phone.

02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:02.040
I will give them my children's phone.

02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:04.880
I will give them the passwords to every one of my accounts

02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:07.200
if it means that there's a likelihood

02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:10.040
that my family will be safer from a nefarious actor

02:29:10.040 --> 02:29:12.400
who's intent on hurting us.

02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:15.160
NSA doesn't care about your affair.

02:29:15.160 --> 02:29:17.240
NSA doesn't care if you're cheating on your taxes.

02:29:17.240 --> 02:29:20.960
NSA doesn't care if you talk shit about your boss

02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:22.880
or if you hate the US president.

02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:24.680
Nobody cares about that.

02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:26.160
Your intelligence community is there

02:29:26.160 --> 02:29:29.600
to find threats to national security.

02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:31.920
That's what they're there to do.

02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:35.800
What Snowden did when he outed that whole program,

02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:39.040
the fact that the court, the justice system,

02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:41.400
civilian justice system went back

02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:44.320
and essentially overruled the ruling

02:29:44.320 --> 02:29:47.040
of the intelligence courts before them

02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:51.720
just goes to show how the general mass community

02:29:51.720 --> 02:29:53.560
really shouldn't have a say

02:29:53.560 --> 02:29:55.720
in what happens in the intelligence community.

02:29:55.720 --> 02:29:56.880
They really shouldn't.

02:29:56.880 --> 02:30:00.800
You have politicians and you have the opportunity

02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:03.760
to elect people to a position and then you trust them.

02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:05.880
That's what a representative republic is.

02:30:05.880 --> 02:30:08.280
You vote the people in, you trust them to work

02:30:08.280 --> 02:30:09.120
on your behalf.

02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:11.760
They make decisions without running them by you.

02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:14.560
They make decisions that they believe

02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:16.320
are in the best interest of their constituency

02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:19.800
and that's how our form of democracy works.

02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:22.120
It worked.

02:30:22.120 --> 02:30:23.600
We were safer.

02:30:23.600 --> 02:30:25.440
Now that we don't have that information

02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:27.320
and now that there's this giant looming question

02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:28.920
of whether or not NSA is there to serve people

02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:31.280
or is collecting mass surveillance

02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:33.440
against all American people,

02:30:33.440 --> 02:30:35.640
that's not really a true accurate representation

02:30:35.640 --> 02:30:36.920
of what they were ever doing.

02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:39.360
They were looking for the needle in a haystack

02:30:39.360 --> 02:30:42.760
of the series of transactions in metadata

02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:45.600
that was going to lead to American deaths.

02:30:45.600 --> 02:30:48.960
We are now less secure because they can't do that

02:30:48.960 --> 02:30:50.800
and that bothers me.

02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:53.840
So you said a few really interesting things there.

02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:57.560
So because you are kind of an insider for a time,

02:30:57.560 --> 02:31:00.680
an insider meaning you were able to build up an intuition

02:31:00.680 --> 02:31:05.160
about the good, the bad and the ugly of these institutions,

02:31:06.040 --> 02:31:07.200
specifically the good.

02:31:07.200 --> 02:31:09.520
A lot of people don't have a good sense of the good.

02:31:09.520 --> 02:31:11.360
They know the bad and the ugly

02:31:11.360 --> 02:31:14.000
or can infer the bad and the ugly.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:18.200
You mentioned that the one little key little thing there

02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:22.040
at the end saying the NSA doesn't care

02:31:22.960 --> 02:31:25.840
about whether you hate the president or not.

02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:28.640
Now that's what people really worry about

02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:32.400
is they're not sure they can trust the government

02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:35.920
to not go into full dictatorial mode

02:31:36.880 --> 02:31:40.720
and basing your political preference, your oppositions,

02:31:40.720 --> 02:31:43.080
basically one of the essential powers,

02:31:46.120 --> 02:31:48.040
the freedom of speech in the United States

02:31:48.040 --> 02:31:49.680
is the ability to criticize your government.

02:31:49.680 --> 02:31:50.520
Exactly.

02:31:50.520 --> 02:31:53.320
And that, they worry, well,

02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:57.480
can't the government get a hold of the NSA

02:31:57.480 --> 02:31:59.720
and start to ask the basic question,

02:31:59.720 --> 02:32:02.320
well, can you give me a list of people

02:32:03.240 --> 02:32:04.080
that are criticizing the government?

02:32:04.080 --> 02:32:06.280
Think about, so let's just walk through that exact example,

02:32:06.280 --> 02:32:08.760
because this is, it's a preponderance,

02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:12.400
it's a preponderance fear, it's a ridiculous fear

02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:15.560
because you would have to tap on multiple elements

02:32:15.560 --> 02:32:16.880
of government for anything to happen.

02:32:16.880 --> 02:32:20.840
So for example, let's just say that somebody goes to the NSA

02:32:20.840 --> 02:32:22.560
and says, hey, can you give us a readout

02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:25.400
on all the people who are tweeting terrible things

02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:26.400
about the president?

02:32:26.400 --> 02:32:27.240
Okay, cool.

02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:30.240
Here's your hundred million people, whatever it is.

02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:31.400
Here's all the people saying negative things

02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:32.680
about the government.

02:32:32.680 --> 02:32:34.200
So now they have a list.

02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:35.480
What do they do next?

02:32:35.480 --> 02:32:37.100
Well, let's just make it simple.

02:32:37.100 --> 02:32:40.220
They stay with NSA and they say, surveil them even more,

02:32:40.220 --> 02:32:42.600
tap their phones, tap their computers.

02:32:42.600 --> 02:32:43.480
I wanna know even more.

02:32:43.480 --> 02:32:46.280
So then they get this preponderance of evidence.

02:32:46.280 --> 02:32:47.920
What do you do with evidence?

02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:49.920
You take it to a court.

02:32:49.920 --> 02:32:50.760
Well, guess what?

02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:53.400
No court is going to support anything that goes

02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:56.920
against the freedom of speech.

02:32:56.920 --> 02:32:58.920
So the court is not going to support

02:32:58.920 --> 02:33:01.120
what the executive is asking them to do.

02:33:01.160 --> 02:33:03.120
Even before you take somebody to court,

02:33:03.120 --> 02:33:05.280
you have to involve law enforcement.

02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:08.120
Essentially, you have to send some sort of police force

02:33:08.120 --> 02:33:11.560
to go apprehend the individual who's in question.

02:33:11.560 --> 02:33:13.600
Well, guess what doesn't meet criteria

02:33:13.600 --> 02:33:16.480
for any police force anywhere in the United States?

02:33:16.480 --> 02:33:20.840
Arresting people who say negative things

02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:21.680
about the president.

02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:25.160
Now, if somebody poses a threat to the life

02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:27.880
of a public figure or the threat to life of a politician,

02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:29.400
that's a completely different case,

02:33:29.400 --> 02:33:31.360
which means the standards of evidence are much higher

02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:32.800
for them to arrest that person.

02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:36.220
So unless you create a secret police force,

02:33:36.220 --> 02:33:38.000
then your actual public police force

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:39.320
is never gonna take action.

02:33:39.320 --> 02:33:42.760
So all these people who are afraid of this exact situation

02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:43.760
that you're outlining,

02:33:43.760 --> 02:33:46.720
they need the creation of a secret police force,

02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:48.160
the creation of a secret court

02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:50.200
that operates outside the judicial system,

02:33:50.200 --> 02:33:52.160
the creation of a secret intelligence service

02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:54.960
that operates outside of foreign intelligence collection,

02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:58.400
all so that a handful of people who don't like the president

02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:00.440
get what?

02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:04.520
Whisked away, assassinated, put in prison, who knows what?

02:34:04.520 --> 02:34:06.240
Think about the resources that would be,

02:34:06.240 --> 02:34:08.400
the amount of money and time

02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:10.920
and how hard would it be to keep that secret

02:34:10.920 --> 02:34:13.080
to have all of those things in motion?

02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:15.920
The reason it worked in Russia and Soviet Germany

02:34:15.920 --> 02:34:17.560
or Russia and communist Germany

02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:21.160
was because everybody knew there was a secret police.

02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:24.200
Everybody knew that there was a threat to work

02:34:24.200 --> 02:34:25.540
to speaking out against the government.

02:34:25.540 --> 02:34:26.880
It's completely different here.

02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:28.720
Well, so there's a lot to say.

02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:32.160
So one is yes, if I was a dictator

02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:35.440
and I wanted to, and just looking at history,

02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:38.440
let me take myself out of it,

02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:41.080
but I think one of the more effective ways

02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:43.080
is you don't need the surveillance.

02:34:43.080 --> 02:34:45.520
You can pick out a random person

02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:49.420
and in a public display, semi-public display,

02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:54.480
basically put them in jail for opposing the government,

02:34:54.480 --> 02:34:56.120
whether they oppose it or not,

02:34:56.160 --> 02:34:59.520
and the fear, that sends a message to a lot of people.

02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:02.160
That's exactly what you see happening in China.

02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:03.560
That's what you just light out.

02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:06.280
It's genius and that is the standard.

02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:07.880
You don't need the surveillance for that.

02:35:07.880 --> 02:35:09.120
Yep.

02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:12.660
But that said, if you did do the surveillance,

02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:15.480
so that's the support, the sort of,

02:35:15.480 --> 02:35:17.280
the incentives aren't aligned.

02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:18.680
It seems like a lot of work to do

02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:20.680
for the thing you could do without the surveillance.

02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:21.520
Right.

02:35:21.520 --> 02:35:25.760
But yes, the courts wouldn't,

02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:29.480
if you were to be able to get a list of people,

02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:31.560
which I think that part you could do,

02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:34.240
that oppose the government,

02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:37.000
you could do that just like you said on Twitter publicly,

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:38.600
you could make a list.

02:35:38.600 --> 02:35:41.320
And with that, you can start to,

02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:43.180
especially if you have a lot of data on those people,

02:35:43.180 --> 02:35:46.480
find ways in which they did violate the law,

02:35:46.480 --> 02:35:48.900
not because they oppose the government,

02:35:48.900 --> 02:35:50.320
but because in some other way,

02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:53.960
the parking tickets or didn't pay the taxes,

02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:55.240
that's probably a common one,

02:35:55.720 --> 02:35:57.960
or like screwed up something about the taxes.

02:35:57.960 --> 02:36:00.640
I just happen to know Russia and Ukraine,

02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:03.040
they're very good at this kind of stuff,

02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:06.440
knowing how the citizens screwed everything up

02:36:06.440 --> 02:36:08.760
because especially in those countries,

02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:11.000
everybody's breaking the law

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.140
because in a corrupt nation,

02:36:13.140 --> 02:36:15.840
you have to bend the law to operate the world.

02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:18.880
Like the number of people that pay taxes fully

02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:22.600
in those nations is just very low, if not zero.

02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:26.520
And so they then use that breaking of the law

02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:29.440
to come up with an excuse to actually put you in jail

02:36:29.440 --> 02:36:31.120
based on that.

02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:33.160
So it's possible to imagine,

02:36:33.160 --> 02:36:38.160
but yes, I think that's the ugly part of surveillance,

02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:42.000
but I do think just like you said,

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:43.600
the incentives aren't correct.

02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:47.520
Like you really don't need to get all of the secret police

02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:49.940
and all of these kinds of organizations working.

02:36:49.940 --> 02:36:53.700
If you do have a charismatic, powerful leader

02:36:53.700 --> 02:36:54.780
that built up a network

02:36:54.780 --> 02:36:57.060
that's able to control a lot of organizations

02:36:57.060 --> 02:37:01.900
to a level of authoritarianism in a government,

02:37:01.900 --> 02:37:03.860
they're just able to do the usual thing.

02:37:03.860 --> 02:37:06.820
One, have propaganda machine to tell narratives,

02:37:06.820 --> 02:37:10.900
two, pick out people that they can put in jail

02:37:10.900 --> 02:37:12.380
for opposing the state,

02:37:12.380 --> 02:37:15.060
and maybe loud members of the press

02:37:15.060 --> 02:37:16.900
start silencing the press.

02:37:16.900 --> 02:37:18.900
There's a playbook to this thing,

02:37:19.060 --> 02:37:21.180
and it doesn't require the surveillance.

02:37:21.180 --> 02:37:26.100
The surveillance, you know what is useful for the surveillance

02:37:26.100 --> 02:37:27.940
is the thing you mentioned in China,

02:37:27.940 --> 02:37:32.940
which is encourage everybody in the citizenry

02:37:34.260 --> 02:37:35.440
to watch each other,

02:37:35.440 --> 02:37:38.060
to say there's enemies of the state everywhere.

02:37:38.060 --> 02:37:40.860
And then you start having children reporting

02:37:40.860 --> 02:37:42.860
on their parents and that kind of stuff.

02:37:42.860 --> 02:37:46.060
Again, don't need a surveillance state for that.

02:37:46.060 --> 02:37:49.420
Now the good of a surveillance system,

02:37:49.420 --> 02:37:53.060
if it's operating within ethical bounds,

02:37:53.060 --> 02:37:55.580
is that yes, it could protect the populace.

02:37:55.580 --> 02:37:57.620
So you're saying like the good,

02:37:57.620 --> 02:38:01.700
given on your understanding of these institutions,

02:38:01.700 --> 02:38:03.660
the good outweighs the bad.

02:38:03.660 --> 02:38:06.100
Absolutely, so let me give you just a practical example.

02:38:06.100 --> 02:38:07.820
So people don't realize this,

02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:10.460
but there's multiple surveillance states that are out there.

02:38:10.460 --> 02:38:11.460
There are surveillance states

02:38:11.460 --> 02:38:13.620
that are close allies with the United States.

02:38:13.620 --> 02:38:14.780
One of those surveillance states

02:38:14.780 --> 02:38:18.700
is the United Arab Emirates, the UAE.

02:38:18.700 --> 02:38:23.340
Now I lived in the UAE from 2019 to 2020,

02:38:23.340 --> 02:38:27.180
came back on a repatriation flight after COVID broke out,

02:38:27.180 --> 02:38:28.220
but we were there for a full year.

02:38:28.220 --> 02:38:31.900
We were residents, we had IDs, we had everything.

02:38:31.900 --> 02:38:35.260
Now when you get your national ID in the Emirates,

02:38:35.260 --> 02:38:39.220
you get a chip and that chip connects you to everything.

02:38:39.220 --> 02:38:41.140
It connects you to cameras,

02:38:41.140 --> 02:38:44.100
it connects you to your license plate on your car,

02:38:44.100 --> 02:38:46.820
to your passport, to your credit card, everything.

02:38:46.820 --> 02:38:49.540
Everything is intertwined, everything is interlinked.

02:38:49.540 --> 02:38:51.100
When you drive, there are no police.

02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:52.580
There are no police on the roads.

02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:56.500
Every 50 to 100 meters, you cross a camera

02:38:56.500 --> 02:38:59.260
that reads your license plate, measures your speed,

02:38:59.260 --> 02:39:00.820
and if you're breaking the speed limit,

02:39:00.820 --> 02:39:02.820
it just immediately charges your credit card

02:39:02.820 --> 02:39:04.540
because it's tied, it's all tied together.

02:39:04.540 --> 02:39:05.780
Totally surveillance.

02:39:05.780 --> 02:39:08.820
That technology was invented by the Israelis

02:39:08.820 --> 02:39:10.980
who use it in Israel.

02:39:13.460 --> 02:39:17.140
I was in Abu Dhabi and I was rear-ended at high speed

02:39:17.140 --> 02:39:19.780
by what turned out to be an Emirati official,

02:39:19.780 --> 02:39:22.180
a senior ranking official of one of the Emirates.

02:39:23.300 --> 02:39:26.340
It was caught on camera, his ID was registered,

02:39:26.340 --> 02:39:28.980
my ID was registered, everything was tied back to our IDs.

02:39:28.980 --> 02:39:31.780
The proof and the evidence was crystal clear.

02:39:31.780 --> 02:39:34.660
Even still, he was Emirati, I was not.

02:39:34.660 --> 02:39:37.620
So when I went to the police station to file the complaint,

02:39:37.620 --> 02:39:39.980
it was something that nobody was comfortable with

02:39:39.980 --> 02:39:44.380
because generally speaking, Emiratis don't accept

02:39:44.380 --> 02:39:46.860
legal claims against their own from foreigners.

02:39:46.860 --> 02:39:48.820
But the difference was that I was an American

02:39:48.820 --> 02:39:50.620
and I was there on a contract supporting

02:39:50.620 --> 02:39:51.740
the Emirati government.

02:39:51.740 --> 02:39:54.660
So I had these different variances, right?

02:39:54.660 --> 02:39:59.020
Long story short, in the end, the surveillance state

02:39:59.020 --> 02:40:01.860
is what made sure that justice was played

02:40:01.860 --> 02:40:06.320
because the proof was incontrovertible.

02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:09.320
There was so much evidence collected

02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:11.360
because of the surveillance nature of their state.

02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:12.920
Now, why do they have a surveillance state?

02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:14.400
It's not for people like me.

02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:16.680
It's because they're constantly afraid

02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:21.360
of extremist terrorist activity happening inside Abu Dhabi

02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:24.240
or inside the UAE because they're under constant threat

02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:27.000
from Islam or from extremists

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:28.640
and they're under constant threat from Iran.

02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:32.080
So that's what drives the people to want a police state,

02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:33.680
to want a surveillance state.

02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:36.520
For them, their survival is paramount

02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:38.800
and they need the surveillance to have that survival.

02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:42.360
For us, we haven't tasted that level of desperation

02:40:42.360 --> 02:40:45.200
and fear yet or hopefully never,

02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:46.480
but that's what makes us feel like

02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:49.040
there's something wrong with surveillance.

02:40:49.040 --> 02:40:50.600
Surveillance is all about the purpose.

02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:52.160
It's all about the intent.

02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:55.920
Well, and like you said, companies do a significant amount

02:40:55.920 --> 02:40:58.760
of surveillance to provide us with services

02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:00.480
that we take for granted.

02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:04.240
For example, just one of the things to give props

02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:06.200
to the digital efforts

02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:08.520
of the Zelenskyi administration in Ukraine.

02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:09.760
I don't know if you're aware,

02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:12.920
but they have this digital transformation efforts

02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:15.120
where you can put, there's an,

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:20.400
it's laughable to say in the United States,

02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:22.080
but they actually did a really good job

02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:25.800
of having a government app that has your passport on it.

02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:27.160
It's all the digital information.

02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:29.000
You can get a doctor.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.160
It's like everything that you would think

02:41:31.160 --> 02:41:34.840
America would be doing, like license,

02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:36.840
all that kind of stuff, it's in an app.

02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:39.640
You could pay each other, there's payment to each other

02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:41.480
and that's all coming, I mean,

02:41:41.480 --> 02:41:42.880
there's probably contractors somehow

02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:44.200
connected to the whole thing,

02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:46.880
but that's like under the flag of government.

02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:49.360
And so that's an incredible technology

02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:53.080
and I didn't, I guess, hear anybody talk about surveillance

02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:55.040
in that context, even though it is,

02:41:55.040 --> 02:41:57.240
but they all love it and it's super easy

02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:00.760
and they, frankly already, it's so easy and convenient.

02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:02.760
They've already taken for granted that,

02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:04.480
of course this is what you do.

02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:06.720
Of course your passport is on your phone.

02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:09.200
For everybody to have housed in a server

02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:10.680
that you have no idea where it's at,

02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:13.280
that could be hacked at any time by a third party.

02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:14.760
They don't ask these kinds of questions

02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:17.760
because it's so convenient as we do for Google,

02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:25.840
Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Microsoft products we use.

02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:29.280
Security and convenience are on two opposite sides

02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:30.840
of another spectrum.

02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:33.280
The more convenient something is, the less secure

02:42:33.280 --> 02:42:36.280
and the more secure something is, the less convenient.

02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:39.720
And that's a battle that we're always working with

02:42:39.720 --> 02:42:42.080
as individuals and then we're trying to outsource

02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:44.160
that battle to our politicians and our politicians

02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:46.840
are frankly just more interested in being politicians.

02:42:46.840 --> 02:42:49.160
Yeah, that said, I mean, people are really worried

02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:54.160
about giving any one institution a large amount of power,

02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:59.840
especially when it's a federal government institution,

02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:02.000
given some history.

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:05.000
First of all, just history of the corruption

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:08.640
of power corrupting individuals and institutions.

02:43:08.640 --> 02:43:13.640
And second of all, myth or reality of certain institutions

02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:17.760
like the CIA misbehaving.

02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:20.720
Well, let me actually ask you about the Edward Snowden.

02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:25.760
So you, outside of the utility that you're arguing for

02:43:26.360 --> 02:43:29.200
of the NSA surveillance program,

02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:34.200
do you think Edward Snowden is a criminal or a hero?

02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:38.200
In terms in the eyes of the law, he's a criminal.

02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:41.160
He broke the law, he broke the confidence,

02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:43.800
he was under security obligation.

02:43:43.800 --> 02:43:45.840
And then when he ran away, he ran away to all

02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:50.040
of the worst villains in the world from the US perspective

02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:52.680
to basically seek protection.

02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:58.600
That's how you act in the face of accusation

02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:03.440
is in essence part of the case that you build for yourself.

02:44:03.440 --> 02:44:07.160
So running away to China, Russia, Cuba,

02:44:07.160 --> 02:44:09.960
there was a Latin Ecuador, I think,

02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:11.920
that just paints a very negative picture

02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:13.640
that does not suggest that you were doing anything

02:44:13.640 --> 02:44:14.760
that was ethical and upright

02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:16.240
and in favor of the American people

02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:18.080
if you're gonna run to American enemies

02:44:18.080 --> 02:44:19.520
to support yourself.

02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:22.600
So for sure, in the eyes of law, he's a criminal.

02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:26.280
In the eyes of a group of people

02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:30.960
who are largely ignorant to what they lost,

02:44:30.960 --> 02:44:32.760
to them, he's a hero.

02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:35.360
To me, he's just kind of a sad case.

02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:40.360
I personally look at Snowden as a sad, unfortunate case.

02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:45.200
His life is ruined, his family name is tarnished,

02:44:46.200 --> 02:44:50.160
he's forever going to be a desperate pawn.

02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:54.400
And that's all because of the decisions that he made

02:44:54.400 --> 02:44:55.600
and the order that he made them.

02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:57.240
I'm not sure his name is tarnished.

02:44:57.240 --> 02:45:01.600
I think the case you're making is a difficult case to make.

02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:06.600
And so I think his name represents fighting one man,

02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:11.400
it's like Tiananmen Square standing before the tank

02:45:11.400 --> 02:45:15.760
is like one man fighting the government.

02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:18.040
And I think that there is some aspect

02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:21.680
to which taking that case aside,

02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:24.760
that is the American spirit,

02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:28.960
which is hold the powerful accountable.

02:45:28.960 --> 02:45:31.400
So whenever there's somebody in power,

02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:34.640
one individual can change.

02:45:38.200 --> 02:45:39.440
One man can make a difference?

02:45:39.440 --> 02:45:40.720
Can make a difference, yeah.

02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:42.320
Very Knight Rider of you.

02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:45.280
I mean, that's the American individualism.

02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:46.720
And so he represents that.

02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:49.640
And I think there's a huge skepticism

02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:52.960
against large federal institutions.

02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:56.560
And I think if you look at the long arc of history,

02:45:56.560 --> 02:45:59.960
that actually is a forcing function for the institutions

02:45:59.960 --> 02:46:01.200
to behave their best.

02:46:02.160 --> 02:46:06.120
So basically hold them accountable.

02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:11.320
If what's nice about this is that we can agree to disagree

02:46:11.320 --> 02:46:13.720
and history will be the one that decides.

02:46:13.720 --> 02:46:18.720
But once like there's a reason that Edward Snowden

02:46:18.720 --> 02:46:23.160
needs to do something new every 16 or 18 months

02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:25.840
to remain relevant, right?

02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:28.600
Because if he didn't, he would just be forgotten

02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:30.680
because he was not a maverick

02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:32.800
who changed history for the better.

02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:37.520
He was a man who broke a law and now he's on the run.

02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:41.080
And to some people, he is a hero.

02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:42.920
To other people, he is a criminal.

02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:44.680
But to the vast majority,

02:46:44.680 --> 02:46:48.360
he's just a blip on a radar of their everyday life

02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:50.720
that really makes no difference to them at all.

02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:52.000
So actually, let's linger on that.

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.440
So just to clarify, do you think,

02:46:56.120 --> 02:46:57.680
are you making the difficult case

02:46:57.680 --> 02:47:02.240
that the NSA mass surveillance program was one ethical

02:47:02.240 --> 02:47:05.000
and two made a better world for Americans?

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:08.320
I am making the case that at the time,

02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:13.160
it was exactly what we needed to feel safe in our own homes.

02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:16.560
But what about to be safe, actually be safe?

02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:19.120
So this is what's difficult because any proof

02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:20.960
that was that they collected

02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:23.520
that actually prevented an attack from happening

02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:24.960
is proof we'll never know about.

02:47:24.960 --> 02:47:27.520
This is the really unfortunate side

02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:28.520
of intelligence operations.

02:47:28.520 --> 02:47:30.520
And I've been at the front end of this.

02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:32.240
You work your ass off.

02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:33.720
You take personal risk.

02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:35.120
You make personal sacrifice

02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:38.320
to make sure that something terrible doesn't happen.

02:47:38.320 --> 02:47:40.040
Nobody knows that that ever happened.

02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:41.640
Does that have to be that way?

02:47:41.640 --> 02:47:44.840
Does it have to remain secret

02:47:44.840 --> 02:47:49.840
every time the NSA or the CIA saves the lives of Americans?

02:47:51.040 --> 02:47:53.000
It does, for two reasons it has to be secret.

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.560
First, the mythos.

02:47:55.560 --> 02:47:58.960
The same thing we were talking about with General Petraeus.

02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:01.560
You can't brag about your victories

02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:05.280
if you want to let the myth shape itself.

02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:06.240
You can't do that.

02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:10.880
The second thing is once something is,

02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:12.880
once a victory is claimed,

02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:16.880
the danger comes from letting your enemy

02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:19.040
know that you claimed the victory

02:48:19.040 --> 02:48:20.240
because they can reverse engineer

02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:22.560
and they can start to change how they did things.

02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:24.720
If a terrorist act, if a terrorist cell

02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:27.640
tries to execute an operation and the operation fails,

02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:29.600
from their point of view, they don't know why it failed.

02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:30.800
They just know that it failed.

02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:33.240
But then if the US or if the American government

02:48:33.240 --> 02:48:37.760
comes in and says, we took apart this amazing attack,

02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:39.960
now they have more information.

02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:41.840
The whole power of secrets, like we talked about before,

02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:43.480
the power of secrets is in knowing

02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:44.680
that not everybody has them.

02:48:44.680 --> 02:48:46.680
There's only a shelf life.

02:48:46.680 --> 02:48:48.320
So take advantage of the shelf life.

02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:51.360
You get space, so you gotta keep it a secret.

02:48:51.360 --> 02:48:56.120
There is no tactical advantage from sharing a secret

02:48:56.160 --> 02:49:00.000
unless you are specifically trying to achieve

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
a certain tactical advantage from sharing that secret,

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:03.160
which is what we've seen so much of

02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:05.240
with US intel sharing with Ukraine.

02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:07.400
There's a tactical advantage from sharing a secret

02:49:07.400 --> 02:49:10.800
about Russian military movements or weaknesses in tanks

02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:14.120
or supply chain challenges, whatever it might be.

02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:16.400
Well, let me argue that there might be an advantage

02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:19.840
to share information with the American public

02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:24.840
when a terrorist attack is averted

02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:28.480
or the lives of Americans are saved.

02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:31.800
Because what that does is make every American think

02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:33.160
that they're not that safe.

02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:36.440
There is no tactical advantage there.

02:49:36.440 --> 02:49:37.280
You think so?

02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:38.120
Absolutely.

02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:44.080
If the Austin PD started telling you every day

02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:48.160
about these crazy crimes that they prevented,

02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:49.920
would that make you feel more safe?

02:49:49.920 --> 02:49:51.480
It would make you feel like they're doing their job.

02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:53.640
Is that obvious to you, make us feel less safe?

02:49:53.640 --> 02:49:55.640
Because if we see competence,

02:49:55.640 --> 02:49:59.960
that there is extremely competent defenders

02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:02.960
of this territory, of these people,

02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:05.080
wouldn't that make us feel more safe or no?

02:50:05.080 --> 02:50:08.920
The human nature is not to assign competence.

02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:13.920
So empirically, humans overvalue losses

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.160
and undervalue gains.

02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:18.480
That's something that we've seen

02:50:18.480 --> 02:50:20.520
from finance to betting and beyond.

02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:23.600
If the Austin Police Department starts telling you

02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:26.760
about all these heinous crimes that were avoided

02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:28.920
because of their hard work,

02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:30.720
the way that your brain is actually going

02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:33.560
to process that information is you are going to say,

02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:36.800
if this is all the stuff that they've stopped,

02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:39.680
how bad must this place be?

02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:41.920
How much more haven't they stopped?

02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:43.280
I take your point.

02:50:43.280 --> 02:50:45.360
It's a powerful psychological point.

02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:49.160
But looking at the other picture of it,

02:50:49.160 --> 02:50:51.600
looking at the police force, looking at the CIA,

02:50:51.600 --> 02:50:56.600
the NSA, those people, now with the police,

02:50:56.680 --> 02:51:00.040
they're seen, there's such a negative feeling

02:51:00.040 --> 02:51:03.480
amongst Americans towards these institutions.

02:51:03.480 --> 02:51:06.600
Who the hell wants to work for the CIA now

02:51:06.600 --> 02:51:07.800
and the police force?

02:51:09.280 --> 02:51:11.880
You're gonna be criticized.

02:51:14.040 --> 02:51:17.000
That's really bad for the CIA.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:18.360
It's terrible.

02:51:18.360 --> 02:51:20.720
As opposed to being seen as a hero.

02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:25.080
For example, currently, soldiers are for the most part

02:51:25.080 --> 02:51:27.480
seen as heroes that are protecting this nation.

02:51:30.240 --> 02:51:32.760
That's not the case for the CIA.

02:51:32.760 --> 02:51:35.320
Soldiers weren't seen as heroes in the Vietnam War.

02:51:36.880 --> 02:51:39.520
You've gotta remember that when you,

02:51:39.520 --> 02:51:43.600
so first of all, public service is a sacrifice.

02:51:43.600 --> 02:51:45.320
We oftentimes forget that.

02:51:45.320 --> 02:51:47.360
We start to think, oh, government jobs are cushy

02:51:47.360 --> 02:51:49.400
and they're easy, and it must be so easy

02:51:49.400 --> 02:51:50.240
to be the president,

02:51:50.240 --> 02:51:53.000
because then you're basically a celebrity overnight.

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.320
Public service is a sacrifice.

02:51:55.320 --> 02:51:56.720
It's a grind.

02:51:57.680 --> 02:52:02.680
For all of the soldiers, the submariners, the missileers,

02:52:03.280 --> 02:52:06.520
the police officers, intelligence specialists,

02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:09.040
they all know what it's like to give things up,

02:52:09.040 --> 02:52:12.640
to serve a public that can turn its opinion

02:52:12.640 --> 02:52:14.600
at any given time.

02:52:14.600 --> 02:52:16.920
And history is what defines it.

02:52:16.920 --> 02:52:18.520
The more important thing is to understand

02:52:18.520 --> 02:52:22.320
that if you want a true, open, and fair democracy,

02:52:22.320 --> 02:52:25.320
you cannot control a narrative.

02:52:25.320 --> 02:52:27.600
And starting to share all of your victories,

02:52:27.600 --> 02:52:29.480
or starting to share your biggest victories

02:52:29.480 --> 02:52:31.640
with the intent of shaping public opinion

02:52:31.640 --> 02:52:33.720
to be supportive of the police force,

02:52:33.720 --> 02:52:37.720
or supportive of CIA, or supportive of you name it,

02:52:37.720 --> 02:52:39.200
is shaping a narrative.

02:52:39.200 --> 02:52:43.280
That is intentional operational use of influence

02:52:43.280 --> 02:52:45.560
to drive public opinion.

02:52:45.560 --> 02:52:47.640
That is something nobody wants to get into.

02:52:47.640 --> 02:52:50.400
It is much more professional to be a silent sentinel,

02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:51.960
a silent servant,

02:52:51.960 --> 02:52:55.160
humbly carrying the burden of public service

02:52:55.160 --> 02:52:56.040
in the United States,

02:52:56.040 --> 02:52:59.240
where we are a fair and open democracy.

02:52:59.240 --> 02:53:00.640
Why?

02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:04.680
Why not celebrate the killing of Bin Laden?

02:53:04.680 --> 02:53:05.520
We did.

02:53:05.520 --> 02:53:06.840
The search, discovery, and the capture,

02:53:06.840 --> 02:53:08.400
and the killing of Bin Laden.

02:53:08.400 --> 02:53:11.040
Wasn't that, actually the details of that,

02:53:11.040 --> 02:53:12.560
how much of the details of that,

02:53:12.560 --> 02:53:15.440
how he was discovered, were made public.

02:53:15.440 --> 02:53:17.520
I think some of it was made public enough

02:53:18.360 --> 02:53:19.200
to make it public,

02:53:19.200 --> 02:53:20.840
but why not do that?

02:53:20.840 --> 02:53:23.240
Doesn't that make heroes out of the people

02:53:23.240 --> 02:53:25.120
that are servants?

02:53:25.120 --> 02:53:28.200
Or do people who serve,

02:53:28.200 --> 02:53:30.520
to do service for this nation,

02:53:30.520 --> 02:53:32.520
do they always have to operate

02:53:32.520 --> 02:53:35.560
in a thankless manner in the shadows?

02:53:35.560 --> 02:53:38.480
That's, I think that's a very good question.

02:53:38.480 --> 02:53:43.480
The folks who I left behind when I left CIA,

02:53:43.720 --> 02:53:47.960
as faceless, nameless heroes every day,

02:53:48.920 --> 02:53:50.120
I am grateful to them.

02:53:51.800 --> 02:53:54.560
The truth is that if you,

02:53:54.560 --> 02:53:56.760
if they were motivated by something else,

02:53:56.760 --> 02:53:58.080
they wouldn't be as good as they are

02:53:58.080 --> 02:53:59.800
at doing what they do.

02:53:59.800 --> 02:54:03.960
And I see your point about,

02:54:03.960 --> 02:54:07.040
shouldn't we be celebrating our victories?

02:54:07.040 --> 02:54:09.040
But when celebrating our victories

02:54:09.040 --> 02:54:14.040
runs the risk of informing our enemies how we operate,

02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:17.040
giving away our informational advantage,

02:54:17.040 --> 02:54:19.240
giving away our tactical battlefield advantage,

02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:22.280
and running the risk of shaping a narrative intentionally

02:54:22.280 --> 02:54:24.080
among our own American people.

02:54:24.080 --> 02:54:26.200
And now all of a sudden we're turning into

02:54:26.200 --> 02:54:29.000
exactly the thing that the American people

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:30.320
trust us not to become.

02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:34.200
Yeah, but then you operate in the secrecy,

02:54:34.200 --> 02:54:38.400
and then there's corrupt and douchebag people

02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:40.120
everywhere, so when they,

02:54:40.120 --> 02:54:43.920
even inside the CIA and criminals inside the CIA,

02:54:43.920 --> 02:54:45.920
there's criminals in all organizations,

02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:48.680
in all walks of life, human nature is such

02:54:48.680 --> 02:54:50.480
that this is always the case.

02:54:50.480 --> 02:54:53.240
Then it breeds conspiracy theories.

02:54:53.240 --> 02:54:54.760
It does.

02:54:54.760 --> 02:54:57.560
And sometimes those conspiracy theories turn out to be true,

02:54:57.560 --> 02:54:59.800
but most times they don't.

02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:02.640
That's just part of the risk of being a myth.

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:05.880
Can you speak to some of the myths?

02:55:05.880 --> 02:55:08.200
So MKUltra.

02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:09.040
So.

02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:09.880
Not a myth.

02:55:09.880 --> 02:55:10.840
Not a myth.

02:55:10.840 --> 02:55:14.560
So this is a fascinating human experimentation program

02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:17.400
undertaken by the CIA to develop procedures

02:55:17.400 --> 02:55:20.840
for using drugs like LSD to interrogate people

02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:23.960
through, let's say, psychological manipulation

02:55:23.960 --> 02:55:26.040
and maybe even torture.

02:55:26.040 --> 02:55:28.520
The scale of the program is perhaps not known.

02:55:29.520 --> 02:55:32.000
How do you make sense that this program existed?

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:33.800
Again, you've gotta look through the lens of time.

02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:35.480
You've gotta look at where we were historically

02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:36.320
at that time.

02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:38.520
There was the peak of the Cold War.

02:55:38.520 --> 02:55:41.880
Our enemies were doing the same kind of experimentation.

02:55:41.880 --> 02:55:44.280
It was essentially of another space race.

02:55:44.280 --> 02:55:49.000
What if they broke through a new weapon technology

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:50.240
faster than we did?

02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:51.680
What would that mean for the safety

02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:54.760
and security of the American people?

02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:57.400
So right decision or wrong decision,

02:55:57.400 --> 02:56:02.160
it was guided by and informed by national security priorities.

02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:06.640
So from this program that was designed to use drugs

02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:08.800
to drive interrogation and torture people

02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:12.600
was born something very productive, Operation Stargate,

02:56:12.600 --> 02:56:17.480
which was a chance to use remote viewing and metaphysics

02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:19.200
to try to collect intelligence.

02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:23.600
Now, even though in the end, the outcome of MKUltra

02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:25.480
and the outcome of Stargate were mixed,

02:56:25.480 --> 02:56:26.560
nobody really knows if they did

02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:28.440
or didn't do what they were supposed to do,

02:56:28.440 --> 02:56:31.960
we still know that to this day, there's still a demand

02:56:31.960 --> 02:56:34.040
in the US government and in CIA

02:56:34.040 --> 02:56:38.040
for people who have sensitivities to ethereal energies.

02:56:39.040 --> 02:56:40.640
By the way, is there any proof

02:56:40.640 --> 02:56:41.760
that that kind of stuff works?

02:56:41.760 --> 02:56:46.280
Or it just shows that there's interest.

02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:47.920
It shows that there's openness

02:56:47.920 --> 02:56:49.680
to consider those kinds of things,

02:56:49.680 --> 02:56:51.680
but is there any evidence that that kind of stuff works?

02:56:51.680 --> 02:56:53.600
If there's evidence, I haven't seen it.

02:56:54.800 --> 02:56:58.840
Speaking from a science-based point of view only,

02:56:58.840 --> 02:57:02.960
if energy and matter can always be exchanged,

02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:07.960
then a person who can understand and become sensitive

02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:11.480
to energy is a person who could become sensitive

02:57:11.480 --> 02:57:13.640
to what does become matter.

02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:17.400
Yeah, I mean, the basics of the physics might be there,

02:57:17.400 --> 02:57:19.960
but a lot of people probably are skeptical.

02:57:19.960 --> 02:57:21.280
I'm skeptical too, but I'm just trying to remain-

02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:23.080
But you should be open-minded, right?

02:57:23.080 --> 02:57:26.320
I mean, that's actually, you know,

02:57:26.320 --> 02:57:28.680
that's what science is about, is remain open-minded,

02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:30.560
even for the things that are long shots,

02:57:30.560 --> 02:57:31.520
because those are the things

02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:34.400
that actually define scientific revolutions.

02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:37.600
What about Operation Northwoods?

02:57:37.600 --> 02:57:41.600
It was a proposed 1962 false flag operation

02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:46.600
by the DOD and the CIA to be carried out by the CIA

02:57:46.960 --> 02:57:50.400
to commit acts of terrorism on Americans

02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:52.320
and blame them on Cuba.

02:57:52.320 --> 02:57:55.800
So JFK, the president, rejected the proposal.

02:57:55.800 --> 02:57:58.120
What do you make that this was on the table,

02:57:58.200 --> 02:57:59.440
Operation Northwoods?

02:57:59.440 --> 02:58:00.840
So it's interesting.

02:58:00.840 --> 02:58:03.000
First, I'm glad that JFK rejected it.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.520
That's a good sign.

02:58:05.520 --> 02:58:09.200
So we have to understand that good ideas

02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:11.680
are oftentimes born from bad ideas.

02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:14.280
I had a really good friend of mine

02:58:14.280 --> 02:58:17.000
who actually went on to become a pastor,

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:18.640
and he used to say all the time

02:58:18.640 --> 02:58:20.520
that he wanted all the bad ideas on the table,

02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:21.960
like, give me all your bad ideas,

02:58:21.960 --> 02:58:23.960
every time we had any kind of conversation.

02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:25.480
And I was always one of those people who was like,

02:58:25.480 --> 02:58:28.080
isn't a bad idea just a waste of time?

02:58:28.840 --> 02:58:29.680
And he was like, no,

02:58:29.680 --> 02:58:31.440
because the best ideas oftentimes come from bad ideas.

02:58:31.440 --> 02:58:35.120
So again, Cuban Missile Crisis,

02:58:35.120 --> 02:58:37.040
mass hysteria in the United States

02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:38.640
about nuclear war from Cuba,

02:58:38.640 --> 02:58:41.240
missiles blowing up American cities faster

02:58:41.240 --> 02:58:43.120
than we could even see them coming.

02:58:43.120 --> 02:58:46.040
It makes sense to me that a president would go to,

02:58:46.040 --> 02:58:48.520
especially the part of CIA,

02:58:48.520 --> 02:58:51.440
which is the Special Activities Division,

02:58:51.440 --> 02:58:52.280
it makes perfect sense to me

02:58:52.280 --> 02:58:54.040
that the president would go to a division

02:58:54.040 --> 02:58:55.320
called Special Activities,

02:58:55.320 --> 02:58:59.520
whose job it is to create crazy ideas

02:58:59.520 --> 02:59:02.440
that have presidential approval,

02:59:02.440 --> 02:59:04.560
but nobody knows they exist.

02:59:04.560 --> 02:59:07.040
So it makes sense that he would challenge a group like that

02:59:07.040 --> 02:59:09.280
to come up with any wacky idea, right?

02:59:09.280 --> 02:59:10.120
Come up with anything.

02:59:10.120 --> 02:59:11.400
Just let's start with something

02:59:11.400 --> 02:59:13.800
because we can't bring nothing to the table.

02:59:13.800 --> 02:59:15.760
We have to do something about this Cuban issue.

02:59:15.760 --> 02:59:17.720
And then that's how an operation like that

02:59:17.720 --> 02:59:19.200
could reasonably be born.

02:59:19.200 --> 02:59:20.880
Not because anybody wants to do it,

02:59:20.880 --> 02:59:22.480
but because they were tasked by the president

02:59:22.480 --> 02:59:24.800
to come up with five ideas

02:59:24.800 --> 02:59:26.520
and it was one of the ideas.

02:59:27.600 --> 02:59:29.560
That still happens to this day.

02:59:29.560 --> 02:59:31.120
The president will still come in,

02:59:31.120 --> 02:59:33.000
but he'll basically send out a notice

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:36.120
to his covert action arm and he will say,

02:59:36.120 --> 02:59:39.600
I need this and I need it on Wednesday.

02:59:39.600 --> 02:59:41.920
And people have to come back with options

02:59:41.920 --> 02:59:44.400
for the thing he asked for, a finding.

02:59:44.400 --> 02:59:46.400
He will issue a presidential finding

02:59:46.400 --> 02:59:48.600
and then his covert action arms have to come back and say,

02:59:48.600 --> 02:59:49.840
here's how we would do this

02:59:49.840 --> 02:59:51.640
and hide the hands of the Americans.

02:59:52.640 --> 02:59:55.520
How gangster was it of JFK to reject it though?

02:59:55.520 --> 02:59:56.520
It was baller, right?

02:59:57.480 --> 03:00:00.040
That's like, that is a mic drop right there.

03:00:00.040 --> 03:00:01.520
Nope, not doing that.

03:00:01.520 --> 03:00:02.360
Yep, doing that.

03:00:03.680 --> 03:00:07.440
A thing that crosses an ethical line,

03:00:07.440 --> 03:00:10.880
even in a time where the human,

03:00:10.880 --> 03:00:13.640
the entirety of human civilization hangs in a balance,

03:00:13.640 --> 03:00:16.160
still forfeit that power.

03:00:16.160 --> 03:00:20.560
That's a beautiful thing about the American experiment

03:00:20.560 --> 03:00:22.520
that's a few times throughout the history

03:00:22.520 --> 03:00:23.800
that this happened,

03:00:23.800 --> 03:00:26.960
including with our first president, George Washington.

03:00:28.120 --> 03:00:30.200
Well, let me ask about JFK.

03:00:31.720 --> 03:00:36.160
25 times two and they still keep that stuff classified.

03:00:37.600 --> 03:00:42.600
So do you think the CIA had a hand

03:00:42.840 --> 03:00:45.640
in the assassination of JFK?

03:00:45.640 --> 03:00:50.520
I cannot imagine in any reasonable point of view

03:00:51.520 --> 03:00:53.560
that the organization of CIA had anything to do

03:00:53.560 --> 03:00:55.080
with the assassination of JFK.

03:00:55.080 --> 03:00:59.440
So it's not possible to infiltrate the CIA,

03:00:59.440 --> 03:01:02.040
a small part of the CIA,

03:01:02.040 --> 03:01:07.040
in order to attain political or criminal gains

03:01:09.360 --> 03:01:10.840
or financial.

03:01:10.840 --> 03:01:14.000
Yeah, absolutely it's possible to infiltrate CIA.

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:17.680
There's a long history of foreign intelligence services

03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:19.200
infiltrating CIA,

03:01:19.200 --> 03:01:23.480
from Aldrich Ames to Jerry Lee recently with China.

03:01:23.480 --> 03:01:25.720
So we know CIA can be infiltrated.

03:01:27.480 --> 03:01:29.000
Even if they are infiltrated

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:34.000
and even if that interlocutor executes on their own agenda

03:01:35.360 --> 03:01:39.480
or the agenda as directed by their foreign adversary,

03:01:39.480 --> 03:01:41.000
their foreign handler,

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:45.120
that's different than organizational support for an event.

03:01:45.120 --> 03:01:47.760
So I do think it's possible

03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:49.880
they could have been infiltrated at the time especially.

03:01:49.880 --> 03:01:54.440
It was a major priority for the Cubans and the Russians

03:01:54.440 --> 03:01:58.560
to infiltrate some aspect of US intelligence.

03:01:58.560 --> 03:02:03.480
Multiple moles were caught in the years following.

03:02:03.480 --> 03:02:05.560
So it's not surprising

03:02:05.560 --> 03:02:07.320
that there would be a priority for that.

03:02:07.320 --> 03:02:09.520
But to say that the organization of CIA

03:02:09.520 --> 03:02:11.640
was somehow in cahoots

03:02:11.640 --> 03:02:15.200
with to independently assassinate their own executive,

03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:16.760
that's a significant stretch.

03:02:16.760 --> 03:02:18.760
I've seen no evidence to support that.

03:02:18.760 --> 03:02:21.560
And it goes contrary to everything I learned

03:02:21.560 --> 03:02:22.720
from my time at CIA.

03:02:24.640 --> 03:02:26.200
Well, let me ask you,

03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:29.920
do you think CIA played a part in enabling drug cartels

03:02:29.920 --> 03:02:31.320
and drug trafficking,

03:02:31.320 --> 03:02:36.320
which is another big kind of shadow that hangs over the CIA?

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:39.360
At the beginning of the drug war,

03:02:39.360 --> 03:02:41.120
I would imagine the answer is yes.

03:02:42.400 --> 03:02:45.280
CIA has its own counter-narcotics division,

03:02:45.280 --> 03:02:47.720
a division that's dedicated to fighting

03:02:47.720 --> 03:02:49.520
and preventing narcotics

03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:51.400
from coming into the United States.

03:02:51.400 --> 03:02:53.480
So when you paint a picture for me,

03:02:53.480 --> 03:02:55.320
like do you think the CIA was complicit

03:02:55.320 --> 03:02:59.160
in helping drug trafficking or drug use?

03:02:59.960 --> 03:03:03.400
When I say yes, my exception is I don't think they did that

03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:05.680
for Americans inside the United States.

03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:07.760
If the CIA can basically set it up

03:03:07.760 --> 03:03:10.520
so that two different drug cartels shoot each other

03:03:10.520 --> 03:03:15.520
by assisting in the transaction of a sale to a third country

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.160
and then leaking that that sale happened

03:03:20.160 --> 03:03:21.720
to a competing cartel,

03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:23.880
that's just letting cartels do what they do.

03:03:23.880 --> 03:03:25.680
That's them doing the dirty work for us.

03:03:25.680 --> 03:03:27.240
So especially at the beginning of the drug war,

03:03:27.240 --> 03:03:28.720
I think there was tons of space,

03:03:28.720 --> 03:03:31.160
lots of room for CIA to get involved

03:03:31.160 --> 03:03:33.800
in the economics of drugs

03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:35.440
and then let the inevitable happen.

03:03:35.440 --> 03:03:36.920
And that was way more efficient,

03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:40.880
way more productive than us trying to send our own troops

03:03:40.880 --> 03:03:44.000
in to kill a bunch of cartel warlords.

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:45.320
So that makes a ton of sense to me.

03:03:45.320 --> 03:03:47.360
It just seems efficient, it seems very practical.

03:03:47.360 --> 03:03:49.520
I do not believe that CIA would like,

03:03:49.520 --> 03:03:50.920
I don't think all the accusations out there

03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:53.640
about how they would buy drugs and sell drugs

03:03:53.640 --> 03:03:55.280
and somehow make money on the side from it.

03:03:55.280 --> 03:03:56.880
That's not how it works.

03:03:56.880 --> 03:03:59.680
So do you think there's on that point

03:03:59.680 --> 03:04:04.120
a connection between Barry Seale, the great governor

03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:05.760
and then President Bill Clinton,

03:04:05.800 --> 03:04:08.680
Oliver North and Vice President, former CIA Director,

03:04:08.680 --> 03:04:11.800
George H.W. Bush and a little town

03:04:11.800 --> 03:04:14.920
with a little airport called Mina, Arkansas?

03:04:14.920 --> 03:04:17.120
So I am out of my element now.

03:04:17.120 --> 03:04:19.840
This is one I haven't heard many details about.

03:04:19.840 --> 03:04:24.840
Okay, so your sense is any of the drug trafficking

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:28.880
has to do with criminal operations

03:04:28.880 --> 03:04:30.800
outside of the United States and the CIA

03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:35.280
just leveraging that to achieve its ends,

03:04:35.280 --> 03:04:37.520
but nothing to do with American citizens

03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:39.840
and American politicians.

03:04:39.840 --> 03:04:43.280
With American citizens, again, speaking organizationally.

03:04:43.280 --> 03:04:45.640
So that would be my sense, yes.

03:04:47.240 --> 03:04:50.480
Let me ask you about, so back to Operation Northwoods,

03:04:50.480 --> 03:04:55.560
because it's such a powerful tool,

03:04:55.560 --> 03:04:59.960
sadly powerful tool used by dictators throughout history,

03:04:59.960 --> 03:05:01.920
the false flag operation.

03:05:02.040 --> 03:05:06.040
So I think there's, and you said the terrorist attacks

03:05:06.040 --> 03:05:11.040
in 9-11 were, it changed a lot for us,

03:05:12.200 --> 03:05:15.200
for the United States, for Americans.

03:05:15.200 --> 03:05:16.760
It changed the way we see the world,

03:05:16.760 --> 03:05:19.000
it woke us up to the harshness of the world.

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.920
I think there's, to my eyes at least,

03:05:21.920 --> 03:05:24.160
there's nothing that shows evidence

03:05:24.160 --> 03:05:27.200
that 9-11 was a quote, inside job.

03:05:27.600 --> 03:05:32.600
But is the CIA or the intelligence agencies

03:05:33.640 --> 03:05:37.600
or the US government capable of something like that?

03:05:37.600 --> 03:05:39.600
I mean, that's the question.

03:05:39.600 --> 03:05:42.640
So there's a bunch of shadiness

03:05:42.640 --> 03:05:46.120
about how it was reported on, I just can't.

03:05:46.120 --> 03:05:48.120
That's the thing I struggle with.

03:05:50.280 --> 03:05:53.520
While there's no evidence that there was an inside job,

03:05:53.520 --> 03:05:55.800
it just doesn't make sense to me.

03:05:55.920 --> 03:05:59.320
Inside job, it raises the question to me,

03:05:59.320 --> 03:06:02.960
well, could something like this be an inside job?

03:06:02.960 --> 03:06:06.600
Because it sure as heck, now looking back 20 years,

03:06:06.600 --> 03:06:09.480
the amount of money that was spent on these wars,

03:06:09.480 --> 03:06:12.080
the military industrial complex,

03:06:12.080 --> 03:06:14.160
the amount of interest in terms of power

03:06:14.160 --> 03:06:15.360
and money involved,

03:06:17.600 --> 03:06:22.600
organizationally, can something like that happen?

03:06:22.600 --> 03:06:26.080
You know Occam's razor, so the Harem's razor,

03:06:26.080 --> 03:06:29.920
is that you can never prescribe to conspiracy

03:06:29.920 --> 03:06:34.080
what could be explained through incompetence, right?

03:06:34.080 --> 03:06:37.320
That is one of, those are two fundamental guidelines

03:06:37.320 --> 03:06:38.880
that we follow all the time, right?

03:06:38.880 --> 03:06:40.720
The simplest answer is oftentimes the best

03:06:40.720 --> 03:06:43.320
and never prescribe to conspiracy

03:06:43.320 --> 03:06:45.160
what can be explained through incompetence.

03:06:45.160 --> 03:06:47.560
Can you elaborate what you mean by we?

03:06:47.560 --> 03:06:48.920
We as human beings?

03:06:48.920 --> 03:06:50.880
As intelligence professionals.

03:06:51.160 --> 03:06:55.160
You think there's a deep truth to that second razor?

03:06:55.160 --> 03:06:57.680
There is more than a deep truth.

03:06:57.680 --> 03:07:01.960
There's ages of experience for me and for others.

03:07:01.960 --> 03:07:04.640
So in general, people are incompetent.

03:07:04.640 --> 03:07:09.080
If left to their own means, they're more incompetent

03:07:09.080 --> 03:07:13.760
than they are malevolent at a large organizational scale.

03:07:13.760 --> 03:07:17.400
People are more incompetent of executing a conspiracy

03:07:18.160 --> 03:07:22.440
than they are of competently, yeah,

03:07:22.440 --> 03:07:25.160
than they are of competently executing a conspiracy.

03:07:25.160 --> 03:07:28.680
That's really what it means is that it's so difficult

03:07:28.680 --> 03:07:30.800
to carry out a complex lie

03:07:30.800 --> 03:07:33.240
that most people don't have the competency to do it.

03:07:33.240 --> 03:07:36.360
So it doesn't make any sense to lead thinking of conspiracy.

03:07:36.360 --> 03:07:40.240
It makes more sense to lead assuming incompetence.

03:07:40.240 --> 03:07:41.880
When you look at all of the outcomes,

03:07:41.880 --> 03:07:45.080
all the findings from 9-11, it speaks to incompetence.

03:07:45.080 --> 03:07:48.840
It speaks brashly and openly to incompetence

03:07:48.840 --> 03:07:50.960
and nobody likes talking about it.

03:07:50.960 --> 03:07:53.760
FBI and CIA to this day hate hearing about it.

03:07:53.760 --> 03:07:56.280
The 9-11 commission is gonna go down in history

03:07:56.280 --> 03:07:58.680
as this painful example of the incompetence

03:07:58.680 --> 03:08:01.000
of the American intelligence community.

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:02.880
And it's going to come back again and again.

03:08:02.880 --> 03:08:04.160
Every time there's an intel flap,

03:08:04.160 --> 03:08:06.760
it's gonna come back again and again.

03:08:06.760 --> 03:08:08.640
What are you seeing even right now?

03:08:08.640 --> 03:08:12.120
We miss the US intelligence infrastructure,

03:08:12.120 --> 03:08:16.400
misjudged Afghanistan, misjudged Hong Kong,

03:08:16.400 --> 03:08:20.160
misjudged Ukraine's and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

03:08:20.160 --> 03:08:22.760
Those were three massive misjudgments in a few years.

03:08:24.440 --> 03:08:26.040
That's meek. It's just embarrassing.

03:08:26.040 --> 03:08:27.360
It's just embarrassing.

03:08:27.360 --> 03:08:28.200
Exactly right.

03:08:28.200 --> 03:08:33.200
So all the sort of cover up looking things around 9-11

03:08:33.400 --> 03:08:36.560
is just people being embarrassed by their failures.

03:08:36.560 --> 03:08:39.240
If they're taking steps to cover anything up,

03:08:39.280 --> 03:08:41.880
it's just their own,

03:08:41.880 --> 03:08:44.960
it's a painful reminder of their lack of competency

03:08:44.960 --> 03:08:46.200
at the time.

03:08:46.200 --> 03:08:48.720
Now, I understand that conspiracy theorists

03:08:48.720 --> 03:08:51.920
want to take inklings of information

03:08:51.920 --> 03:08:55.800
and put them together in a way that is the most damning,

03:08:55.800 --> 03:08:59.280
but that goes back to our point about overvaluing losses

03:08:59.280 --> 03:09:00.840
and undervaluing gains.

03:09:00.840 --> 03:09:02.880
It's just predictable human behavior.

03:09:04.200 --> 03:09:07.120
Let me ask you about this because it comes up often.

03:09:07.960 --> 03:09:10.400
So I'm from MIT and there's a guy

03:09:10.400 --> 03:09:12.640
by the name of Jeffrey Epstein

03:09:12.640 --> 03:09:15.000
that still troubles me to this day

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:17.480
that some of the people I respect

03:09:17.480 --> 03:09:20.840
were interacted with this individual

03:09:20.840 --> 03:09:23.840
and fell into his influence.

03:09:27.760 --> 03:09:31.960
Charm, charisma, whatever the hell he used

03:09:31.960 --> 03:09:36.960
to delude these people, he did so successfully.

03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.200
I'm very open-minded about this thing.

03:09:39.200 --> 03:09:40.440
I would love to learn more,

03:09:40.440 --> 03:09:42.640
but a lot of people tell me,

03:09:42.640 --> 03:09:44.680
a lot of people I respect,

03:09:44.680 --> 03:09:47.920
that there's intelligence agencies behind this individual.

03:09:47.920 --> 03:09:50.280
So they were using Jeffrey Epstein

03:09:50.280 --> 03:09:54.160
for getting access to powerful people

03:09:54.160 --> 03:09:57.360
and then to control and manipulate those powerful people.

03:09:57.360 --> 03:10:01.560
The CIA, I believe, is not brought up as often as Mossad.

03:10:01.560 --> 03:10:04.400
And so this goes back to the original aspect

03:10:04.440 --> 03:10:06.160
of our conversation is how much

03:10:06.160 --> 03:10:09.600
each individual intelligence agency is willing to go

03:10:09.600 --> 03:10:13.520
to control, to manipulate, to achieve its means.

03:10:13.520 --> 03:10:16.960
Do you think there is, can you educate me if,

03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:21.400
obviously you don't know, but you can bet

03:10:21.400 --> 03:10:24.000
what are the chances the intelligence agencies

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:26.840
are involved with the character of Jeffrey Epstein?

03:10:26.840 --> 03:10:29.360
In some way, shape, or form with the character of Epstein,

03:10:29.360 --> 03:10:31.640
it's 100% guaranteed

03:10:31.640 --> 03:10:34.640
that some intelligence organization was involved.

03:10:34.640 --> 03:10:36.360
But let's talk about why.

03:10:36.360 --> 03:10:37.800
Let's talk about why, okay?

03:10:38.640 --> 03:10:41.000
There's multiple types of intelligence assets.

03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:43.440
Just like we were talking earlier,

03:10:43.440 --> 03:10:47.240
there's foreign intelligence reporting assets,

03:10:47.240 --> 03:10:50.080
there's access agents,

03:10:50.080 --> 03:10:51.960
and then there's agents of influence.

03:10:51.960 --> 03:10:54.960
Three different categories of intelligence, right?

03:10:54.960 --> 03:10:58.240
One is when you talk about foreign intelligence reporters,

03:10:58.240 --> 03:10:59.760
these are people who have access to secrets

03:10:59.760 --> 03:11:02.000
and their job is to give you their secrets

03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:04.600
in exchange for gold or money or alcohol or prostitution

03:11:04.600 --> 03:11:05.440
or whatever else, right?

03:11:05.440 --> 03:11:07.080
Their job is to give you secrets

03:11:07.080 --> 03:11:09.120
and then you pay them for the secrets.

03:11:09.120 --> 03:11:13.440
Access agents, their job is to give you physical access

03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:17.640
or digital access to something of interest to you.

03:11:17.640 --> 03:11:19.840
So maybe they're the ones that open a door

03:11:19.840 --> 03:11:21.320
that should have been locked and let you come in

03:11:21.320 --> 03:11:23.080
and stick your thumb drive in the computer.

03:11:23.080 --> 03:11:25.560
Or maybe they're the ones that share a phone number

03:11:25.560 --> 03:11:27.480
with somebody and then they're just like,

03:11:27.480 --> 03:11:29.080
just don't tell them you got the phone number from me.

03:11:29.080 --> 03:11:31.200
Their job is to give you access.

03:11:31.200 --> 03:11:33.600
Then you have these agents of influence.

03:11:33.600 --> 03:11:38.600
An agent of influence's job is to be part of your effort

03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:42.760
to influence the outcomes in some way

03:11:42.760 --> 03:11:46.120
that benefits your intelligence requirements, right?

03:11:46.120 --> 03:11:48.440
Of these three types of people,

03:11:48.440 --> 03:11:52.840
the least scrupulous and the most shady

03:11:52.840 --> 03:11:54.760
is your agent of influence

03:11:54.760 --> 03:11:55.880
because your agent of influence

03:11:55.880 --> 03:11:57.480
understands exactly what they're doing.

03:11:57.480 --> 03:11:59.840
They know they're working with one guy

03:11:59.840 --> 03:12:02.360
and they know they're using the influence

03:12:02.360 --> 03:12:04.280
to manipulate some other guy.

03:12:05.320 --> 03:12:07.320
When it comes to powerful people,

03:12:07.320 --> 03:12:09.560
especially wealthy, powerful people,

03:12:10.920 --> 03:12:14.120
the only thing that interests them is power.

03:12:14.120 --> 03:12:16.400
Money is not a challenge anymore.

03:12:16.400 --> 03:12:19.480
Prestige, notoriety, none of those things are a challenge.

03:12:19.480 --> 03:12:21.360
The rest of us, we're busy trying to make money.

03:12:21.360 --> 03:12:23.120
We're busy trying to build a reputation.

03:12:23.120 --> 03:12:25.680
We're busy trying to build a career, keep a family afloat.

03:12:25.680 --> 03:12:27.400
At the highest levels, they're bored.

03:12:28.320 --> 03:12:29.160
They don't need any of that.

03:12:29.160 --> 03:12:30.440
The only thing that they care about

03:12:30.440 --> 03:12:32.360
is being able to wield power.

03:12:32.360 --> 03:12:35.640
So a character like Jeffrey Epstein

03:12:35.640 --> 03:12:39.680
is exactly the kind of character that the Chinese would want,

03:12:39.680 --> 03:12:42.360
the Russians would want, Mossad would want,

03:12:42.360 --> 03:12:44.000
the French would want.

03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:47.640
It's too easy because the man had access

03:12:47.640 --> 03:12:52.160
to a wide range of American influential people

03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:54.360
for corporate espionage uses,

03:12:54.400 --> 03:12:56.920
for economic espionage uses,

03:12:56.920 --> 03:12:59.440
for national security espionage uses.

03:12:59.440 --> 03:13:01.400
It doesn't make any sense

03:13:01.400 --> 03:13:03.640
that a person like that wouldn't be targeted.

03:13:03.640 --> 03:13:04.600
It doesn't.

03:13:04.600 --> 03:13:06.040
So the question is.

03:13:06.040 --> 03:13:07.520
Who?

03:13:07.520 --> 03:13:12.520
Who and whether, I think the really important distinction

03:13:14.400 --> 03:13:18.200
here is was this person, was Jeffrey Epstein created

03:13:18.200 --> 03:13:21.680
or once he's achieved and built his network,

03:13:21.680 --> 03:13:23.600
was he then infiltrated?

03:13:23.680 --> 03:13:26.840
And that's a really sort of important difference.

03:13:26.840 --> 03:13:29.560
Like at which stage do you connect a person like that?

03:13:29.560 --> 03:13:32.320
You start to notice maybe they're effective

03:13:32.320 --> 03:13:36.120
at building a network and then you start making,

03:13:36.120 --> 03:13:39.120
building a relationship to where at some point

03:13:39.120 --> 03:13:41.080
it's a job, they're working for you.

03:13:41.080 --> 03:13:43.880
Or do you literally create a person like that?

03:13:43.880 --> 03:13:45.800
Yeah, so intelligence organizations

03:13:45.800 --> 03:13:47.200
have different strategies here.

03:13:47.200 --> 03:13:49.840
In the United States, we never create.

03:13:49.840 --> 03:13:53.400
We don't have a budget cycle that allows us to create.

03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:57.200
The maximum budget cycle in the United States is five years.

03:13:57.200 --> 03:14:00.560
So even if we were to try to invest in some seed operation

03:14:00.560 --> 03:14:03.160
or create some character of influence,

03:14:03.160 --> 03:14:06.160
essentially every year you have to justify

03:14:06.160 --> 03:14:07.760
why you're spending budget.

03:14:07.760 --> 03:14:10.160
And that becomes very difficult in a democracy like ours.

03:14:10.160 --> 03:14:13.840
However, Russia and China are extremely adept

03:14:13.840 --> 03:14:17.280
at seed operations, long-term operations.

03:14:17.280 --> 03:14:20.960
They are willing to invest and develop

03:14:21.360 --> 03:14:26.360
and create an agent that serves their purposes.

03:14:26.480 --> 03:14:31.000
Now, to create someone from scratch like Jeffrey Epstein,

03:14:31.960 --> 03:14:34.120
the probabilities are extremely low.

03:14:34.120 --> 03:14:35.040
They would have had to start

03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:37.320
with like a thousand different targets

03:14:37.320 --> 03:14:39.360
and try to grow a thousand different,

03:14:39.360 --> 03:14:41.160
if you will, influencers,

03:14:41.160 --> 03:14:42.680
and then hope that one of them hits

03:14:42.680 --> 03:14:44.600
kind of like a venture capital firm, right?

03:14:44.600 --> 03:14:47.040
Invest in many, hope that a few hit.

03:14:47.040 --> 03:14:51.320
More likely, they observed him at some point

03:14:51.320 --> 03:14:53.360
in his own natural rise.

03:14:53.360 --> 03:14:55.520
They identified his personal vulnerability,

03:14:55.520 --> 03:14:57.600
very classic espionage technique.

03:14:57.600 --> 03:15:01.080
And then they stepped in, introduced themselves mid-career

03:15:01.080 --> 03:15:04.080
and said, hey, we know you have this thing that you like

03:15:04.080 --> 03:15:06.960
that isn't really frowned upon by your own people,

03:15:06.960 --> 03:15:08.160
but we don't frown upon it.

03:15:08.160 --> 03:15:10.520
And we can help you both succeed

03:15:10.520 --> 03:15:14.880
and have an endless supply of ladies along the way.

03:15:14.920 --> 03:15:18.200
I've recently talked to Ryan Graves, who's a lieutenant,

03:15:18.200 --> 03:15:21.480
Ryan Graves, who's a fighter jet pilot,

03:15:24.120 --> 03:15:26.200
about many things.

03:15:26.200 --> 03:15:30.000
He also does work on autonomous weapon systems, drones,

03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:32.720
and that kind of thing, including quantum computing.

03:15:32.720 --> 03:15:37.240
But he also happens to be one of the very few pilots

03:15:37.240 --> 03:15:38.920
that were willing to go on record

03:15:38.920 --> 03:15:41.080
and talk about UFO sightings.

03:15:41.920 --> 03:15:44.400
Does the CIA and the federal government

03:15:44.400 --> 03:15:46.600
have interest in UFOs?

03:15:46.600 --> 03:15:50.480
In my experience at CIA, that is an area

03:15:50.480 --> 03:15:53.600
that remains very compartmented.

03:15:53.600 --> 03:15:56.440
And that could be one of two reasons.

03:15:56.440 --> 03:15:58.400
It could be because there is significant interest

03:15:58.400 --> 03:16:00.920
and that's why it's so heavily compartmented.

03:16:00.920 --> 03:16:05.880
Or it could be because it's an area that's just not important.

03:16:05.880 --> 03:16:07.000
It's a distraction.

03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:10.720
So they compartment it so it doesn't distract you.

03:16:10.880 --> 03:16:12.560
Distract from other operations.

03:16:13.480 --> 03:16:17.880
One of the areas that I've been quite interested in

03:16:17.880 --> 03:16:19.120
and where I've done a lot of research

03:16:19.120 --> 03:16:20.800
and I've done some work in the private intelligence

03:16:20.800 --> 03:16:23.160
and private investigation side is with UFOs.

03:16:24.960 --> 03:16:27.600
The place where UFOs really connect

03:16:27.600 --> 03:16:28.680
with the federal government

03:16:28.680 --> 03:16:31.040
is when it comes to aviation safety

03:16:31.040 --> 03:16:33.240
and predominance of power.

03:16:33.240 --> 03:16:37.000
So FAA and the US Air Force and the US military

03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:38.960
are very invested in knowing what's happening

03:16:38.960 --> 03:16:41.000
in the skies above the United States.

03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:43.640
And that's of primary interest to them.

03:16:43.640 --> 03:16:46.360
When they can rule out the direct threat

03:16:46.360 --> 03:16:48.320
to national security of UFOs,

03:16:48.320 --> 03:16:50.240
then they become less interested.

03:16:50.240 --> 03:16:54.400
That said, when you have unexplained aerial phenomenon

03:16:54.400 --> 03:16:58.920
that are unexplained, that can't directly be tied

03:16:58.920 --> 03:17:03.440
to anything that is known of the terrestrial world,

03:17:04.400 --> 03:17:07.880
then they're left without an answer to their question.

03:17:07.880 --> 03:17:10.640
They don't know if it's a threat or not a threat.

03:17:10.640 --> 03:17:12.560
But I think the scarier concern

03:17:12.560 --> 03:17:13.800
for the US national government

03:17:13.800 --> 03:17:15.280
or for the US federal government,

03:17:15.280 --> 03:17:16.960
the scarier concern that nobody talks about

03:17:16.960 --> 03:17:20.320
is what if the UFO isn't alien?

03:17:20.320 --> 03:17:25.320
What if it is actually a cutting edge war machine

03:17:25.880 --> 03:17:29.320
that we are eons behind ever being able to replicate?

03:17:29.320 --> 03:17:34.200
Or the other concern is that it's a system,

03:17:34.200 --> 03:17:36.840
it's a machine from a foreign power

03:17:36.880 --> 03:17:38.760
that's doing intelligence collection.

03:17:38.760 --> 03:17:39.600
Correct.

03:17:39.600 --> 03:17:41.240
So it's not just military purposes,

03:17:41.240 --> 03:17:43.800
it's actually collecting data.

03:17:43.800 --> 03:17:46.240
Well, they fall, a lot of times the federal government

03:17:46.240 --> 03:17:47.240
will see the two as the same.

03:17:47.240 --> 03:17:50.240
It's a hostile tool from a foreign government.

03:17:50.240 --> 03:17:53.680
So collection of information is a hostile act.

03:17:53.680 --> 03:17:56.640
Absolutely, that's why the Espionage Act exists.

03:17:56.640 --> 03:17:58.160
That's why it's a criminal offense

03:17:58.160 --> 03:18:00.360
if you're committing espionage in the United States

03:18:00.360 --> 03:18:03.360
as a US citizen or a foreign citizen.

03:18:03.360 --> 03:18:05.800
So I guess they keep digging until they can confirm

03:18:05.800 --> 03:18:07.040
it's not a threat.

03:18:07.040 --> 03:18:10.680
But it just, and you're saying that there's not,

03:18:10.680 --> 03:18:13.280
from your understanding, much evidence that they're doing so,

03:18:13.280 --> 03:18:17.080
it could be because they're compartmentalized.

03:18:17.080 --> 03:18:21.560
But you're saying private intelligence institutions

03:18:21.560 --> 03:18:24.560
are trying to make progress on this.

03:18:25.600 --> 03:18:29.640
Yeah, it's really difficult to know the scale.

03:18:29.640 --> 03:18:31.520
Yeah, there's an economic interest

03:18:31.520 --> 03:18:33.920
in the private intelligence world.

03:18:33.920 --> 03:18:36.040
Because, for example, if you understand

03:18:36.040 --> 03:18:40.000
why certain aerial phenomenon are happening over a location,

03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:43.360
then you can use that to inform investors,

03:18:43.360 --> 03:18:44.960
whether to invest in that location

03:18:44.960 --> 03:18:47.080
or avoid investment in that location.

03:18:47.080 --> 03:18:48.680
But that's not a national security concern.

03:18:48.680 --> 03:18:51.520
So it doesn't matter to the federal government.

03:18:52.600 --> 03:18:54.560
Could these UFOs be aliens?

03:18:54.560 --> 03:18:57.320
Now I'm going into a territory of you as a human being

03:18:57.320 --> 03:19:00.080
wondering about all the alien civilizations

03:19:00.080 --> 03:19:01.600
that are out there.

03:19:02.120 --> 03:19:03.960
The humbling question.

03:19:03.960 --> 03:19:05.560
We are not alone.

03:19:05.560 --> 03:19:07.040
You think we're not alone?

03:19:07.040 --> 03:19:10.360
It's an improbability that we are alone.

03:19:10.360 --> 03:19:15.120
If by virtue of the fact that sentient human life exists,

03:19:15.120 --> 03:19:17.440
intelligent human life exists,

03:19:17.440 --> 03:19:19.360
all the probabilities that would have to be destroyed

03:19:19.360 --> 03:19:22.880
for that to be true simply speak over the galaxies

03:19:22.880 --> 03:19:26.240
that exist, that there's no possible way we're alone.

03:19:26.240 --> 03:19:27.760
It's a mathematical equation.

03:19:27.760 --> 03:19:30.320
It's a one or a zero, right?

03:19:30.320 --> 03:19:32.600
And for me, it has to exist.

03:19:32.600 --> 03:19:35.480
It's impossible otherwise rationally for me to think

03:19:35.480 --> 03:19:37.960
that we are truly the only intelligent life form

03:19:37.960 --> 03:19:39.360
in all of the universe.

03:19:40.320 --> 03:19:44.000
But to think that an alien life form

03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:49.000
is anything like us at all is equally as inconceivable.

03:19:49.840 --> 03:19:52.400
To think that they're carbon-based, bipedal,

03:19:52.400 --> 03:19:57.120
humanoid alien species that just happened to fly around

03:19:57.120 --> 03:20:01.120
in metal machines and visit alien planets

03:20:01.120 --> 03:20:05.680
in a way that they become observed is, it's just silly.

03:20:05.680 --> 03:20:07.120
It's the world of sci-fi.

03:20:07.120 --> 03:20:07.960
Well, let me push.

03:20:07.960 --> 03:20:09.880
What does every good scientist,

03:20:09.880 --> 03:20:11.600
because we always assume that they're superior

03:20:11.600 --> 03:20:13.480
to us in intelligence.

03:20:13.480 --> 03:20:16.480
When any scientist carries out an experiment,

03:20:16.480 --> 03:20:19.560
the whole objective of the experiment is to observe

03:20:19.560 --> 03:20:23.440
without being disclosed or being discovered.

03:20:23.440 --> 03:20:26.360
So why on earth would we think that the superior species

03:20:26.360 --> 03:20:29.280
makes the mistake of being discovered over and over again?

03:20:31.040 --> 03:20:32.720
So to push back on that idea,

03:20:32.720 --> 03:20:34.720
if we were to think about us humans

03:20:34.720 --> 03:20:36.560
trying to communicate with ants,

03:20:37.720 --> 03:20:39.480
first we observe for a while.

03:20:39.480 --> 03:20:41.320
There'll be a bunch of PhDs written,

03:20:41.320 --> 03:20:45.160
a bunch of people just sort of collecting data,

03:20:45.160 --> 03:20:48.480
taking notes, trying to understand about this thing

03:20:48.480 --> 03:20:51.000
that you detected that seems to be a living thing,

03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:52.600
which is a very difficult thing to define

03:20:52.600 --> 03:20:54.120
from an alien perspective.

03:20:54.160 --> 03:20:55.280
Or from our perspective,

03:20:55.280 --> 03:20:57.640
we find the left on Mars or something like that.

03:20:57.640 --> 03:20:59.760
Okay, so you observe for a while,

03:20:59.760 --> 03:21:02.360
but then if you want to actually interact with it,

03:21:02.360 --> 03:21:04.480
how would you interact with the ants?

03:21:04.480 --> 03:21:06.920
If I were to interact with the ants,

03:21:06.920 --> 03:21:10.680
I would try to infiltrate.

03:21:10.680 --> 03:21:15.120
I would try to figure out what is the language

03:21:15.120 --> 03:21:17.920
they used to communicate with each other.

03:21:17.920 --> 03:21:21.880
I would try to operate at their physical scale,

03:21:22.680 --> 03:21:24.600
in terms of the physics of their interaction,

03:21:24.600 --> 03:21:27.360
in terms of the information,

03:21:27.360 --> 03:21:30.080
methods, mediums of information exchange

03:21:30.080 --> 03:21:33.040
with pheromones or whatever, however the heck ants.

03:21:33.040 --> 03:21:36.000
So I would try to mimic them in some way.

03:21:36.000 --> 03:21:38.400
So in that sense, it makes sense

03:21:38.400 --> 03:21:43.360
that the objects we would see,

03:21:43.360 --> 03:21:44.480
you mentioned bipedal.

03:21:44.480 --> 03:21:45.880
Yes, of course it's ridiculous

03:21:45.880 --> 03:21:50.240
that aliens would actually be very similar to us,

03:21:50.240 --> 03:21:54.560
but maybe they create forms in order to be like,

03:21:54.560 --> 03:21:58.280
here, the humans will understand it,

03:21:58.280 --> 03:22:00.920
and this needs to be sufficiently different from humans

03:22:00.920 --> 03:22:02.840
to know that there's something weird.

03:22:02.840 --> 03:22:05.080
I don't know, I think it's actually

03:22:05.080 --> 03:22:07.360
an incredibly difficult problem of figuring out

03:22:07.360 --> 03:22:10.440
how to communicate with a thing way dumber than you.

03:22:11.920 --> 03:22:14.680
People assume if you're smart,

03:22:14.680 --> 03:22:16.840
it's easier to talk to the dumb thing,

03:22:16.840 --> 03:22:19.240
but I think it's actually extremely difficult

03:22:19.240 --> 03:22:23.720
when the gap in intelligence is just orders of magnitude.

03:22:23.720 --> 03:22:26.320
And so of course you can observe,

03:22:26.320 --> 03:22:30.040
but once you notice the thing is sufficiently interesting,

03:22:30.040 --> 03:22:32.160
how do you communicate with that thing?

03:22:32.160 --> 03:22:34.320
So this is where one of the things

03:22:34.320 --> 03:22:38.720
I always try to highlight is how conspiracies are born,

03:22:38.720 --> 03:22:41.320
because many people don't understand how easy it is

03:22:41.320 --> 03:22:44.360
to fall into the conspiratorial cycle.

03:22:44.360 --> 03:22:47.560
So the first step to a conspiracy being born

03:22:47.560 --> 03:22:52.360
is to have a piece of evidence that is true,

03:22:52.360 --> 03:22:55.360
and then immediately following the true evidence

03:22:55.360 --> 03:22:57.280
is a gap in information.

03:22:57.280 --> 03:23:00.720
And then to fill in the gap of information,

03:23:00.720 --> 03:23:05.720
people create an idea, and then the next logical outcome

03:23:05.920 --> 03:23:08.080
is based on the idea that they just created,

03:23:08.080 --> 03:23:10.240
which is an idea that's based on something

03:23:10.240 --> 03:23:12.480
that was imagined in the first place.

03:23:12.480 --> 03:23:15.520
So the factual thing is now two steps away,

03:23:15.520 --> 03:23:17.280
and then three steps away, four steps away,

03:23:17.280 --> 03:23:18.120
as the things go on.

03:23:18.120 --> 03:23:20.360
And then all of a sudden you have this kernel of truth

03:23:20.360 --> 03:23:23.040
that turned into this wild conspiracy.

03:23:23.040 --> 03:23:26.080
So in our example, you talked about humans

03:23:26.080 --> 03:23:27.320
trying to communicate with ants.

03:23:27.320 --> 03:23:28.840
Ants are not intelligent.

03:23:28.840 --> 03:23:30.800
There's no, ants are not an intelligent species.

03:23:30.800 --> 03:23:33.840
They're a drone species that's somehow commanded

03:23:33.840 --> 03:23:36.080
through whatever technology, whatever, whatever-

03:23:36.080 --> 03:23:37.960
Spoken like a typical human, but yes.

03:23:37.960 --> 03:23:40.120
Whatever biological thing is in the queen, right?

03:23:40.120 --> 03:23:41.960
But they're not, it's not a fair equivalent,

03:23:41.960 --> 03:23:43.120
but let's look at gorillas,

03:23:43.120 --> 03:23:45.280
or let's look at something in the monkey family, right?

03:23:45.960 --> 03:23:49.120
Largely, we agree that there is some sort of intelligence

03:23:49.120 --> 03:23:52.200
there, or dolphins, some sort of intelligence, right?

03:23:54.000 --> 03:23:59.000
It is a human thing, a human thing to want to observe

03:23:59.160 --> 03:24:02.320
and then communicate and integrate.

03:24:02.320 --> 03:24:06.640
That's a human thing, not an intelligent life thing.

03:24:06.640 --> 03:24:09.080
So for us to even think that a foreign,

03:24:09.080 --> 03:24:12.280
an intelligent alien species would want to engage

03:24:12.280 --> 03:24:16.920
and communicate at all is an extremely human assumption.

03:24:16.920 --> 03:24:18.200
And then from that assumption,

03:24:18.200 --> 03:24:20.160
then we started going into all the other things you said.

03:24:20.160 --> 03:24:23.040
If they wanted to communicate, wouldn't they want to mimic?

03:24:23.040 --> 03:24:24.160
If they wanted to mimic,

03:24:24.160 --> 03:24:26.040
wouldn't they create devices like ours?

03:24:26.040 --> 03:24:29.320
So now we're three steps removed from the true fact

03:24:29.320 --> 03:24:32.400
of there's something unexplainable in the skies.

03:24:34.440 --> 03:24:37.800
Yeah, so the fact is there's something unexplainable

03:24:37.800 --> 03:24:40.400
in the skies, and then we're filling in the gaps

03:24:40.400 --> 03:24:43.320
with all our basic human biases and assumptions.

03:24:43.320 --> 03:24:44.160
Exactly.

03:24:44.160 --> 03:24:45.080
But the thing is-

03:24:45.080 --> 03:24:47.640
Now we're getting right back to Project Northwood.

03:24:47.640 --> 03:24:48.840
We need some plan.

03:24:48.840 --> 03:24:50.480
I don't care how crazy the idea is, guys.

03:24:50.480 --> 03:24:51.560
Give me some plan.

03:24:51.560 --> 03:24:53.440
So that's where we come up with.

03:24:53.440 --> 03:24:55.320
Maybe it's an alien species trying to communicate,

03:24:55.320 --> 03:24:58.000
or maybe it's an alien, a hostile threat

03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:01.000
that's trying to take over the world, or who knows what.

03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:01.840
Maybe it's-

03:25:01.840 --> 03:25:06.840
I mean, but you have to somehow construct hypotheses

03:25:07.160 --> 03:25:10.160
and theories for anomalies,

03:25:10.160 --> 03:25:15.160
and then from that, amidst the giant pile of the ridiculous,

03:25:16.640 --> 03:25:21.640
emerges perhaps a deeper truth over a period of decades.

03:25:21.960 --> 03:25:24.480
And at first, that truth is ridiculed,

03:25:24.480 --> 03:25:29.280
and then it's accepted, that whole process.

03:25:29.280 --> 03:25:30.800
The Earth revolving around the sun?

03:25:30.800 --> 03:25:32.960
Yeah, the Earth revolving around the sun.

03:25:32.960 --> 03:25:37.400
But to me, it's interesting because it asks us

03:25:37.400 --> 03:25:39.400
looking out there with SETI,

03:25:39.400 --> 03:25:41.960
just looking for alien life,

03:25:41.960 --> 03:25:45.600
is forcing us to really ask questions about ourselves,

03:25:45.600 --> 03:25:48.400
about what is life, how special.

03:25:48.400 --> 03:25:50.000
First of all, what is intelligence?

03:25:50.000 --> 03:25:52.480
How special is intelligence in the cosmos?

03:25:52.480 --> 03:25:55.840
And I think it's inspiring and challenging

03:25:55.840 --> 03:25:57.440
to us as human beings,

03:25:57.440 --> 03:26:00.360
both on a scientific and engineering level,

03:26:00.360 --> 03:26:01.880
but also on a philosophical level.

03:26:01.880 --> 03:26:04.520
I mean, all of those questions are laid before us

03:26:04.520 --> 03:26:06.560
when you start to think about alien life.

03:26:06.560 --> 03:26:09.560
So you interviewed Joe Rogan recently,

03:26:09.560 --> 03:26:12.440
and he said something that I thought was really,

03:26:12.440 --> 03:26:14.880
really brilliant during the podcast interview.

03:26:14.880 --> 03:26:15.720
He said that-

03:26:15.720 --> 03:26:17.040
He's gonna love hearing that.

03:26:17.040 --> 03:26:18.920
But go ahead, sorry.

03:26:18.920 --> 03:26:22.000
But he said that he realized at some point

03:26:22.960 --> 03:26:25.560
that the turn in his opinion about UFOs happened

03:26:25.560 --> 03:26:29.280
when he realized how desperately he wanted it to be true.

03:26:30.440 --> 03:26:33.040
This is the human condition.

03:26:34.080 --> 03:26:35.840
Our pink matter works the same way,

03:26:35.840 --> 03:26:37.000
as everybody's pink matter.

03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:38.560
And one of the ways that our pink matter works

03:26:38.560 --> 03:26:41.560
is with this thing, with what's known as a cognitive bias.

03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:42.960
It's a mental shortcut.

03:26:42.960 --> 03:26:45.200
Essentially, your brain doesn't want to process

03:26:45.200 --> 03:26:46.680
through facts over and over again.

03:26:46.680 --> 03:26:49.000
Instead, it wants to assume certain facts are in place

03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:50.320
and just jump right to the conclusion.

03:26:50.320 --> 03:26:53.000
It saves energy, it saves megabytes.

03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:56.320
So what Joe, or Joe Rogan,

03:26:56.320 --> 03:26:57.840
I feel weird calling him Joe, I don't know him,

03:26:57.840 --> 03:26:59.680
but what Joe identified on his own-

03:26:59.680 --> 03:27:00.640
Mr. Rogan.

03:27:00.640 --> 03:27:03.120
What Mr. Rogan identified on his own

03:27:04.080 --> 03:27:06.920
was his own cognitive loop.

03:27:06.920 --> 03:27:10.320
And then he immediately grew suspicious of that loop.

03:27:10.320 --> 03:27:11.880
That is a super powerful tool.

03:27:11.880 --> 03:27:13.320
That is something that most people

03:27:13.320 --> 03:27:15.640
never become self-actualized enough to realize,

03:27:15.640 --> 03:27:17.240
that they have a cognitive loop,

03:27:17.240 --> 03:27:20.160
let alone questioning their own cognitive loop.

03:27:20.160 --> 03:27:23.480
So that was, when it came to this topic specifically,

03:27:23.480 --> 03:27:25.920
that was just something that I thought was really powerful

03:27:25.920 --> 03:27:30.920
because you learned to not trust your own mind.

03:27:30.960 --> 03:27:34.640
On the record, after he drinks one whiskey,

03:27:34.640 --> 03:27:36.400
all that goes out.

03:27:36.400 --> 03:27:38.800
I think that was just in that moment in time.

03:27:40.960 --> 03:27:41.800
A moment of brilliance.

03:27:41.800 --> 03:27:43.120
A moment of brilliance.

03:27:43.120 --> 03:27:44.640
I think he still is,

03:27:48.440 --> 03:27:50.400
he's definitely, one of the things that inspires me

03:27:50.400 --> 03:27:53.400
about Joe is how open-minded he is, how curious he is.

03:27:53.400 --> 03:27:57.400
He refuses to let the conformity and the conventions

03:27:57.400 --> 03:28:00.640
of any one community, including the scientific community,

03:28:01.320 --> 03:28:04.240
be a kind of thing that limits his curiosity,

03:28:04.240 --> 03:28:08.760
of asking what if, it's entirely possible.

03:28:08.760 --> 03:28:10.160
I think that's a beautiful thing.

03:28:10.160 --> 03:28:13.680
And it actually represents what the best of science is,

03:28:13.680 --> 03:28:15.960
that childlike curiosity.

03:28:15.960 --> 03:28:18.600
So it's good to sort of balance those two things,

03:28:18.600 --> 03:28:21.240
but then you have to wake up to it like,

03:28:21.240 --> 03:28:24.440
is there a chance this is true

03:28:24.440 --> 03:28:27.080
or do I just really want it to be true?

03:28:27.080 --> 03:28:27.920
And that-

03:28:27.920 --> 03:28:29.840
Is there a hot girl that talks to you overseas?

03:28:29.840 --> 03:28:30.680
Yeah.

03:28:30.680 --> 03:28:31.520
Yeah.

03:28:31.520 --> 03:28:34.080
For a brief moment.

03:28:35.400 --> 03:28:37.920
There's actually a deeper explanation for it

03:28:37.920 --> 03:28:39.600
that I'll tell you off the mic

03:28:39.600 --> 03:28:42.960
that perhaps a lot of people can kind of figure out.

03:28:42.960 --> 03:28:43.800
Anyway.

03:28:43.800 --> 03:28:44.880
Just to take it one step further,

03:28:44.880 --> 03:28:45.760
because I love this stuff.

03:28:45.760 --> 03:28:48.880
Personally, I love pink matter stuff.

03:28:48.880 --> 03:28:50.080
In your interview with Jack Barsky,

03:28:50.080 --> 03:28:52.280
Jack's a good friend of mine, a good dude.

03:28:52.280 --> 03:28:53.120
Yeah, incredible person.

03:28:53.120 --> 03:28:55.760
Yeah, in your conversation with Jack Barsky,

03:28:56.560 --> 03:28:58.560
he started talking to you about

03:28:58.560 --> 03:29:01.800
how his recruiters were feeding back to him

03:29:01.800 --> 03:29:04.560
his own beliefs, his own opinions about himself,

03:29:04.560 --> 03:29:06.480
how smart he was, how good he was,

03:29:06.480 --> 03:29:08.360
how uniquely qualified he was.

03:29:08.360 --> 03:29:10.480
That's all pink matter manipulation.

03:29:10.480 --> 03:29:12.400
Feeding right back to the person

03:29:12.400 --> 03:29:14.120
what they already think of themselves

03:29:14.120 --> 03:29:17.680
is a way to get them to invest and trust you faster

03:29:17.680 --> 03:29:21.240
because obviously you value them for all the right reasons

03:29:21.240 --> 03:29:23.000
because that's how they see themselves.

03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:28.000
So that loop that the KGB was using with Jack,

03:29:28.920 --> 03:29:31.120
Jack did not wake up to that loop at the time.

03:29:31.120 --> 03:29:33.000
He woke up to it later.

03:29:33.000 --> 03:29:35.200
So it happens to all of us.

03:29:35.200 --> 03:29:37.120
We're all in a loop.

03:29:37.120 --> 03:29:39.640
It's just whether it's about oat milk

03:29:39.640 --> 03:29:41.160
or whether it's about aliens

03:29:41.160 --> 03:29:43.960
or whether it's about the Democrats

03:29:43.960 --> 03:29:45.560
trying to take your guns, whatever it is,

03:29:45.560 --> 03:29:48.160
everybody's in a loop and we've got to wake up

03:29:48.160 --> 03:29:50.240
to ask ourselves, just like you said,

03:29:50.240 --> 03:29:53.840
is it true or do we just really want it to be true?

03:29:53.840 --> 03:29:55.720
And until you ask yourself that question,

03:29:55.720 --> 03:29:58.240
you're just one of the masses trapped in the loop.

03:29:58.240 --> 03:30:03.240
Yeah, that's the really, the Nietzsche gaze into the abyss.

03:30:03.560 --> 03:30:05.000
It's a dangerous thing.

03:30:05.000 --> 03:30:08.600
That's the path to insanity is to ask that question.

03:30:08.600 --> 03:30:11.000
You want to be doing it carefully,

03:30:11.000 --> 03:30:14.240
but it's also the place where you can truly discover

03:30:14.240 --> 03:30:15.960
something fundamental about this world

03:30:15.960 --> 03:30:17.280
that people don't understand

03:30:17.280 --> 03:30:21.840
and then lay the groundwork for progress,

03:30:21.840 --> 03:30:24.960
scientific, cultural, all that kind of stuff.

03:30:24.960 --> 03:30:25.800
Absolutely.

03:30:27.320 --> 03:30:28.840
What is one spy trick?

03:30:28.840 --> 03:30:31.200
This is from a Reddit that I really enjoy.

03:30:31.200 --> 03:30:32.680
What's one spy trick?

03:30:32.680 --> 03:30:36.880
And you're full of a million spy tricks.

03:30:36.880 --> 03:30:37.800
People should follow you.

03:30:37.800 --> 03:30:39.200
You did an amazing podcast.

03:30:39.200 --> 03:30:40.560
You're just an amazing person.

03:30:40.560 --> 03:30:42.000
Thank you.

03:30:42.000 --> 03:30:45.080
What is the one spy trick you would teach everyone

03:30:45.120 --> 03:30:48.040
that they can use to improve their life instantly?

03:30:48.040 --> 03:30:50.840
Now you already mentioned quite a few,

03:30:50.840 --> 03:30:54.160
but what else could jump to mind?

03:30:54.160 --> 03:30:56.680
My go-to answer for this has not really changed much

03:30:56.680 --> 03:30:57.720
over the last few years.

03:30:57.720 --> 03:31:00.040
So the first, the most important spy trick

03:31:00.040 --> 03:31:01.680
to change everything immediately

03:31:02.760 --> 03:31:05.360
is something called perception versus perspective.

03:31:06.200 --> 03:31:09.220
We all look at the world through our own perception.

03:31:10.320 --> 03:31:11.520
My dad used to tell me,

03:31:11.520 --> 03:31:13.720
my stepdad used to tell me that perception is reality.

03:31:13.720 --> 03:31:17.440
And I was arguing this with him when I was 14 years old.

03:31:17.440 --> 03:31:19.360
I told you so, dad, you're still wrong.

03:31:19.360 --> 03:31:20.560
Yeah.

03:31:20.560 --> 03:31:22.680
But perception is your interpretation

03:31:22.680 --> 03:31:25.480
of the world around you, but it's unique only to you.

03:31:26.320 --> 03:31:28.860
There's no advantage in your perception.

03:31:28.860 --> 03:31:29.700
That's why so many people

03:31:29.700 --> 03:31:31.540
find themselves arguing all the time,

03:31:31.540 --> 03:31:35.480
trying to convince other people of their own perception.

03:31:35.480 --> 03:31:37.800
The way that you win any argument,

03:31:37.800 --> 03:31:39.820
the way that you get ahead in your career,

03:31:39.820 --> 03:31:44.820
the way that you outsell or outrace anybody

03:31:45.100 --> 03:31:47.500
is when you move off of perception

03:31:47.500 --> 03:31:49.660
and move into perspective.

03:31:49.660 --> 03:31:52.340
Perspective is the act or the art

03:31:52.340 --> 03:31:56.380
of observing the world from outside of yourself.

03:31:56.380 --> 03:31:59.460
Whether that's outside of yourself as like an entity,

03:31:59.460 --> 03:32:02.460
just observing a third from a different point of view,

03:32:02.460 --> 03:32:05.180
or even more powerful, you sit in the shoes,

03:32:05.180 --> 03:32:07.460
you sit in the seat of the person opposite you,

03:32:07.460 --> 03:32:10.220
and you think to yourself, what is their life like?

03:32:10.220 --> 03:32:11.680
What do they feel right now?

03:32:13.140 --> 03:32:13.980
Are they comfortable?

03:32:13.980 --> 03:32:14.820
Are they uncomfortable?

03:32:14.820 --> 03:32:15.660
Are they afraid?

03:32:15.660 --> 03:32:16.480
Are they scared?

03:32:16.480 --> 03:32:18.720
What's the stressor that they woke up to this morning?

03:32:18.720 --> 03:32:19.560
What's the stressor

03:32:19.560 --> 03:32:21.680
that they're gonna go to sleep with tonight?

03:32:21.680 --> 03:32:24.740
When you shift places and get out of your own perception

03:32:24.740 --> 03:32:27.280
and into someone else's perspective,

03:32:27.280 --> 03:32:29.260
now you're thinking like them,

03:32:29.260 --> 03:32:31.640
which is giving you an informational advantage.

03:32:31.640 --> 03:32:33.340
But you know what they're all doing?

03:32:33.340 --> 03:32:36.980
Everyone else out there is trapped in their own perception.

03:32:36.980 --> 03:32:39.340
Not thinking about a different perspective.

03:32:39.340 --> 03:32:42.540
So immediately you have superior information,

03:32:42.540 --> 03:32:44.080
superior positioning,

03:32:44.080 --> 03:32:46.220
you have an advantage that they don't have.

03:32:46.220 --> 03:32:48.800
And if you do that to your boss,

03:32:48.800 --> 03:32:50.140
it's gonna change your career.

03:32:50.140 --> 03:32:51.420
If you do that to your spouse,

03:32:51.420 --> 03:32:52.540
it's gonna change your marriage.

03:32:52.540 --> 03:32:53.980
If you do that to your kids,

03:32:53.980 --> 03:32:55.820
it's gonna change your family legacy

03:32:55.820 --> 03:32:58.140
because nobody else out there is doing it.

03:32:58.140 --> 03:33:01.940
It's so interesting how difficult empathy is for people

03:33:01.940 --> 03:33:03.820
and how powerful it is,

03:33:03.860 --> 03:33:05.740
especially for, like you said,

03:33:05.740 --> 03:33:07.220
the spouse, like intimacy.

03:33:08.880 --> 03:33:10.100
Stepping outside of yourself

03:33:10.100 --> 03:33:11.980
and really putting yourself in the shoes

03:33:11.980 --> 03:33:12.820
of the other person,

03:33:12.820 --> 03:33:14.340
considering how they see the world.

03:33:14.340 --> 03:33:17.860
And that's, I really enjoy that

03:33:17.860 --> 03:33:21.980
because how does that exactly lead to connection?

03:33:21.980 --> 03:33:26.640
I think when you start to understand

03:33:26.640 --> 03:33:30.020
the way the other person sees the world,

03:33:30.020 --> 03:33:32.300
you start to enjoy the world through their eyes

03:33:32.340 --> 03:33:34.300
and you start to be able to share,

03:33:34.300 --> 03:33:35.700
in terms of intimacy,

03:33:35.700 --> 03:33:39.100
share the beauty that they see together

03:33:39.100 --> 03:33:41.060
because you understand their perspective.

03:33:41.060 --> 03:33:43.780
And somehow you converge as well.

03:33:43.780 --> 03:33:46.100
Of course, that allows you to gather information better

03:33:46.100 --> 03:33:47.340
and all that kind of stuff.

03:33:47.340 --> 03:33:50.420
And that allows you to work together better

03:33:50.420 --> 03:33:53.380
to share in all different kinds of ways.

03:33:53.380 --> 03:33:55.820
But for intimacy, that's a really powerful thing.

03:33:55.820 --> 03:34:00.820
And also for actually people you really disagree with

03:34:00.940 --> 03:34:03.180
or people on the internet you disagree with and so on.

03:34:03.180 --> 03:34:07.460
I find empathy is such a powerful way

03:34:07.460 --> 03:34:09.780
to resolve any tensions there.

03:34:09.780 --> 03:34:12.540
Even people like trolls or all that kind of stuff,

03:34:12.540 --> 03:34:14.040
I don't deride them.

03:34:14.040 --> 03:34:16.020
I just kind of put myself in their shoes

03:34:16.020 --> 03:34:21.020
and it becomes an enjoyable camaraderie with that person.

03:34:21.740 --> 03:34:23.180
So I wanna draw a pretty hard line

03:34:23.180 --> 03:34:26.700
between perspective and empathy.

03:34:26.700 --> 03:34:30.420
Because empathy is frankly an overused term

03:34:32.140 --> 03:34:33.740
by people who don't really know

03:34:33.740 --> 03:34:34.980
what they're saying sometimes.

03:34:34.980 --> 03:34:35.940
I think you know what you're saying,

03:34:35.940 --> 03:34:37.380
but the vast majority of people listening.

03:34:37.380 --> 03:34:39.300
I would argue that, but that's fine.

03:34:39.300 --> 03:34:40.540
As soon as you say empathy,

03:34:40.540 --> 03:34:41.380
they're gonna just be like,

03:34:41.380 --> 03:34:43.380
oh yeah, I know, I've heard this a thousand times.

03:34:43.380 --> 03:34:44.460
Yes.

03:34:44.460 --> 03:34:47.860
Empathy is about feeling what other people feel.

03:34:49.940 --> 03:34:51.700
It's more about feeling, would you say?

03:34:51.700 --> 03:34:53.060
Yeah, it's about feelings.

03:34:53.060 --> 03:34:54.860
It's about understanding someone else's feelings.

03:34:54.900 --> 03:34:58.060
Feeling, it's not the same as sympathy

03:34:58.060 --> 03:34:59.320
where you feel their feelings.

03:34:59.320 --> 03:35:01.860
Empathy is about recognizing that they have feelings

03:35:01.860 --> 03:35:04.420
and recognizing that their feelings are valid.

03:35:04.420 --> 03:35:07.380
Perspective is more than just feelings.

03:35:07.380 --> 03:35:11.420
It's about the brain, it's about the pink matter

03:35:11.420 --> 03:35:14.540
on the left side and the right side of the brain.

03:35:14.540 --> 03:35:16.460
Yes, I care about feelings.

03:35:16.460 --> 03:35:18.780
And this goes directly to your point about connection.

03:35:18.780 --> 03:35:20.260
Yes, I care about feelings,

03:35:20.260 --> 03:35:22.700
but I also care about objectives.

03:35:22.700 --> 03:35:25.740
What is your life, what is your aspirational goal?

03:35:25.740 --> 03:35:27.500
What was it like to grow up as you?

03:35:27.500 --> 03:35:29.060
What was it like to experience this

03:35:29.060 --> 03:35:30.860
and how did this shape your opinion on that?

03:35:30.860 --> 03:35:35.740
And what is it that you're going to do next?

03:35:35.740 --> 03:35:38.820
More than just feelings, actual tactical actions.

03:35:38.820 --> 03:35:42.700
And that becomes extremely valuable in the operational world

03:35:42.700 --> 03:35:45.100
because if you can get into someone's head,

03:35:45.100 --> 03:35:47.740
left brain and right brain, feelings and logic,

03:35:47.740 --> 03:35:48.740
you can start anticipating

03:35:48.740 --> 03:35:50.200
what actions they're gonna take next.

03:35:50.200 --> 03:35:52.620
You can direct the actions that they're going to take next

03:35:52.620 --> 03:35:54.220
because you're basically telling them the story

03:35:54.220 --> 03:35:56.000
that's in their own head.

03:35:56.000 --> 03:35:58.740
When it comes to relationships and personal connection,

03:35:58.740 --> 03:36:00.060
we talked about it earlier,

03:36:00.060 --> 03:36:05.060
the thing that people want the most is community.

03:36:05.620 --> 03:36:08.140
They want someone else who understands them.

03:36:08.140 --> 03:36:11.780
They want to be with people, they don't want to be alone.

03:36:11.780 --> 03:36:15.820
The more you practice perspective, empathy or no empathy,

03:36:15.820 --> 03:36:19.220
the more you just validate that a person is there.

03:36:19.220 --> 03:36:22.380
I am in this time and space with you in this moment.

03:36:22.380 --> 03:36:27.380
Feelings aside, that is powerful.

03:36:27.460 --> 03:36:29.180
That is intimate.

03:36:29.180 --> 03:36:31.020
And whether you're talking about lovers

03:36:31.020 --> 03:36:32.900
or whether you're talking about a business exchange

03:36:32.900 --> 03:36:35.900
or whether you're talking about collaborators in a crime,

03:36:35.900 --> 03:36:39.260
I'm here with you, ride or die, let's do it.

03:36:39.260 --> 03:36:41.060
That's powerful.

03:36:41.060 --> 03:36:46.060
How much of what you've learned in your role at the CIA,

03:36:46.460 --> 03:36:48.620
transfer over to relationships,

03:36:48.620 --> 03:36:51.420
the business relationship to other aspects of life,

03:36:51.420 --> 03:36:53.940
this is something you work closely with powerful people

03:36:53.940 --> 03:36:55.180
to help them out.

03:36:55.180 --> 03:36:57.940
What have you learned about the commonalities

03:36:57.940 --> 03:36:59.940
about the problems that people face?

03:36:59.940 --> 03:37:04.940
Man, I would say about a solid 95% of what I learned

03:37:05.460 --> 03:37:07.540
at CIA carries over to the civilian world.

03:37:07.540 --> 03:37:10.500
That 5% that doesn't is,

03:37:10.500 --> 03:37:13.060
it would carry over in a disaster, right?

03:37:13.060 --> 03:37:16.180
There's knowing how to shoot on target

03:37:16.180 --> 03:37:20.780
with my non-dominant hand really only has one purpose.

03:37:20.780 --> 03:37:23.180
It's not gonna happen day to day, right?

03:37:23.180 --> 03:37:24.500
Knowing how to do a dead drop

03:37:24.500 --> 03:37:27.060
that isn't discoverable by the local police force

03:37:27.060 --> 03:37:28.500
isn't gonna be useful right now,

03:37:28.500 --> 03:37:30.580
but it could be useful in disaster.

03:37:30.580 --> 03:37:32.740
But the 95% of stuff that's useful,

03:37:32.740 --> 03:37:34.500
it's all tied to the human condition.

03:37:34.500 --> 03:37:37.660
It's all tied to being able

03:37:37.660 --> 03:37:40.980
to understand what someone's thinking,

03:37:40.980 --> 03:37:42.980
understand what someone's feeling,

03:37:42.980 --> 03:37:45.460
direct their thoughts, direct their emotions,

03:37:45.460 --> 03:37:47.940
direct their thought process, win their attention,

03:37:47.940 --> 03:37:51.060
win their loyalty, win influence with them,

03:37:51.060 --> 03:37:54.860
grow your network, grow your own circle of influence.

03:37:54.860 --> 03:37:58.460
I mean, all of that is immensely, immensely valuable.

03:37:59.500 --> 03:38:00.860
As an example, the disguise,

03:38:00.860 --> 03:38:03.260
the disguise thing that we talked about earlier,

03:38:03.260 --> 03:38:06.580
disguise in and of itself has mixed utility.

03:38:06.580 --> 03:38:07.500
If you're Brad Pitt

03:38:07.500 --> 03:38:08.580
and you don't want anybody to know you're Brad Pitt,

03:38:08.580 --> 03:38:10.340
you put on a level one disguise and that's great.

03:38:10.340 --> 03:38:12.740
Or maybe you call me and I walk you through a level two

03:38:12.740 --> 03:38:14.380
disguise so that you can go to Aruba

03:38:14.380 --> 03:38:16.260
and nobody's gonna know you're in Aruba, right?

03:38:16.260 --> 03:38:17.100
Whatever it is.

03:38:18.780 --> 03:38:20.980
But even there with the 5%

03:38:20.980 --> 03:38:22.860
that doesn't apply to everyday life,

03:38:22.860 --> 03:38:24.780
there's still elements that do.

03:38:24.780 --> 03:38:28.780
For example, when a person looks at a human being's face,

03:38:28.780 --> 03:38:32.260
the first place they look is the same part of the face

03:38:32.260 --> 03:38:34.180
as if they were reading a piece of paper.

03:38:34.180 --> 03:38:36.900
So in English, we start from the top left

03:38:36.900 --> 03:38:38.740
and we read left to right, top to bottom.

03:38:38.740 --> 03:38:41.340
So when an English speaking person interacts

03:38:41.340 --> 03:38:42.260
with another person,

03:38:42.260 --> 03:38:45.500
the first thing they look at isn't their eyes,

03:38:45.500 --> 03:38:49.220
it's the upper left, from their point of view,

03:38:49.220 --> 03:38:52.060
corner of their face, right?

03:38:52.060 --> 03:38:55.980
They look there and the information they get is hair color,

03:38:55.980 --> 03:38:58.260
hair pattern, skin color, right?

03:38:58.260 --> 03:39:01.020
That's it, before they know anything else about the face.

03:39:01.020 --> 03:39:02.780
This is one of the reasons why somebody can look at you

03:39:02.780 --> 03:39:05.020
and then you ask them, what color are my eyes?

03:39:05.020 --> 03:39:06.380
I don't really remember

03:39:06.380 --> 03:39:07.820
because the way they read the face,

03:39:07.820 --> 03:39:10.260
they read it from left to right, top to bottom.

03:39:10.260 --> 03:39:11.580
So they're paying a lot of attention

03:39:11.580 --> 03:39:12.940
to the first few things they see

03:39:12.940 --> 03:39:14.140
and then they're paying less attention

03:39:14.140 --> 03:39:14.980
as they go down the face.

03:39:14.980 --> 03:39:16.100
It's the same scrolling behavior

03:39:16.100 --> 03:39:18.900
that you see on the internet, right?

03:39:18.900 --> 03:39:21.340
So when you understand that through the lens of disguise,

03:39:21.340 --> 03:39:23.180
it allows you to make a very powerful disguise.

03:39:23.180 --> 03:39:25.700
The most important part of your disguise is here,

03:39:25.700 --> 03:39:27.340
if you're English speaking, right?

03:39:27.340 --> 03:39:29.340
Here, if you're speaking some foreign languages

03:39:29.340 --> 03:39:31.140
that read right to left, right?

03:39:31.140 --> 03:39:33.100
If it's Chinese, you know that they're gonna look

03:39:33.100 --> 03:39:35.820
from here down because they read left down.

03:39:35.820 --> 03:39:36.660
So-

03:39:36.660 --> 03:39:37.500
So interesting.

03:39:37.500 --> 03:39:39.860
So yeah, knowing that really helps you sort of configure

03:39:39.860 --> 03:39:41.700
the things in terms of physical appearance.

03:39:41.700 --> 03:39:42.540
That's interesting.

03:39:42.540 --> 03:39:43.380
Correct, correct.

03:39:43.660 --> 03:39:45.260
When it comes to how to make a disguise,

03:39:45.260 --> 03:39:47.700
not so useful to the ultra wealthy, usually.

03:39:47.700 --> 03:39:50.020
But when it comes to how to read a face,

03:39:50.020 --> 03:39:52.580
or more importantly, how people are going to read your face,

03:39:52.580 --> 03:39:53.860
that's extremely important

03:39:53.860 --> 03:39:57.580
because now you know where to find the first signs

03:39:57.580 --> 03:39:59.580
of deception in a baseline or anything else.

03:39:59.580 --> 03:40:03.580
You mentioned that the idea of having privacy

03:40:07.460 --> 03:40:10.260
is one that we kind of, we think we can,

03:40:10.260 --> 03:40:12.020
but we really don't.

03:40:12.380 --> 03:40:14.980
Is it possible for maybe somebody like me

03:40:14.980 --> 03:40:18.060
or a regular person to disappear from the grid?

03:40:18.060 --> 03:40:18.900
Absolutely.

03:40:18.900 --> 03:40:20.420
Yeah, and it's not as hard as you might think.

03:40:20.420 --> 03:40:21.660
It's not convenient.

03:40:21.660 --> 03:40:24.700
Again, convenience and security.

03:40:24.700 --> 03:40:26.460
You can disappear tomorrow, right?

03:40:26.460 --> 03:40:27.740
I can walk you through three steps right now

03:40:27.740 --> 03:40:29.180
that's gonna help you disappear tomorrow.

03:40:29.180 --> 03:40:31.340
But none of them are convenient.

03:40:31.340 --> 03:40:33.580
They're all extremely secure, right?

03:40:33.580 --> 03:40:35.180
The first thing you do is every piece

03:40:35.180 --> 03:40:38.180
of digital technology you have that is connected

03:40:38.180 --> 03:40:41.260
to you in any way is now dead.

03:40:41.260 --> 03:40:42.500
You just let the battery run out.

03:40:42.500 --> 03:40:43.620
Forever. Forever.

03:40:43.620 --> 03:40:46.420
You never touch it again, starting at this moment.

03:40:46.420 --> 03:40:50.220
What you have to do is go out and acquire a new one.

03:40:50.220 --> 03:40:52.940
Realistically, you will not be able to acquire a new one

03:40:52.940 --> 03:40:55.660
in the United States by buying it

03:40:55.660 --> 03:40:58.700
because to do so, you would tie it to your credit card.

03:40:58.700 --> 03:41:00.820
You would tie it to a location, a time, a place,

03:41:00.820 --> 03:41:02.300
a registered name, whatever else.

03:41:02.300 --> 03:41:04.820
So you would have to require it essentially by theft

03:41:05.780 --> 03:41:07.460
or through the black market.

03:41:07.460 --> 03:41:08.700
So you would want something

03:41:08.700 --> 03:41:11.300
because you're gonna need the advantage of technology

03:41:11.300 --> 03:41:13.060
without it being in your name.

03:41:13.060 --> 03:41:16.420
So you go out and you steal a phone or you steal a laptop.

03:41:16.420 --> 03:41:17.700
You do whatever you have to do to make sure

03:41:17.700 --> 03:41:19.220
that you can get on with the password

03:41:19.220 --> 03:41:21.100
and whatever else that might be as dirty

03:41:21.100 --> 03:41:22.380
or as clean as you want that to be.

03:41:22.380 --> 03:41:24.340
We're all morally flexible here,

03:41:24.340 --> 03:41:27.140
but now you have a technological device

03:41:27.140 --> 03:41:29.300
that you can work with.

03:41:29.300 --> 03:41:31.340
And then from there on,

03:41:31.340 --> 03:41:32.660
you're just doing whatever you have to do,

03:41:32.660 --> 03:41:35.060
whether you're stealing every step of the way

03:41:35.060 --> 03:41:38.700
or whether you run a massive con.

03:41:38.700 --> 03:41:42.300
Keep in mind that we often talk about con men and cons.

03:41:42.300 --> 03:41:43.500
Do you know what the root,

03:41:43.500 --> 03:41:46.500
the word that con is a root word for?

03:41:46.500 --> 03:41:48.020
Confidence.

03:41:48.020 --> 03:41:49.300
That's what a con man is.

03:41:49.300 --> 03:41:51.580
A con man is a confidence man.

03:41:51.580 --> 03:41:54.340
Just somebody who is so brazenly confident

03:41:54.340 --> 03:41:55.780
that the people around them,

03:41:55.780 --> 03:41:58.620
living in their own perception, not perspective

03:41:58.620 --> 03:42:00.340
and their perception, they're like,

03:42:00.340 --> 03:42:01.980
well, this guy really knows what he's talking about.

03:42:01.980 --> 03:42:04.020
So I'm gonna do what he says.

03:42:04.020 --> 03:42:05.580
So you can run a massive con

03:42:05.580 --> 03:42:07.220
and that can take care of your finances,

03:42:07.220 --> 03:42:08.500
that can take care of your lodging,

03:42:08.500 --> 03:42:10.220
whatever else it is.

03:42:10.220 --> 03:42:13.020
You are whoever you present yourself to be.

03:42:13.860 --> 03:42:18.300
So if you wanna be Bill for the afternoon,

03:42:18.300 --> 03:42:19.820
just go tell people your name is Bill.

03:42:19.820 --> 03:42:21.500
They're not gonna question you.

03:42:21.500 --> 03:42:26.500
So the intelligence, the natural web of intelligence

03:42:26.900 --> 03:42:30.100
gathering systems we have in the United States

03:42:30.100 --> 03:42:34.460
and in the world, are they going to believe

03:42:34.460 --> 03:42:35.900
for long that you're Bill?

03:42:37.020 --> 03:42:37.860
Are they?

03:42:37.860 --> 03:42:39.860
Until you do something that makes them think otherwise.

03:42:39.860 --> 03:42:41.020
If you are consistent,

03:42:41.020 --> 03:42:43.220
we talked about consistency being the superpower.

03:42:43.220 --> 03:42:46.620
If you are consistent, they will think you're Bill forever.

03:42:46.620 --> 03:42:48.980
How difficult is that to do?

03:42:48.980 --> 03:42:50.700
It's not convenient.

03:42:50.700 --> 03:42:51.860
It's quite difficult.

03:42:51.860 --> 03:42:53.820
Does that like require training?

03:42:53.820 --> 03:42:55.740
It does require training.

03:42:55.740 --> 03:42:57.780
Because why do criminals always get caught?

03:42:57.780 --> 03:42:59.940
Because they stop being consistent.

03:42:59.980 --> 03:43:04.980
Criminals, I never hesitate to admit this,

03:43:07.140 --> 03:43:09.020
but people tell me I should hesitate to admit it.

03:43:09.020 --> 03:43:11.660
So now I hesitate because of the guidance

03:43:11.660 --> 03:43:13.540
I've gotten to hesitate, right?

03:43:13.540 --> 03:43:14.380
I like criminals.

03:43:14.380 --> 03:43:16.420
I'm friends with a number of criminals

03:43:16.420 --> 03:43:17.940
because the only people who get me,

03:43:17.940 --> 03:43:20.940
like right away who get me are criminals

03:43:20.940 --> 03:43:23.140
because we know what it's like

03:43:23.140 --> 03:43:25.380
to basically abandon all the rules,

03:43:25.380 --> 03:43:26.660
do our own thing our own way

03:43:26.660 --> 03:43:29.060
and watch the world just keep turning.

03:43:29.060 --> 03:43:33.860
Most people are so stuck in the trap

03:43:33.860 --> 03:43:36.060
of normal thought and behavior

03:43:36.060 --> 03:43:37.500
that when I tell them they just don't,

03:43:37.500 --> 03:43:39.260
just go tell people your name is Bill.

03:43:39.260 --> 03:43:40.980
Most people are gonna say,

03:43:40.980 --> 03:43:42.540
that's not gonna work.

03:43:42.540 --> 03:43:43.380
But a criminal will be like,

03:43:43.380 --> 03:43:44.660
oh yeah, I did that once.

03:43:44.660 --> 03:43:46.300
I just told everybody my name is Nancy,

03:43:46.300 --> 03:43:48.860
I'm a dude and they still believe me.

03:43:48.860 --> 03:43:50.380
Criminals just get it, right?

03:43:50.380 --> 03:43:53.540
So what happens with criminals

03:43:53.540 --> 03:43:56.420
is they go to the school of hard knocks.

03:43:57.180 --> 03:44:00.340
They learn criminal behavior on the job.

03:44:00.340 --> 03:44:02.660
Spies go to school.

03:44:02.660 --> 03:44:05.020
We go to the best spy school in the world.

03:44:05.020 --> 03:44:07.860
We go to Langley's, the farm, right?

03:44:07.860 --> 03:44:10.140
What's known as Field Tradecraft Course, FTC

03:44:10.140 --> 03:44:12.420
in a covert location for a covert period of time

03:44:12.420 --> 03:44:13.540
and covert, covert, covert.

03:44:13.540 --> 03:44:14.620
So if anybody from CI is watching,

03:44:14.620 --> 03:44:16.180
I'm not breaking any rules.

03:44:16.180 --> 03:44:19.060
It's all on Wikipedia, but it's not coming from me.

03:44:19.060 --> 03:44:20.500
But we do, that's how we do it.

03:44:20.500 --> 03:44:24.860
They train us from a hundred years of experience

03:44:24.860 --> 03:44:27.100
in the best ways to carry out covert operations,

03:44:27.100 --> 03:44:30.780
which are all just criminal activities overseas.

03:44:30.780 --> 03:44:32.340
We learn how to do it the right way

03:44:32.340 --> 03:44:33.340
so that we don't get caught.

03:44:33.340 --> 03:44:34.460
We learn how to be consistent.

03:44:34.460 --> 03:44:37.700
More importantly, we learn how to create an operation

03:44:37.700 --> 03:44:39.940
that has a limited lifespan

03:44:39.940 --> 03:44:43.160
because the longer it lives, the more at risk you are.

03:44:43.160 --> 03:44:46.380
So you want operations to be short, concise,

03:44:46.380 --> 03:44:49.780
on the X, off the X, limit your room from mistakes.

03:44:49.780 --> 03:44:52.180
Criminals want the default

03:44:52.180 --> 03:44:55.020
to wanting these long-term operations

03:44:55.020 --> 03:44:56.980
because they don't want to have to recreate a new way

03:44:56.980 --> 03:44:59.000
to make money every 15 days.

03:45:00.500 --> 03:45:03.940
You mentioned if anybody from the CIA is watching.

03:45:03.940 --> 03:45:08.540
So I've seen you talk about the fact that sort of people

03:45:08.540 --> 03:45:10.380
that are currently working at the CIA

03:45:10.380 --> 03:45:14.420
would kind of look down on the people who've left the CIA

03:45:14.420 --> 03:45:16.820
and they divide them, especially if you go public,

03:45:16.820 --> 03:45:19.900
especially if there's a book and all that kind of stuff.

03:45:19.900 --> 03:45:22.420
Do you feel the pressure of that to be quiet,

03:45:28.100 --> 03:45:30.620
to not do something like this conversation

03:45:30.620 --> 03:45:31.620
that we're doing today?

03:45:31.620 --> 03:45:34.100
I feel the silent judgment.

03:45:34.100 --> 03:45:35.420
That's very real.

03:45:35.420 --> 03:45:36.980
I feel it for myself and I feel it for my wife

03:45:36.980 --> 03:45:38.620
who doesn't appear on camera very often,

03:45:38.620 --> 03:45:40.860
but who's also former CIA.

03:45:40.860 --> 03:45:42.700
We both feel the judgment.

03:45:42.700 --> 03:45:47.580
We know that right now, three days after this is released,

03:45:47.580 --> 03:45:49.180
somebody's gonna send an email

03:45:49.180 --> 03:45:52.100
on a closed network system inside CIA headquarters

03:45:52.100 --> 03:45:53.860
and there's a bunch of people who are gonna laugh at it,

03:45:53.860 --> 03:45:56.060
a bunch of people who are gonna say that who knows what,

03:45:56.060 --> 03:45:56.900
it's not gonna be good stuff.

03:45:56.900 --> 03:45:58.660
A bunch of people you respect probably.

03:45:58.660 --> 03:46:01.980
A bunch of people who I'm trying to bring honor to.

03:46:01.980 --> 03:46:04.820
Whether I know them or respect them is irrelevant.

03:46:04.820 --> 03:46:08.020
These are people who are out there doing the deed every day

03:46:08.020 --> 03:46:09.940
and I wanna bring them honor

03:46:09.940 --> 03:46:13.060
and I wanna do that in a way that I get to share

03:46:13.060 --> 03:46:15.680
what they can't share and what they won't share

03:46:15.680 --> 03:46:17.180
when they leave because they will also feel

03:46:17.180 --> 03:46:20.540
the silent pressure, the pressure to the shame,

03:46:20.540 --> 03:46:21.760
the judgment, right?

03:46:22.780 --> 03:46:25.480
But the truth is that I've done this now long enough.

03:46:25.480 --> 03:46:27.980
The first few times that I spoke out publicly,

03:46:29.380 --> 03:46:32.200
the response to being a positive voice

03:46:32.200 --> 03:46:35.000
for what the sacrifice is that people are making,

03:46:35.000 --> 03:46:39.060
it's so refreshing to be an honest voice

03:46:39.060 --> 03:46:43.140
that people don't normally hear that it's too important.

03:46:43.140 --> 03:46:44.340
One day I'm gonna be gone

03:46:44.340 --> 03:46:46.380
and my kids are gonna look back on all this

03:46:46.380 --> 03:46:48.400
and they're gonna see their dad

03:46:48.400 --> 03:46:51.020
trying to do the right thing for the right reasons

03:46:51.020 --> 03:46:53.540
and even if my son or daughter ends up at CIA

03:46:53.540 --> 03:46:55.300
and even if they get ridiculed for being,

03:46:55.300 --> 03:46:57.700
oh, you're the Bustamante kid, right?

03:46:57.700 --> 03:47:00.100
Your dad's a total sellout, whatever it might be.

03:47:01.140 --> 03:47:02.840
Like I want them to know, you know,

03:47:02.840 --> 03:47:05.820
dad was doing what he could to bring honor

03:47:05.820 --> 03:47:07.520
to the organization even when he couldn't stay

03:47:07.520 --> 03:47:09.500
in the organization anymore.

03:47:09.500 --> 03:47:11.500
So you said when you were 27,

03:47:11.500 --> 03:47:14.060
I think you didn't know what the hell you're doing.

03:47:15.060 --> 03:47:20.060
So now that you're a few years older and wiser,

03:47:21.300 --> 03:47:24.820
let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat

03:47:24.820 --> 03:47:27.500
and give advice to other 27-year-olds

03:47:27.500 --> 03:47:30.980
or even younger 17, 18-year-olds

03:47:30.980 --> 03:47:34.220
that are just out of high school, maybe going to college,

03:47:34.220 --> 03:47:35.540
trying to figure out this life,

03:47:35.540 --> 03:47:37.660
this career thing that they're on.

03:47:37.660 --> 03:47:42.100
What advice would you give them about how to have a career

03:47:42.100 --> 03:47:44.540
or how to have a life they can be proud of?

03:47:45.820 --> 03:47:47.420
That's a powerful question, man.

03:47:49.620 --> 03:47:51.180
Have you figured it out yet yourself?

03:47:51.180 --> 03:47:54.860
No, I think I'm a grand total of seven days

03:47:54.860 --> 03:47:56.260
smarter than I was at 27.

03:47:57.140 --> 03:47:57.980
It's not a good average.

03:47:57.980 --> 03:47:58.820
It's progress.

03:48:00.260 --> 03:48:01.100
There's still time.

03:48:01.100 --> 03:48:02.660
There's still time.

03:48:02.660 --> 03:48:07.120
So for all the young people out there deciding what to do,

03:48:08.500 --> 03:48:10.720
I would just say the same thing that I do say

03:48:10.720 --> 03:48:12.400
and I will say to my own kids.

03:48:12.400 --> 03:48:14.360
You only have one life.

03:48:14.360 --> 03:48:16.560
You only have one chance.

03:48:16.560 --> 03:48:20.320
If you spend it doing what other people expect you to do,

03:48:21.240 --> 03:48:25.400
you will wake up to your regret at some point.

03:48:25.400 --> 03:48:29.200
I woke up when I was 38 years old.

03:48:29.200 --> 03:48:32.020
My wife in many ways is still waking up to it

03:48:32.020 --> 03:48:34.800
as she watches her grandparents pass

03:48:34.800 --> 03:48:37.460
and an older generation pass away.

03:48:38.460 --> 03:48:42.860
The folks that really have a blessed life

03:48:42.860 --> 03:48:45.140
are the people who learn early on

03:48:45.140 --> 03:48:49.260
to live with their own rules, live their own way

03:48:50.100 --> 03:48:52.860
and live every day as if it's the last day.

03:48:53.700 --> 03:48:58.080
Not necessarily to waste it by being wasteful or silly,

03:48:58.080 --> 03:48:59.980
but to recognize that today is a day

03:48:59.980 --> 03:49:04.500
to be productive and constructive for yourself.

03:49:04.500 --> 03:49:06.060
If you don't want a career,

03:49:06.140 --> 03:49:07.900
today's not the day to start pursuing a career

03:49:07.900 --> 03:49:09.720
just because someone else told you to do it.

03:49:09.720 --> 03:49:11.180
If you wanna learn a language,

03:49:11.180 --> 03:49:13.740
today's a day to find a way to buy a ticket

03:49:13.740 --> 03:49:15.740
to another country and learn through immersion.

03:49:15.740 --> 03:49:17.980
If you want a date, if you wanna get married,

03:49:17.980 --> 03:49:21.540
if you want a business, today is the day to just go out

03:49:21.540 --> 03:49:25.220
and take one step in that direction.

03:49:25.220 --> 03:49:28.640
And as long as you, every day you just make one new step,

03:49:28.640 --> 03:49:32.140
just like CIA recruited me, just do the next thing.

03:49:32.140 --> 03:49:34.520
If the step seems like it's too big,

03:49:34.520 --> 03:49:36.080
then there's probably two other steps

03:49:36.080 --> 03:49:37.680
that you can do before that.

03:49:37.680 --> 03:49:40.440
Just make constant progress, build momentum,

03:49:40.440 --> 03:49:43.960
move forward and live on your own terms.

03:49:43.960 --> 03:49:47.040
That way you don't ever wake up to the regret.

03:49:47.040 --> 03:49:50.000
And it'll be over before you know it.

03:49:50.000 --> 03:49:52.000
Whether you regret it or not, it's true.

03:49:53.000 --> 03:49:55.540
What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

03:49:55.540 --> 03:49:56.720
What's the meaning of life?

03:49:56.720 --> 03:49:57.800
Self-respect.

03:49:59.040 --> 03:50:00.260
That's a fast answer.

03:50:00.260 --> 03:50:01.960
There's a story behind it if you want the story.

03:50:01.960 --> 03:50:03.720
I would love to have the story.

03:50:03.720 --> 03:50:08.080
There's a covert training base in Alabama in south,

03:50:08.080 --> 03:50:10.200
far south in like the armpit of America

03:50:10.200 --> 03:50:12.760
where elite tier one operators go

03:50:12.760 --> 03:50:16.120
to learn human intelligence stuff.

03:50:16.120 --> 03:50:18.960
And there's a bar inside this base.

03:50:18.960 --> 03:50:23.960
And on the wall is just, it's scribbles of opinions.

03:50:25.880 --> 03:50:28.000
And the question in the middle of the wall says,

03:50:28.000 --> 03:50:29.400
what's the meaning of life?

03:50:29.400 --> 03:50:33.100
And all these elite operators over the last 25 or 30 years,

03:50:33.100 --> 03:50:35.540
they all go, they get drunk and they scribble their answer

03:50:35.540 --> 03:50:37.340
and they circle it with a Sharpie, right?

03:50:37.340 --> 03:50:41.540
Love, family, America, freedom, right?

03:50:41.540 --> 03:50:42.500
Whatever.

03:50:42.500 --> 03:50:43.740
And then the only thing they have to do is

03:50:43.740 --> 03:50:45.160
if they're gonna write something on there,

03:50:45.160 --> 03:50:48.140
they have to connect it with something else on the wall,

03:50:48.140 --> 03:50:49.100
at least one other thing.

03:50:49.100 --> 03:50:50.980
So if they write love, they can't just leave it

03:50:50.980 --> 03:50:53.660
floating there, they have to write love in a little bubble

03:50:53.660 --> 03:50:54.980
and connect it to something else,

03:50:54.980 --> 03:50:56.740
connect it to family, whatever else.

03:50:56.740 --> 03:50:58.080
When you look at that wall,

03:50:59.980 --> 03:51:02.740
the word self-respect is on the wall.

03:51:02.740 --> 03:51:04.460
And it's got a circle around it.

03:51:04.460 --> 03:51:06.620
And then you can't see any other word

03:51:06.620 --> 03:51:09.680
because of all the things that connect to self-respect.

03:51:10.800 --> 03:51:13.980
Just dozens of people have written over,

03:51:13.980 --> 03:51:16.000
have written their words down and been drawn

03:51:16.000 --> 03:51:17.860
and scribbled over because of all the lines

03:51:17.860 --> 03:51:19.220
that connect with self-respect.

03:51:19.220 --> 03:51:20.900
So what's the meaning of life?

03:51:20.900 --> 03:51:24.180
From my point of view, I've never seen a better answer.

03:51:24.180 --> 03:51:25.140
It's all self-respect.

03:51:25.140 --> 03:51:26.180
If you don't respect yourself,

03:51:26.180 --> 03:51:27.540
how can you do anything else?

03:51:27.540 --> 03:51:28.420
How can you love someone else

03:51:28.420 --> 03:51:29.740
if you don't have self-respect?

03:51:29.740 --> 03:51:31.060
How can you build the business you're proud of

03:51:31.060 --> 03:51:32.000
if you don't have self-respect?

03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:33.240
How can you raise kids?

03:51:33.240 --> 03:51:34.440
How can you make a difference?

03:51:34.440 --> 03:51:36.040
How can you pioneer anything?

03:51:36.040 --> 03:51:39.120
How can you just wake up and have a good day

03:51:39.120 --> 03:51:41.300
if you don't have self-respect?

03:51:42.800 --> 03:51:44.240
The power of the individual,

03:51:44.240 --> 03:51:48.360
that's what makes this country great.

03:51:48.360 --> 03:51:52.240
I have to say, after traveling quite a bit in Europe

03:51:52.240 --> 03:51:55.760
and especially in a place of war,

03:51:55.760 --> 03:51:57.120
coming back to the United States

03:51:57.120 --> 03:51:58.440
makes me really appreciate

03:51:58.440 --> 03:52:02.280
about the better angels of this nation,

03:52:02.280 --> 03:52:04.960
the ideals it stands for, the values it stands for.

03:52:04.960 --> 03:52:09.960
And I'd like to thank you for serving this nation for time

03:52:10.040 --> 03:52:12.640
and humanity for time,

03:52:12.640 --> 03:52:16.800
and for being brave enough and bold enough

03:52:16.800 --> 03:52:19.480
to still talk about it and to inspire others,

03:52:19.480 --> 03:52:24.480
to educate others, for having many amazing conversations

03:52:25.120 --> 03:52:28.720
and for honoring me by having this conversation today.

03:52:28.720 --> 03:52:30.080
You're an amazing human.

03:52:30.080 --> 03:52:31.360
Thanks so much for talking today.

03:52:31.360 --> 03:52:32.760
Lex, I appreciate the invite, man.

03:52:32.760 --> 03:52:33.600
It was a joy.

03:52:34.600 --> 03:52:36.240
Thanks for listening to this conversation

03:52:36.240 --> 03:52:38.000
with Andrew Bustamante.

03:52:38.000 --> 03:52:39.140

03:52:44.100 --> 03:52:47.020
from Sun Tzu in the art of war.

03:52:47.920 --> 03:52:52.160
Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night.

03:52:52.200 --> 03:52:55.440
And when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.

03:52:56.800 --> 03:52:59.440
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
