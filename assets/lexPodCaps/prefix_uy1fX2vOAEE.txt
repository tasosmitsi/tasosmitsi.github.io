00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
The following is a conversation with Jimmy Pedro,

00:02.720 --> 00:05.200
a legendary judo competitor and coach.

00:05.200 --> 00:08.580
He represented the United States at four Olympics

00:08.580 --> 00:12.140
in 92, 96, 2000, and 2004,

00:12.140 --> 00:14.680
winning a bronze medal at two of them.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.480
He medaled in three world championships,

00:17.480 --> 00:20.100
winning gold in 1999.

00:20.100 --> 00:23.640
He has coached many of the elite level American judoka,

00:23.640 --> 00:26.100
including Kayla Harrison, Ronda Rousey,

00:26.100 --> 00:28.460
Travis Stevens, and many others.

00:28.460 --> 00:32.880
Plus, he's now my judo coach, along with Travis Stevens.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.940
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:34.940 --> 00:36.940
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:36.940 --> 00:38.320
in the description.

00:38.320 --> 00:42.260
And now, here's my conversation with Jimmy Pedro.

00:43.140 --> 00:46.600
What is the most beautiful throw in judo, to you?

00:47.740 --> 00:49.340
I think Uchi Mata.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.380
You know, it's the one that seems to have

00:51.380 --> 00:52.980
the most amplitude.

00:52.980 --> 00:54.420
Person goes the highest.

00:54.420 --> 00:57.220
You see a leg swing through the middle,

00:57.220 --> 00:58.380
the person doing the throw,

00:58.380 --> 00:59.620
there's a leg swinging through the middle.

00:59.620 --> 01:02.020
The other person definitely goes, you know,

01:02.020 --> 01:04.680
head over heels, flat on their back.

01:04.680 --> 01:06.420
It's probably the most dynamic,

01:06.420 --> 01:08.080
pretty judo throw there is.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.500
Okay, so it's a single,

01:09.500 --> 01:11.060
you're standing on a single foot,

01:11.060 --> 01:13.180
and you're raising your other foot in the air,

01:13.180 --> 01:14.740
and it's a forward throw,

01:14.740 --> 01:19.500
which means your back is facing the opponent,

01:19.500 --> 01:23.060
but they kind of both fly through the air

01:23.060 --> 01:24.460
and twist through the air.

01:24.460 --> 01:25.520
Correct.

01:25.520 --> 01:28.400
Yeah, so how does that throw work?

01:28.400 --> 01:30.400
What are the principles behind that throw?

01:30.400 --> 01:33.440
It's one of those throws that, you know,

01:33.440 --> 01:35.200
people can kind of understand

01:35.200 --> 01:36.880
how to pick up another human being

01:36.880 --> 01:38.720
in sort of trivial ways,

01:38.720 --> 01:40.240
but the Uchi Mata, to me,

01:40.240 --> 01:43.840
never quite made sense, like, why it works.

01:43.840 --> 01:47.360
There's a cork, there's a twisting motion.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.720
There's some involvement of the hip,

01:49.720 --> 01:52.920
but it's not really a hip throw,

01:52.920 --> 01:55.600
because the hip is not all the way over,

01:55.600 --> 01:58.200
so it's not, it's a very confusing throw.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.800
I'm trying to say, can you say something for us?

02:00.800 --> 02:02.680
It's probably one of the most difficult throws

02:02.680 --> 02:04.980
to learn as well, because it is so complex.

02:04.980 --> 02:06.600
You do have to stand on one leg,

02:06.600 --> 02:08.120
balance on one leg, you know,

02:08.120 --> 02:10.040
swing your other leg through the middle,

02:10.040 --> 02:12.040
hold your opponent up in the air,

02:12.040 --> 02:16.080
and it's hard to make that contact

02:16.080 --> 02:18.400
with upper body to your back.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.600
You know, you have to turn your back

02:19.600 --> 02:20.480
on the throw as well.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.640
So how does it work?

02:22.640 --> 02:24.880
It's definitely sort of a throw

02:24.880 --> 02:27.940
where you need to start pulling your opponent's

02:27.940 --> 02:30.440
upper body towards you, right?

02:30.440 --> 02:32.620
So their upper body starts coming towards you.

02:32.620 --> 02:35.120
Your legs go towards them

02:35.120 --> 02:38.400
as your body starts to go into the throw.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.880
So your head is gonna go left, let's say.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.600
Your legs are gonna go to the right.

02:43.600 --> 02:47.340
Your partner's gonna start to lean towards you.

02:47.340 --> 02:50.520
And just as you start to get their momentum coming forward,

02:50.560 --> 02:53.400
your leg is gonna sweep up underneath theirs,

02:53.400 --> 02:55.280
pick them up onto your hip, right?

02:55.280 --> 02:57.300
And then the finish of the throw is a twist.

02:57.300 --> 02:59.280
And a lot of times the good judoka

02:59.280 --> 03:01.600
will leave their feet when they do the throw.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.080
So both bodies are in the air together.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.120
And then the thrower comes down on top

03:06.120 --> 03:07.560
of the person being thrown.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.320
So all four feet are in the air.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.160
Correct.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.360
So there's just this unstoppable force of twist.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.760
So you're all in the air.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.840
You're basically doing a roll together.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.440
Correct.

03:17.440 --> 03:21.720
Okay, so who to you is the best Uchimata,

03:21.720 --> 03:23.680
who has, besides yourself?

03:23.680 --> 03:25.960
I'm not gonna lie.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.360
There's plenty of guys that do Uchimata

03:28.360 --> 03:29.800
a lot better than I do.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.840
You do have a nice video about the Uchimata online,

03:31.840 --> 03:36.160
but who is a great practitioner of the Uchimata to you?

03:36.160 --> 03:37.840
Right now, Shohei Ono,

03:37.840 --> 03:39.760
who's two-time Olympic gold medalist.

03:39.760 --> 03:40.960
That's his favorite throw.

03:40.960 --> 03:44.360
And there's tons of highlight videos on the IJF

03:44.360 --> 03:47.720
and judo fanatics showing how he does his Uchimata.

03:47.720 --> 03:50.560
And it is quite different than everybody else's.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.040
But it's unstoppable.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.400
When he comes in, nobody stops it.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.000
He's won two golds in a row at the Olympics.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.480
I think maybe in the last eight years,

03:57.480 --> 03:59.320
the guys lost two matches.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.880
He's just incredible.

04:00.880 --> 04:05.080
At a very competitive division, I guess, 73 kilos?

04:05.080 --> 04:05.920
Okay.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.680
And then three-time world champ too.

04:08.680 --> 04:11.040
Is he the greatest of all time to you?

04:11.880 --> 04:14.560
The only reason why he's not is because Nomura

04:14.560 --> 04:15.880
is a 60-kilo player.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.400
He was three-time Olympic champion.

04:18.400 --> 04:21.440
So Nomura, I mean, unless Ono's gonna stick around

04:21.440 --> 04:26.440
for another three years and win again here in Paris,

04:26.600 --> 04:28.240
then he'd match what Nomura did.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.400
But three-time gold medalist in judo

04:30.400 --> 04:34.240
in a lightweight division, that's pretty spectacular.

04:34.240 --> 04:38.760
So to you, being able to win a championship,

04:38.760 --> 04:41.880
world championship or Olympic medal

04:41.880 --> 04:43.960
is a measure of greatness.

04:43.960 --> 04:47.000
It's not like you have some people

04:47.000 --> 04:48.120
who are not as accomplished,

04:48.120 --> 04:49.960
like Koga or something like that.

04:49.960 --> 04:54.960
But just the beauty, the moments of magic,

04:55.040 --> 04:57.640
the number of moments of magic is the highest,

04:57.640 --> 04:59.560
even if it's not championships.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.000
I think you have to go by that

05:01.000 --> 05:04.080
because there's so many phenomenal judo players

05:04.080 --> 05:07.280
that have come through the system of spectacular judo.

05:08.280 --> 05:11.560
You have won countless major events,

05:11.560 --> 05:13.920
but the ability to pull it together, right,

05:13.920 --> 05:16.480
at those magical moments, the pinnacle of the sport,

05:16.480 --> 05:18.720
the world championships, the Olympic Games,

05:18.720 --> 05:21.560
and proving that you can do it time and time again

05:21.560 --> 05:24.400
makes you unstoppable, it makes you the best.

05:24.400 --> 05:27.080
There was a guy back in the 70s and 80s

05:27.080 --> 05:28.440
by the name of Fuji,

05:28.440 --> 05:32.280
and he won four world championships back to back.

05:32.280 --> 05:35.000
And back then, the Worlds was every two years.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.640
So here he was, a four-time world champion.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.960
That's eight years the top of the sport.

05:39.960 --> 05:43.720
He never won an Olympic medal.

05:43.720 --> 05:45.560
He never went to the Olympics.

05:45.560 --> 05:48.840
So there's a guy who missed out on Olympic greatness,

05:48.840 --> 05:52.520
but was arguably the best competitor back in that period.

05:52.520 --> 05:56.280
By the way, same Fuji as Fuji?

05:56.280 --> 05:57.120
Right.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.040
Really? Okay.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.600
Wow, I didn't know there was an actual guy, Fuji.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.520
Our brand is named after the mountain, Mount Fuji.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.600
But this is a different guy, his name was Fuji.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.520
All right, well, history rhymes.

06:10.640 --> 06:13.320
What about Teddy Renair?

06:13.320 --> 06:15.400
10-time world champ, I think.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.560
Two-time gold medalist at the Olympics.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.480
Two-time bronze medalist at the Olympics.

06:22.720 --> 06:26.320
Probably the most dominant judoka ever.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.240
Is he in the running?

06:27.240 --> 06:28.960
What do you think about that guy?

06:28.960 --> 06:32.120
I think he's a freak of nature, Teddy.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.520
If you look at the size, just how big he,

06:34.520 --> 06:36.520
how tall he is, how big he is,

06:36.520 --> 06:38.600
how physical he is of a specimen.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.640
Like I sat next to him on a bus

06:40.640 --> 06:45.640
and like his legs are literally the size of my waist.

06:45.800 --> 06:48.040
Like when you sit next to him and just look at the size,

06:48.040 --> 06:49.760
he's a big man.

06:49.760 --> 06:54.120
So obviously to win 10 world titles in the sport of judo,

06:54.120 --> 06:58.800
I mean, that's almost an incomprehensible feat,

06:58.800 --> 07:00.560
two-time Olympic champion again.

07:01.560 --> 07:06.040
But it puts him in one of the maybe 10 or 12 people

07:06.040 --> 07:08.120
that ever do that in the history of the sport.

07:08.120 --> 07:11.520
So he's definitely got to be in the running for the best.

07:11.520 --> 07:15.600
But technically, I don't think he's as technical

07:15.600 --> 07:16.640
as some of the other.

07:17.960 --> 07:21.880
In terms of pure judo finesse technique,

07:21.880 --> 07:26.840
he's powerful, he's explosive, he's dominant, he's strong.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.000
Teddy also grips really, really well,

07:29.000 --> 07:32.400
which makes him that much tougher to beat

07:32.400 --> 07:34.160
because a lot of times heavyweights,

07:34.160 --> 07:35.080
especially the heavyweight division,

07:35.080 --> 07:38.480
a lot of them just grab the gi and they go man to man

07:38.480 --> 07:41.240
and judo to judo and take shots at each other.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.600
And that's why a lot of them end up getting beat.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.920
But Teddy's in control, like positionally,

07:45.920 --> 07:47.880
he stays in really good position

07:47.880 --> 07:49.920
and he controls his opponent the whole fight.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.240
So they really don't have a chance against him.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.120
He doesn't give them a chance to beat him,

07:54.120 --> 07:55.640
which is why he's been so dominant.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.400
But he's not really stalling.

07:57.440 --> 08:01.760
So I mean, he does have a really nice sort of gari,

08:01.760 --> 08:06.760
this backward trip, outside trip, in case people don't know.

08:07.080 --> 08:11.320
I mean, he has just technically pretty good throws

08:11.320 --> 08:12.840
for heavyweight.

08:12.840 --> 08:16.880
Heavyweights can be sometimes messy with their judo.

08:16.880 --> 08:21.600
He's pretty technical and clean

08:21.600 --> 08:24.080
in the execution of his big throws.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.280
But a lot of that probably has to do

08:26.280 --> 08:28.360
with the dominant gripping that he does.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.640
It's not defensive gripping, it's offensive gripping,

08:30.640 --> 08:32.280
but the dominant gripping.

08:32.280 --> 08:33.120
100%.

08:33.120 --> 08:36.040
He controls the grips, he controls the movement

08:36.040 --> 08:37.920
of the match as a result of that,

08:37.920 --> 08:39.720
and then he creates his own openings.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.320
So I mean, for a heavyweight, phenomenal technique, yes.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.400
And what you said, messy, I like to call it sloppy, right?

08:46.400 --> 08:49.480
A lot of the heavyweights tend to be sloppy.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.520
They fall on the ground a lot.

08:51.520 --> 08:54.440
It's hard to move somebody that weighs 350 pounds.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.000
It's hard to get that body moving

08:56.000 --> 08:58.400
and just with the simple pull motion.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.920
So he's definitely found a way to do it.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.600
But he's also, I don't know, six foot eight.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.480
He probably weighs 140 kilos.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.800
He's a big boy.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.240
But he had this winning streak of just,

09:10.240 --> 09:13.040
I don't know how long, but like over 100 matches.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.440
And he lost at this Olympics

09:16.440 --> 09:18.120
that we just went through, the 20,

09:18.120 --> 09:20.320
I don't even know what to call it, 2021 Olympics.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.840
I don't know the proper terminology.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.120
Tokyo 2020 is what they call it.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.240
Tokyo 2020, all right.

09:26.240 --> 09:30.120
So he lost to Tamerlan Basheev.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.040
I mean, it's always sad to see

09:33.040 --> 09:34.880
a sort of greatness come to an end.

09:34.880 --> 09:39.080
It's like Karelin in wrestling and Greco-Roman.

09:39.080 --> 09:42.240
Did you shed a bit of a tear to see greatness go?

09:44.600 --> 09:46.480
Or is it just the way of life?

09:47.680 --> 09:50.560
I mean, what did you think about sort of this dominance,

09:50.560 --> 09:53.800
this run of dominance being stopped?

09:54.720 --> 09:56.160
It's obviously sad to see.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.560
I love seeing champions succeed,

09:58.560 --> 10:00.480
especially people that are good people.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.720
And I think Teddy's a good person.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.320
I think there's some arrogant champions

10:04.320 --> 10:06.120
that everybody would like to see lose

10:06.120 --> 10:10.080
just because they don't want to deal with their personality.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.000
But I think Teddy's a very humble champion.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.560
He's a people's champion.

10:16.720 --> 10:17.880
I think he's been privileged,

10:17.880 --> 10:19.800
and he makes good money from the sport of judo

10:19.800 --> 10:21.880
and the French Federation has taken care of him well.

10:21.880 --> 10:25.360
So he's a lifelong judo icon.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.680
So it's sad to see somebody like that get beat,

10:27.680 --> 10:29.200
especially when this could have been

10:29.200 --> 10:30.760
his third Olympic title

10:30.760 --> 10:35.760
and just put him in infamy.

10:36.680 --> 10:38.120
So it was sad to see,

10:38.120 --> 10:42.080
but I think every athlete goes through it, right?

10:42.080 --> 10:45.840
I mean, it's just, that's what the Olympics is all about.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.480
The great ones fall sometimes.

10:48.480 --> 10:53.000
Especially in judo, it's like the margin of error.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.600
I mean, I guess the other question I want to ask here

10:55.600 --> 10:57.680
is in your sense,

10:57.680 --> 11:01.320
how difficult it is to not lose for so long.

11:02.280 --> 11:06.800
It seems like in judo, like a little mistake and it's over.

11:06.800 --> 11:10.400
There's no coming back, an epon means it's over.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.920
So how difficult is that?

11:12.920 --> 11:15.080
It's hard to stay that dominant without question.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.200
And first of all, when you are,

11:17.200 --> 11:20.280
the entire world is training against you just to beat you.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.920
They're studying every single movement.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.360
They're studying patterns.

11:24.360 --> 11:25.680
They're trying to break it down

11:25.680 --> 11:27.680
and find a flaw in your game.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.400
So everybody's hunting for you

11:29.400 --> 11:30.400
when you're the best in the world,

11:30.400 --> 11:31.240
especially at the Olympics.

11:31.240 --> 11:32.960
That's the one to beat you at.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.000
So everybody's focused on you.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.440
And then there's an incredible amount of pressure

11:37.440 --> 11:39.040
on that athlete to perform.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.040
You carry the flag for your country.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.320
When you're in opening ceremonies sometimes,

11:44.120 --> 11:45.880
all spotlight is on you.

11:46.760 --> 11:47.840
And it's particularly hard

11:47.840 --> 11:50.280
when things don't go well early.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.200
In other words, when you're expected to win

11:53.200 --> 11:55.640
and then all of a sudden now you're in a hard fight

11:55.640 --> 11:57.200
and it's not going the way you want.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.160
That pressure, the one who's the favorite

11:59.160 --> 12:01.000
feels the pressure the most at the Olympics.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.880
And that's why I think the other ones are able to win it.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.640
I've actually never gotten a chance

12:05.640 --> 12:08.480
to listen to Teddy Reneer sort of explain

12:10.040 --> 12:11.920
ideas behind his judo.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.760
I wonder what his mental game is like,

12:13.760 --> 12:16.440
because I think his English is pretty not very good.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.800
And I just haven't seen good interviews,

12:19.800 --> 12:21.520
but it's always fascinating too.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.440
There's certain great athletes

12:25.440 --> 12:28.600
that are also great thinkers and speakers,

12:28.600 --> 12:32.160
like the Satya brothers in wrestling.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.720
Again, that's on my to-do list 100%.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.200
I'm going to Dagestan and talking to them

12:38.200 --> 12:39.640
because they're brilliant.

12:39.640 --> 12:43.760
But to be able to sort of, maybe after retirement,

12:43.760 --> 12:46.560
to think back, what were the systems involved?

12:46.560 --> 12:50.880
Both on the technical, the training side,

12:50.880 --> 12:53.520
and then the mental side.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.400
Because to stay that dominant,

12:55.400 --> 12:58.520
just like you're saying, everybody's studying to beat you.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.320
And the heavyweights are just these powerful dudes.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.320
To be able to control them with your game

13:06.320 --> 13:08.800
and the game that everybody knows is coming

13:09.640 --> 13:11.760
I don't know what's behind that,

13:11.760 --> 13:13.880
but there's got to be...

13:13.880 --> 13:17.920
It feels like the mental game is exceptionally important.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.560
I think a lot of people underestimate

13:19.560 --> 13:22.200
just how important that side is.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.200
Being mentally prepared for victory,

13:24.200 --> 13:27.160
mentally prepared to be the best, to stay the best.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.440
There's no way that's weak-minded

13:30.440 --> 13:32.480
that they can accomplish that.

13:32.480 --> 13:36.560
It's 100% confidence and belief in yourself.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.640
If we take a big picture of you then,

13:38.640 --> 13:39.960
not necessarily Teddy Renair,

13:39.960 --> 13:42.600
but if you want to go from the very beginning,

13:42.600 --> 13:47.600
from day one of judo class to Olympic champion

13:47.760 --> 13:50.040
or Olympic medalist,

13:50.040 --> 13:54.160
what does it take to become an Olympic medalist in judo,

13:54.160 --> 13:56.000
from start to finish?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.360
Like how many different trajectories do you see?

13:58.360 --> 14:01.720
Or is there some unifying principles?

14:01.720 --> 14:03.160
I think a lot of it has to...

14:03.160 --> 14:07.000
Your journey is going to depend a lot by where you're from.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.120
So a path that an American might take

14:09.120 --> 14:10.960
versus somebody who's from Japan

14:10.960 --> 14:12.800
or somebody who's from Europe.

14:12.800 --> 14:16.680
There's three very distinct paths, right?

14:16.680 --> 14:19.960
Because in Japan, it's part of the culture.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.280
There's a system of excellence.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.680
There's elementary school judo,

14:24.680 --> 14:26.760
there's junior high school, there's high school,

14:26.760 --> 14:28.800
there's collegiate, there's Olympic.

14:28.840 --> 14:33.840
And much like our wrestling is here in the United States,

14:34.520 --> 14:36.520
it's very similar, there's youth wrestling,

14:36.520 --> 14:39.040
there's high school, there's NCAA,

14:39.040 --> 14:40.280
and then there's Olympic wrestling.

14:40.280 --> 14:44.040
And when your country is a factory

14:44.040 --> 14:47.160
of producing athletes at the highest level,

14:47.160 --> 14:49.680
then all of those top athletes

14:49.680 --> 14:51.320
typically go back into the sport

14:51.320 --> 14:52.600
and there's professions for them.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.920
They have an opportunity to coach

14:53.920 --> 14:55.520
at all those different levels.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.320
And just the level of their game and the expertise

14:58.840 --> 15:01.600
that all of them have, even down at the elementary level,

15:01.600 --> 15:04.200
make their skill so solid.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.000
And as a coach, in that situation,

15:06.000 --> 15:09.640
you can just sit back and watch who stands out

15:09.640 --> 15:12.200
as opposed to, I think in America, I guess,

15:12.200 --> 15:15.240
you would need to craft.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.400
You don't get to choose from a thousand people,

15:17.400 --> 15:21.200
a few people that naturally stand out at the age of nine.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.840
You have to actually,

15:24.080 --> 15:26.520
whatever the natural resources you're given,

15:26.960 --> 15:29.800
craft them into a champion.

15:30.960 --> 15:34.200
So if we look at that, the American way,

15:34.200 --> 15:36.280
where you just have a person with a smile

15:36.280 --> 15:38.320
show up to your dojo,

15:38.320 --> 15:41.120
says, I wanted to be an Olympic medalist.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.040
What process do you take them through?

15:43.040 --> 15:45.360
The odds are really insurmountable.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.600
It's a very, very high hill to climb.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.040
And there's only a few people

15:50.040 --> 15:52.680
and there's only a few coaches in this entire country

15:52.680 --> 15:55.120
that really understand that process

15:55.120 --> 15:58.280
and that can help people reach that level

15:58.280 --> 16:00.080
as it's been proven, right?

16:01.240 --> 16:05.080
Number one, you certainly have to have a solid base,

16:05.080 --> 16:08.240
a fundamental base of an expectation

16:08.240 --> 16:10.080
of what the training is gonna be.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.680
And it has to be a level of professionalism

16:12.680 --> 16:13.760
very, very early,

16:13.760 --> 16:15.800
where you're teaching all the basic judo moves,

16:15.800 --> 16:20.520
all the basic fundamental movements, posture, gripping.

16:20.520 --> 16:23.120
Well, maybe gripping doesn't come in so early in the game,

16:23.120 --> 16:26.640
but throwing methodology, movements,

16:26.640 --> 16:30.880
naiwaaza position, standing fundamental throws.

16:30.880 --> 16:33.960
And I think most importantly is really the work ethic,

16:33.960 --> 16:35.800
just the way you're gonna train,

16:35.800 --> 16:37.360
the intensity you're gonna train with,

16:37.360 --> 16:40.080
the ability to, the mindset of going

16:40.080 --> 16:42.440
to tournaments constantly.

16:42.440 --> 16:44.360
In order to compete with the rest of the world,

16:44.360 --> 16:49.360
our young kids need to be tested a lot when they're young.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.440
They have to be put through adversity

16:51.440 --> 16:53.240
because they don't get put through adversity in training

16:53.240 --> 16:55.040
because you don't have that many good training partners.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.800
So you get put through adversity in competition.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.520
And then we see what your weaknesses are

16:59.520 --> 17:02.600
and we continue to make improvements on those.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.040
But the journey is, it's long.

17:05.040 --> 17:08.120
And until they're kind of at the teenage years,

17:08.120 --> 17:10.200
they're gonna have to pretty much stay domestic, right?

17:10.200 --> 17:12.600
Cause they got to go through life as a normal kid,

17:12.600 --> 17:14.280
but they've got to be training in the dojo

17:14.280 --> 17:17.080
at least five days a week.

17:17.080 --> 17:20.400
Sometimes they might wanna get an extra technical workout in

17:20.480 --> 17:23.160
or doing some base conditioning in addition to that.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.720
And then really at the teenage years,

17:24.720 --> 17:28.760
that's where we really, we've struggled in America

17:28.760 --> 17:31.920
of keeping teens in the sport of Judo

17:31.920 --> 17:34.520
as well as developing them properly.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.280
Because up until around the teenage years,

17:36.280 --> 17:38.200
I think the Americans are on par

17:38.200 --> 17:40.680
with the rest of the world in terms of technique

17:40.680 --> 17:41.800
and in terms of skill.

17:41.800 --> 17:45.880
And we've proven we can compete with the rest of the world

17:45.880 --> 17:49.200
up until that age, but that's where Japan

17:49.280 --> 17:50.760
and that's where the Europeans

17:50.760 --> 17:52.920
and the countries that are strong in Judo,

17:52.920 --> 17:55.400
that's where they put a lot of time, energy and effort

17:55.400 --> 17:59.120
is it's at a teens where they have a great coaching staff,

17:59.120 --> 18:01.960
they have good training camps with 800,

18:01.960 --> 18:04.720
a thousand people going to them every single weekend.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.280
When you say teens, what do you mean?

18:07.280 --> 18:09.000
Do you mean literally like 13?

18:09.000 --> 18:12.480
Yeah, age 13 to 17, 13 to 19.

18:12.480 --> 18:15.680
And that's when you really accelerate your development.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.720
So you're saying like in America,

18:17.720 --> 18:22.720
when you're young, like before nine, 10, 11, 12,

18:23.080 --> 18:26.120
you stick in Judo, you can progress quite a bit.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.920
But then I guess the other competition there,

18:28.920 --> 18:33.080
if you're into two people

18:35.480 --> 18:39.000
doing stuff to each other in a combative way,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.640
the other competitor in America is wrestling.

18:41.640 --> 18:45.560
So Judo almost primes you, like it teaches you

18:45.560 --> 18:47.560
how to be a great wrestler as well.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.800
And so then you have to have a hard decision

18:51.680 --> 18:54.320
because you can probably be a collegiate wrestler.

18:55.640 --> 19:00.080
You have like a clear plan of where you're going to go

19:00.080 --> 19:02.480
if you wanna be a wrestler, where Judo,

19:02.480 --> 19:07.280
that plan is less clear.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.360
So you have to be on your own a bit with your coach,

19:10.360 --> 19:11.200
that kind of thing.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.120
Exactly.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.440
Okay, so when you're on your own with your coach,

19:14.440 --> 19:16.160
to me, that's just a fascinating journey

19:16.160 --> 19:19.160
because then it's just like the purity of it.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.680
It's the coach and the athlete and the dream.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.520
It's all about the dedication,

19:24.520 --> 19:27.560
the five, six, seven days a week,

19:27.560 --> 19:32.200
competing, what, once a month, twice a month.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.360
Twice a month.

19:33.360 --> 19:35.480
Okay, and just, but also,

19:35.480 --> 19:36.920
you probably don't have that conversation,

19:36.920 --> 19:38.680
I don't know if you do, maybe you do,

19:38.680 --> 19:41.800
saying like, we're gonna do this for the next eight years.

19:42.520 --> 19:43.360
Right.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.480
Do you ever sit down, would you just do it,

19:46.480 --> 19:48.040
take it the David Goggins way,

19:48.040 --> 19:50.760
which is like, let's just take it one step at a time.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.120
Let's hope we're there in eight years.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.240
Yeah, let's hope we're there.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.080
Do you like actually-

19:56.080 --> 19:58.240
Well, no, like right now, you have to think about

19:58.240 --> 20:02.080
the Olympics is gonna be in Los Angeles in 2028.

20:02.080 --> 20:05.080
So it's really interesting, now would be the time,

20:05.080 --> 20:08.720
and now is the time, to identify talent

20:08.720 --> 20:11.560
and get commitment out of students

20:12.120 --> 20:14.960
that in seven years, you can make a U.S. Olympic team,

20:14.960 --> 20:17.360
because we're gonna have a full team.

20:17.360 --> 20:20.240
America's gonna have 14 athletes compete in those games,

20:20.240 --> 20:21.720
one in every weight class.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.800
So now is the time, if you're gonna go on a journey

20:23.800 --> 20:26.040
to the Olympics and stay with the sport of judo,

20:26.040 --> 20:28.520
now would be the time to do it, you know?

20:28.520 --> 20:33.280
And so what, you show up to the Pedro Judo Center,

20:33.280 --> 20:36.640
and how much drilling,

20:36.640 --> 20:39.880
how much technique strategy discussions,

20:39.920 --> 20:43.120
how much randori, or like live sparring,

20:43.120 --> 20:45.920
how much conditioning and strength training,

20:47.040 --> 20:48.200
how much of all of that?

20:49.320 --> 20:51.320
How much of cross training to other gyms

20:51.320 --> 20:53.760
or something like that, traveling abroad,

20:53.760 --> 20:56.200
is there something to be said about us,

20:56.200 --> 20:57.560
some aspects of that system?

20:57.560 --> 21:00.440
For sure, you need it all, what you just said,

21:00.440 --> 21:02.240
we needed all of it, and we do do all of that.

21:02.240 --> 21:05.120
Right now, we have a young group of kids at the academy,

21:05.120 --> 21:09.400
you'll see tonight, some of them are 14, 13, 15, 17.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.240
Are they good?

21:10.240 --> 21:11.080
Yeah, really good.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.600
Okay, can't wait.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.360
They're right around your waist, so it'll be perfect.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.200
That's nice.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.800
They're just young boys,

21:17.800 --> 21:20.560
but they've been training hard through COVID.

21:20.560 --> 21:23.800
We've been, Travis and myself have been training them,

21:23.800 --> 21:26.240
we share responsibilities.

21:26.240 --> 21:28.920
They're doing randori like five nights a week,

21:28.920 --> 21:33.840
we have them doing randori Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays,

21:33.840 --> 21:36.520
Fridays, and Sundays is when they're doing randori,

21:36.520 --> 21:37.800
they're coming to the dojo Friday night

21:37.800 --> 21:39.400
and Sunday night to do training.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.640
We also have technical sessions for them,

21:42.640 --> 21:44.680
they're in school now, so it's a little bit challenging,

21:44.680 --> 21:46.520
but they come five o'clock in the afternoon

21:46.520 --> 21:48.240
and they do a technical session.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.360
Through COVID, they will come in every morning

21:50.360 --> 21:51.760
doing technical sessions.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.200
What's a technical session?

21:53.200 --> 21:57.560
It's an hour of repetitive throwing or repetitive drilling

21:57.560 --> 22:01.000
to reinforce movements that we deem important

22:01.000 --> 22:03.120
to our successful system.

22:03.120 --> 22:06.080
So, nawaza positions, groundwork positions,

22:06.080 --> 22:08.240
where we want them to be in this position

22:08.240 --> 22:10.400
and they're gonna drill it 50 times.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.960
With resistance, in big groups,

22:12.960 --> 22:15.080
doing drills over and over again,

22:15.080 --> 22:17.320
picking apart the details of the technique

22:17.320 --> 22:19.920
and what they're doing wrong, showing them how to fix it,

22:19.920 --> 22:21.320
but now we've done it so much

22:21.320 --> 22:23.640
that now we can do a whole drill session with them

22:23.640 --> 22:26.400
where they know all the different techniques inside and out

22:26.400 --> 22:29.000
and they can move from position to position really quickly.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.760
Do they do it for a period of time,

22:31.760 --> 22:33.920
like two minutes, five minutes,

22:33.920 --> 22:37.040
or is it like one, two, they're actually counting?

22:37.040 --> 22:38.680
No, sometimes it's both.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.200
So sometimes we do it for reps,

22:40.200 --> 22:42.360
sometimes we do it for time.

22:42.360 --> 22:45.880
So sometimes it might be as many as they can do in 60 seconds

22:45.880 --> 22:47.960
or as many as they can do in two minutes.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.280
And sometimes it might just be,

22:49.280 --> 22:51.840
I want you to do every position five times.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.640
In terms of throws,

22:53.640 --> 22:55.600
we're not talking about on a crash pad, right?

22:55.600 --> 22:56.440
It's just-

22:56.440 --> 22:58.600
We're talking about free moving around the mat.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.480
And just dynamically and just throwing.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.320
Correct.

23:02.320 --> 23:06.840
For me, because as I was mentioning to you offline,

23:06.840 --> 23:08.280
Travis threw me a few times,

23:09.160 --> 23:11.760
a lot of times when he was visiting in Austin.

23:11.760 --> 23:15.880
And I just remembered, so there's two things,

23:15.880 --> 23:18.400
fortunately or unfortunately in my life,

23:18.400 --> 23:22.760
having gotten a chance to train with folks of that level,

23:22.760 --> 23:25.200
just cleanness of throw and the power.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.600
And it was very nice.

23:26.600 --> 23:30.040
I immediately actually enjoyed being thrown like that,

23:30.880 --> 23:33.160
to throw a little shade at Craig Jones

23:33.160 --> 23:34.840
with his current mat situation,

23:36.080 --> 23:38.400
is they're very, they were quite thin.

23:39.480 --> 23:41.200
And as Travis commented on,

23:41.200 --> 23:42.800
and not just the thinness of the mats,

23:42.800 --> 23:45.560
but they were laid on like concrete, right?

23:45.560 --> 23:49.240
So I felt, it's like soft until it's not.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.800
But being thrown very cleanly,

23:53.800 --> 23:55.040
I just felt like there's,

23:55.040 --> 23:57.080
this is not gonna lead to injury, it was great.

23:57.080 --> 23:59.040
It wasn't injury prone.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.880
But then, as I mentioned to you,

24:00.880 --> 24:04.600
when a day or two after, my entire leg,

24:04.600 --> 24:06.600
one of them, I guess it's the left leg,

24:08.040 --> 24:11.320
was just black, a bruise.

24:11.320 --> 24:12.640
It didn't hurt too bad,

24:12.640 --> 24:14.480
but it was just the body's gotten soft.

24:14.480 --> 24:17.080
So I guess the question I have is,

24:17.080 --> 24:21.480
does the body get used to just that number of throws,

24:21.480 --> 24:26.320
just over time being thrown thousands of times a month?

24:26.320 --> 24:28.760
Unquestionably, your body gets used to it.

24:29.320 --> 24:31.280
So it hardens, it gets really hard,

24:31.280 --> 24:34.360
which is why judo is hard to come back to

24:34.360 --> 24:36.160
after you've taken a long period of time off,

24:36.160 --> 24:39.000
because your body is not used to that impact anymore.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.880
And I always found out that,

24:40.880 --> 24:42.480
when I was training judo a lot,

24:42.480 --> 24:46.520
it's hard to shed weight and keep weight off,

24:46.520 --> 24:51.000
because your body develops this layer of protection

24:51.000 --> 24:53.360
on itself that it doesn't wanna give up.

24:53.360 --> 24:54.520
When you're sucking a lot of weight,

24:54.520 --> 24:55.920
that means you're frail.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.200
I always seem to retain weight more

24:59.200 --> 25:00.600
when you're doing hard judo training,

25:00.600 --> 25:02.960
as opposed to losing weight.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.360
It's easy when you go out for runs and things like that

25:05.360 --> 25:06.640
to shed the water weight,

25:06.640 --> 25:09.520
but to actually keep the pounds off was pretty hard.

25:09.520 --> 25:11.040
Yeah, the body kind of develops,

25:11.040 --> 25:12.840
like you said, a level of protection.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.560
What about the randori?

25:14.560 --> 25:16.160
Just out of curiosity, again,

25:16.160 --> 25:18.960
I haven't ever had the opportunity to train

25:18.960 --> 25:20.440
with folks at a high level.

25:22.520 --> 25:25.800
In jiu-jitsu, there's different gyms

25:26.640 --> 25:27.480
and different styles,

25:27.480 --> 25:29.200
but I've noticed that at the highest levels,

25:29.200 --> 25:33.240
people can go pretty hard in a certain kind of way

25:33.240 --> 25:36.560
where it's more technical and you're not,

25:36.560 --> 25:39.600
you're moving at 100%,

25:39.600 --> 25:43.640
but the power is not at 100%.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.640
It's a weird little dance.

25:45.640 --> 25:50.640
You're not really forcing stuff.

25:51.120 --> 25:53.920
You're more focused on the right timing,

25:53.920 --> 25:58.160
the right positioning of hands and feet and body

25:58.160 --> 25:59.160
and all those kinds of things.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.840
You're not forcing stuff in the way you would

26:01.840 --> 26:04.200
in competition, like really the power.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.600
Does that sound similar to you

26:05.600 --> 26:07.280
for the way you tried to do randori?

26:07.280 --> 26:08.960
So there's different styles of judo.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.800
And I'd say the Japanese style,

26:10.800 --> 26:12.200
the technical style of judo

26:12.200 --> 26:14.160
is exactly what you just talked about.

26:14.160 --> 26:16.400
It's almost like two guys in pajamas, right?

26:16.400 --> 26:18.040
We're not going, we're not using,

26:18.040 --> 26:20.760
we're using minimal effort, maximum efficiency.

26:20.760 --> 26:23.720
We're moving around and we're trying to feel that movement

26:23.720 --> 26:25.960
and it's timing and finesse and technique

26:25.960 --> 26:28.080
and fun and clean throws.

26:28.080 --> 26:30.840
And when you train in Japan,

26:30.840 --> 26:34.840
you can train 15 rounds of randori, five minute rounds.

26:34.840 --> 26:38.640
That's 75 minutes of straight sparring.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.520
You can do that straight in Japan without a problem.

26:41.520 --> 26:42.840
I mean, you'll get tired, of course.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.760
You're gonna fall a lot, you're gonna throw a lot,

26:45.760 --> 26:48.120
but it's very like free feeling.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.360
And it's technical, as you explained.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.880
But then when you go to Europe

26:51.880 --> 26:53.920
and you try to do rounds with the Europeans,

26:53.920 --> 26:55.240
they are very physical.

26:55.240 --> 26:59.000
They don't have that same finesse in their training

26:59.000 --> 27:00.360
that they do in Japan.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.240
And in Europe, you'd be hard pressed

27:02.240 --> 27:04.360
to do eight rounds of randori in a night.

27:04.360 --> 27:06.440
It's so physically exhausting

27:06.440 --> 27:09.520
because so much effort is going into just fighting

27:09.520 --> 27:11.540
and fending off the gripping system

27:11.540 --> 27:13.600
and the power of your opponent.

27:13.600 --> 27:16.320
You're physically drained after eight rounds of randori.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.360
So it's a much different feel.

27:18.360 --> 27:21.600
When you say Europe, do you mean Germany, France,

27:21.600 --> 27:23.840
Britain, Russia, is there a lot?

27:23.840 --> 27:27.080
So there's a kind of similarity

27:27.080 --> 27:28.840
to all of those kinds of approaches.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.120
The only difference would be Russia,

27:30.120 --> 27:32.880
that they do a lot more active drilling,

27:32.880 --> 27:35.480
a lot more sequential movement training.

27:35.480 --> 27:38.000
They don't focus as much on randori.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.520
You'll do much fewer rounds in Russia during training camps

27:42.520 --> 27:44.120
than you would in those other countries

27:44.120 --> 27:46.800
we just talked about, France, Germany, et cetera.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.920
What about in this kind of American system

27:48.920 --> 27:53.400
where you have much less talent to work with?

27:53.400 --> 27:58.400
Is, do you just select whatever works

27:58.960 --> 28:00.080
for the particular athletes?

28:00.080 --> 28:03.600
Or do you have something you prefer in your system?

28:03.600 --> 28:05.520
So you need a combination of all of it.

28:05.520 --> 28:06.960
If you're gonna win at the Olympic level,

28:06.960 --> 28:10.300
you have to be able to deal with the finesse of the Japanese,

28:10.300 --> 28:12.340
the physicality of the Europeans.

28:12.340 --> 28:14.560
You have to focus on the ground,

28:14.560 --> 28:17.240
the naiwaza aspect, because a lot of people are weak there

28:17.240 --> 28:18.760
in the world of the sport of judo.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.400
That's a chance to win.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.880
We've sort of developed our American system of judo,

28:22.880 --> 28:26.360
at least for the last, I'd say probably the last 20 years,

28:26.360 --> 28:27.960
it'd be the American system of judo,

28:27.960 --> 28:31.600
which relies heavily on taking the individual

28:31.600 --> 28:34.080
and whatever techniques they do,

28:34.080 --> 28:37.760
perfecting those techniques and the combinations

28:37.760 --> 28:40.040
and other throws that go with those throws,

28:40.040 --> 28:43.200
but then implementing and overlaying an American system

28:43.200 --> 28:47.680
of gripping, naiwaza, conditioning, mentality,

28:47.680 --> 28:51.600
training methodology, like in game planning,

28:51.600 --> 28:52.640
to beat your opponents.

28:52.640 --> 28:55.640
And I think that's the secret sauce to success

28:55.640 --> 28:58.400
for the fair Americans, because there's no way,

28:58.400 --> 29:01.020
if we don't have eight partners to train with in a night

29:01.020 --> 29:02.760
that are gonna give us good rounds, right?

29:02.760 --> 29:06.000
We might have two, so we're gonna have the same guy,

29:06.000 --> 29:07.960
those two people, two times each.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.140
Now I have four good rounds.

29:09.140 --> 29:11.560
The rest of the rounds, I'm not being pushed to the limit.

29:11.560 --> 29:12.900
So we train differently.

29:14.240 --> 29:17.200
And a lot of times we do a lot of stuff like shark bait.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.280
When our athletes are preparing for competition,

29:19.280 --> 29:21.040
for example, when Kayla or Travis

29:21.040 --> 29:23.680
were preparing for competition,

29:23.680 --> 29:26.400
we might only have 20 people in the whole gym

29:26.400 --> 29:29.320
to work out with, those two Olympic medalists, right?

29:29.320 --> 29:30.880
And of those 20 people,

29:30.880 --> 29:33.920
maybe four of them are Travis' size.

29:33.920 --> 29:36.320
Maybe there's only one girl in the room for Kayla,

29:36.320 --> 29:37.520
she's gotta train with guys.

29:37.520 --> 29:39.920
And then the other ones are teenagers that are too weak

29:39.920 --> 29:41.480
to train with either one of them.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.800
So what we would do is just put together four or five people

29:44.800 --> 29:48.160
that could give them a challenge, and we'd line them up,

29:48.160 --> 29:50.440
and they would do a minute, a minute, a minute, a minute,

29:50.440 --> 29:53.280
and they'd do five minutes in a row as hard as they can.

29:53.280 --> 29:56.200
And that person can go hard for a minute with Travis or Kayla.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.600
They can't go five minutes hard,

29:57.600 --> 29:59.000
but they can go one minute hard.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.440
So it made their training much more intense,

30:02.440 --> 30:04.120
much more physically demanding.

30:04.120 --> 30:06.880
And then rinse and repeat that six times

30:06.880 --> 30:08.840
or eight times in a night.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.400
They just got 40 minutes of intense randori.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.120
And then they'd do a six or eight minutes of training

30:14.120 --> 30:15.560
with them that wasn't as good.

30:15.560 --> 30:16.960
Only had to do six or eight minutes

30:16.960 --> 30:18.080
of training the whole night.

30:18.080 --> 30:18.920
You know?

30:18.920 --> 30:19.760
So.

30:20.640 --> 30:23.080
It's so, it's so difficult.

30:23.080 --> 30:26.680
Because then you look at like the Russian national team

30:27.640 --> 30:32.640
and you have just the world champions and so.

30:36.160 --> 30:39.040
Or you even have like, what is it?

30:39.200 --> 30:40.040
The training system.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.680
You have like these people.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.120
It's a small group of people,

30:43.120 --> 30:45.760
but they're all some of the best people in the world.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.360
And they're going head to head.

30:47.360 --> 30:50.000
And yeah, you don't necessarily get a good look

30:50.000 --> 30:52.720
kind of a variety of styles,

30:52.720 --> 30:55.120
but just the quality is there.

30:55.120 --> 30:58.640
And even that is missing for people your size in America.

30:58.640 --> 31:02.360
Because that is so difficult to work with.

31:02.360 --> 31:05.480
Which it makes Gail's and makes Travis's story

31:05.480 --> 31:07.280
that much more amazing.

31:07.280 --> 31:10.520
Is, you mentioned kind of picking whatever

31:10.520 --> 31:14.680
the set of techniques the athlete is naturally good at

31:14.680 --> 31:15.880
or prefers or whatever.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.680
How much specialization is there?

31:19.680 --> 31:21.600
Maybe if I give you like two choices,

31:21.600 --> 31:24.200
is it good to have like one throw

31:25.080 --> 31:27.000
and try to become the best person in the world

31:27.000 --> 31:27.920
at that throw?

31:27.920 --> 31:30.000
Or do you want to have a bunch of stuff?

31:31.000 --> 31:32.960
Like a variety of throws?

31:32.960 --> 31:34.720
Well, for Travis, it was Ippon Sanagi.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.440
That was his main throw, right?

31:36.440 --> 31:38.360
But from that Ippon Sanagi,

31:38.360 --> 31:41.120
he had a variety of other attacks he could do,

31:41.120 --> 31:42.360
you know, that mixed it up.

31:42.360 --> 31:44.320
So that you kept people guessing.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.240
Maybe it wasn't the Ippon Seoi was coming.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.440
Maybe it was the Koshiguruma that he did.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.240
Or maybe it was the Ippon to Osoto

31:50.240 --> 31:51.400
that he did in combination.

31:51.400 --> 31:55.080
So you typically have one main throw that you do.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.840
For me, it was Taiyotoshi.

31:56.840 --> 31:58.840
For Kayla, it was her Ogoshi.

31:58.840 --> 32:01.200
For Travis, it was his Ippon Sanagi.

32:01.200 --> 32:04.120
But then you come up with a variety of other throws

32:04.120 --> 32:06.400
that you do from the very same grip.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.400
So whatever grip you take for your main throw,

32:09.400 --> 32:12.320
you want to develop an arsenal of attacks

32:12.320 --> 32:15.960
that go in all different directions holding that same grip.

32:15.960 --> 32:19.240
So you keep your opponent guessing as to what's coming.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.680
Because if they're just sitting on one technique

32:21.680 --> 32:23.240
at the highest level of sport,

32:23.240 --> 32:24.720
with the exception of a few, right?

32:24.720 --> 32:26.880
We talked about Ono's Uchimata.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.360
With the exception of a few,

32:28.360 --> 32:30.360
most of the world catches on pretty quick

32:30.360 --> 32:31.800
on how to beat you.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.640
There is something to just making sure

32:34.640 --> 32:36.280
you dedicate to the main thing.

32:36.280 --> 32:41.280
So for Travis, that would be the main version of his Sanagi.

32:41.440 --> 32:43.960
Like really making sure you don't forget

32:43.960 --> 32:46.240
to really put in the time on that.

32:46.240 --> 32:51.240
Because I mean, one way to say it is

32:51.960 --> 32:56.000
that threat being dangerous opens up a lot of things.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.200
Right.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.320
But also, I don't know.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.600
I think I'm just, as a fan,

33:02.600 --> 33:06.800
I think it's sad when like elite level athletes

33:06.800 --> 33:09.320
in all like combat sports,

33:09.320 --> 33:12.560
kind of start taking their main thing for granted.

33:12.560 --> 33:16.560
Like they think, okay, I've figured that part out.

33:16.560 --> 33:19.760
Now I'll be working on this whole system on variations,

33:19.760 --> 33:23.240
on different setups, on lefty versus left.

33:23.240 --> 33:26.760
There's some like weird variation as opposed to,

33:26.760 --> 33:29.400
you know what, if you look at some of the best people ever,

33:29.400 --> 33:32.880
they seem to have not cared about variations at all.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.920
They're just like literally,

33:34.920 --> 33:37.760
they are more like Jiro Dreams of Sushi

33:37.760 --> 33:42.520
and like fine tuning their ear,

33:42.520 --> 33:45.640
their ability to detect the minute movements

33:45.640 --> 33:48.160
that give you an opening on that main thing.

33:48.160 --> 33:52.720
And so the whole time you're just waiting for that throw,

33:52.720 --> 33:55.920
you're like dancing with like a little bit of pressure

33:55.920 --> 33:58.640
and like releasing the pressure and putting the pressure,

33:58.640 --> 34:00.640
maybe a little bit off balance

34:00.640 --> 34:03.920
and finding like the right moment to strike

34:03.920 --> 34:05.440
and focusing on that.

34:05.440 --> 34:08.800
Again, maybe that's just like a romanticization of like

34:09.800 --> 34:10.960
the simplicity of that.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.960
Maybe it is kind of impossible to do that on the large scale,

34:13.960 --> 34:18.960
but I just, yeah, I don't know if you can comment on that,

34:19.960 --> 34:22.880
whether there is some value in still putting in like tens

34:22.880 --> 34:25.480
of thousands of reps on the main, main thing.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.880
Well, unquestionably that has to happen.

34:28.040 --> 34:30.080
You still have to drill your main throw

34:30.080 --> 34:32.840
and you have to fine tune it and continue to do,

34:32.840 --> 34:36.040
repetition after repetition and throws on the crash pad

34:36.040 --> 34:37.760
or throws on the mat, moving around,

34:37.760 --> 34:40.120
just explosive movements doing your main technique.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.280
You're never gonna forget that

34:41.280 --> 34:43.040
and you're not gonna put it to the side

34:43.040 --> 34:44.120
and not practice it anymore.

34:44.120 --> 34:46.160
It still has to be part of your repertoire

34:46.160 --> 34:49.680
and part of your daily training, but you do have to evolve.

34:49.680 --> 34:54.280
And I think that's the sport of Judo makes you evolve.

34:54.280 --> 34:56.880
When I look at, we talk about Koga from before, right?

34:56.880 --> 34:59.720
We talked about, he had a dynamic Ippon Seinagi

34:59.720 --> 35:01.880
that nobody could stop for years and years and years.

35:01.880 --> 35:05.040
But when people started to be unorthodox

35:05.040 --> 35:07.480
and come down his back and cross grip him

35:07.480 --> 35:09.520
and he couldn't get to the lapel,

35:09.520 --> 35:10.880
he had to come up with something else.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.800
And all of a sudden you saw Koga doing,

35:12.800 --> 35:15.680
now he did a Sode, or now he did a Tomoinagi,

35:15.680 --> 35:18.440
which so he can, he added to his arsenal

35:18.440 --> 35:20.440
to keep people thinking, keep people guessing.

35:20.440 --> 35:22.720
So it's not, you're not just that one trick pony.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.200
They still couldn't stop his Ippon Seinagi

35:25.200 --> 35:26.760
once he got that grip.

35:27.640 --> 35:28.680
But if they stopped him from getting that grip

35:28.680 --> 35:30.400
or putting two hands on the gi,

35:30.400 --> 35:31.720
he had to go to something else.

35:31.720 --> 35:33.000
And that's what he did.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.720
Does Travis's or Koga's Seinagi make sense to you?

35:36.720 --> 35:38.960
That weird, so when I,

35:38.960 --> 35:40.560
Split hip, it's a split hip.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.760
Split hip, so I don't know if you know this,

35:43.760 --> 35:45.680
but I got into Judo because of Travis.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.360
I watched him at 2008 Olympics.

35:47.360 --> 35:51.040
And I was, there's something about just,

35:51.040 --> 35:53.160
not the cockiness, but the confidence

35:53.160 --> 35:56.520
and just the refusal to quit, the refusal to

35:56.960 --> 35:59.040
just that energy, whatever it connected with me,

35:59.040 --> 36:01.160
it's like, oh, that guy's badass.

36:01.160 --> 36:03.200
I wanna be badass like that.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.880
And then I also, there happened to be

36:04.880 --> 36:08.720
in my university Judo and I got into it

36:08.720 --> 36:10.640
and just fell in love with the elegance and the beauty

36:10.640 --> 36:12.000
and the power of the sport.

36:13.600 --> 36:18.600
But also I started to mimic Travis's game, his and Koga's.

36:18.920 --> 36:21.920
And then the instructors I worked with,

36:21.920 --> 36:24.360
they said, that's the wrong way to do it.

36:24.400 --> 36:28.400
And I always, I never found somebody that told me like,

36:28.400 --> 36:29.680
no, that's not the wrong way.

36:29.680 --> 36:31.120
There's a lot of ways to do it.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.760
And there's like the classic way

36:32.760 --> 36:34.400
and you have to understand it and you have to learn it,

36:34.400 --> 36:36.040
but this is not the wrong way.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.560
Cause I was trying to find somebody

36:37.560 --> 36:39.080
who understands this throw.

36:39.960 --> 36:42.400
Cause it was so beautiful at the highest level,

36:42.400 --> 36:45.240
especially with Koga, the way you're able,

36:45.240 --> 36:46.960
the quickness with which you can strike,

36:46.960 --> 36:48.720
the fact that you can stand on the feet

36:48.720 --> 36:52.160
and the elevation you can get and the power you can get.

36:52.600 --> 36:57.600
Has certain throws, just like Uchimura doesn't look powerful.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.440
It just like, it looks effortless.

37:02.440 --> 37:06.800
But like the standing Senagi with a split hip,

37:06.800 --> 37:10.280
it just looks powerful because there's a,

37:10.280 --> 37:12.640
you're like, you're stepping into them,

37:12.640 --> 37:14.800
you're lifting the opponent and they still have,

37:14.800 --> 37:15.720
they're not surprised.

37:15.720 --> 37:17.240
They're now like helpless.

37:17.240 --> 37:18.760
Right, their feet are fluttering in the air.

37:18.760 --> 37:19.840
They're fluttering.

37:19.840 --> 37:23.920
And then there's just this pause and then just big slam.

37:23.920 --> 37:27.640
With Uchimura, it's almost like you don't know what hit you.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.040
And so Taito is just the same.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.880
It's almost like a surprise, like, oh shit,

37:30.880 --> 37:32.200
I'm now on my back.

37:32.200 --> 37:37.200
And so I just love that throw,

37:37.200 --> 37:40.440
but like it didn't make sense to me.

37:40.440 --> 37:42.920
Like when trying to explain it to others,

37:42.920 --> 37:45.400
when trying to learn, it didn't make sense to me

37:45.400 --> 37:46.240
how it works.

37:46.240 --> 37:47.480
Does it make sense to you?

37:47.480 --> 37:48.320
It does.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.200
I was born a Jidoka, right?

37:50.200 --> 37:54.560
So I've lived this stuff since I was an infant.

37:54.560 --> 37:57.360
And I've seen every style and every technique.

37:58.240 --> 38:01.040
The split hip Senagi is difficult to learn.

38:01.040 --> 38:04.000
It's harder to learn than the basic form,

38:04.000 --> 38:05.200
but it is powerful.

38:05.200 --> 38:08.120
And it does upon entry,

38:08.120 --> 38:10.520
both your opponent's feet leave the mat at the same time.

38:10.520 --> 38:11.360
So you've got them.

38:11.360 --> 38:12.720
Once you enter, you've got them.

38:12.720 --> 38:13.880
You just got to finish, right?

38:13.880 --> 38:15.440
You just got to lock them and turn and go.

38:15.440 --> 38:17.240
So it makes sense to me.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.080
My dad did teach me how to do that when I was younger.

38:20.080 --> 38:21.480
Yeah, he wanted me to do a split hip.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.400
We have kids at the school today

38:23.400 --> 38:26.120
that we teach the split hip Senagi, same way,

38:27.200 --> 38:28.600
because it is that dynamic, right?

38:28.600 --> 38:31.440
You don't drop to the ground and roll and turn.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.000
It's not the classic form

38:33.000 --> 38:34.320
where you're giving way to your opponent.

38:34.320 --> 38:36.720
It's actually, you go pick the guy up in the air

38:36.720 --> 38:37.720
and then you slam him.

38:39.160 --> 38:41.920
Okay, beautiful.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.080
So maybe on a small tangent,

38:44.080 --> 38:46.440
so where we're talking about elite level athletes

38:46.440 --> 38:50.240
in terms of randori, in terms of like drilling,

38:50.240 --> 38:53.040
for more recreational athletes,

38:53.040 --> 38:56.480
like I have personally that situation going on,

38:56.480 --> 38:57.480
but there's other people

38:57.480 --> 39:00.160
that are just recreationally training judo.

39:00.160 --> 39:03.240
How do you recommend they improve judo?

39:03.240 --> 39:08.240
Like if I wanted to compete a bunch and do reasonable

39:08.440 --> 39:10.200
with a particular set of throws,

39:10.200 --> 39:15.200
say the split Senagi, so how do you do the randori?

39:16.040 --> 39:18.640
Do you use a crash pad to get in reps?

39:18.640 --> 39:20.360
Do you, like, what do you recommend?

39:20.360 --> 39:22.960
So I guess there's two recreational people

39:22.960 --> 39:23.800
that we're talking about.

39:23.800 --> 39:25.920
One is somebody who wants to learn judo

39:25.920 --> 39:27.480
and become good at judo,

39:27.480 --> 39:29.720
but doesn't necessarily want to compete,

39:29.720 --> 39:30.720
but just wants to get better.

39:30.720 --> 39:33.520
And I think that there's not enough emphasis

39:33.520 --> 39:38.000
in this country on paying attention to that type of student.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.160
Everybody pushes them to competition.

39:40.160 --> 39:43.440
But in reality, there's a huge audience of people out there

39:43.440 --> 39:44.920
that would love to learn judo

39:44.920 --> 39:46.840
and be very proficient at judo

39:46.840 --> 39:50.160
and have the skills to go execute if they haven't needed it.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.880
And there's a class and there should be a program

39:52.880 --> 39:53.800
for that athlete.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.600
And that athlete does not need to do randori.

39:56.600 --> 39:59.120
Like the sport of judo is physical enough

39:59.120 --> 40:01.000
where you're picking somebody up all the time

40:01.000 --> 40:03.760
and moving their body weight around the mat all the time,

40:03.760 --> 40:05.840
where you can get very physically strong,

40:05.840 --> 40:07.400
very physically fit.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.300
Technically, you'll be better than somebody

40:09.300 --> 40:11.960
that does randori more than you,

40:11.960 --> 40:14.360
because if you learn good technique

40:14.360 --> 40:16.440
and you learn the movement and you learn the feel

40:16.440 --> 40:18.760
and you learn the timing,

40:18.760 --> 40:20.240
you'll actually be a better athlete

40:20.240 --> 40:22.240
than the person that just focuses on randori

40:22.240 --> 40:24.760
who does ugly technique and wins with force.

40:24.760 --> 40:28.720
So we have a recreational class at our school

40:28.720 --> 40:30.200
where they don't do any randori.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.640
They have an option afterwards

40:31.640 --> 40:33.160
if they want to stay for 15 minutes

40:33.160 --> 40:34.120
or stay for 30 minutes

40:34.120 --> 40:36.200
where they can participate in randori.

40:36.200 --> 40:39.120
But most of the adult students choose not to

40:39.120 --> 40:42.280
because they're already so tired from the other hour class.

40:42.280 --> 40:43.120
It's a good workout.

40:43.120 --> 40:44.520
Right, they're already dripping sweat.

40:44.520 --> 40:48.520
They're already like, if you work hard and drill hard,

40:48.520 --> 40:51.400
it's an intense workout, you're exhausted.

40:51.400 --> 40:55.820
So that's a specific set of program,

40:55.820 --> 40:57.160
I should say, at every academy.

40:57.160 --> 41:01.720
And then if you wanna get good and you wanna compete,

41:01.720 --> 41:04.520
then to me, once you have your techniques,

41:04.520 --> 41:09.320
it's learning how to implement a good gripping system

41:09.320 --> 41:11.320
to put yourself in a position

41:11.320 --> 41:14.640
where you can always dominate the grips,

41:16.560 --> 41:17.860
control the movement,

41:17.860 --> 41:20.120
initiate the reactions from your opponent

41:20.120 --> 41:22.560
and then have the opportunity to attack and score.

41:22.560 --> 41:25.440
And I think that when people train with

41:25.440 --> 41:29.080
or when they jump into a higher level of the sport of judo,

41:29.080 --> 41:31.120
all of a sudden the first thing they say is,

41:31.120 --> 41:33.400
I can't attack, I don't know how to attack

41:33.400 --> 41:35.440
because positionally, they don't know

41:35.440 --> 41:36.440
where to put their hands.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.800
They don't know how to hold the gi properly.

41:38.800 --> 41:43.040
They don't understand that they have an inferior grip

41:43.040 --> 41:45.460
and they don't know how to get into a better position

41:45.460 --> 41:46.320
so they can attack.

41:46.320 --> 41:47.560
And that's a big part of the game

41:47.560 --> 41:49.720
that not a lot of people really understand.

41:49.720 --> 41:52.720
So you really, even for recreational competitors,

41:52.720 --> 41:54.880
you really need to have a gripping system.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.200
You need to understand the gripping system.

41:57.200 --> 41:58.880
If you want to win.

41:58.880 --> 42:00.640
I mean, if the goal is to go and compete,

42:00.640 --> 42:01.880
that's a different story.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.800
I don't have fun getting beat up or losing in competitions.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.940
I enjoy the...

42:06.940 --> 42:09.240
I don't even know if it's the winning or the losing.

42:09.240 --> 42:12.040
I think this is what,

42:12.040 --> 42:14.280
because I competed a lot in both judo and jiu-jitsu

42:14.280 --> 42:18.080
and in judo, it feels like,

42:18.080 --> 42:19.960
because I didn't have a gripping system,

42:19.960 --> 42:21.840
it feels like you're not even playing judo

42:21.840 --> 42:24.300
against the good black belts.

42:26.360 --> 42:27.320
They're not even trying

42:27.320 --> 42:29.800
because they get a certain kind of grip

42:29.800 --> 42:31.320
and you just can't do anything.

42:31.600 --> 42:33.080
And I don't have a good answer for that.

42:33.080 --> 42:34.800
I don't even know what I'm looking for.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.120
And so it's not even fun.

42:36.120 --> 42:37.760
It's not like even losing.

42:37.760 --> 42:40.680
It's like, I don't know.

42:40.680 --> 42:43.480
It's like you didn't even show up to play

42:43.480 --> 42:44.640
is what it feels like.

42:44.640 --> 42:45.480
And it's unfortunate.

42:45.480 --> 42:50.000
And I think that is a big gap in knowledge actually

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
in judo schools is the gripping part.

42:55.720 --> 42:59.240
When you first go out to do judo, right?

42:59.240 --> 43:00.320
The first thing you have to do

43:00.320 --> 43:01.920
is you have to grab your opponent, right?

43:01.920 --> 43:04.080
And a lot of times I hear coaches say, get a grip,

43:04.080 --> 43:04.920
just take a grip.

43:04.920 --> 43:07.300
Well, sometimes if you take a grip,

43:07.300 --> 43:10.480
you're in a worse position than not having a grip at all.

43:10.480 --> 43:11.960
And that's what a lot of people don't understand.

43:11.960 --> 43:14.400
Like if you hold the gi in the wrong way,

43:14.400 --> 43:16.960
your opponent can attack you, but you can't attack him.

43:16.960 --> 43:19.320
So why would you ever do that grip

43:20.440 --> 43:22.880
if it's only to your detriment, right?

43:22.880 --> 43:26.920
So that's, and the way you grip does set up

43:26.920 --> 43:28.400
what attacks you can do as well.

43:28.400 --> 43:29.680
So that is a huge part.

43:29.680 --> 43:32.720
And I'm not saying that you have to be 100% disciplined

43:32.720 --> 43:34.480
and only always outgrip your opponent

43:34.480 --> 43:36.160
and only be able to do throws

43:36.160 --> 43:37.160
when you have a superior grip.

43:37.160 --> 43:40.360
I'm just saying that to be able to put the grips together

43:40.360 --> 43:42.160
with the throws and understand the movements

43:42.160 --> 43:45.000
is gonna make you that much ahead of the game.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.420
So if we take a step to our previous discussion

43:48.420 --> 43:51.800
of going from zero to hero,

43:51.800 --> 43:55.800
so going from the early days through the teenage years

43:55.800 --> 43:58.520
to winning an Olympic medal.

43:58.520 --> 44:00.880
So we mentioned a lot of training,

44:00.880 --> 44:03.900
the dedication of the training, the competing.

44:03.900 --> 44:05.120
What other elements are there?

44:05.120 --> 44:07.920
The mental side is visualization,

44:07.920 --> 44:12.640
believing that you could perform at that level.

44:12.640 --> 44:13.720
So what else can you say about that?

44:13.720 --> 44:15.480
I think that comes at the highest level,

44:15.480 --> 44:17.280
the visualization, the success,

44:17.280 --> 44:18.480
that comes at the highest level.

44:18.480 --> 44:20.600
I think in the teen years,

44:21.840 --> 44:24.880
there's the experience plays a huge role

44:24.880 --> 44:28.240
in getting to train with other people.

44:28.520 --> 44:30.920
As Americans, we have to go train in Europe.

44:30.920 --> 44:33.200
We have to feel the European style of judo.

44:33.200 --> 44:35.720
We have to understand that physicality.

44:35.720 --> 44:38.040
They grip very differently.

44:38.040 --> 44:41.120
They put you in very unorthodox positions.

44:41.120 --> 44:43.760
And if you don't know how to deal with that,

44:43.760 --> 44:45.440
you get thrown before you even have a chance

44:45.440 --> 44:47.200
to try your own throws.

44:47.200 --> 44:50.480
So it takes a lot of that experience

44:50.480 --> 44:52.760
and understanding what's going on.

44:52.760 --> 44:55.120
And then you also need to get that physicality.

44:55.120 --> 44:59.240
You need to be strong and hard, I would say,

44:59.240 --> 45:01.640
by doing all those rounds with the Europeans.

45:01.640 --> 45:03.520
And at the same time, you need to go to Asia

45:03.520 --> 45:05.240
and you need to train in Japan

45:05.240 --> 45:08.720
because you need to feel that free-flowing judo

45:08.720 --> 45:10.720
for your technical side.

45:10.720 --> 45:12.560
And I think that's one of the things

45:12.560 --> 45:13.840
that I was able to benefit from.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.000
My dad was a coach who said,

45:15.000 --> 45:17.840
"'Listen, I've taken you as far as I can take you.

45:17.840 --> 45:20.280
"'I want you to go to the next level.'"

45:20.280 --> 45:23.000
He sent me to England with Neil Adams,

45:23.000 --> 45:24.560
who was an Olympic silver medalist

45:24.800 --> 45:27.080
and was a world champion, had a great ground game,

45:27.080 --> 45:29.480
and was good at gripping, and actually did Taiyotoshi,

45:29.480 --> 45:30.480
which is the throw I did.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.520
So my dad said, "'I want you to go learn from Neil.'"

45:32.520 --> 45:34.800
And I ended up going to England

45:34.800 --> 45:36.640
probably eight to 10 times in my career

45:36.640 --> 45:38.280
and spending a good amount of time there

45:38.280 --> 45:40.680
training at the Neil Adams Academy.

45:40.680 --> 45:43.040
He's now the voice of judo, Neil Adams.

45:43.040 --> 45:43.960
What do you make of that guy?

45:43.960 --> 45:44.920
Just a brief pause.

45:44.920 --> 45:48.520
He's like Morgan Freeman is the voice

45:48.520 --> 45:50.200
of like March of the Penguins

45:50.200 --> 45:52.240
and any other nature documentary.

45:52.240 --> 45:54.840
And Neil Adams is, there's very few sports

45:54.840 --> 45:56.400
that have a Neil Adams, I would say,

45:56.400 --> 46:00.920
because he's legitimately, maybe like Joe Rogan

46:00.920 --> 46:02.840
is that from mixed martial arts.

46:02.840 --> 46:06.360
It's just like an exceptionally recognizable voice.

46:06.360 --> 46:08.000
He's really knowledgeable.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.560
Also the passion is conveyed so well.

46:10.560 --> 46:13.600
Like many times I'll watch just because he's talking.

46:13.600 --> 46:14.640
So who is he?

46:14.640 --> 46:16.680
Since you've gotten the chance to train with him,

46:16.680 --> 46:18.800
to learn from him, who's Neil Adams?

46:18.800 --> 46:20.280
He's a great friend of mine.

46:20.280 --> 46:21.120
He is?

46:21.120 --> 46:21.960
He's a mentor.

46:23.440 --> 46:25.000
Like I said, I lived and trained

46:25.000 --> 46:27.720
at the Neil Adams Club in Coventry, England

46:27.720 --> 46:29.920
since I was like 16 years old.

46:29.920 --> 46:31.920
I went and visited him for the first time.

46:31.920 --> 46:33.440
He's the one who originally taught me

46:33.440 --> 46:37.360
how to do juji-gatami in the way that I do juji-gatami.

46:37.360 --> 46:38.200
I trained with him.

46:38.200 --> 46:39.520
He was just retired.

46:39.520 --> 46:41.840
He was in his early thirties when I first went out there.

46:41.840 --> 46:43.960
And so I trained with him many times.

46:43.960 --> 46:48.960
And over the years, he was a mentor, great person,

46:49.880 --> 46:53.360
cares about people, cares about the sport of judo.

46:55.480 --> 46:57.760
Had a good little club that was a fitness club.

46:57.760 --> 47:00.840
And it was judo, it was fitness.

47:00.840 --> 47:02.920
It used to go there.

47:02.920 --> 47:05.240
I'd show up at that place at like seven in the morning.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.240
And the first thing we would do is we'd go for a run.

47:07.240 --> 47:09.280
And we'd either be running mountains

47:09.280 --> 47:11.240
or we'd be doing a five mile run

47:11.240 --> 47:13.080
or we'd be doing something at the park.

47:13.080 --> 47:15.680
We were doing sprints and buddy carries and all this stuff.

47:15.680 --> 47:18.160
And then at 9 a.m. we'd have a technical session

47:18.160 --> 47:20.120
with Neil Adams where he would,

47:20.120 --> 47:20.960
for an hour and a half,

47:20.960 --> 47:23.280
we would drill techniques and learn positions.

47:23.280 --> 47:25.000
And it was no randori.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.560
It was that sequential drilling

47:26.560 --> 47:28.040
that we talked about before, right?

47:28.040 --> 47:31.800
Where you're reinforcing your two or three attacks

47:31.800 --> 47:32.960
to set up your main attack.

47:32.960 --> 47:34.160
Or if you're on the ground,

47:34.160 --> 47:36.880
you're going through repetitions of certain movements.

47:38.160 --> 47:41.840
And then I'd spend all afternoon at the club, have lunch.

47:41.840 --> 47:45.240
I'd go do my weight training in the afternoon at that place.

47:45.240 --> 47:46.200
And then in the evening,

47:46.240 --> 47:49.400
we would either do randori training at the Neil Adams Club

47:49.400 --> 47:50.640
or we would all get in a car

47:50.640 --> 47:53.760
and we'd drive to another location

47:53.760 --> 47:55.120
and we'd go train at another club

47:55.120 --> 47:56.240
that might be an hour away.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.280
And there'd be 50 bodies there to train with.

47:58.280 --> 48:00.440
And each night we'd go to a different dojo.

48:00.440 --> 48:02.360
And so it would be all day at the club.

48:02.360 --> 48:04.680
And I'd do that for like three weeks straight.

48:04.680 --> 48:05.800
All we'd do was train.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.920
Do you know how he became the voice of Judo?

48:07.920 --> 48:12.920
Do you have an understanding of what his thinking is around

48:13.400 --> 48:15.720
how much he dedicates to himself

48:15.720 --> 48:17.920
to just commentating on Judo?

48:17.920 --> 48:21.280
I imagine the amount of research required,

48:21.280 --> 48:23.000
but also just like psychologically,

48:23.000 --> 48:25.400
just the excitement he has in his voice.

48:25.400 --> 48:28.000
It takes work to do that.

48:28.000 --> 48:28.920
Do you have an understanding

48:28.920 --> 48:30.960
of like what his vision is with that?

48:30.960 --> 48:35.080
He's always been a very charismatic, animated person, Neil.

48:35.080 --> 48:38.480
Very passionate and loud and funny.

48:38.480 --> 48:40.080
And the Brits are very funny to begin with.

48:40.080 --> 48:42.880
So he's very charismatic.

48:42.880 --> 48:45.600
But I think after coaching,

48:46.560 --> 48:48.920
he coached the country of Wales for a while.

48:48.920 --> 48:51.080
He tried coaching stints in other countries.

48:51.080 --> 48:54.760
He didn't have a lot of success on the coaching side,

48:54.760 --> 48:56.320
developing an Olympic champion.

48:56.320 --> 49:00.160
I know that was a goal of his, that he was a world champion.

49:00.160 --> 49:01.480
I think it was 1981.

49:01.480 --> 49:05.440
He won two silver medals in the Olympic games himself.

49:05.440 --> 49:07.880
He went on to coach for a while

49:07.880 --> 49:09.760
and had some political issues

49:09.760 --> 49:12.640
with the country of England for a while.

49:12.640 --> 49:14.400
And then left England and went to Wales.

49:14.640 --> 49:17.520
I think he had a coaching stint somewhere else as well.

49:17.520 --> 49:20.440
Didn't have a lot of success coaching in the sport

49:20.440 --> 49:22.120
with athletes, not at the highest level.

49:22.120 --> 49:24.280
Had a great national team and things like that.

49:24.280 --> 49:27.400
He was really good at teaching his technique to others

49:27.400 --> 49:29.040
because he helped me a lot.

49:30.640 --> 49:33.320
But running a program, I think, was difficult for him.

49:33.320 --> 49:34.400
The boy's not listening

49:34.400 --> 49:36.400
and not having that same kind of passion

49:36.400 --> 49:37.800
and intensity that he...

49:37.800 --> 49:39.800
And that's why I bonded well with him

49:39.800 --> 49:41.080
because I was all in, right?

49:41.080 --> 49:43.160
I went there and whatever he said, I did.

49:43.160 --> 49:44.120
I didn't care how hard.

49:44.760 --> 49:45.600
I didn't care how long.

49:45.600 --> 49:47.120
I just wanted to get as good as I could.

49:47.120 --> 49:50.120
And so that's why he was a good mentor for me.

49:50.120 --> 49:54.640
But now in terms of a commentator, he's very cerebral.

49:54.640 --> 49:56.640
He just, he loves judo.

49:56.640 --> 49:59.280
He researches it nonstop.

50:00.360 --> 50:02.080
He's got that great voice

50:02.080 --> 50:05.520
and he knows how to bring life to the game.

50:05.520 --> 50:06.360
And that's what he's done.

50:06.360 --> 50:07.960
And now this is who he is, right?

50:07.960 --> 50:09.680
He does judo full-time.

50:09.680 --> 50:11.000
This is his job.

50:11.040 --> 50:12.560
Can I ask you a small,

50:12.560 --> 50:15.600
before we return to the actual sport,

50:15.600 --> 50:17.200
the coaching of the sport,

50:17.200 --> 50:18.840
it's a bit of a political question.

50:18.840 --> 50:21.080
I did a whole rant before Travis episode.

50:23.960 --> 50:26.200
I love Neil Adams' voice.

50:26.200 --> 50:28.000
I love watching judo.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
And it's really disappointing to me that the IOC

50:33.240 --> 50:36.680
and whoever is responsible, I don't understand this,

50:36.680 --> 50:38.640
that they don't make it easy

50:38.640 --> 50:43.640
for people to watch the Olympics in replay for years after.

50:44.080 --> 50:46.320
Like I can't watch Travis's matches.

50:46.320 --> 50:49.000
I can't watch, like they make it very difficult

50:49.000 --> 50:50.480
to watch stuff online.

50:51.320 --> 50:55.880
So what happened is I uploaded the Travis Stevens episode

50:55.880 --> 50:59.200
and we talked about his Ole Bischoff 2012 match.

50:59.200 --> 51:04.080
And it was like one minute of like a small overlay

51:04.080 --> 51:06.760
of the video as we're talking through it,

51:06.760 --> 51:08.080
like stepping through it.

51:08.160 --> 51:11.800
And it got taken down immediately from YouTube,

51:11.800 --> 51:14.360
the whole four hour conversation

51:14.360 --> 51:16.600
because of that one minute little clip.

51:17.720 --> 51:20.680
And the way it got taken down automatically

51:20.680 --> 51:25.040
is because the IOC has that video uploaded.

51:25.040 --> 51:27.440
It's set to private, but it's uploaded.

51:27.440 --> 51:31.160
So like they have the video and they choose not to show it.

51:31.160 --> 51:33.360
It's not that they're asking for money or whatever.

51:33.360 --> 51:35.400
They're just not showing it anywhere.

51:35.400 --> 51:37.640
They're not showing it through their own service.

51:37.640 --> 51:39.800
Like NBC Olympics or so on.

51:39.800 --> 51:42.200
There's just so many great human stories

51:42.200 --> 51:44.200
that the Olympics reveals.

51:44.200 --> 51:46.840
They're just not made easily accessible.

51:46.840 --> 51:50.480
That's the Olympics charter is you want to,

51:50.480 --> 51:54.920
I think the actual line is to ensure the fullest coverage

51:54.920 --> 51:57.360
and the widest possible audience in the world

51:57.360 --> 51:58.880
for the Olympic games.

51:58.880 --> 52:02.520
And it seems like to me as a fan of the Olympic games,

52:02.520 --> 52:04.240
we're not getting any of that.

52:04.240 --> 52:08.120
Do you have an understanding of why that is?

52:08.120 --> 52:10.720
Like why we can't watch Kayla's matches,

52:10.720 --> 52:12.600
Travis's matches super easily,

52:12.600 --> 52:15.000
even if we're willing to pay money for it.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.840
So you can't go on the International Judo Federation

52:17.840 --> 52:20.600
website right now and watch any of the Olympic footage?

52:20.600 --> 52:22.720
No, no, no.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.040
So the only thing they have is for certain,

52:27.040 --> 52:30.080
for example, Teddy Renair match he lost.

52:30.080 --> 52:31.200
Not available anywhere.

52:31.200 --> 52:32.040
Really?

52:32.040 --> 52:33.640
And that's like a dramatic thing.

52:33.960 --> 52:36.800
So the one thing they have is for certain sports

52:36.800 --> 52:39.200
at the highest level, like gymnastics,

52:39.200 --> 52:40.560
they'll have a highlight,

52:40.560 --> 52:43.640
which is the most frustrating thing to me.

52:43.640 --> 52:46.120
Because this is what I can't,

52:46.120 --> 52:50.120
I'm going to try to prevent myself from going on a rant.

52:50.120 --> 52:55.120
But people don't just want to see a two minute highlight

52:56.640 --> 52:58.600
of a historic moment.

52:58.600 --> 53:01.440
They want to see the buildup where the athlete is standing,

53:01.480 --> 53:04.160
the nerves, the fear, the confidence.

53:04.160 --> 53:06.120
You see the buildup to the event,

53:06.120 --> 53:09.240
say it's a gymnastic, whatever, floor routine.

53:09.240 --> 53:11.880
Like their name is announced, they're walking,

53:11.880 --> 53:13.920
the coat, then they cut to the coach,

53:13.920 --> 53:15.680
and the coach with anticipation,

53:15.680 --> 53:16.840
and then go to the athlete.

53:16.840 --> 53:18.800
You want the full 10 minute thing.

53:18.800 --> 53:20.840
You don't want a two minute highlight

53:20.840 --> 53:23.440
of what happened like last second or whatever.

53:23.440 --> 53:28.280
It's just like the magic of that full story.

53:28.280 --> 53:31.960
Like a lifetime building up to those 10 minutes, right?

53:31.960 --> 53:34.360
That's the magic of the Olympics,

53:34.360 --> 53:36.120
that both the drama and the triumph

53:36.120 --> 53:37.520
that happens in those moments,

53:37.520 --> 53:39.680
and the fact that you can't relive that.

53:41.120 --> 53:43.400
Like Travis had a bunch of those, right?

53:43.400 --> 53:46.960
Like he had a bunch of times he faced like world champions,

53:46.960 --> 53:49.920
he won and lost, and just it's always close,

53:49.920 --> 53:51.800
it's always dramatic.

53:51.800 --> 53:53.560
And none of those are available,

53:53.560 --> 53:58.560
except like maybe the one where he'd be arm barred

53:59.640 --> 54:01.920
or whatever the submission was, I forgot.

54:01.920 --> 54:04.960
The joke, the joke, yeah, the Georgian.

54:04.960 --> 54:07.360
But most things are not.

54:07.360 --> 54:09.920
Usain Bolt, the full races,

54:09.920 --> 54:12.240
not all of his races are available online.

54:13.160 --> 54:18.160
The race with the Italian winning the 100 meter track race,

54:19.640 --> 54:22.400
this Olympics is not only a highlight is available

54:22.400 --> 54:23.240
from what I saw.

54:23.880 --> 54:24.720
It didn't look too hard.

54:24.720 --> 54:27.520
So like, but that, the fact that it's not super easily

54:27.520 --> 54:29.760
accessible if you're willing to pay money even,

54:29.760 --> 54:33.040
but probably should be for free is heartbreaking to me.

54:33.040 --> 54:38.040
Cause to me, the Olympics is like some of the best

54:38.400 --> 54:40.120
of humanity.

54:40.120 --> 54:43.240
Just like, again, the hardship they have to overcome.

54:43.240 --> 54:45.480
So like the losses are really powerful.

54:45.480 --> 54:49.400
Cause it's such heartbreak, but it's also like the triumph.

54:49.400 --> 54:50.600
Where you're losing history.

54:50.600 --> 54:53.160
You're losing histories, which you are of all the

54:53.160 --> 54:55.520
magical moments of your sport, right?

54:55.520 --> 54:57.400
It's a sin.

54:58.600 --> 55:03.600
I got to blame it on television rights and money.

55:03.960 --> 55:04.800
That's what it comes down to.

55:04.800 --> 55:06.520
You're talking about billions and billions of dollars

55:06.520 --> 55:10.280
of television rights paid by NBC here in the United States.

55:10.280 --> 55:13.040
And globally, whatever the main carriers are

55:13.040 --> 55:16.120
and all the other nations that are dictating

55:16.120 --> 55:18.000
what can be replayed and what can't.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.400
And it's what it comes down to.

55:20.160 --> 55:25.160
I made a DVD or a video when I first retired from the sport.

55:26.280 --> 55:27.360
It was called Fury on the Mat.

55:27.360 --> 55:28.760
It was kind of my story, right?

55:28.760 --> 55:32.400
And I did it with a friend who was a videographer

55:32.400 --> 55:35.680
and we grabbed a bunch of my old footage and Olympic footage.

55:35.680 --> 55:39.880
And somebody said to me, you can't use that Olympic footage.

55:39.880 --> 55:41.800
And I was young and I had just retired.

55:41.800 --> 55:43.280
I said, what do you mean I can't use the Olympic footage?

55:43.280 --> 55:45.320
It's not the television footage.

55:45.320 --> 55:47.480
It's my buddy who filmed it with his own camera.

55:47.480 --> 55:48.320
It's my footage.

55:48.320 --> 55:49.160
Yeah, exactly.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.240
And they said, no, if it has Olympics in it

55:51.240 --> 55:52.960
or it's anything to do with the Olympics,

55:52.960 --> 55:54.640
the USOC owns it.

55:54.640 --> 55:56.280
Yeah, I said, okay, well, they said,

55:56.280 --> 55:57.680
well, you should get to send it to them

55:57.680 --> 56:00.280
and let them review it.

56:00.280 --> 56:02.640
So I sent it to them and I got a bill back.

56:02.640 --> 56:05.040
I got a thing back that said, if you wanna use this footage,

56:05.040 --> 56:06.880
it's gonna be like $30,000.

56:06.880 --> 56:09.200
And I said, man, it's only like three minutes.

56:09.200 --> 56:11.120
I spliced it up as much as I could

56:11.120 --> 56:13.240
and I only have highlights in there.

56:13.240 --> 56:15.320
And then I said, come on, I went back

56:15.320 --> 56:17.360
and I negotiated with them.

56:17.360 --> 56:18.200
But at the end of the day,

56:18.200 --> 56:20.440
I still had to pay like $15,000

56:20.440 --> 56:23.720
just to have a few minutes of footage in my own film.

56:23.720 --> 56:25.320
This is...

56:25.320 --> 56:27.040
And I'm thinking, if you wouldn't even have that film

56:27.040 --> 56:28.440
if I didn't compete in it, you know?

56:28.440 --> 56:30.200
Like you can't, you know?

56:30.200 --> 56:31.920
So it was a struggle.

56:31.920 --> 56:33.600
And this is the different, like you have the same

56:33.600 --> 56:35.960
in Jiu Jitsu, there's certain organizations,

56:35.960 --> 56:40.000
IBJJF or like Flow Grappling and Flow Wrestling.

56:40.000 --> 56:43.040
I understand, I think when it's a business,

56:43.040 --> 56:44.600
it might make sense.

56:44.600 --> 56:46.240
First of all, you should actually be good

56:46.240 --> 56:48.160
at being a business and making money

56:49.160 --> 56:51.120
which is why for me, the IOC doesn't make sense.

56:51.120 --> 56:54.360
Like it should be accessible, but it would cost money.

56:56.360 --> 56:57.600
I can't buy it.

56:57.600 --> 57:00.240
Like would I have to email them for this footage

57:00.240 --> 57:02.080
and pay $30,000?

57:02.080 --> 57:06.280
No, but the question is like the way you run a business

57:06.280 --> 57:08.240
is you make that frictionalness.

57:08.240 --> 57:11.080
Whatever the money is, $30,000 or $30,

57:11.080 --> 57:13.880
you make it frictional and easy to pay that money.

57:13.880 --> 57:17.040
But anyway, I understand why that might be the case

57:17.040 --> 57:18.920
with Flow Grappling, but to me,

57:18.920 --> 57:21.040
the Olympics is a special thing.

57:21.040 --> 57:21.880
For sure.

57:21.880 --> 57:23.880
It's like you said, it is history.

57:23.880 --> 57:27.200
Like there's not even, like even the world championships

57:27.200 --> 57:28.040
don't compare.

57:28.040 --> 57:30.200
I understand they're really important,

57:30.200 --> 57:32.120
but Olympics is history.

57:32.120 --> 57:37.120
And the stories should certainly belong to the athletes

57:37.160 --> 57:39.840
if they want to do like Fury on the mat

57:39.840 --> 57:43.040
to do their own story or like on a podcast

57:43.080 --> 57:47.280
to talk about the most tragic moment of their career.

57:49.680 --> 57:53.080
Do you have a sense of how that could be fixed or no?

57:54.760 --> 57:57.200
The only thing I could think of is you'd have to go

57:57.200 --> 57:58.360
to the Olympic committee.

57:58.360 --> 58:00.840
The US Olympic committee is the place I would start

58:00.840 --> 58:02.960
because the US controls the worldwide market

58:02.960 --> 58:04.600
when it comes to television.

58:04.600 --> 58:06.320
We pay the most for our television rights.

58:06.320 --> 58:09.900
Our sponsors pay the most for their rights

58:09.900 --> 58:12.040
to be associated with the best team in the world,

58:12.040 --> 58:13.240
which is the United States, right?

58:13.240 --> 58:15.280
So it's where all the money starts here.

58:16.200 --> 58:18.920
I got to believe there has to be a way to get that footage

58:18.920 --> 58:22.440
that should be accessible to the sports themselves.

58:22.440 --> 58:24.760
I'm surprised it's not, but if it's not,

58:24.760 --> 58:27.400
then it's because of dollars.

58:27.400 --> 58:29.600
It's because people aren't, the sport itself

58:29.600 --> 58:33.320
is not willing to pay enough money to have it on its,

58:33.320 --> 58:35.760
accessible to its audience.

58:35.760 --> 58:38.680
It's too cost prohibitive for them to do it.

58:38.680 --> 58:40.760
No, but I think it's also unfortunately

58:40.760 --> 58:43.080
might be some mixture of incompetence

58:43.080 --> 58:45.160
and just an old way of doing things

58:45.160 --> 58:48.400
because there's a lot of money to be made

58:48.400 --> 58:52.880
on television rights where you live show the event, right?

58:52.880 --> 58:56.600
But what's not being leveraged is the huge amount of money

58:56.600 --> 58:58.040
that could be made on the replay.

58:58.040 --> 59:00.800
This is what people don't understand is,

59:00.800 --> 59:04.840
do you know how many times, just the tens of millions

59:04.840 --> 59:09.840
of times that people watch individual events years from now?

59:10.360 --> 59:12.640
You watch all the videos on YouTube,

59:12.640 --> 59:15.720
they're still getting plays, hundreds of millions of views

59:15.720 --> 59:18.600
on stuff that happened 10 years ago, 15 years ago.

59:18.600 --> 59:20.920
That's really powerful and there's a lot of opportunity

59:20.920 --> 59:22.320
to make a ton of money.

59:22.320 --> 59:25.480
So it's not that they're necessarily greedy,

59:25.480 --> 59:28.040
they're also just not good at being greedy.

59:28.040 --> 59:29.080
I get what you're saying, yeah.

59:29.080 --> 59:30.960
It's not the traditional, think about it though,

59:30.960 --> 59:34.520
it's not traditional for television studios.

59:34.520 --> 59:37.320
It's non-traditional to go to online streaming,

59:37.320 --> 59:40.280
to online access to information.

59:40.280 --> 59:41.240
It's not hard, right?

59:41.240 --> 59:45.120
Cause everybody's doing it now, but it's not typical.

59:45.120 --> 59:50.040
Yeah, so it requires for the IOC to operate

59:50.040 --> 59:51.400
outside their comfort zone.

59:51.400 --> 59:53.280
Well, I definitely hope that's the case.

59:53.280 --> 59:58.280
And since Travis's video got taken down,

59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.440
it's obvious they have it.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.520
They have it on their YouTube channel.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:07.520
So it's like, I hope that they will just release it

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.600
and for money, for whatever, but release it

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:15.600
and have that history not be erased, right?

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:19.080
It'd be wonderful if athletes could buy,

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.360
even if you could buy your own footage,

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.040
you can't use it commercially, you can't,

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.160
but you can buy your own matches

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.200
and have them available for yourself or package the footage.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.480
It would be to be awesome.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.200
Thank you for that.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.200
It is quite heartbreaking for me.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.280
So I wanted to talk about it a little bit.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.200
Let's go to you as an athlete real quick.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.040
Sure.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.680
You represented the United States at four Olympics,

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.880
winning a bronze medal at two of them.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:52.320
Who or what was the toughest match or moment

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.960
you had in those years?

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.240
Maybe a moment that defined you,

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.800
that you remember as being particularly

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.320
defining in your career.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:10.240
I would say the bronze medal match in Atlanta in 96,

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.040
because up to that moment,

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.600
the United States team had not won a medal,

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.520
had not fought for a medal in the games.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.200
We were on our home turf.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.200
It was my second Olympic games, right?

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.040
So I had competed in 92 and I had won two matches

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.600
and lost in the third round in Barcelona.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.120
I didn't make the podium.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.160
I lost to a Japanese guy from Japan.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.600
But the gold, silver and bronze medalist at that Olympics

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.000
in Barcelona were all guys that I had beat.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.200
In fact, two of them I was undefeated against

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.120
in my entire career, the Brazilian and the Cuban

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.680
I had never lost to.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.320
So that's when I knew I was capable of being

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.920
on the podium at the Olympic games.

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:52.160
When 96 came around, I was 25 years old.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.720
I was fairly in my prime.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.720
I had lived in Japan for six months.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.840
My technique was at a high level.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.840
I was amongst the best in the world.

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:06.640
I lost at that Olympics to a guy from Mongolia.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.120
It was right before the match

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.640
I was supposed to fight against Japan.

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.240
So I was like anticipating the match against Japan

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.440
and I got beat by the Mongolian.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.720
So that was kind of a letdown.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:20.720
But the match for the bronze in front of the hometown crowd,

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.120
all of my family, all of my friends,

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:26.200
all of my friends, everybody who had ever helped me

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:29.280
in the sport were in the stands that day,

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.680
including all my teammates at Brown University

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.120
that were on the wrestling team and little,

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.600
my uncles, my aunts, everybody was in the stands, right?

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.880
So it was like the Jimmy Pedro day.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.640
And I'm getting goosebumps right now talking about it.

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.240
But it was a match against the Brazilian

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.160
for the bronze medal.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.200
I had beaten the Brazilian like two or three times

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.040
before that.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.040
I found myself down in the match.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.360
He actually countered me.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.320
I came in my Taotoshi and he was waiting for it

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.800
and he countered me and he scored a yuko against me.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.640
So I was losing the fight,

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.280
came down to about the last minute in the match

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.440
and I was just tucking in my gi and fixing my thing,

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.920
gathering my thoughts together

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.640
and the whole crowd just started chanting,

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.320
USA, USA, USA.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.600
And I like literally like got so much energy.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.720
I walked out there, I grabbed the guy,

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:22.280
I came in my Taotoshi again.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.160
He stepped off the Taotoshi.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.600
I threw him with Uchimata free-pone.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:31.600
I won my first Olympic medal in front of the hometown crowd.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:33.840
Everybody went bananas.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:36.560
The United States judo team had our first medal

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:37.840
from the Olympics.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.680
It ended up being the only Olympic medal

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.080
we won at that games.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.440
But it was like a magical moment to define my career

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.920
and solidified myself in like history where,

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.360
hey, and now I get to step up on the Olympic podium

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.800
and I'm Olympic medalist.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.680
And to me, that was my defining moment.

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.840
And after that, I was sold.

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.840
Like, man, I had to go back to the Olympics again.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.960
I wanna win a gold medal.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.680
I wanna do, I want this feeling all over again.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.040
I don't care if I have to wait four years, let's do it.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.480
In your career, like moments like that,

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:13.480
do you think you love winning or hate losing more?

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.800
So do you live for those moments

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:21.800
or are you more driven by just how much you hate losing?

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.520
So in order to be a champion,

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.520
my belief is that you have to hate losing

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.440
more than you like winning.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.720
Hate losing more than you like winning.

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.960
But I live for those moments when you do win.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.520
And what excited me the most in my career

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:44.320
when I was competing was I loved being in the finals.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.440
I loved the spotlight being on me.

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.920
I can't think of too many times in my career.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.360
Of course there were a few,

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:54.120
but there weren't too many times where the chips were down,

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:56.840
like the lights were on and I didn't win.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:00.000
Like it was, I might've lost early in the day

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.280
and didn't make it to the finals

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.880
or didn't make it to the medal rounds.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:06.320
But like in my career, I have a ton of golds.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.840
I have a ton of bronzes,

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.600
which means the lights are on and I won.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:15.000
And I have very few silvers and very few fifths.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.600
So I either lost in the early rounds

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.560
and didn't make to the medal rounds in my younger days

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:21.640
or the spotlight came and I really shined.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.560
Because if you look, I don't know how many silvers,

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.080
but there wasn't very many silver medals

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.560
in my career that I won.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.400
You know what I mean?

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.000
So I just loved that moment.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.240
I didn't feel pressure.

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.720
I loved the crowd.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.400
I loved being in the spotlight.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.200
I didn't have, I wasn't nervous when it came to the finals

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:37.920
or I knew I was getting a medal.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:38.960
It didn't matter.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.760
You know, so it was just me against the other guy.

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.360
And that's how I always saw it.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.200
And I just loved that moment.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.920
So your dad was your coach.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:46.760
Yeah.

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:50.120
You had to get to meet him tonight.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:50.960
Oh, great.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.080
He's kind of a legend in the sport.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:59.160
So how has your dad helped you as a coach,

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:02.360
as an athlete, as a human being throughout the years?

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:07.560
Number one, my dad is the most brutally honest person

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.520
you will ever meet in your life.

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:10.480
Brutally honest.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:13.560
He will tell you, if you are fat,

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.880
he will tell you you're fat right to your face.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:16.720
He wants you to get better.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.080
He wants you to be healthy.

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.840
Doesn't want you to die of obesity.

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.200
It's just the way he is.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.800
If you didn't do well, he will not sugar coat it.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:27.200
He will let you know what you didn't do right.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.120
So he's the ultimate litmus test, right?

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:34.640
Second is he is the most passionate,

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:38.720
caring, deep, always thinking about,

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:44.640
very cerebral, very a student of the game.

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:49.240
Somebody who helped me immensely in defining my strategy,

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:53.520
helping me improve and always look for what's next.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.080
In terms of training,

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:02.200
I think that he's probably the most brilliant human

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:06.560
when it comes to preparing an athlete physically,

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:10.080
not to say mentally, physically for success.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.480
When all the chips are down,

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.920
that athlete will be ready that day.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.840
And he has a system of training and preparing

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.880
and getting the athlete to peak for performance.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.920
You mean like conditioning, like the whole thing?

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:21.920
Yes.

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.120
Okay, because I remember like,

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:28.680
vaguely remember Kayla Harrison talking about

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.000
her preparation being very difficult.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:31.840
Yeah.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.320
That's it.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.160
That's him?

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:35.000
Yeah, that's him.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.400
That's it, say, you go back and ask Rhonda Rousey

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.440
about her career, right?

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.720
My dad was her coach.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.560
Yeah.

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:45.880
My dad moved her to Camp New Hampshire in Boston,

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.160
got her up, ran her in the morning,

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.720
had her downstairs in the basement of his house,

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:51.680
training with the weights.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:52.960
We brought a Russian girl in.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.000
She did throws on his cement outside

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
with a little crash pad.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:56.840
Nice.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:57.960
Through the Russian girl, you know,

01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.320
hundred times that morning.

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.720
And then every night came to Boston,

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.360
you know, to the training center in Wakefield,

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.640
trained at night and went back and slept at my dad's house

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:09.280
and three weeks straight before she went off to Beijing.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.080
And he did the same with Kayla.

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:12.240
He did the same with me.

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:16.600
Like, he's just, his passion is producing athletes

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.800
at the highest level and he knows how to do it.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:23.800
And then the one side of my dad's coaching

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:26.240
where I think there's a flaw or weakness

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.320
is on the mental preparation side of the game.

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:32.480
He wasn't somebody that was, I don't know if he,

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.960
maybe because he wasn't an Olympic champion himself

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:37.960
and wasn't a world champion, he lacked the confidence

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.840
in helping others be more confident.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.680
So he's more of a,

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:43.600
this is what you need to work on type of thing.

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.240
He doesn't know how to build the athletes up

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.240
to make them feel invincible.

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.040
And I feel like that's something that I was able

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.320
to give all of the athletes,

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:55.120
to help them with that visualization, belief in yourself,

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.160
knowing that you're gonna win

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.320
before you step out of the mat,

01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:00.040
knowing that we've earned the right to victory,

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:04.640
seeing success in your mind, having a positive mantra

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.320
that you, I'm the best in the world

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:09.120
and nobody's beaten me today, type of feeling.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.000
So you go out there feeling like King Kong

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.400
when you step on the mat, that nobody's gonna stop you.

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.000
And so I think the combination of both of us as coaches,

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.320
I'm a lot more technical.

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.920
My dad is good at letting,

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.880
identifying what they need to do for their techniques

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.480
and what, in strategy, how to beat opponents

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:30.800
and putting game plans together.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.800
So combined the two of us made a unbelievable team.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.440
So he's not gonna let the athlete be soft

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:39.400
when they enter the highest,

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:43.640
the most difficult competitions of their career.

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.360
So on the mental side,

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:48.120
what's mental preparation look like?

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.880
Like how many years before the Olympics

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:54.080
do you start helping an athlete believe

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.480
that they can win an Olympic medal?

01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:00.080
Well, I think it's gotta be a seed in that athlete's brain,

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.280
something they wanna do, right?

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.760
Nobody can quickly get there, right?

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:06.760
It's a long process.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.240
But if your goal, if you're national champion

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:10.960
or you've proven yourself to win

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:13.280
in some international tournaments

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.440
and you think the Olympics is a possibility for you,

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:16.760
then defining it as,

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.160
hey, I wanna be on the Olympic team,

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:24.160
that would be the first step into getting ready.

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:28.360
And I always make them put it on paper.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:29.600
If it really is your goal,

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.880
then you show me that it's your goal

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.960
and put it on paper and commit to it.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.080
I wanna be Olympic medalist.

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.080
I wanna be Olympic champion.

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.560
I wanna go to the Olympics.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:38.920
World team member, maybe junior world team member,

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:41.720
whatever it is, we walk before we go to the highest level.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:44.360
But if the goal is to go to the Olympics,

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.880
let's accomplish these other things first, right?

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.280
Because if we can accomplish these other things,

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.600
then we're on our way to getting to the ultimate goal,

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.160
which is the Olympics.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.320
For somebody like Kayla, for example,

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.200
she didn't say that she wanted to be Olympic champion

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:05.320
when she first came here in 2005, right?

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:07.840
We wanted to become national champion.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.280
Then we wanted to be on the world team.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.000
Then we wanted to be a world medalist.

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.560
Our sights were set on the Olympics or the Olympic gold.

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:17.120
So it's having those clearly defined goals

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.120
that are attainable.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.960
Like they should be a reach, they should be a stretch,

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.720
but they have to be attainable.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.280
They can't be just a pipe dream.

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.120
But once you put it to paper

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.080
and you think it's achievable,

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:33.040
then it's mapping the plan to get there.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.880
Is there a daily process of visualizing yourself

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:40.040
as an Olympic champion or national champion?

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:42.000
Yes, it is.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.200
You should do it either every night before you go to bed

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:48.680
or before every training session

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.160
or after every training session.

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:51.680
One of those three times it should,

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.080
or first thing you wake up in the morning

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.600
because it may be to help some people,

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.440
it motivates them to go do what it is

01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.440
that they're supposed to do in the day.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:04.640
But the process of visualization is, to me,

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:07.600
is closing your eyes for a few moments.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.840
Your brain works really, really fast, right?

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:14.600
And it's actually picturing the day in its entirety

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.120
from start to finish,

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:19.240
from the moment you wake up and you step on the scale

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.560
to the moment you have your breakfast

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.320
and you go through your morning routine.

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.000
Like live the day that you're gonna have at the Olympics.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.200
So whatever it is you're trying to do,

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.200
let's say the Olympic day, for example.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.040
Picture yourself making weight,

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.920
picture yourself who you're around, eating your breakfast,

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.960
having maybe saying a few jokes, laughing.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.120
This is a real day, make it real.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.880
Going back and packing your judo bag for the day,

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:45.920
getting on the bus, driving to the venue,

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:49.520
feel what it's like walking into the stadium

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.160
for the first time, going to the warm-up area,

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:54.680
seeing your draw up on the sheet

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.760
of who you're gonna fight that day,

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.160
watching yourself warm up,

01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.920
go through your warm-up routine,

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.600
walking out of the chute into the venue,

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.480
going to do that first fight.

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.520
Picture the moment of throwing your opponent,

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:10.800
coming off the mat, high-fiving the coach,

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.520
getting ready for your second fight.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.480
Like live the day from start to finish

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:18.200
and make it as real as possible.

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.960
Where all the way to the moment where you've just won

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.480
and you're raising your arms in celebration,

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.960
you're bowing, you're hugging your opponent,

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:28.800
you come off the mat, you hug your coach,

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.800
you're running around the stadium with the flag,

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.800
you stepped up on the podium, you heard your name,

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.960
Olympic champion, Jimmy Pedro.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:42.040
You heard the moment, the medal being put around your neck,

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.080
picture the people coming up on the podium with you,

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.280
arms around them taking the pictures.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:51.040
The more real you can make it,

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.800
even before it ever happens, right?

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.960
When you do that enough times,

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.800
I feel that pathways get created for you

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.040
so that when your body gets to that moment,

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.800
and I've been here before, this is it,

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.040
this is my moment, this is what I pictured my whole life.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.240
I'm not nervous because I've seen this,

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:14.000
this is gonna happen, I believe it's possible, right?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.040
And I believe the athletes that do that

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.720
and make it real enough that when they get to that moment,

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.800
they go right through, there's no hesitation.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.440
This is what this is meant to be, this is my destiny,

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.640
this is why I did everything I did

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.080
versus the ones that don't think about it ever,

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:31.520
but just kind of like hope.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.520
It's not real to them, it doesn't feel attainable.

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.840
They don't believe it's possible.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:40.040
They haven't committed to believing it was possible.

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.920
Without that commitment in yourself and that belief,

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:44.000
it can't happen.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.440
And one thing that, I talked to Travis a bit about this,

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:51.280
you probably worked with him on the details

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.840
of what you're talking about,

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:55.320
but he said that you should really

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:01.360
focus on visualizing the sensations you feel.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.760
So say if you're drinking coffee or something like that,

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.040
you're not thinking about observing yourself

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.320
from a third-person perspective drinking coffee.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:15.600
You're thinking of how your hand will feel

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.480
when it touches something warm.

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:21.040
You try to replay the actual sensations you would feel.

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:26.480
It sounds kind of strange, but meaning you really

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.960
wanna put yourself in the body

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.600
as you would experience those moments,

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.840
as opposed to watching yourself on TV experience

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:36.560
in those moments, like really be inside.

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.360
And yeah, so that means sensations,

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.600
like how does it feel when you grip a gi?

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:45.320
How does it, yeah, the sweating,

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.280
just the sensation of sweat,

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:50.160
like rolling down your forehead or whatever,

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.640
like all of those actual feelings.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.600
When I explain it to you,

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.800
I guess my body has been through it so many times,

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.480
both in my mind and in reality,

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:02.280
that it brings back all of those same emotions.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:04.480
I start to get goosebumps.

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:07.000
My armpits start to sweat.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.320
I'm living it if it's real.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:10.640
I'm reliving it now.

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:14.360
But when you're going through the visualization process,

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.640
it has to be that real.

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:18.880
The smells, the taping of the fingers,

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:23.360
like the more colorful and the more real you can make it,

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.600
the more believable it is.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.840
So I've been doing this kind of thing,

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:32.240
just having listened to you enough for other stuff,

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.360
so let's see if it works.

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.280
But do you see this kind of visualization

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:40.240
being useful for other things in career

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.360
and all those kinds of things?

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:46.360
100%, 100%, because I just know with my own life,

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:51.040
my own experiences, like my wife sometimes says to me,

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.640
she says, well, where do you see yourself

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:55.640
in like five years from now?

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:59.000
And five years ago, I had said to her,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.640
I wanna have my own business.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.840
I wanna have, this is the amount of money

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:05.680
that I'm hoping I can make in a given year.

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:07.040
Like you have to have goals for yourself.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.040
Like is this, if you put out there like,

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.520
okay, I wanna make a million dollars in a year,

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:13.240
that's a big number.

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:15.680
Like for me or for the normal person,

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:17.000
that's a really big number.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:17.840
You know what I mean?

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:19.760
Like it's not, especially when you're not making

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:22.880
that much at the time, it's a super big number, right?

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.520
So having those goals for yourself,

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:27.840
like it won't happen and it's not possible

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:30.480
unless you dream it's possible.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.960
And think that it's possible.

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:34.200
And then it doesn't magically happen

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:36.040
and maybe it doesn't happen in five years,

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.360
maybe happens in 10,

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.960
but at least you're on the path to getting there.

01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:40.800
You know what I mean?

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.000
And I said, I wanna own my own business.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.480
I wanna control my own destiny.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.240
I wanna be my own boss.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.000
I wanna make my own decisions.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.160
Like these are the things that I told her I wanted to do.

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:55.160
And now I'm at that point where I work for myself,

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.560
I have my own company, I have partners obviously,

01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:00.600
but like if I wanna pick up and go somewhere for a week,

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.320
I just do, I don't have to ask permission to do it, right?

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.200
That's what life, freedom, right?

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.920
That's what I'd like, it's so.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:09.240
And all of it starts with a dream.

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:12.880
And the same with my dojo, when I first opened,

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.920
so I ran a dojo for a long time

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.680
and I only had 60 students always,

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:19.000
like 40 to 60 students had fluctuated.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:20.820
And I said to myself,

01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:23.280
why can't I get more people in my door, right?

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.260
So I hired consultants to come in and look at my business

01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:27.540
and say, why, right?

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:29.540
And they came in and said,

01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:31.340
well, this place is really intimidating.

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.020
Like if I was coming in off the street,

01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:35.220
the first thing I see is this big Olympic champion

01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:37.700
on the wall and I see this training that's going on

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:40.060
and these guys are flying through the air and landing hard

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:41.700
and as a white belt, you're telling me

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:42.780
that's the class for me?

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:44.500
Like, no way, I'm not gonna do that.

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:47.540
So like I listened to these people and I said, you're right.

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:51.060
And the training was hour and a half, two hours long.

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.460
People can't handle an hour and a half

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:54.180
or two hours training when they're first walking in the door.

01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:56.940
So I had to restructure all my programming.

01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:59.660
I had to look at the way I was offering my curriculum

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:02.860
at my school and I had to make levels for everybody, right?

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:05.580
Like here's my four to six year old class.

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:07.740
Here's my six to 13 year old class.

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.840
There's all my beginner classes.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.620
They don't mix in with the advanced people.

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:16.620
And I had to learn how to make it accessible for everybody

01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:19.580
instead of just the people that wanted to train hard.

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:22.180
And then the challenge was, okay,

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:25.020
if you can have a lot of people in your dojo training,

01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.140
it's a recreational school.

01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:28.340
You can't produce champions at that same school.

01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:29.780
That's what I was told.

01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:31.740
So then I got all my black belts together

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:33.660
and I said, listen, this is my vision.

01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:34.860
This is what I want.

01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:38.220
I wanna have a club that has over 200 judo only athletes.

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:41.780
No jiu jitsu, no karate, nothing, judo only.

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:43.820
I want over 200 people.

01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:47.700
And inside of that dojo, I wanna have Olympic champions

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.060
and I wanna have recreational.

01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:51.260
Like little kids, five and six years old,

01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:52.860
older guys in their seventies train.

01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:55.660
I don't care, but I want the spectrum of recreational

01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:57.260
and I want Olympic champions.

01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:00.420
The only way to do that is to take your instructors

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:03.340
and say, you're all gonna do this, define the roles,

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:04.820
who's gonna be the recreational coach,

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:06.280
who's gonna be the competitive coach.

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.620
How do we separate these programs?

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:10.220
And lo and behold, that was my vision

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.420
that I shared with all of them.

01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:15.020
And that was back in 2006.

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:19.840
And by 2012, we've got Olympic champion, Kayla Harrison.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:21.960
We have over 200 people at the school.

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:24.240
We have a successful, thriving business,

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:28.080
but it doesn't happen without that vision, a plan

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:30.480
and believing that it's possible.

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.520
Believing that it's possible.

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:36.680
I don't know, but I personally have on top of that

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:41.880
almost like very specific visions of a future.

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:44.680
Like, I don't know what any,

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:46.760
cause I don't wanna give actual examples.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:52.600
Cause for several reasons, one of which is just people will,

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:56.160
as they often have, they often will in your life,

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.420
they'll just laugh at it a little bit.

01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:00.840
Like that seems silly.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.320
And I don't, I'm very hesitant to share certain things

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.220
like that with people because they'll,

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.280
I mean, I'm with Johnny Ive,

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.360
who's the lead designer in Apple.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.480
Like you want that dream, that little flame

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.680
people will put that flame out too easily,

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:21.520
even people that love you.

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:24.520
So I have very specific kind of visions,

01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:30.840
like maybe for Travis, it would be like a specific opponent

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.120
or something like Ole Bischoff.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:35.760
Like very specific, very specific situation

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.800
of what's going to happen.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:39.200
Not just like, I wanna be Olympic champion,

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:43.120
but very specific, like almost silly situations.

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:45.960
Yeah, like the dynamic between Travis and Ole Bischoff

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.800
or something like maybe visualize that.

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:51.040
For me, that helps because it makes it all real,

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.400
even more real.

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.480
It's not like some big goal,

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.880
like a million dollars or something like that,

01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.440
which is also really important to have

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.200
because you can measure it and so on.

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:05.200
But the, it's just like you belong in those situations.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:08.960
Just believing you belong in there.

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:09.800
It's not the-

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:10.640
It can be you.

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.800
Yeah, it could be you.

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:13.680
And that for some reason, that really helps me,

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:15.160
the little details.

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:16.000
Sure.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.360
Like visualizing, most of them

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.360
are almost a little bit funny.

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:23.320
Like the focusing on the funniness.

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:28.080
It's the mundane-ness of it helps me a lot.

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:30.260
And all the people that have done great things,

01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.860
they're just human too.

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:33.720
Correct, and I think a lot of people

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:38.680
overestimate who others are, right?

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:42.320
And don't, and sell themselves too short

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.600
because at the end of the day,

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:47.440
everybody started like everybody else, really.

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.120
I mean, we did, you know, we're all infants.

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.660
We couldn't walk, we couldn't talk.

01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:52.500
We couldn't do anything.

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.400
We learned along the way.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.240
But, and I think that's the one thing that I realized

01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:00.120
is that, and I tell this to my athletes,

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:03.360
but I also tell it to my recreational students,

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.840
nobody is better than you are.

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:09.560
Nobody, unless you allow them to be, right?

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.600
If you really want something to happen,

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:16.600
then like map the plan, believe in yourself, decide,

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:20.720
and know full out, you're gonna fail a lot.

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.360
You're gonna get beat down.

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.640
You're gonna have losses.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:24.880
You're gonna have struggles.

01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.320
Like, and I think that's the one thing

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.680
with social media today is that

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:30.600
everybody sees everybody succeed.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:32.300
Nobody posts the picture when they're on the ground

01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:33.720
and fail, you're losing.

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:36.120
Like nobody sees when you broke your arm

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:37.780
and you had to go through rehab, you know,

01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:39.580
whatever it is, like had your injuries

01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:41.480
and you were on your couch watching TV

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:43.520
and you were suffering and you were like,

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:46.160
everybody has really, really dark, bad moments

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:50.240
in their life and defeats and losses and suffrage.

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:53.200
And it's only at the end after they've recovered

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.420
from all of that, they've reclimbed up the mountain

01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:56.640
and they've gone to the pinnacle

01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:59.760
that you see them on social media with the medal, right?

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:03.120
But everybody else like struggles and was human

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:05.320
and failed many, many times.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:10.320
And, you know, convincing yourself that you're capable,

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:12.600
I think is the first start of everything.

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:15.560
Do you need people in your life that believe in you

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:19.020
or should most of it come from within yourself?

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.080
I think most of it has to come in from,

01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:25.540
it certainly helps, but it has to come from you first.

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:26.600
You have to be driven.

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:30.520
Like other people can help you define where you wanna go

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.340
and help you get there and encourage you

01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:34.440
and can support you and, you know,

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:37.920
whether it's resource wise or with connections

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:39.760
and like they can help with that path,

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:42.760
but that first part has to come from you.

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:45.600
It has to be your passion, your desire,

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:48.360
your, it's your commitment to yourself.

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:49.960
You're the one that's gonna ultimately make

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.800
all the sacrifices to do it.

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.520
So you, it has to be your decision,

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.880
not your parents, not your spouse's,

01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:58.080
something that you're really motivated to do.

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:01.320
Let me ask you about Travis, Kayla,

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.240
and maybe a few of the other athletes

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:04.080
you've been involved with.

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.380
So first, Travis.

01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:11.300
Travis Stevens, Olympic silver medalist,

01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:16.820
three time Olympian, 2008, 2012, 2016.

01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:20.340
What makes Travis Stevens great?

01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:23.080
What makes him so successful?

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:25.780
What makes him unique in your mind as an athlete?

01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:29.860
Through all the hardship he had to overcome,

01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:32.580
through his weird looking sayanagi

01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:36.180
that eventually worked out nicely,

01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:39.020
through the full richness of his personality

01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:41.140
in the context of all the other great athletes

01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:43.140
you've coached, what makes him special?

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:48.220
His fight, Travis has fight.

01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:50.700
And you know, the first time I ever saw Travis Stevens

01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:52.940
was in like recognized him.

01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:55.340
Maybe I had seen him before as a younger boy or something,

01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:57.860
but like actually recognized him as,

01:25:57.860 --> 01:26:00.940
I brought a group of young kids to Italy

01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:03.180
for a competition in a training camp.

01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:06.260
And it was this program called U23 Elite.

01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:10.820
And I picked, handpicked 20 kids to go to this event.

01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:14.280
And it was the first time I coached an international team.

01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:17.100
And I had never seen Travis fight before,

01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:18.860
compete, train, anything.

01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:21.540
And during this competition, you know,

01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:22.900
he's an 81 kilo player.

01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:25.260
I think he was maybe like 18 years old,

01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:28.140
17, 18 years old.

01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:31.140
And it was a really hard European event.

01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:34.820
And I think Travis won three matches and he lost two.

01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:37.260
But what stood out the most to me was like

01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:39.220
the fight he had in him.

01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:41.260
He was scrapping every fight.

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:42.580
Like he scrapped hard.

01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:45.100
Like he wanted to win more than any of them, right?

01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:47.380
He didn't win, but he wanted to win more.

01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:49.740
And I noticed that right away.

01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:52.620
And then I also noticed that after he lost his second match

01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:54.400
and he was eliminated from the tournament,

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:57.020
I saw how disappointed he was in himself.

01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:58.780
Like he actually thought he was supposed

01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:01.900
to beat those people, even though he was like 17, right?

01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:03.940
And he's fighting against grown men that are, you know,

01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:06.340
a high level judo, much higher than he was.

01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:09.780
And I said to him, I said, hey son, like, don't worry, man.

01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:11.260
You got a long career ahead of you.

01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:13.620
Like, I'm glad you're disappointed,

01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:15.740
but there's so many things you don't know

01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:17.680
and so many skills you don't have.

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:19.520
The fact that you were able to hold your own

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.900
and scrap like that, like you've got a good future.

01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:24.940
And I remember calling my friend, Jason Morris,

01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:26.460
after that tournament.

01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:27.300
And I said, hey man,

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:29.780
did you ever hear of this kid, Travis Stevens?

01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:30.860
He says, no, why?

01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:33.020
I said, man, that kid's got some fight in him, right?

01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:35.740
And I said that, I said that to Jason at the time.

01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:37.220
I said, that kid's got some fight in him, man.

01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:38.940
He's pretty talented, you know?

01:27:38.940 --> 01:27:40.240
And that's how it started.

01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:43.420
So I saw that in him when he was young.

01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:46.260
But the other thing was Travis,

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:50.380
like there's no such thing as hard work to that guy.

01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:52.940
If you tell him to put his head through the wall

01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:53.900
and that's how he wins,

01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:55.220
he'll go put his head through the wall.

01:27:55.220 --> 01:28:00.220
He'll do whatever it takes for him to do to achieve success.

01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:06.020
And he hates failure more than he likes winning, 100%.

01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:09.020
He always has.

01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:11.140
He punishes himself when he doesn't do well.

01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:12.660
He makes himself work harder.

01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:17.660
He goes and just abuses himself when he doesn't succeed

01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:22.280
because he's so heartbroken and disappointed in himself.

01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:24.920
So that's a trait that I think all of the athletes

01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:28.960
that I work with closely, they all had that same trait.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.840
They hated losing more than anything.

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:31.920
They would break their arm.

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.600
They'd fall on their head.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:36.880
They'd rather get hit by a car than lose a judo tournament.

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.280
And as a result, then they all had fight

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:40.800
and they all were willing to train.

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.160
They were willing to listen.

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:44.660
They would do anything for victory.

01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:47.440
Within the rules, I'm not talking about taking drugs

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:48.280
or anything like that,

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:52.720
they'd give 100% of themselves for victory.

01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:56.080
And Travis was somebody that when he was down,

01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:58.720
he found a way to get better doing something else.

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:01.520
If he couldn't do standing, that's when he started jiu-jitsu.

01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:03.120
He couldn't go on his feet anymore.

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:04.880
He couldn't stand up and train.

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:06.440
I might as well go learn jiu-jitsu

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:09.320
and get good on the ground because I can.

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:11.800
So he always found a way and no matter what obstacle

01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:14.320
was in his way, he just went around it.

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.640
So what about the, it'd be interesting

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:18.120
to get your perspective

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:19.960
because I know Travis's perspective

01:29:19.960 --> 01:29:24.200
is the just the number of injuries.

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.440
Like what do you make of the perseverance

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.800
through all the injuries he had to overcome?

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.880
Specifically, like you just observing this creature

01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:33.480
that you've coached.

01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:37.240
I mean, he seems to not see the injuries as a problem.

01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:40.780
He just like, just like you said, head through the wall.

01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:44.840
It's like what, like when we were talking about injuries,

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:49.560
he doesn't even see the injuries themselves as the problem

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:52.200
because he thinks that the injuries,

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:54.520
you heal back stronger.

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:57.240
I forget the exact quote, but he said like,

01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:02.240
my body is now less injury prone than most of anyone else.

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.080
Because I've already broken everything.

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:07.480
And it's just grown back stronger.

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:08.640
Because I asked him something like,

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:10.960
do you regret sort of pushing your body

01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:14.820
to all of those places that resulted in those injuries?

01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:19.500
His response was like, no, I'm stronger now.

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:21.900
So I don't know if that's justification,

01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:24.740
but that certainly describes a mindset that,

01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:27.700
yeah, head through the wall that doesn't,

01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:30.620
it's almost not dramatic.

01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:32.460
Like, look, I got this injury.

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:35.240
It's so, I'm so like brave and special

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.380
for overcoming this injury.

01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:39.900
He's just, that's part of the job

01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:41.580
and he gets the job done.

01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:44.420
But like that job involves a lot of injuries.

01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:46.780
One of the talks I gave Travis and that team

01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:49.120
at that particular tournament was

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:51.300
at the very beginning of the camp, after the tournament,

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:53.420
I said to them, listen, my vision,

01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:54.620
I shared my vision with them.

01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:57.940
I said, my vision is, in seven years,

01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:00.740
because that was 2005, I said, in seven years,

01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:04.340
I wanna have a US team that steps on the mat,

01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:06.300
that is ready to kick ass.

01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:07.940
And in order to get there,

01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:09.820
all of you guys can be a part of this team

01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:12.340
and part of this process, but in order to get there,

01:31:12.340 --> 01:31:14.420
you guys have to be the first ones to practice.

01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:15.900
You have to be the last ones to leave

01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:18.740
because we have to work harder than the rest of the world

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:20.620
because we're up against all odds.

01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:23.740
I said, I am sick of America being a laughing stock

01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:26.740
of judo and being the first round, easy match,

01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:28.760
warm up for everybody else.

01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:32.180
I said, if you get injured, you're not gonna be on the side

01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:36.140
with a ice bag on, taking off rounds

01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:37.900
and then get back on the mat the next day

01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:39.100
and tell me you're okay.

01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:41.340
If you can train the next day, you can train today.

01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:42.220
So there's no injury.

01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:44.180
The only time you'll leave in this dojo

01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:47.180
is if the ambulance has to take you out of here.

01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:51.340
And I do think subliminally, Travis bought into that message

01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:53.340
and heard that message then and said,

01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:55.660
if I'm gonna be a champ, then that's the way I'm gonna do it.

01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:58.960
And he did, and he embodied it, he lived it.

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:02.580
Man, there were many times in Europe where I said,

01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:05.260
dude, just tape it up, go off to the side,

01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:07.660
just take the day off, like take the rest of the day off,

01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:08.900
you're beat up, you can't do it.

01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:10.420
He said, no, no, I'm gonna tape it up, I'm gonna tape it up.

01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:12.460
I said, no, you don't need it right now.

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:14.420
And he said, no, Sensei, I'm doing it.

01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:18.620
The ambulance isn't taking me out, it's just my wrist,

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:20.460
it's just my ankle, it's just my wrist.

01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:23.300
It's just my ankle, yeah, I love it.

01:32:23.300 --> 01:32:27.180
Yeah, what about the, so the other really big thing

01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:30.540
is you comment on a little bit is the weight cut.

01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:33.880
So early in his career, he was 81 kg

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:37.220
and that was presumably not so difficult.

01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:40.400
But later in his career, he is 81 kg

01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:42.960
and it's becoming more and more difficult.

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:47.120
So that's the other thing with him is,

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:50.320
so I've known a lot of really, really tough people

01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:53.080
at the highest levels broken by the weight cut.

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:55.440
Like that can break the toughest minds

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:57.960
and it doesn't seem to have broken him

01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:02.960
and he delivered on it often on like insane weight cuts.

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:07.320
So just as a coach, what do you think about his particular,

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:10.720
his mind and the challenge of the weight cut?

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.440
It was part of his process.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:15.160
It was part of his way of getting ready for battle.

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:16.200
Suffering?

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.880
Yeah, it really was.

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:20.480
And if I'm gonna suffer this much,

01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:22.460
then I'm gonna make my opponents pay

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:24.840
for all the suffering that I went through to get here.

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:26.020
That was his mindset.

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.100
Later on in his career, you're right,

01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:31.240
like a lot of times Travis,

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:33.400
he would never step on a scale

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.200
until he got to the tournament.

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:37.600
And even when he'd get to the tournament,

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.560
like he'd weigh like 90 kilos.

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:42.560
He'd show up at the tournament nine kilos over.

01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:44.760
I'm like, you have to, but I never,

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.640
it was just an expectation of making weight.

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.400
Not making weight was never an option

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:52.200
for any of our athletes and Travis knew it.

01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:56.440
And he said, as a professional, my job is to make weight.

01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:57.680
If I don't make weight,

01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:00.680
he was never gonna allow that to happen

01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:02.760
and he was never gonna allow us to come to him and say,

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.920
hey, I told you,

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:07.800
cause he losing wasn't an option.

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:08.900
Making a weight wasn't,

01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:11.740
not making weight was not an option for him ever either.

01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:14.360
But a lot of times he wouldn't even,

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.360
he'd be nine kilos over on the plane

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.000
going over to the tournament

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.200
and have to make weight three days later.

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:22.160
And he didn't break 86 kilos

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.760
until the day before the tournament.

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.780
Like he had five kilos over the day before,

01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:27.800
that was his way.

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:30.520
But he would do three workouts,

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:32.560
wake up in the morning, workout, then he'd eat,

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:34.240
then he'd workout in the afternoon,

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:35.060
then he'd eat again,

01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:36.600
then he'd workout again at night.

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:37.840
And then he'd reward himself,

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:39.000
hey, I worked out three times today,

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000
he'd go have a Mountain Dew or a chocolate bar.

01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:47.400
And then he's next morning, he's back up to 87

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:51.360
and he would never touch weight until the morning of weigh-ins.

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:57.820
When he wasn't on weight for more than like five minutes.

01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:00.840
His process would break a lot of people.

01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:03.560
So the fact that he got the job done is...

01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:04.840
Not just the job done,

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:07.440
but every single time he got the job done.

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:10.160
And I made those athletes fight.

01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:11.500
We would fight in Paris,

01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.320
we would do a camp for a week,

01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:15.440
double session camp for a week.

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.540
He'd be seven kilos over,

01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:19.760
have to fight the next weekend.

01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:21.900
We're talking two or three days later.

01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:23.580
So not only did he make the weight,

01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:26.460
but he did a grueling training camp twice a day

01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:29.560
and then cut weight and then fought again.

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:31.200
Then did another camp for a week

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:32.800
in double session training camp

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.440
and then fought on a third weekend in a row.

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:37.360
And our athletes went through hell.

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:38.720
All of our athletes went through hell

01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:42.320
because on the tour around the world,

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:45.000
they fought in every event, they did every camp,

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.600
they fought in every event.

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.880
Whereas most of the other teams like Japan

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:51.440
comes in and fights in Paris, then they go home.

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.880
They maybe do a camp for three days, then they go home.

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:56.680
They don't stay in Europe for four or five weeks straight

01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:57.960
and fight in every tournament.

01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.480
And when you get to Germany,

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:01.360
the Germans skip the French Open,

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:02.560
they skip the camp in France,

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.240
they're just getting ready for Germany.

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:06.160
Our athletes already had two competitions,

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:09.100
two training camps, three weight cuts now.

01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:10.840
And then, so they're not a hundred percent

01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:12.280
when they fight in Germany,

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:14.740
but that's all part of the experience they need,

01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:15.960
the training that they need

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:18.480
that they don't get here in this country.

01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.240
And all of those were just preparation

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:23.520
for our world championships or our Olympic games.

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:26.560
So by the time our athletes got to those tournaments,

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.580
they felt so strong, so rested,

01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:32.980
so like, man, this guy that felt like a monster in Germany

01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:34.580
feels like nothing today

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:37.260
because you're fully rested now, you know?

01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:38.500
But part of the challenge is

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:42.060
because the American team is smaller and more,

01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:44.060
I mean, just smaller,

01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:49.060
is all the different places you go to do the weight cut,

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:54.380
to do the diet, to do the preparation or the recovery,

01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:58.140
there's like that process changes every time.

01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:01.580
So you basically have to improvise a lot.

01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:02.420
Oh yeah.

01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:05.100
You show up to a hotel and how you do the weight cut,

01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:05.920
you don't know,

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.340
and there's the different weather conditions.

01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:11.140
It's not, it's like, what is it?

01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:12.580
Rocky versus Drago, right?

01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:13.420
Right.

01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:15.180
So you don't have, you have to just improvise.

01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:16.860
And that's also a fascinating part

01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:18.100
of the American judo story,

01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:19.920
which is like, you have to improvise more.

01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:22.860
Well, it was funny because when I, it was 1990,

01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:25.040
and it was at the Goodwill Games, right?

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:28.460
And we were, it was a US Olympic committee type event

01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:31.580
and so we're on the bus with the swim team.

01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:34.540
And it was me and Jason Morris on the American team

01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:36.420
and we're going to the judo competition,

01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:38.220
but we're on the bus with the swim team.

01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:40.820
I'm sorry, we're going to the venue where we're staying.

01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:42.700
You know, I remember being like by ourselves

01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:45.260
with no staff, no manager, no coach,

01:37:45.260 --> 01:37:48.340
we're just by ourselves going to fight in Russia, right?

01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:52.860
And the swim team's on there with their full sweats

01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:54.940
and their staff and like their managers.

01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:57.540
And I heard the lady, the girl go,

01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:58.700
I'm sorry, this was 1994

01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:00.180
because it was in St. Petersburg, Russia.

01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:02.700
So I heard the little girl on the team,

01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:03.780
she goes up to the coach, she goes,

01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:06.900
coach, do you think you can send a massage therapist

01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:08.060
to my room at Tanyaim?

01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:10.340
You know, I'm feeling kind of jet lag.

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:12.460
I looked at, me and Jason looked at,

01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:13.700
we looked at each other like,

01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:17.700
what, she's scheduling a massage?

01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:18.740
We don't even have a staff.

01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:20.440
Like, what the hell is going on here?

01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:23.500
You know, what a difference in sporting,

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:26.380
you know, different sports within the same country,

01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:27.340
you know, and-

01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:29.940
Not to romanticize things,

01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:32.660
but that you do represent the spirit of the Olympics

01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:37.380
when you're kind of the improvisational nature of it.

01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:41.580
Cause it is just you, you and sometimes you and the coach

01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:46.580
and just pure guts and you against the world with no money.

01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:48.580
The warrior spirit.

01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:49.680
The warrior spirit.

01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:53.140
How did it feel like when he,

01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:56.500
after being in two Olympics,

01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:59.100
beating some of the best people in the world,

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:01.340
facing some of the best people in the world

01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:04.340
and just barely losing,

01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:06.140
what did it feel like to you as a coach

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:08.660
to see Travis Stevens win the silver medal?

01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:10.880
Electric.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.900
First of all, in 2012 in London,

01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:20.140
it was like, it felt like somebody died.

01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:21.580
I'm not going to be, I'm not going to lie to you.

01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:22.420
Like-

01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:23.460
The Ole Bischoff match?

01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:27.140
No, just seeing Travis not finish on the podium, period.

01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:30.300
You know, in the Ole Bischoff match,

01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:33.620
I thought he won regardless of who won and who lost.

01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:35.980
He just left everything he had on that mat, right?

01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:38.700
10 minutes of probably it was a 20 something minute match,

01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:40.860
but 10 minutes of fighting actually, right?

01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:43.060
He left everything he had.

01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:44.460
He wanted to be in the Olympic finals.

01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:46.140
He wanted to be an Olympic champion.

01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:47.860
And when he didn't get that opportunity,

01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:48.860
he lost everything.

01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:50.300
He drained himself.

01:39:50.300 --> 01:39:52.720
He cried for 45 minutes straight.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:53.800
I couldn't regroup him.

01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:54.800
I couldn't get him out.

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.920
I said, Travis, you've got to stop your crying.

01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:58.440
You've got to get off the floor.

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.240
We've got a bronze medal fight.

01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:03.800
Like if you don't recover, you're not going to perform well.

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:04.960
And he just didn't care.

01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:06.960
Like it was gold or nothing.

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:09.720
And so when he walked out against the Canadian boy,

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:12.000
he had beaten the Canadian, I think at that time,

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.040
he had beaten that Canadian every single time

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.060
except for that bronze medal match.

01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:18.460
But he just didn't have the fight in him anymore.

01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:19.720
You know, he'd left it all out in the match

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:20.960
and the Bischoff match.

01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:23.160
So to see him come back with zero, right?

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:26.760
We just had a team where his best friend, Marty Malloy,

01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:29.160
won a bronze medal, right?

01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:31.600
Then the day after Travis fights,

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:34.180
Kayla Harrison goes and wins her first gold medal, right?

01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:35.020
Our first ever gold.

01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:37.040
So we have a gold and a bronze.

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:38.480
His training partner wins a gold.

01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:41.200
His best friend from growing up wins a bronze.

01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:42.880
He has nothing, right?

01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:46.980
To see him for four years go through hell,

01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:49.600
like literally like all of his injuries,

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:52.480
every training camp, and then forget the humiliation

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:56.520
because every time any reporter ever came to my dojo,

01:40:56.520 --> 01:40:57.640
they wanna talk to Kayla.

01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:59.080
She's the Olympic champion.

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:00.920
Who is this Travis guy?

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:01.980
Who is this guy?

01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:05.800
So he didn't medal, he's not that important.

01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:08.800
Up until you get to the right before the Olympics,

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:11.720
now they talk about he's an Olympian again.

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:14.520
But up until that point, and then every little kid

01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:17.220
see Kayla's medal, oh, Travis, yeah,

01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:19.620
you went to the Olympics, where's your medal?

01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:20.460
How did you do?

01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:23.380
I took fifth, I didn't place.

01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:25.580
It's the lowest of low every day

01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:27.400
having that constant reminder.

01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:29.460
So four years later,

01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:34.700
when that guy, I mean, mentally, he was ready.

01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:37.940
Physically, he was ready.

01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:41.780
That was the best and strongest Travis Stevens

01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:44.180
that I've ever seen and I've ever felt.

01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:46.260
Because I had to get on the mat and do some drills

01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:49.100
and stuff like that and try to defend arm bars

01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:51.340
because we didn't have a lot of bodies in Rio.

01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:53.140
And I was like, my God, he's,

01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:54.340
I said after one of the practice,

01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:56.620
this is the strongest I've ever felt that guy, right?

01:41:56.620 --> 01:41:59.140
Before the competition, so physically he was ready.

01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:01.940
Mentally, the morning of competition, I said to Travis,

01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:04.620
I looked him in the eye and I said,

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:06.380
we're ready to go over to the venue.

01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:08.020
I said, are you ready today?

01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:10.380
And he just looked at me and like, he goes,

01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:12.460
I am gonna shock the world today.

01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:14.100
That's what he told me, I'm gonna shock the world today.

01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:16.940
And I said, all right, great, let's go, right?

01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:18.620
So we go to the venue.

01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:23.180
And every other athlete was just like nervously,

01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:25.340
like doing repetitions of Uchi Komis.

01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:27.100
You could see like sweat coming out.

01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:29.820
You could see like all this nervous energy

01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:31.580
going through their body.

01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:32.820
And here comes Travis Stevens.

01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:35.460
He's got these big goofy headphones on.

01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:38.220
He's got a tank top that says USA on it.

01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:41.260
He's got the swim trunks that say USA,

01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:44.300
that have shiny letters that glow in the dark.

01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:47.580
And he's like, and this is in the middle of the judo hall

01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:48.780
where all these athletes are warming up

01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:50.060
for their first match.

01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:53.260
He's like dancing around, like doing this loose warmup,

01:42:53.260 --> 01:42:56.780
like almost like a little kid at an amusement park

01:42:56.780 --> 01:42:59.540
whose dad said, yeah, go play, you know?

01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:01.940
And it was like, he had waited four years for that moment.

01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:06.940
He was so relaxed, so focused, so relaxed and couldn't wait.

01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:08.700
It was like a cage tiger.

01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:10.740
Like if you, like coming out of the chute

01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:14.860
to go step onto the mat was like this tiger

01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:17.340
that you were just letting out of the cage and he just go.

01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:18.700
Like now is your time to go fight.

01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:20.460
And that's what he did that whole day.

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:25.180
And like when he beat Chirikishvili in the semis

01:43:25.180 --> 01:43:27.860
and choked him out and won that fight,

01:43:27.860 --> 01:43:31.900
like there's nobody with the exception of maybe

01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:33.340
the guys in the American team,

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:35.660
there was nobody in that stadium

01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:38.420
that expected Travis to beat him, nobody.

01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:41.580
Like, you know, he had smashed Travis,

01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:43.460
I don't know how many times before that free poem,

01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:44.580
like in the first minute even.

01:43:44.580 --> 01:43:46.020
It wasn't even a fight, right?

01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:49.140
And it was great game plan.

01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:51.740
He's the world number one at the time too.

01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:56.860
World number one at the time, world champion,

01:43:56.860 --> 01:43:59.940
carried the flag for the Georgian federation

01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:01.500
walking into the games,

01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:06.340
most dominant 80-1 kilo player in that weight class

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:08.220
for quite some time.

01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:11.180
And man, we just had his number

01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:13.220
and Travis was ready to go, you know?

01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:14.060
It was so cool.

01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:15.220
It was so awesome.

01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:17.340
We had already won,

01:44:17.340 --> 01:44:20.220
Kayla had already won her second goal, right?

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:24.340
The way the event went and Travis winning that

01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:26.340
was like icing on the cake for our team.

01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:29.220
That was the best performance we've ever had in history.

01:44:29.220 --> 01:44:30.060
It's awesome.

01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:31.620
So you mentioned Kayla.

01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:36.620
She is one of, if not the greatest American judoka ever,

01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:39.500
two-time gold medalist.

01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:41.940
2010 world champion.

01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:42.780
2010.

01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:43.820
For senior worlds.

01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:45.540
Senior worlds.

01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:49.180
What makes Kayla special?

01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:51.380
What makes her so great?

01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:53.260
What made this champion?

01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:57.460
It's combination of a lot of things.

01:44:57.460 --> 01:45:01.180
One was obviously Kayla's mental toughness, right?

01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:03.900
To overcome what she overcame.

01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:05.780
You know, this is a girl who,

01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:09.260
you know, let's, I don't wanna say forget

01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:10.340
about the sexual abuse,

01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:13.300
but the fact that she had to go through that in life

01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:15.860
and learned how to compartmentalize that

01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:18.460
and keep that off as a separate part of her brain,

01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:21.100
you know, and forget about it and move on.

01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:23.740
That took an incredible team to help her do that.

01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:28.180
And my dad was a huge part of her accomplishing that.

01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:29.580
So for people who don't know,

01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:32.340
we should comment and say that Kayla had to go

01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:37.340
through trauma in her earlier life through sexual abuse

01:45:37.460 --> 01:45:39.740
and had to overcome that through the whole process

01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:43.260
of becoming a champion as well.

01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:45.980
Because she had zero self-esteem, zero self-worth.

01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:47.460
She was at the lowest of lows

01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:51.620
and didn't even wanna be on this earth, right?

01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:56.220
So she was traumatized obviously for,

01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:57.500
and getting her the right help

01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:59.140
and surrounding her with the right people

01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:01.500
who could help her get through that

01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:05.020
and be by her side as she's getting through that

01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:06.780
and letting her know and reaffirming

01:46:06.780 --> 01:46:08.380
that she's doing the right thing

01:46:08.380 --> 01:46:09.780
and she made the right decision

01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:11.780
and she should have zero guilt.

01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:14.060
And, you know, this doesn't define her.

01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:15.820
It happened to her, but it doesn't define her.

01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:18.580
What defines her is what she does from now on.

01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:21.580
And then rebuilding that person to become who she became.

01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:25.340
I think the mental toughness is a big part of it, her mind.

01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:31.340
But then as an athlete, you know, she's a lot like Travis.

01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:33.700
You know, she's a warrior.

01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:34.540
She's a fighter.

01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:36.860
You know, my dad always jokes with her, you know?

01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:38.940
He says, you're a workhorse.

01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:39.860
You're not a thoroughbred.

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:42.140
We're not gonna treat you like a thoroughbred, right?

01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:42.980
You're a workhorse.

01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:46.020
So you're gonna work in a way you're gonna get bigger

01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:47.340
and stronger is you're gonna work harder

01:46:47.340 --> 01:46:48.180
and you're gonna keep, you know,

01:46:48.180 --> 01:46:50.500
and she came to us when she was only 15.

01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:53.500
So at that time we got her with a really good

01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:54.900
strength and conditioning coach.

01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:57.740
We did all the core Olympic style lifting.

01:46:57.740 --> 01:47:00.380
Like as her body was developing,

01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:02.380
she was getting stronger every single day.

01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:05.380
And then, you know, she had the luxury of being on the mat

01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:08.380
with, at the time I was still young enough to train

01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:10.500
and be on the mat and I was around her weight class

01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:12.140
and Travis was able to train with her.

01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:15.540
And all, we had all the top US athletes at the time

01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:16.700
training here at my school.

01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:19.140
So she got the benefit of all the best guys

01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:21.060
to train within the country, you know?

01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:24.540
And her doing all of those rounds, you know,

01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:27.660
night in, week, night, every night, every week,

01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:30.300
every year compiled with the best, you know,

01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:32.700
highest level she could as a girl.

01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:34.980
She got the strength, she got the technique, she got the,

01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:36.660
and then she had the coaching on top of it

01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:39.180
with my dad being on her as, you know, working her out

01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:43.420
and, you know, having the wherewithal to develop a strategy

01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:44.260
and a plan for her.

01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:46.260
Because when she first came here,

01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:50.260
she competed at 63 kilos, which is 138 pounds.

01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:55.060
At the time, Rhonda Rousey was also training here

01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:56.940
and she was 70 kilos.

01:47:56.940 --> 01:48:00.260
So if Kayla was struggling making 63,

01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:01.780
so the only way to, obviously,

01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:04.220
the only way to still compete is to move up.

01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:05.780
But my dad said, well, if you move up,

01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:06.940
then you're in Rhonda's weight.

01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:09.580
So let's skip that weight and you're gonna go to 78 kilos.

01:48:09.580 --> 01:48:10.460
And he told her, listen,

01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:12.500
you're gonna go up two weight classes.

01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:15.380
She looked at him and was like, that's 172 pounds.

01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:17.220
And he goes, well, I don't care.

01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:20.380
Like you're already struggling making 138, you weigh 150,

01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:21.220
what's the difference?

01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:23.220
We put 20 pounds on, go to 170.

01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:24.940
So that's why she jumped two weights

01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:26.580
because she passed Rhonda.

01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:27.500
She went to the weight above

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:29.060
so she could make the national team

01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:31.940
and she had a chance to go to the Olympics and all that.

01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:34.980
Because we envisioned Rhonda staying around till 2012.

01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:37.300
And that's also like a long-term vision

01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:40.660
because you kind of grow into that body then over time.

01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:41.500
So you can dominate,

01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:43.900
you can learn what it's like in that weight class,

01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:46.020
you can learn to dominate that weight class,

01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:47.700
excel and then dominate.

01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:49.980
People that cut weight too hard, too long,

01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:51.260
they forget about technique

01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:52.940
because they're only worried about losing weight.

01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:54.500
They're always tired in training.

01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:56.060
They don't give a hundred percent effort.

01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:57.340
They're not getting better.

01:48:57.340 --> 01:49:00.460
She now is just focused on getting better at judo,

01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:02.660
getting bigger, getting stronger, getting more powerful.

01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:04.660
So I think given her that purpose

01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:06.500
and that was a great call.

01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:09.620
What are some memorable

01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:11.900
or maybe the most memorable moment,

01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:14.700
Kayla Harrison moment to you as her coach?

01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:19.300
Not the most perhaps, let's say.

01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:21.140
What are some memorable moments?

01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:23.620
Everybody hears the good ones, right?

01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:26.220
So everybody knows she won the world championships

01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:28.780
in Tokyo in 2010.

01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:31.900
She was our two-time Olympic champion in 2012, 2016.

01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:34.140
I'll never forget those moments, right?

01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:35.380
Cause they're historic.

01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:38.660
One of the biggest moments

01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:41.620
that I like sharing this story with everybody is that

01:49:43.180 --> 01:49:45.860
in 2010 in January,

01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:48.020
Kayla was still a developing athlete

01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:50.220
and we had a local tournament in New York.

01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:51.700
It was in Brooklyn, New York.

01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:53.620
It was called the Starrett Cup.

01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:55.180
And I knew that at that tournament

01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:57.220
that two of the Canadian girls,

01:49:57.220 --> 01:49:59.740
they were like ranked 15th or 20th in the world.

01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:02.500
They weren't superstars, but they were tough players.

01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:04.740
Both of them, I knew were gonna be at that tournament.

01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:07.060
So I said, Kayla, we're gonna go to this tournament.

01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:08.620
You're gonna compete against the Canadian girls,

01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:10.140
get some good experience,

01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:11.260
figure out what you need to work on

01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:13.780
and then we'll go home and work on some stuff.

01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:14.900
Well, she went to the tournament.

01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:16.540
There was only three girls in the weight,

01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:18.420
her and the two Canadians.

01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:22.740
At that tournament, she lost both fights, right?

01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:24.780
So this is January, 2010.

01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:26.340
She lost both matches.

01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:27.260
She was competitive,

01:50:27.260 --> 01:50:29.420
but certainly things she needed to work on.

01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:32.540
It was good development thing for her and for us.

01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:34.940
It also opened her mind to say, oh man,

01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:39.500
cause she was already a junior world champion at the time.

01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:40.900
But so now there's another level.

01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:42.180
This is a senior level, right?

01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:43.380
You gotta go up another level.

01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:45.500
Here's two girls that aren't even medalists

01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:46.340
that are beating you.

01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:48.140
Now there's more work to be done.

01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:49.580
And so I like telling that story

01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:52.620
because everybody sees the champions

01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:53.460
in the greatest moments.

01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:55.580
They don't see them when they have bad days.

01:50:55.580 --> 01:50:58.700
And could you imagine being, oh and two,

01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:01.660
you feel like a failure, right?

01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:06.660
But 10 months later was Tokyo 2010.

01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:09.660
She went from oh and two at Starrett New York

01:51:10.980 --> 01:51:15.980
to world champion 2010 in the motherland in Japan.

01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:19.420
I mean, that's an amazing turnaround.

01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:22.540
And that's only possible if you put the losses

01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:24.340
in their proper context,

01:51:24.340 --> 01:51:26.580
you don't let it destroy you mentally

01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:28.100
and just keep moving forward.

01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:29.420
Correct.

01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:31.140
This is so funny.

01:51:31.140 --> 01:51:34.380
So you were there at 2010 at the Starrett Cup.

01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:35.980
Was Travis there?

01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:36.820
Yeah.

01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:37.660
I made all those,

01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:38.900
we fought at every local,

01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:41.540
like the mentality of our team was,

01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:43.800
no tournament is beneath us.

01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:47.880
If our goal is to go to the Olympics in the worlds and win,

01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:49.600
there's no tournament that's beneath us.

01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:50.880
We're gonna get experience.

01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:51.840
We're gonna fight.

01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:52.840
We're gonna learn.

01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:54.040
We're gonna compete.

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:56.360
We're gonna get better, you know?

01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:59.920
I actually, just as a funny little side,

01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:00.920
I was there.

01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:01.880
I competed.

01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:02.720
Really?

01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:04.160
This is one of the earlier tournaments,

01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:05.480
like the beginner division.

01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:07.880
Oh no, I actually did black belt division too.

01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:11.840
That was one of the, actually, yeah, I remember that.

01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:15.160
That's when it was so early that I thought,

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:19.000
like I was also really strong at that time,

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.120
just like physically, like powerlifting stuff.

01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:24.280
So I thought like, it'll be good experience

01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:26.480
to also do a black belt division.

01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:29.680
And remember, it must've been actually Travis's division,

01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:30.520
which is funny.

01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:33.760
Is Legere brothers?

01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:35.560
Yeah, Harry and Gary.

01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:37.640
They are super, they're super good

01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:38.720
and they're super dominant,

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:41.360
but I think Travis faced one of them

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:42.480
and beat them.

01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:44.640
I don't know.

01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:47.680
I just remembered, it's funny how there's just like

01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:51.400
these little roads that later reconnect,

01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:54.440
but yeah, there's some incredible people there.

01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:57.480
And I saw obviously the positive things

01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:59.880
and it's interesting that Kayla's story

01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:01.400
was also intersecting there

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:03.640
and that was one of the lower points for her.

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:07.000
Another story I like to share is that

01:53:08.120 --> 01:53:09.960
you have to know your athletes, right?

01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:13.400
And you have to really get to know their psychology,

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:15.480
what they're thinking psychologically, mentally,

01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:16.560
what's going through their head.

01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:20.040
Another story was in Tokyo.

01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:25.040
It was 2015, the Tokyo Grand Slam.

01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:28.160
So we had had Kayla face off

01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:30.880
against almost all the top girls in her division.

01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:34.120
She had beaten everybody going into the 2016 Olympics.

01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:37.640
But at the 2015 Tokyo Grand Slam,

01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:40.680
there was a girl from Japan

01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:42.240
that she hadn't fought in a long time

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:44.400
and she lost to the girl last time she fought her.

01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:47.480
So it was something we wanted her to beat this girl

01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:48.520
going into the Olympics

01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:50.680
so that she knew she could beat everybody.

01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:54.640
And it was a first round match

01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:57.920
and it was gonna be tough for Kayla, right?

01:53:57.920 --> 01:53:59.160
It was gonna be a really hard fight.

01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:02.520
And she had won a bunch of tournaments in a row

01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:03.360
leading up to that.

01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:04.560
So her confidence was really high,

01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:06.560
but at the same time,

01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:08.680
she didn't think she needed this fight.

01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:13.840
And she showed up to the tournament and she said,

01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:15.440
I don't think I can fight today.

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:17.200
I've got a stinger in my neck.

01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:18.680
I've got a stinger coming down my neck

01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:20.320
and I'm kind of sore.

01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:21.720
She didn't tell us.

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:23.360
She went and told the trainer.

01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:25.680
She walked around, she's holding her neck

01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:27.720
and me and my dad were like, what's up with her?

01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:29.080
I don't know.

01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:31.520
And then, so, I don't know,

01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:33.240
maybe she doesn't wanna fight today, I don't know, right?

01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:35.920
So all of a sudden the trainer comes up to us

01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:36.960
and she didn't come to us.

01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:37.920
The trainer came to us and says,

01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:39.720
you know, I really don't think it's a good idea

01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:41.560
that Kayla fight today.

01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:43.680
And we looked at him and we're like,

01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:46.040
well, your opinion doesn't really matter, does it?

01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:48.480
Like, what's up with her?

01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:49.800
Well, she has this thing in her neck.

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:51.640
It's like a pinched nerve and does this.

01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:55.520
And then we talked, I said,

01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:57.000
is there a risk of her getting injured?

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.640
Like, is this pain or is this risk

01:54:58.640 --> 01:54:59.640
that she's gonna get injured

01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:02.760
and she's gonna set her back like long time in her career?

01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:04.480
He says, no, she's not gonna get injured.

01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:05.320
Just a pinched nerve.

01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:06.560
There's a little pain she's gonna have to deal with.

01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:08.720
I go, okay, well, can you fix the pain?

01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:11.560
He says, yeah, I can do this and that

01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:13.760
and I can give her a shot and the pain will go away.

01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:15.640
I said, okay, then do that.

01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:17.280
And so Kayla comes up, she goes,

01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:18.960
didn't the trainer talk to you?

01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:20.280
I said, yeah, he talked to us.

01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:22.160
Well, he said, I can't fight.

01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:23.880
I know, but we already talked to the trainer

01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:27.720
and he said, you're good to go.

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:29.400
She looked at us like,

01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:30.720
and then we had to talk to her and say,

01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:34.200
listen, you're not injured, you're in pain

01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.520
because we just came from a camp.

01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:38.080
I said, you're in pain, but here's the deal.

01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:39.400
We want you to fight this girl.

01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:41.240
Why don't you go out there and beat this girl, period.

01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:43.560
I don't care, I want to know that you can beat this girl.

01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:44.600
This is why we came.

01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:48.320
This is our last hard tournament before the Olympic Games.

01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:50.440
This is what we want from you.

01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:53.360
And lo and behold, she understood.

01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:54.800
They gave her a quick shot.

01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:55.760
The rest of the world thought

01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:58.680
we were crazy making her compete.

01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:00.440
And then she went out there.

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:03.120
She fought, didn't even know she was injured.

01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:04.040
No, you know what I mean?

01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:04.880
She just went out there.

01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:06.000
She fought the tournament.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.440
She beat the Japanese girls.

01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:09.720
She ended up going through the whole tournament.

01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:11.480
She took a gold medal.

01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:12.480
She won the event.

01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:17.200
That turned out to be a great confidence builder in it.

01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:20.280
Yeah, and that kind of sets you up

01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:23.120
for all the chaos that can happen at the Olympic Games.

01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:26.000
And it tells you, if you can beat these girls

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.480
when you're not a hundred percent

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:28.440
and you're not at your best,

01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:31.800
you're physically beat, mentally beat.

01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:33.360
Imagine what you're gonna do when you're fresh.

01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:35.080
Well, when she was going to the Olympic Games,

01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:37.760
there's a lot, she had the mental game.

01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:39.560
Down. Down. Down.

01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:40.840
There wasn't a girl in that division

01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:42.920
that thought they could beat Kayla going into those games.

01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:44.400
Not a one.

01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:46.600
They just looked at her and went, no, not happening.

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:48.080
Yeah, that's great.

01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:50.080
I mean, she's a great Olympic champion,

01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:51.600
two-time Olympic champion.

01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:55.720
But there is something that she's commented on,

01:56:55.720 --> 01:57:00.120
which is she's suffered or went through depression

01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:02.480
after winning her second Olympic gold.

01:57:02.480 --> 01:57:04.200
Why do you think this happens?

01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:07.880
You often hear stories of great champions

01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:11.080
becoming depressed after the Olympics.

01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:14.400
There's a lack of purpose afterwards, right?

01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:18.520
Because you've done in life what you set out to do.

01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:20.600
You've had a goal every day you woke up.

01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:21.960
You knew what your purpose was.

01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:25.880
You knew what your day looked like.

01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:27.920
You knew why you were doing that.

01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:31.640
And all of a sudden you won and you got all the fame

01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:33.800
and you're all happy.

01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:35.360
But then you wake up and you go,

01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:37.880
now what?

01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:39.440
I don't have a next.

01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:42.120
And also because there was nothing for her,

01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:46.520
there was no path set out for Kayla that said,

01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:49.080
okay, you're gonna become an ambassador,

01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:51.800
a global ambassador of judo.

01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:55.000
The IJF is gonna help pay a salary.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.480
The USA Judo is gonna give you a salary.

01:57:57.480 --> 01:57:59.560
We want you to go teach children.

01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:02.080
We want you to go be an ambassador for women.

01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:04.920
We're gonna fly you around and whatever it is.

01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:07.240
We're gonna give you a job and here's what you're gonna do

01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:08.600
if you'd like to take it.

01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:10.440
There was nothing for her.

01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:13.320
I remember doing the interview at the Olympics with her

01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:15.720
and they said, are you gonna compete in the next Olympics?

01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:17.120
And I said, no.

01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:17.960
Why?

01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:19.080
She already two-time gold medalist.

01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:20.840
What does three-time gold medalist do for her?

01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:23.880
Doesn't motivate her to do it again.

01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:25.000
They said, are you doing MMA?

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:25.840
I said, no.

01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:26.680
Why would she do MMA?

01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:28.240
That's ridiculous.

01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:29.320
She doesn't need MMA.

01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:31.520
She should be able to make a living

01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:34.240
off of what she's accomplished in this sport

01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:36.160
for the rest of her life.

01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:37.720
But what happens is,

01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:40.000
and what most people don't understand is,

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.800
once you say I'm retired,

01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:44.720
I'm no longer competing in the sport of judo.

01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:48.880
You don't get a salary from USA Judo anymore,

01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:50.000
which she was getting.

01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:53.480
I think she got like $72,000 a year

01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:55.120
from USA Judo at the time.

01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:59.920
You don't get a stipend from the Olympic Committee anymore.

01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:01.120
Goes away.

01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:03.440
Your sponsor, like the New York Athletic Club,

01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:05.720
was a great sponsor for her for all those years.

01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:08.760
In fact, she could have never been the athlete she became

01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:10.800
without the support of the NYC.

01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:12.640
Because I talked to them when she was 15.

01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:15.160
I said, hey, I got a girl that's really good.

01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:17.920
Someday, if you invest in her now,

01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:20.120
I promise you she'll pay back for you.

01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:22.400
And I remember the day she won the Olympic gold,

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:23.240
I called the guy up.

01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:25.760
I said, hey, I told you she'd be, so.

01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:28.600
But they can no longer give you stipends

01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:29.760
because you're not competing

01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:30.880
and representing them anymore.

01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:32.160
So that goes away.

01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:35.000
All of your sponsorships

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.800
and all of your money that you would make

01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:38.480
from your TV commercials or whatever,

01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:40.840
that didn't happen for her after the Olympics

01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:42.800
because judo's an obscure sport, right?

01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:45.800
So she didn't have any opportunities for that.

01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:48.760
At the end of the day, she has no revenue coming in.

01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:49.600
How do you live?

01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:52.360
You get a bonus of 25 grand from the Olympic committee

01:59:52.360 --> 01:59:54.600
or whatever for winning a gold.

01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:56.920
But aside from that, you're not gonna live on that money.

01:59:56.920 --> 02:00:00.080
So no purpose, no goal, right?

02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:01.640
What am I gonna wake up and do tomorrow?

02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:02.480
I don't know.

02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:03.560
So she has no direction.

02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:06.440
And then at the same time, she has no money coming in.

02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:07.640
So everything shuts off.

02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:09.720
So now it's like, where do you turn?

02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:10.560
What do you do?

02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:14.400
And that leads to being depressed

02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:17.520
because yeah, even though I've accomplished all this stuff,

02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:18.880
I'm kind of lost in life.

02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:21.040
Like what's next for me?

02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:23.400
And I guess you just have to ride that out

02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:28.400
because when you're a great human being, great champion,

02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:32.400
life has a way of helping you find a way.

02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:34.760
I mean, she's in mixed martial arts now,

02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:36.640
but she has a lot of stuff going on.

02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:37.760
Right.

02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:41.280
Well, her kids, she adopted her sister's kids.

02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:43.160
So she's their legal guardian now.

02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:44.560
So that is her purpose, right?

02:00:44.560 --> 02:00:47.520
Raising these kids and making them part of her family

02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:51.160
and she's fortunate enough that she has enough money

02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:53.800
that she can do that and she can give them a good life.

02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:54.840
You know?

02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:56.480
I'm gonna ask you to start some trouble,

02:00:56.480 --> 02:00:58.600
but I heard that she said somewhere

02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:02.040
that she can be Khabib Nurmagomedov in judo.

02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:03.200
What do you think?

02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:04.040
To be honest with you,

02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:06.560
I mean, I don't know what level of judoka.

02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:07.400
Yeah, I don't know.

02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:08.240
I don't know what level he is.

02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:10.960
But I do know that that Russian system

02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:13.280
respects judo immensely.

02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:16.560
What I will tell you is this, I trained with Kayla

02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:18.240
when I was an Olympic medalist

02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:19.920
and a world champion in judo.

02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:23.040
And granted I was older when I trained with her,

02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:24.840
but you have to go as a man.

02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:29.480
You have to go 100% or she will smash you as a man.

02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:31.760
And I could tell you that if Khabib

02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:34.120
doesn't do a lot of just judo,

02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:37.000
doesn't like gripping and doesn't understand,

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:40.040
like if he can throw, that's one thing,

02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:42.920
but if he doesn't really understand judo at a high level,

02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:44.920
she will throw him.

02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:46.120
She would beat him in a match.

02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:48.960
In a judo contest, not in a mixed martial arts contest,

02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:52.160
not in a wrestling contest, not in a submission contest,

02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:56.120
in a pure judo match where he cannot grab legs

02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:58.920
and he has to grip up and just throw.

02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:01.200
I'd put my money on Kayla.

02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:05.320
Unless he's, if he could go place in the nationals

02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:06.640
in Russia, he would beat her.

02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:08.440
But if he's not at that level of judo,

02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:09.760
he's more like a brown belt

02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:13.000
or he's not a high level judo player, she will win.

02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:17.480
I saw her take some of our best juniors in this country,

02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:21.320
some of the guys that went and won,

02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:23.600
meddled in our senior nationals.

02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:26.640
I've seen her smash all of them in judo.

02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:29.600
Now, she's not gonna do that to a Travis Stevens.

02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:34.600
She's not gonna do that to a senior national champion

02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:36.960
or Olympian in our sport,

02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:40.680
but she will go toe to toe with every other male,

02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:41.680
black belts or not.

02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:46.240
Speaking of Khabib and Russia,

02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:51.560
Vladimir Putin, I don't know if you have heard of him.

02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:55.640
He's the president of Russia, but he's also a judoka.

02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:58.400
Have you gotten a chance to see him do judo?

02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:01.720
What do you think about his judo, if you were to analyze it?

02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:03.320
I'm actually really good friends

02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:04.920
with the Russian Federation.

02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:08.920
The guy in charge is Ezio Gamba.

02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:09.760
He's an Italian.

02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:11.760
He has a mastermind behind their success

02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:15.040
of the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams.

02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:18.520
2020, he suffered from leukemia, blood cancer,

02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:21.120
so he wasn't part of their 2020 program,

02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:23.440
but he was part of 2012, 2016.

02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:24.280
That whole national,

02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:27.400
the Olympic team in 2012 came to our studio

02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:30.440
and lived here for a month in Boston.

02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:31.920
They went to school in Boston.

02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:33.360
I brought them to my house.

02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:34.880
They had three Olympic champions.

02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:37.120
Three Olympic champions.

02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:37.960
They all-

02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:39.320
Oh my God, what a team.

02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:41.480
They all came and lived here in Boston for a month.

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:45.400
They wanted to be part of experience America type program,

02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:49.040
so I've seen all of them with Putin in Russia

02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:50.680
at their national training center,

02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:52.760
working out with them and taking falls

02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:53.680
and doing judo with him.

02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:58.080
So, it's hard when you're older to move in judo.

02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:01.640
I mean, I was at a high level and I'm now 51.

02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:03.560
It's hard for me to move like I used to.

02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:08.560
So, at his age, he's got to be what, between 62, 65-ish?

02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:11.320
I mean, he moves really well for somebody

02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:16.000
that's that age and probably hasn't done very much judo

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.840
for the last however many years, right?

02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:19.880
So, that tells you, at one point,

02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:21.480
he had to be a really good judo player.

02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:23.920
Yeah, he put in a lot of work at some point

02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:25.120
to develop the technique.

02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:27.520
You could tell when a great judo player,

02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:30.240
even if they haven't practiced it,

02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:33.040
even if they're up there in age,

02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:34.400
just the way they move,

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:35.920
the way they go in for a seinage,

02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:38.160
the way they go for a particular throw,

02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:40.280
the way they do foot sweeps and all that kind of stuff,

02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:42.560
you could just tell he's good at judo.

02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:43.920
That's kind of fascinating.

02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:48.240
It's fascinating to see political leaders.

02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:50.760
I've gotten to interact with quite a few

02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:54.960
for whom judo was a formative experience in their life.

02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:57.280
And that's so interesting that, for a lot of people,

02:04:57.280 --> 02:05:00.680
judo played a big part in our life, early development.

02:05:00.680 --> 02:05:04.480
It's similar to if you served in the military.

02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:07.080
There's just something about judo.

02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:09.640
As a martial art, it's not just the technique.

02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:13.200
So yes, there's something about gaining confidence

02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:17.080
through becoming aware of what your body can do,

02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:20.520
the sort of the artistry and the skill of it,

02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:22.520
also the power of being able to dominate

02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:24.680
another human being with technique,

02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:28.880
but also the, I don't know, the formality,

02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:33.600
the discipline of just honoring the tradition of it.

02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:37.000
So all of that mixed together somehow creates-

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:37.880
Memories.

02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:40.640
It creates memories that kind of define you

02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:42.800
as a human being and that you carry that forward

02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:43.640
throughout your life.

02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:45.440
And I've just been surprised to know

02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:49.040
how many powerful people internationally have,

02:05:50.440 --> 02:05:53.640
like in their heart, in their, who they are, judo.

02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:54.560
For sure. At the core of it.

02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:57.680
It makes you the human being that you are.

02:05:57.680 --> 02:05:58.520
It really does.

02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:02.640
It becomes a fabric of, the people that stick with it,

02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:03.480
that stay with it.

02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:07.560
And because it, I mean, it teaches you so many lessons.

02:06:07.560 --> 02:06:09.720
It's so memorable because of what you talked about,

02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:14.720
the tradition, but it's also, you grow with other people,

02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:16.640
and you learn from other people,

02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:19.120
and you experience things with other people.

02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:24.120
It's such a hands-on sport that it's very memorable.

02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:28.240
And people love it so much, like right now at my dojo,

02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:30.120
we have like four generations,

02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:33.240
like somebody that did judo with my dad,

02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:36.080
had a kid who trained with me,

02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:39.120
who loved judo so much, had a kid.

02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:44.000
That kid was now in his twenties who did judo,

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:45.920
and now has a kid who's two or three or four

02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:48.280
that's coming to my toddler program at my school.

02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:50.000
Like we're talking four generations,

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.640
and they all loved the experience so much

02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:54.800
and what it did for them in their lives,

02:06:54.800 --> 02:06:56.520
that they wanted the next generation

02:06:56.520 --> 02:06:58.280
to also experience the same thing.

02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:01.000
This is a tricky question,

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.280
but if people are interested in judo

02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:05.880
and want to start learning it in the United States,

02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:09.720
there's thousands of jiu-jitsu schools, for example,

02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:13.800
is there advice you can give to people interested in judo

02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:17.800
or maybe to jiu-jitsu gym owners?

02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:25.040
How do you get judo as part of your life in America?

02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:26.480
Well, I mean, if you're fortunate

02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:28.880
to live near another dojo, right?

02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:30.640
A place that has judo locally,

02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:32.720
then that's your best opportunity to learn,

02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:35.800
is to go learn from another school.

02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:39.280
Unfortunately, sometimes the nearest dojo

02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:41.840
might not be for two hours or three hours away

02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:44.520
from where you're at, which is an obstacle.

02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:45.360
You're not gonna do that.

02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:47.800
So, I mean, Travis and I did start

02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:50.400
the American judo system online.

02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:52.840
It's at usajudo.com,

02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:57.080
and we've broken down every single judo technique

02:07:57.080 --> 02:08:00.400
to the very, very basic elements of just movement.

02:08:00.400 --> 02:08:02.280
So we teach every technique

02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:05.800
of how you do it mechanically with just your feet,

02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:09.360
then how you incorporate your hands and your feet together,

02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:11.200
how you do it in all directions,

02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:13.360
moving forward, sideways, backwards,

02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:17.160
how to then introduce a partner into the movement,

02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:23.040
how to do basic uchikomi or repetitions with a partner,

02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:24.480
then moving with a partner,

02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:26.440
then how to throw your opponent static,

02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:27.320
how to throw your opponent.

02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:30.800
So basically from the very foundation of the movement

02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:33.120
all the way to the most advanced level,

02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:36.920
we've documented this through separate videos.

02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:40.040
And we've taken now, I think, 12 to 15

02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:42.240
of standing techniques combined

02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:44.600
with a whole bunch of groundwork techniques.

02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:48.040
And our goal is just to continue to build this platform out

02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:51.480
so that anybody anywhere can learn online

02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:52.520
and can ask questions.

02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:54.880
We have a live training class every couple of weeks.

02:08:54.880 --> 02:08:58.560
Every two weeks, he or I answer questions online

02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:00.320
for our members.

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:05.320
Ideally, what we'd like to do is have a standing curriculum

02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:08.800
for jujitsu instructors that want to learn

02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:10.040
and become black belts in judo.

02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:12.120
Here's how these are the techniques you need to know.

02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:14.040
This is how many reps you need to do.

02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:17.240
This is how efficient you need to get at those techniques

02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:21.440
to become certified as an instructor or become a black belt

02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:24.040
and eventually have an online promotion system

02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:27.240
where anybody anywhere can just submit videos

02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:30.160
and show us that they can do those techniques.

02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:31.800
And obviously we'll have people review them.

02:09:31.800 --> 02:09:34.200
And this is a dream and a vision,

02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:36.480
but we've already started the platform.

02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:39.920
We're about to do a collaborative effort with USA Judo

02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:41.920
where all of their members will start to get access

02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:43.400
to this platform as well.

02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:47.400
And if we can get that influx of money and people

02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:51.880
on the platform, it'll allow us to hire and grow it faster.

02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:55.640
So you also want to do like certification there.

02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:57.320
It's not just instruction.

02:09:57.320 --> 02:09:58.880
Correct.

02:09:58.880 --> 02:09:59.920
That would be amazing.

02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:01.320
Yeah.

02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:02.600
I mean, for me personally, sort of,

02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:04.760
I mean, mostly in Austin, Texas now.

02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:05.600
Right.

02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:10.240
And there's a few judo schools, but it's not, not really.

02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:11.080
Right.

02:10:11.080 --> 02:10:13.120
There's not, and it's just one of those cities

02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:15.360
that doesn't quite have, I mean, there's a few,

02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:18.240
it's basically just like a few random judo people

02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:20.280
that kind of kind of gather together

02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:23.920
a couple of times a week, but it's not a system,

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:29.000
a dojo, an instructor integrated into a judo school or not.

02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:35.080
The problem with most judo dojos right now is that

02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:37.840
most of them cater towards the competitive side.

02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:41.520
Also, a lot of them do it recreationally,

02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:43.280
meaning this isn't how they make a living.

02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:45.840
So they're there three nights a week or they're there five,

02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:47.280
even if they're there five nights a week,

02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:51.000
it's still only one junior class and one senior class

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:51.840
and that's it.

02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:53.200
And it's one size fits all.

02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:54.680
It doesn't matter what level you're at,

02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:55.640
it's one size fits all.

02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:58.120
So you can't get out of the training,

02:10:58.120 --> 02:10:59.680
what you're looking to get out of the training,

02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:01.680
it's whatever the instructor's teaching.

02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:04.960
And you can't learn because it's not

02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:06.360
at the appropriate level for you.

02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:08.360
And usually you're pushed into doing randori

02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:09.280
where you have no choice,

02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:11.480
but to do the randori part of the training.

02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:14.680
So it's a challenge to go learn.

02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:18.280
And then a lot of times the schools are old school,

02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:20.320
so they go make you do falls for a half hour.

02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:23.040
They make you do things, maybe your jiu-jitsu

02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:25.280
person who knows how to fall already,

02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:27.200
but you haven't proven it to the jiu-jitsu instructor

02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:28.640
and they don't break the norm and say,

02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:30.200
you still have to fall for six months,

02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:32.520
which turns a lot of people away as well.

02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:36.160
So it's like any business.

02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:40.920
If you don't deliver on your customer's expectations,

02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:42.920
you're not gonna have very many customers,

02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:44.520
which is the way it is now.

02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:47.600
So a lot of people do listen to this,

02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:49.920
but in general in the United States practice

02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:51.360
Brazilian jiu-jitsu,

02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:54.120
which has a lot of similarities to judo

02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:56.240
as obviously its origins in judo.

02:11:57.400 --> 02:11:59.280
How would you compare the two arts

02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:00.840
from the perspective of people

02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:03.160
just interested about both arts?

02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:07.480
Do you recommend people who do jiu-jitsu get into judo?

02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:10.600
How can it enrich their jiu-jitsu?

02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:11.960
How do you compare the two arts,

02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:15.680
the actual practice of it and why it might be useful to you?

02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:19.720
I mean, I think that judo is a hard sport for adults to do.

02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:23.240
It just is, especially people that haven't fallen

02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:25.760
in a long time, aren't very athletic.

02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:30.000
I think about my own experience, right?

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.080
Other than judo, when did I ever do

02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:33.800
like a forward somersault?

02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:35.720
Maybe when I was in grade school, right?

02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:39.120
That's the last time I've left my feet was in grade school.

02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:42.800
Most people haven't got off of a chair or a couch.

02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:45.640
They spend eight to 10 hours a day either working

02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:48.840
behind a computer or sitting on a couch watching TV, right?

02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:50.600
And they're not that athletic.

02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:51.920
And they haven't done anything athletic

02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:55.120
at least probably since high school, right?

02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:57.440
That's their last athletic endeavor, most of them.

02:12:57.440 --> 02:12:59.080
So you're talking about as an adult,

02:12:59.080 --> 02:13:01.960
that's 35 or 40 wanting to start a sport.

02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:04.040
Judo is a really hard sport to start,

02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:06.920
especially in today's dojos

02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:09.760
that don't have a recreational adult program.

02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:11.680
You know, when it's one size fits all, it's hard.

02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:15.760
So for those people, jiu-jitsu makes a heck of a lot of sense.

02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:18.800
It's good self-defense, it's cerebral,

02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:21.360
where you gotta use your brain, you're a smaller person,

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:23.120
you have to use technique, you know,

02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:25.400
it teaches all the same things as judo,

02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:27.040
but it's a safe way to do it.

02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:31.160
And because of the validation it has with the UFC

02:13:31.160 --> 02:13:33.120
and MMA today, right?

02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:34.560
Everybody knows jiu-jitsu,

02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:37.120
so now they can be part of mainstream society

02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:40.240
and talk intelligently about what they see on television

02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:42.200
or what's going on on ESPN today, right?

02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:43.040
They have some knowledge.

02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:45.840
So they have an identity.

02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:47.880
And also there's a good culture in jiu-jitsu

02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:49.480
where it's becoming a family.

02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:51.400
You know, the dojo is the family place.

02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:53.960
You go to feel good, you go to see your friends,

02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:57.200
you go to get fit and you have a good time, right?

02:13:57.200 --> 02:13:59.840
So it makes a lot of sense why it's growing.

02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:03.120
Judo on the other hand, I think is a better sport

02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:04.480
for children to do.

02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:08.240
It's more, I would say, fun and interactive.

02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:10.120
It's a little easier to teach the kids

02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:12.200
how to do the throwing skills

02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:14.320
and for safety and things like that.

02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:16.800
Their body can handle more than the adults can.

02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:18.640
They're less likely to get injured.

02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:21.560
It makes them better athletes

02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:24.440
because it's a lot more three-dimensional in my opinion.

02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:28.320
So I think there's a good fit between

02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:32.160
judo can thrive from kids till, you know, whatever,

02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:34.120
high school, college.

02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:37.760
Jiu-jitsu thrives from that 18-year-old up, right?

02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:39.640
Right now that's kind of where it is.

02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:43.640
So as a dojo, you have to kind of focus on the teens

02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:46.840
and the college, like early 20s, that kind of-

02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:48.600
Or you need to have,

02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:50.560
if you're gonna be a successful judo dojo,

02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:53.880
you have to have that recreational,

02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:56.680
fundamental adult program in your school

02:14:56.680 --> 02:15:00.760
where people actually come to judo, learn the moves,

02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:03.520
but aren't pushed into randori training

02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:05.760
and pushed into things where they're uncomfortable

02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:08.000
and they can't control the situation

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:09.760
because there's too many unknowns.

02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:14.280
You got an education at Browns.

02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:15.720
You're somebody who's amazing

02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:18.360
because as an Olympian and an Olympic coach,

02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:20.880
you've always emphasized kind of balance and education

02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:24.440
and all of that side of life.

02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:26.200
So developing your brain too.

02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:29.520
So you are an Olympic medalist,

02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:32.960
a coach of Olympic medalists, you're a business owner.

02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:35.680
So successful in all these domains.

02:15:35.680 --> 02:15:37.000
So I have to ask,

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:40.120
what advice would you give to young people today,

02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:44.960
high school, judo age, high school, college, undergrad,

02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:49.280
how to be successful in their career

02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:50.880
or just in life in general,

02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:53.520
how to live a life they can be proud of?

02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:57.960
I think you have to be true to yourself.

02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:00.720
You have to decide what it is you really wanna do

02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:02.280
with your life.

02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:04.080
And it's hard because when I grew up,

02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:05.960
I didn't know I was gonna be successful.

02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:07.600
When I was young,

02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:09.080
I didn't know I was gonna be an Olympic medalist.

02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:12.080
I certainly did envision myself owning a couple of companies

02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:14.920
that makes their living exclusively

02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:16.200
for martial arts or judo

02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:18.560
because that wasn't really an opportunity when I was a kid,

02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:20.640
but I've created that opportunity.

02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:22.200
I would just say that,

02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:24.640
pick something that you're passionate about.

02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:26.040
I was stuck in a career before

02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:28.000
where I wasn't passionate about it.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:29.840
And it was my wife who said,

02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:32.080
Jimmy, if you can figure out

02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:36.760
how to make your living exclusively for martial arts,

02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:38.960
where your brain and your heart and your passion

02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:42.160
is all towards one thing that you really like,

02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:43.360
then you'll be successful.

02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:44.320
And I left the job.

02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:45.160
I had three kids.

02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:48.000
I was working for monster.com.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:49.880
I was in internet marketing

02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:51.640
and I was working for that company, great company,

02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:53.080
nothing wrong with the company,

02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:56.560
but sitting behind the desk from eight till five,

02:16:56.560 --> 02:17:00.600
and then I get to go to judo from six till nine at night.

02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:02.240
My whole day is tied up doing something

02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:04.080
that I'm really not passionate about.

02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:07.200
She said, if you can figure out how to make money

02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:10.360
from your dojo and other things judo related,

02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:11.600
then I think you'll be successful.

02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:13.200
And so she's the one that my wife, Maria,

02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:15.360
gave me that advice and I would give that to others.

02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:17.120
Find something that you love doing

02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:18.800
where it doesn't feel like work,

02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:20.160
something you're passionate about.

02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:22.320
And if the opportunity doesn't exist,

02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:23.400
how to make money on it,

02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:25.280
you can create the opportunity.

02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:26.920
Be resourceful, figure it out.

02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:29.360
Don't let anybody tell you you can't do it.

02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:33.320
I didn't know that I could have a 200 person judo school

02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:34.600
that only taught judo

02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:37.480
because it really didn't exist in this country.

02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:40.360
That actually charges money like jujitsu charges.

02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:42.600
We're talking not, there's plenty of clubs out there

02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:45.160
that charge 10 bucks a month that might have 100 people,

02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:46.720
but there's not many that,

02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:49.920
where the tuition is $150 a month, having 200 people.

02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:54.520
So that's a successful business, but it wasn't done before.

02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:57.520
But be passionate about it, understand you're gonna fail,

02:17:57.520 --> 02:17:59.280
understand you're gonna get knocked down,

02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:03.600
there's gonna be dark days, but you gotta persevere.

02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:04.920
You gotta believe in yourself.

02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:06.640
You gotta have a plan.

02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:09.600
You have to be willing to learn from other people.

02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:10.760
And that's what I did.

02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:13.960
If I didn't know it, I brought somebody in to tell me,

02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:14.840
what am I doing wrong?

02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:17.040
Like, look from the outside, what do you see?

02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:19.680
Okay, great, then you gotta be willing to change.

02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:21.840
You gotta be willing to adapt.

02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:25.960
And I think listening, believing in myself

02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:27.840
and creating opportunity.

02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:30.440
And the other thing is helping others.

02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:35.080
Something I always did in my in my judo life

02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:37.040
and in my business life.

02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:39.880
If somebody came to me and asked for help with,

02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:41.800
hey man, is there something you can do to help me?

02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:43.760
I'm trying to get this thing started.

02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:46.480
I'm trying to get this dojo off the ground

02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:48.600
or I'm trying to run this event series

02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:52.560
or I was creative in trying to figure out a way

02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:54.080
to help them make it work.

02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:56.160
Because if that really was their dream

02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:58.120
and I could help them do their dream,

02:18:58.120 --> 02:18:59.880
I felt like that person would then

02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:04.160
give nothing but good, good comments about us.

02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:06.560
Good, good, like they remembered forever.

02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:08.160
They become like family.

02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:11.120
And they'd be the best advocates for your business ever.

02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:13.800
And so the kids that I taught at my dojo

02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:14.880
were treated that way.

02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:17.120
The people that worked for me get treated that way.

02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:20.120
The people that my customers that I work with

02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:23.560
and building their dojos get treated that way.

02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:24.800
People that ran tournaments,

02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:27.320
whether it was Grappler's Quest years ago

02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:29.200
and helping that guy with a full set of mats

02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:32.360
for his Brian Simmons with his thing or

02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:37.480
any of the Gracie's, it just became like family.

02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:39.080
And then I just work hard and deliver

02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:40.720
on what I say I'm gonna do.

02:19:40.720 --> 02:19:43.120
If I say I'm gonna do it, I do it.

02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:44.480
And I think it goes a long way.

02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:45.760
Well, and I got a comment.

02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:49.360
So in a small way, people may not know.

02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:50.640
I think it's still on YouTube.

02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:52.920
We previously talked many years ago.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:57.120
And I remember you were so kind to me.

02:19:57.120 --> 02:19:58.960
And you didn't really know who I was.

02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:01.120
You just took me as a human being.

02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:02.640
You welcomed me into your dojo.

02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:05.120
And we just had a conversation on a podcast

02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:07.080
or whatever the heck you call that thing.

02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:09.160
And you were just very kind.

02:20:09.160 --> 02:20:12.160
And you were also just,

02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:16.320
it was the last conversation I had

02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:20.240
when I showed up to MIT and it stayed with me.

02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:23.160
So I've resumed doing this podcast,

02:20:23.160 --> 02:20:24.920
but it stayed with me because you said

02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:29.000
you said that I did a good job at this.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:32.560
And people, especially at that time, didn't tell me that.

02:20:33.720 --> 02:20:36.240
And just that little act of kindness

02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:38.120
is probably just a regular part of your day.

02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:38.960
You had a busy day.

02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:40.120
It was the end of the day.

02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:42.800
Just saying that, that was powerful.

02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:45.040
And that pays off somehow.

02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:48.000
So thank you for that.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:50.440
But I was sincere.

02:20:50.440 --> 02:20:51.280
It was genuine.

02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:54.160
I felt like I had been to so many interviews.

02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:55.760
When it's around the Olympic time,

02:20:55.760 --> 02:20:57.760
there's lots of beat reporters that come out

02:20:57.760 --> 02:20:59.040
and they're trying to get your time.

02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:02.280
And they're there because they have to get the story

02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:04.520
for their newspaper or their television show.

02:21:04.520 --> 02:21:07.000
And a lot of times those people show up

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.760
and they pronounce my name wrong

02:21:09.760 --> 02:21:11.760
or they get something wrong about the background

02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:16.360
or they offend me because they call me five minutes before

02:21:16.360 --> 02:21:17.600
that they're supposed to be there and say,

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:18.960
oh, sorry, we're running late.

02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:20.000
We'll be there an hour and a half.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:21.720
Well, I'm a busy guy too.

02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:25.000
And you were somebody that showed up,

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:26.720
was so prepared with your notes,

02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:31.680
knew everything about the history of what I had done.

02:21:31.680 --> 02:21:34.520
The questions you asked were intelligent questions.

02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:36.000
They were well thought out.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
And at the end of that interview,

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.960
I was really genuinely impressed

02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:43.560
and I wanted to let you know you did a great job

02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:45.200
because you stood out from the rest.

02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:46.040
Thank you.

02:21:46.040 --> 02:21:46.880
Yeah.

02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:48.600
I mean, for me, it was like showing up to like the Mecca,

02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:49.440
like the track.

02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:53.160
I mean, you don't always want to just tell that to people,

02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:57.640
but you show up, obviously you're the legend of Judo

02:21:57.640 --> 02:21:58.680
in the United States.

02:21:58.680 --> 02:22:01.600
And so that was like, Boston is the Mecca.

02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:06.600
Like this is where you travel to talk to the great.

02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:09.160
So the fact that you were kind to me

02:22:09.160 --> 02:22:11.000
just stuck with me for a long time.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:14.640
So it pays off to be kind to others,

02:22:14.640 --> 02:22:19.640
to give them a chance.

02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:23.200
Jimmy, thank you so much for giving me another chance

02:22:23.200 --> 02:22:24.600
and spending your valuable time.

02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:27.400
And you've also were kind enough to invite me

02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:30.080
to train with you today at your dojo.

02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:31.360
So I can't wait.

02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:32.200
Let's go.

02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:33.040
Let's go do some Judo.

02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:33.880
Yeah, awesome.

02:22:33.880 --> 02:22:35.400
Thank you, Lex.

02:22:35.400 --> 02:22:36.960
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:38.440
with Jimmy Pedro.

And now let me leave you with some words from Bruce Lee.

02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:50.520
I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once,

02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:55.400
but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.

02:22:56.320 --> 02:22:59.400
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
