00:00.000 --> 00:03.560
So Big Dog became LS3, which is the big load carrying one.

00:03.560 --> 00:07.960
Just a quick pause, it can carry 400 pounds.

00:07.960 --> 00:12.600
It was designed to carry 400, but we had it carrying about 1,000 pounds.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.920
Of course you did, just to make sure.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.200
We had one carrying the other one, we had two of them.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.920
So we had one carrying the other one.

00:18.920 --> 00:22.040
So one of the things that stands out about the robots

00:22.040 --> 00:25.200
Boston Dynamics have created is how beautiful the movement is,

00:25.280 --> 00:30.000
how natural the walking is and running is,

00:30.000 --> 00:32.200
even flipping is, throwing is.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.960
So maybe you can talk about what's involved

00:34.960 --> 00:37.640
in making it look natural.

00:37.640 --> 00:41.240
Well, I think having good hardware is part of the story.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.480
And people who think you don't need

00:43.480 --> 00:45.960
to innovate hardware anymore are wrong.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.320
The following is a conversation with Mark Ryberg,

00:52.400 --> 00:56.600
a legendary roboticist, founder and longtime CEO of Boston Dynamics

00:56.600 --> 01:00.440
and recently the executive director of the newly created

01:00.440 --> 01:04.840
Boston Dynamics AI Institute that focuses on research

01:04.840 --> 01:08.720
and the cutting edge, on creating future generations of robots

01:08.720 --> 01:12.440
that are far better than anything that exists today.

01:12.440 --> 01:16.240
He has been leading the creation of incredible legged robots

01:16.240 --> 01:22.200
for over 40 years at CMU, at MIT, the legendary MIT

01:22.200 --> 01:25.240
leg lab, and then, of course, Boston Dynamics

01:25.240 --> 01:29.240
with amazing robots like Big Dog, Atlas, Spot, and Handle.

01:29.240 --> 01:34.960
This was a big honor and pleasure for me.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.480
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.440
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:38.440 --> 01:39.720
in the description.

01:39.720 --> 01:43.800
And now, dear friends, here's Mark Ryberg.

01:43.800 --> 01:47.080
When did you first fall in love with robotics?

01:47.080 --> 01:50.960
Well, I was always a builder from a young age.

01:51.280 --> 01:51.840
I was lucky.

01:51.840 --> 01:56.160
My father was a frustrated engineer.

01:56.160 --> 02:01.560
And by that, I mean he wanted to be an aerospace engineer,

02:01.560 --> 02:03.800
but his mom from the old country thought

02:03.800 --> 02:05.800
that that would be like a grease monkey.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.440
And so she said no.

02:07.440 --> 02:10.400
So he became an accountant.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.200
But the result of that was our basement

02:12.200 --> 02:16.800
was always full of tools and equipment and electronics.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.120
And from a young age, I would watch

02:19.120 --> 02:22.480
him assembling an ICO kit or something like that.

02:22.480 --> 02:27.120
I still have a couple of his old ICO kits.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.560
But it was really during graduate school

02:29.560 --> 02:35.200
when I followed a professor back from class.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.920
It was Bertolt Horn at MIT.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.520
And I was taking an interim class.

02:40.520 --> 02:43.240
It's IAP, independent activities period.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.680
And I followed him back to his lab.

02:45.720 --> 02:51.400
And on the table was a VIKARM robot arm taken apart

02:51.400 --> 02:53.360
in probably 1,000 pieces.

02:53.360 --> 02:58.680
And when I saw that from that day on, I was a roboticist.

02:58.680 --> 02:59.800
Do you remember the year?

02:59.800 --> 03:01.040
1974.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.040
1974.

03:02.040 --> 03:04.720
So there's just this arm and pieces.

03:04.720 --> 03:08.400
And you saw the pieces, and you saw in your vision

03:08.400 --> 03:11.280
the arm when it's put back together

03:11.280 --> 03:12.840
and the possibilities that it holds.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.760
Somehow it spurred my imagination.

03:15.760 --> 03:19.520
I was in the brain and cognitive sciences department

03:19.520 --> 03:21.640
as a graduate student doing neurophysiology.

03:21.640 --> 03:25.240
I'd been an electrical engineer as an undergrad at Northeastern.

03:25.240 --> 03:28.960
And the neurophysiology wasn't really working for me.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.920
It wasn't conceptual enough.

03:30.920 --> 03:35.000
I couldn't see really how by looking at single neurons,

03:35.000 --> 03:36.720
you were going to get to a place where

03:36.720 --> 03:40.440
you could understand control systems or thought

03:40.440 --> 03:41.960
or anything like that.

03:41.960 --> 03:45.320
And the AI lab was always an appealing.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.640
This was before CSAIL, right?

03:46.640 --> 03:47.520
This was in the 70s.

03:47.520 --> 03:51.720
So the AI lab was always an appealing idea.

03:51.720 --> 03:56.200
And so when I went back to the AI lab following him

03:56.200 --> 03:59.200
and I saw the arm, I just thought, this is it.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.400
That's so interesting.

04:00.400 --> 04:04.000
The tension between the BCS, brain and cognitive science

04:04.000 --> 04:07.160
approach to understanding intelligence,

04:07.160 --> 04:09.720
and the robotics approach to understanding intelligence.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.920
Well, BCS is now morphed a bit, right?

04:11.920 --> 04:15.120
They have the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines,

04:15.120 --> 04:17.720
which is trying to bridge that gap.

04:17.720 --> 04:21.040
And even when I was there, David Maher was in the AI lab.

04:21.040 --> 04:24.360
David Maher had models of the brain

04:24.360 --> 04:26.600
that were appealing both to biologists

04:26.600 --> 04:28.760
but also to computer people.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.360
So he was a visitor in the AI lab at the time.

04:31.360 --> 04:34.160
And I guess he became full time there.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.080
So that was the first time a bridge was

04:36.080 --> 04:38.600
made between those two groups.

04:38.640 --> 04:39.960
Then the bridge kind of went away.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.200
And then there was another time in the 80s.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.600
And then recently, the last five or so years,

04:45.600 --> 04:48.160
there's been a stronger connection.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.360
You said you were always kind of a builder.

04:50.360 --> 04:53.720
What stands out to you in memory of a thing you've built?

04:53.720 --> 04:58.480
Maybe a trivial thing that just kind of inspired you

04:58.480 --> 05:02.640
and the possibilities that this direction of work might hold.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.160
I mean, we were just doing gadgets when we were kids.

05:05.160 --> 05:07.840
I had a friend we were taking.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.320
I don't know if everybody remembers,

05:10.320 --> 05:15.320
but fluorescent lights had this little aluminum cylinder.

05:16.160 --> 05:18.320
I can't even remember what it's called now.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.440
That you needed a starter, I think it was.

05:21.360 --> 05:24.240
And we would take those apart, fill them with match heads,

05:24.240 --> 05:27.040
put a tail on it and make it into little rockets.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.040
So it wasn't always about function.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.000
It was, well.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.040
Well, rocket was pretty much.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.720
I guess that is pretty functional.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.520
But yeah, I guess that is a question.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.360
How much was it about function

05:37.360 --> 05:39.760
versus just creating something cool?

05:39.760 --> 05:43.400
I think it's still a balance between those two.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.040
There was a time though when I was,

05:45.040 --> 05:46.920
I guess I was probably already a professor

05:46.920 --> 05:48.240
or maybe late in graduate school

05:48.240 --> 05:50.640
when I thought that function was everything

05:50.640 --> 05:55.640
and that mobility, dexterity, perception and intelligence,

05:56.080 --> 05:59.640
those are sort of the key functionalities for robotics.

05:59.640 --> 06:04.040
That that's what mattered and nothing else mattered.

06:04.040 --> 06:07.120
And I even had kind of this platonic ideal

06:08.080 --> 06:10.400
that a robot, if you just looked at a robot

06:10.400 --> 06:11.560
and it wasn't doing anything,

06:11.560 --> 06:12.960
it would look like a pile of junk,

06:12.960 --> 06:16.320
which a lot of my robots looked like in those days.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.400
But then when it started moving,

06:18.400 --> 06:21.280
you'd get the idea that it had some kind of life

06:21.280 --> 06:24.680
or some kind of interest in its movement.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.520
And I think we purposely even designed the machines,

06:27.520 --> 06:31.040
not worrying about the aesthetics of the structure itself.

06:31.800 --> 06:35.760
But then it turns out that the aesthetics

06:35.760 --> 06:38.640
of the thing itself add and combine

06:38.640 --> 06:42.400
with the lifelike things that the robots can do.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.640
But the heart of it is making them do things

06:45.640 --> 06:47.400
that are interesting.

06:47.400 --> 06:51.160
So one of the things that underlies a lot of your work

06:51.160 --> 06:53.800
is that the robots you create,

06:53.800 --> 06:57.600
the systems you have created for over 40 years now

06:57.600 --> 07:00.200
have a kind of, they're not cautious.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.000
So a lot of robots that people know about

07:03.000 --> 07:05.880
move about this world very cautiously, carefully,

07:05.880 --> 07:08.040
very afraid of the world.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.560
A lot of the robots you built,

07:09.560 --> 07:10.720
especially in the early days,

07:10.720 --> 07:13.560
were very aggressive, under-extuated.

07:13.560 --> 07:18.040
They're hopping, they're wild, moving quickly.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.800
So what, is there a philosophy underlying that?

07:20.800 --> 07:22.000
Well, let me tell you about

07:22.000 --> 07:24.200
how I got started on legs at all.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.600
When I was still a graduate student,

07:26.600 --> 07:28.680
I went to a conference.

07:28.680 --> 07:31.720
It was a biological-legged locomotion conference,

07:31.720 --> 07:33.560
and I think it was in Philadelphia.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.560
So it was all biomechanics people,

07:35.560 --> 07:37.440
researchers who would look at muscle

07:37.440 --> 07:40.200
and maybe neurons and things like that.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.480
They weren't so much computational people,

07:42.480 --> 07:44.160
but they were more biomechanics.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.800
And maybe there were a thousand people there.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.960
And I went to a talk, one of the talks,

07:48.960 --> 07:52.440
all the talks were about the body of either animals

07:52.440 --> 07:54.560
or people and respiration, things like that.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.880
But one talk was by a robotics guy,

07:56.880 --> 08:00.520
and he showed a six-legged robot

08:00.520 --> 08:03.520
that walked very slowly.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.920
It always had at least three feet on the ground,

08:06.920 --> 08:10.200
so it worked like a table or a chair with tripod stability.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.960
And it moved really slowly.

08:11.960 --> 08:14.000
And I just looked at that and said,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.280
wow, that's wrong.

08:16.280 --> 08:19.760
That's not anything like how people and animals work

08:19.760 --> 08:22.480
because we bounce and fly.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.320
We have to predict what's gonna happen

08:24.320 --> 08:25.560
in order to keep our balance

08:25.680 --> 08:28.760
when we're taking a running step or something like that.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.880
We use the springiness in our legs,

08:31.880 --> 08:34.320
our muscles and our tendons and things like that

08:34.320 --> 08:37.120
as part of the story, the energy circulates.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.680
We don't just throw it away every time.

08:39.680 --> 08:42.560
So I'm not sure I understood all that when I first thought,

08:42.560 --> 08:45.400
but I definitely got inspired to say,

08:46.400 --> 08:48.200
let's try the opposite.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.240
And I didn't have a clue as to how to make

08:50.240 --> 08:54.400
a hopping robot work, not balance in 3D.

08:55.760 --> 08:56.840
In fact, when I started,

08:56.840 --> 08:58.840
it was all just about the energy of bouncing.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.680
And I was gonna have a springy thing in the leg

09:01.680 --> 09:04.200
and some actuator so that you could get

09:04.200 --> 09:08.000
an energy regime going of bouncing.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.080
And the idea that balance was an important part of it

09:10.080 --> 09:12.280
didn't come until a little later.

09:12.280 --> 09:17.160
And then I made the one like the Pogo stick robots.

09:17.160 --> 09:20.200
Now I think that we need to do that in manipulation.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.840
If you look at robot manipulation,

09:22.840 --> 09:25.160
we, a community, has been working on it

09:25.160 --> 09:28.760
for 50 years, we're nowhere near human levels

09:28.760 --> 09:30.360
of manipulation.

09:30.360 --> 09:35.120
I mean, it's come along, but I think it's all too safe.

09:35.120 --> 09:39.160
And I think trying to break out of that safety thing

09:39.160 --> 09:42.880
of static grasping, if you look at a lot of work

09:42.880 --> 09:45.400
that goes on, it's about the geometry of the part.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.200
And then you figure out how to move your hand

09:48.200 --> 09:50.360
so that you can position it with respect to that.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.200
And then you grasp it carefully and then you move it.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.420
Well, that's not anything like how people and animals work.

09:56.420 --> 09:59.560
We juggle in our hands, we have multiple objects

09:59.560 --> 10:01.120
and can sort them.

10:02.520 --> 10:07.000
So now to be fair, being more aggressive

10:07.000 --> 10:09.320
is gonna mean things aren't gonna work very well for a while.

10:09.320 --> 10:13.320
So it's a longer term approach to the problem.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.040
But that, and that's just theory now,

10:16.040 --> 10:18.040
maybe that won't pay off, but that's sort of

10:18.040 --> 10:19.200
how I'm trying to think about it,

10:19.200 --> 10:22.960
trying to encourage our group to go at it.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.880
Well, yeah, I mean, we'll talk about what it means to,

10:25.880 --> 10:29.320
what is the actual thing we're trying to optimize

10:29.320 --> 10:30.600
for a robot.

10:30.600 --> 10:33.040
Sometimes, especially with human-robot interaction,

10:33.040 --> 10:36.280
maybe flaws is a good thing.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.640
Perfection is not necessarily the right thing to be chasing.

10:38.640 --> 10:42.360
Just like you said, maybe being good at fumbling an object,

10:43.240 --> 10:46.120
being good at fumbling might be the right thing to optimize

10:46.120 --> 10:50.080
versus perfect modeling of the object

10:50.080 --> 10:54.200
and perfect movement of the arm to grasp that object,

10:54.200 --> 10:56.440
because maybe perfection is not supposed to exist

10:56.440 --> 10:57.280
in the real world.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.240
I don't know if you know my friend, Matt Mason,

10:59.240 --> 11:02.800
who is the director of the Robotics Institute

11:02.800 --> 11:03.640
at Carnegie Mellon,

11:03.640 --> 11:06.000
and we go back to graduate school together.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.240
But he analyzed a movie of Julia Childs

11:10.240 --> 11:12.240
doing a cooking thing.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.660
And she did, I think he said something like,

11:14.660 --> 11:17.840
there were 40 different ways that she handled a thing,

11:17.840 --> 11:20.240
and none of them was grasping.

11:20.240 --> 11:24.480
She would nudge, roll, flatten with her knife,

11:24.480 --> 11:28.200
things like that, and none of them was grasping.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.320
So, okay, let's go back to the early days.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.880
First of all, you've created and led the leg lab,

11:33.880 --> 11:36.000
the legendary leg lab at MIT.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.440
So what was that first hopping robot?

11:38.440 --> 11:40.600
But first of all, the leg lab actually started

11:40.600 --> 11:42.000
at Carnegie Mellon. Carnegie Mellon.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.720
So I was a professor there starting in 1980,

11:46.680 --> 11:48.720
to about 1986.

11:48.720 --> 11:52.440
And so that's where the first hopping machines were built,

11:52.440 --> 11:55.000
starting, I guess we got the first one working

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
in about 1982, something like that.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.920
That was a simplified one.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.440
Then we got a three-dimensional one in 1983.

12:03.440 --> 12:06.640
The quadruped that we built at the leg lab,

12:06.640 --> 12:10.880
the first version, was built in about 1984 or five,

12:10.880 --> 12:15.360
and really only got going about 86 or so.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.400
It took years of development to get it to.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.440
Let's just pause here.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.680
For people who don't know, I'm talking to Mark Graeber,

12:20.680 --> 12:22.440
founder of Boston Dynamics.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.400
But before that, you were a professor

12:25.400 --> 12:28.640
developing some of the most incredible robots for 15 years,

12:28.640 --> 12:30.840
and before that, of course, a grad student and all that.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.400
So you've been doing this for a really long time.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.120
So you skipped over this,

12:34.120 --> 12:36.280
but go to the first hopping robot.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.080
There's videos of some of this.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.640
I mean, these are incredible robots.

12:39.640 --> 12:43.560
So you talked about the very first step

12:43.600 --> 12:47.200
was to get a thing hopping up and down.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.040
And then you realized, well, balancing is a thing

12:50.040 --> 12:53.840
you should care about, and it's actually a solvable problem.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.240
Can you just go through how to create that robot?

12:56.240 --> 13:00.080
What was involved in creating that robot?

13:00.080 --> 13:03.520
Well, I'm going to start on the, not the technical side,

13:03.520 --> 13:07.200
but the, I guess we could call it the motivational side

13:07.200 --> 13:08.720
or the funding side.

13:08.720 --> 13:12.000
So before Carnegie Mellon, I was actually at JPL,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.240
at the Jet Propulsion Lab for three years.

13:14.240 --> 13:18.600
And while I was there, I connected up with Ivan Sutherland,

13:18.600 --> 13:23.200
who is sometimes regarded as the father of computer graphics

13:23.200 --> 13:25.120
because of work he did both at MIT

13:25.120 --> 13:28.240
and then University of Utah and Evans and Sutherland.

13:28.240 --> 13:32.200
Anyway, I got to know him.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.760
And at one point he said,

13:33.760 --> 13:38.760
he encouraged me to do some kind of project at Caltech.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.360
Even though I was at JPL,

13:40.360 --> 13:43.960
those are kind of related institutions.

13:43.960 --> 13:47.520
And so I thought about it

13:48.480 --> 13:51.880
and I made up a list of three possible projects.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.880
And I purposely made the top one

13:53.880 --> 13:56.040
and the bottom one really boring sounding.

13:56.040 --> 14:00.320
And in the middle, I put a pogo stick robot.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.120
And when he looked at it,

14:02.120 --> 14:07.120
Ivan is a brilliant guy, brilliant engineer

14:07.160 --> 14:09.320
and real cultivator of people.

14:09.320 --> 14:11.160
He looked at it and knew right away

14:11.160 --> 14:12.800
what the thing that was worth doing.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.000
And so he had an endowed chair.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.240
So he had about $3,000 that he gave me

14:17.240 --> 14:19.080
to build the first model,

14:19.080 --> 14:22.280
which I went to the shop and with my own hands

14:22.280 --> 14:26.520
kind of made a first model, which didn't work

14:26.520 --> 14:31.400
and was just a beginning shot at it.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.960
And Ivan and I took that to Washington.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.360
And in those days, you could just walk into DARPA

14:37.400 --> 14:40.440
and walk down the hallway and see who's there.

14:40.440 --> 14:43.680
Ivan who had been there in his previous life.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.720
And so we walked around and we looked in the offices.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.080
Of course, I didn't know anything.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.880
I was basically a kid, but Ivan moved his way around

14:50.880 --> 14:54.360
and we found Craig Fields in his office.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.120
Craig later became the director of DARPA,

14:56.120 --> 14:58.360
but in those days, he was a program manager.

14:58.360 --> 15:01.120
And so we went in, I had a little Samsonite suitcase,

15:01.120 --> 15:03.960
we opened and it had just the skeleton

15:04.000 --> 15:07.400
of this one-legged hopping robot and we showed it to him.

15:07.400 --> 15:11.640
And you could almost see the drool going down his chin

15:11.640 --> 15:12.560
of excitement.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.600
And he sent me $250,000.

15:14.600 --> 15:19.520
He said, okay, I wanna fund this.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.200
And I was between institutions.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.760
I was just about to leave JPL

15:22.760 --> 15:25.960
and I hadn't decided yet where I was going next.

15:25.960 --> 15:30.400
And then when I landed at CMU, he sent $250,000,

15:30.400 --> 15:34.040
which in 1980 was a lot of research money.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.440
Did you see the possibility of where this is going?

15:36.440 --> 15:38.880
Why this is an important problem?

15:38.880 --> 15:39.720
No.

15:39.720 --> 15:43.720
The balance, I mean, it has to do with legged locomotion.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.480
I mean, it has to do with all these problems

15:45.480 --> 15:49.800
that the human body solves when we're walking, for example.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.440
Like all the fundamentals are there.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.120
Yeah, I mean, I think that was the motivation

15:54.120 --> 15:57.040
to try and get more at the fundamentals of how animals work.

15:57.040 --> 16:00.160
But the idea that it would result in machines

16:00.880 --> 16:03.680
that were anything like practical, like we're making now,

16:03.680 --> 16:06.040
that wasn't anywhere in my head now.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.640
You know, as an academic,

16:07.640 --> 16:11.240
I was mostly just trying to do the next thing,

16:11.240 --> 16:14.600
make some progress, impress my colleagues if I could.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.440
And have fun.

16:15.440 --> 16:16.280
And have fun.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.400
Pogo stick robot.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.240
Pogo stick robot.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.720
So what was on the technical side?

16:19.720 --> 16:22.720
What are some of the challenges of getting up,

16:22.720 --> 16:25.880
getting to the point where we saw, like in the video,

16:25.880 --> 16:28.640
the Pogo stick robot that's actually successfully hopping

16:28.640 --> 16:31.560
and then eventually doing flips and all this kind of stuff?

16:31.560 --> 16:32.920
Well, in the very early days,

16:32.920 --> 16:37.240
I needed some better engineering than I could do myself.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.440
And I hired Ben Brown.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.960
We each had our way of contributing to the design

16:42.960 --> 16:46.520
and we came up with a thing that could start to work.

16:46.520 --> 16:47.800
I had some stupid ideas

16:47.800 --> 16:50.600
about how the actuation system should work.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.840
And we sorted that out.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.680
It wasn't that hard to make it balanced

16:54.680 --> 16:58.880
once you get the physical machine to be working well enough

16:58.880 --> 17:01.360
and have enough control over the degrees of freedom.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.160
And then we very quickly, you know,

17:04.160 --> 17:08.120
we started out by having it floating on an inclined air table.

17:08.120 --> 17:11.240
And then that only gave us like six foot of travel.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.000
So once it started working,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.960
we switched to a thing that could run around the room

17:15.960 --> 17:17.840
on another device.

17:17.840 --> 17:19.520
It's hard to explain these without you seeing them,

17:19.520 --> 17:22.480
but you probably know what I'm talking about, a planarizer.

17:22.480 --> 17:26.240
And then the next big step was to make it work in 3D,

17:26.240 --> 17:28.160
which that was really the scary part.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.520
With these simple things,

17:29.520 --> 17:32.680
you know, people had inverted pendulums at the time for years

17:32.680 --> 17:35.680
and they could control them by driving a cart back and forth.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.160
But could you make it work in three dimensions

17:38.160 --> 17:40.520
while it's bouncing and all that?

17:40.520 --> 17:43.760
But it turned out, you know, not to be that hard to do,

17:43.760 --> 17:46.560
at least at the level of performance we achieved at the time.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.200
So, okay, you mentioned inverted pendulum,

17:48.200 --> 17:53.200
but like, can you explain how a hopping stick in 3D

17:54.720 --> 17:57.920
can control, can balance itself?

17:57.920 --> 17:58.760
Yeah, sure.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.280
What does the actuation look like?

18:01.240 --> 18:02.400
You know, the simple story is

18:02.400 --> 18:04.440
that there's three things going on.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.480
There's something making it bounce.

18:06.480 --> 18:11.240
And, you know, we had a system that was estimating

18:11.240 --> 18:14.400
how high the robot was off the ground and using that,

18:14.400 --> 18:18.560
you know, there's energy that can be in three places

18:18.560 --> 18:19.760
in a pogo stick.

18:19.760 --> 18:22.840
One is in the spring, one is in the altitude,

18:22.840 --> 18:25.000
and the other is in the velocity.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.280
And so when at the top of the hop, it's all in the height.

18:29.280 --> 18:31.880
And so you could just measure how high you're going

18:31.880 --> 18:35.600
and thereby have an idea of a lot about the cycle

18:35.600 --> 18:38.840
and you could decide whether to put more energy in or less.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.360
So that was one element.

18:40.360 --> 18:43.640
Then there's a part that you decide where to put the foot.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.720
And if you think when you're landing on the ground

18:45.720 --> 18:47.400
with respect to the center of mass,

18:47.400 --> 18:49.440
so if you think of a pole vaulter,

18:49.440 --> 18:53.680
the key thing the pole vaulter has to do is get its body

18:53.680 --> 18:56.240
to the right place when the pole gets stuck.

18:56.240 --> 18:58.720
If they're too far forward,

18:58.720 --> 19:00.880
they kind of get thrown backwards.

19:00.880 --> 19:03.560
If they're too far back, they go, you know, over.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.760
And what they need to do is get it so that they go mostly up

19:06.760 --> 19:07.720
to get over the thing.

19:07.720 --> 19:10.880
And, you know, high jumpers is the same kind of thing.

19:10.880 --> 19:14.040
So there's a calculation about where to put the foot.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.480
And we did something, you know, relatively simple.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.840
And then there's a third part to keep the body

19:18.840 --> 19:20.320
at an attitude that's upright.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.040
Because if it gets too far, you know,

19:22.040 --> 19:24.800
you could hop and just keep rotating around,

19:24.800 --> 19:26.360
but if it gets too far,

19:26.360 --> 19:29.880
then you run out of motion of the joints at the hips.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.560
So you have to do that.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.000
And we did that by applying a torque

19:34.000 --> 19:35.360
between the legs and the body

19:35.360 --> 19:36.640
every time the foot's on the ground.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.720
You only can do it while the foot's on the ground.

19:38.760 --> 19:42.880
In the air, you know, the physics don't work out.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.360
How far does it have to tilt before it's too late

19:45.360 --> 19:47.200
to be able to balance itself?

19:47.200 --> 19:50.080
Or is it impossible to balance itself, correct itself?

19:50.080 --> 19:52.240
Well, you're asking an interesting question

19:52.240 --> 19:57.240
because in those days, we didn't actually optimize things.

19:58.680 --> 20:01.040
And they probably could have gone much further than we did

20:01.040 --> 20:02.760
and then had higher performance.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.440
And we just kind of got, you know,

20:04.440 --> 20:06.960
a sketch of a solution and worked on that.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.320
And then in years since, some people working for us,

20:09.320 --> 20:10.840
some people working for others,

20:10.840 --> 20:14.640
people came up with all kinds of equations for,

20:14.640 --> 20:17.960
or, you know, algorithms for how to do a better job,

20:17.960 --> 20:19.840
be able to go faster.

20:19.840 --> 20:22.200
One of my students worked on getting things to go faster.

20:22.200 --> 20:26.160
Another one worked on climbing over obstacles.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.440
Cause when you're running, it's one,

20:28.440 --> 20:29.960
on the open ground, it's one thing.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.680
If you're running like up a stair,

20:32.680 --> 20:34.640
you have to adjust where you are,

20:34.640 --> 20:36.080
otherwise things don't work out right.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.800
You land your foot on the edge of the step.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.320
So there's other degrees of freedom to control

20:40.320 --> 20:41.920
if you're getting to, you know,

20:41.920 --> 20:44.120
more realistic, practical situations.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.160
I think it's really interesting to ask about the early days

20:46.160 --> 20:49.120
because, you know, believing in yourself,

20:49.120 --> 20:51.120
believing that there's something interesting here.

20:51.120 --> 20:54.000
And then you mentioned finding somebody else, Ben Brown.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.600
What's that like finding other people

20:55.600 --> 20:59.000
with whom you can build this crazy idea

20:59.000 --> 21:00.400
and actually make it work?

21:00.400 --> 21:02.600
Probably the smartest thing I ever did

21:02.600 --> 21:04.160
is to find the other people.

21:04.160 --> 21:05.520
I mean, when I look at it now, you know,

21:05.520 --> 21:06.760
I look at Boston Dynamics

21:06.760 --> 21:10.000
and all the really excellent engineering there,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.480
you know, people who really make stuff work.

21:12.480 --> 21:16.320
You know, I'm only the dreamer.

21:16.320 --> 21:20.920
So when you talk about pogo stick robot or legged robots,

21:20.920 --> 21:24.240
whether it's quadrupeds or humanoid robots,

21:24.240 --> 21:26.800
did people doubt that this is possible?

21:26.800 --> 21:29.240
Did you experience a lot of people around you kind of-

21:29.240 --> 21:31.480
I don't know if they doubted whether it was possible,

21:31.480 --> 21:34.560
but I think they thought it was a waste of time.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.600
Oh, it's not even an interesting problem.

21:36.600 --> 21:39.720
I think for a lot of people, you know, people who were,

21:39.720 --> 21:41.680
I think it's been both though.

21:41.680 --> 21:45.200
Some people, I think, I felt like they were saying,

21:45.200 --> 21:47.440
oh, you know, why are you wasting your time

21:47.440 --> 21:49.280
on this stupid problem?

21:49.280 --> 21:51.240
And then, but then I've been at many things

21:51.240 --> 21:53.960
where people have told me it's been an inspiration

21:53.960 --> 21:58.960
to go out and, you know, attack these harder things.

21:59.880 --> 22:03.160
And I think it has turned out,

22:03.160 --> 22:04.960
I think legged locomotion has turned out

22:04.960 --> 22:06.400
to be a useful thing.

22:06.400 --> 22:10.080
Did you ever have like doubt about bringing Atlas to life,

22:10.080 --> 22:14.080
for example, or with Big Dog, just every step of the way,

22:14.080 --> 22:18.000
did you have doubt like, this is too hard of a problem?

22:19.040 --> 22:21.760
I mean, at first I wasn't an enthusiast for the humanoids

22:21.760 --> 22:24.360
because again, it goes back to saying,

22:24.360 --> 22:26.000
what's the functionality?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.920
And the form wasn't as important as the functionality.

22:29.760 --> 22:34.760
And also, you know, there's an aspect to humanoid robots

22:35.160 --> 22:38.080
that's about, all about the cosmetics

22:38.080 --> 22:40.040
where there isn't really other functionality.

22:40.040 --> 22:43.880
And that kind of is off-putting for me as a roboticist.

22:43.880 --> 22:46.040
I think the functionality really matters.

22:46.040 --> 22:49.640
So probably that's why I avoided human robots,

22:49.640 --> 22:51.800
humanoid robots to start with.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.680
But I'll tell you, now, you know,

22:54.680 --> 22:55.880
after we started working on them,

22:55.880 --> 22:58.400
you could see that the connection and the impact

22:59.280 --> 23:02.400
with other people, whether they're lay people

23:02.400 --> 23:04.640
or even other technical people,

23:04.640 --> 23:08.240
there's a special thing that goes on.

23:08.240 --> 23:09.880
Even though most of the humanoid robots

23:09.880 --> 23:11.520
aren't that much like a person.

23:11.520 --> 23:15.640
But we anthropomorphize and we see the humanity.

23:15.640 --> 23:20.080
But also like with Spot, you can see, not the humanity,

23:20.080 --> 23:24.080
but whatever we find compelling about social interactions,

23:24.080 --> 23:25.240
they're in Spot as well.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.960
I'll tell you, you know, I go around giving talks

23:26.960 --> 23:29.520
and take Spot to a lot of them.

23:29.520 --> 23:30.760
And it's amazing.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.840
The media likes to say that they're terrifying

23:32.840 --> 23:34.400
and that people are afraid.

23:34.400 --> 23:39.000
And YouTube commenters like to say that it's frightening.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.400
But when you take a Spot out there,

23:41.400 --> 23:42.720
now maybe it's self-selecting,

23:42.720 --> 23:45.440
but you get a crowd of people who wanna take pictures,

23:45.440 --> 23:48.680
wanna pose for selfies, wanna operate the robot,

23:48.680 --> 23:52.680
wanna pet it, wanna put clothes on it, it's amazing.

23:52.680 --> 23:53.920
Yeah, I love Spot.

23:53.920 --> 23:56.760
So if we move around history a little bit,

23:57.600 --> 24:00.680
so you said, I think in the early days of Boston Dynamics,

24:00.680 --> 24:04.720
that you quietly worked on making a running version of Aibo,

24:04.720 --> 24:06.600
Sony's robot dog.

24:06.600 --> 24:10.040
It's just an interesting little tidbit of history for me.

24:12.480 --> 24:15.160
What stands out to you in memory from that task?

24:15.160 --> 24:17.600
For people who don't know that little dog robot

24:17.600 --> 24:20.880
moves slowly, how did that become big dog?

24:20.880 --> 24:22.240
What was involved there?

24:22.240 --> 24:24.080
What was the dance between how do we make

24:24.080 --> 24:25.840
this cute little dog versus a thing

24:25.840 --> 24:27.440
that can actually carry a lot of payload

24:27.440 --> 24:29.200
and move fast and stuff like that?

24:29.200 --> 24:31.840
What the connection was is that at that point,

24:31.840 --> 24:33.320
Boston Dynamics was mostly

24:33.320 --> 24:35.520
a physics-based simulation company.

24:35.520 --> 24:39.360
So when I left MIT to start Boston Dynamics,

24:39.360 --> 24:40.520
there was a few years of overlap,

24:40.520 --> 24:42.640
but the concept wasn't to start a robot company.

24:42.640 --> 24:47.000
The concept was to use this dynamic simulation tool

24:47.000 --> 24:50.380
that we developed to do robotics for other things.

24:51.280 --> 24:54.680
But working with Sony, we got back into robotics

24:54.680 --> 24:57.600
by doing the Aibo runner, by, we programmed,

24:57.600 --> 25:00.360
we made some tools for programming Curio,

25:00.360 --> 25:03.400
which was a small humanoid this big

25:03.400 --> 25:06.600
that could do some dancing and other kinds of fun stuff.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.540
And I don't think it ever reached the market,

25:08.540 --> 25:10.440
even though they did show it.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.040
When I look back, I say that we got us back

25:14.040 --> 25:14.920
where we belonged.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.760
Yeah, you rediscovered the soul of the company.

25:17.760 --> 25:18.960
That's right.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.200
And so from there, it was always about robots.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.040
Yeah.

25:23.040 --> 25:28.040
So you started Boston Dynamics in 1992, right?

25:28.080 --> 25:30.900
What are some fond memories from the early days?

25:31.920 --> 25:36.560
One of the robots that we built wasn't actually a robot.

25:36.560 --> 25:40.360
It was a surgical simulator, but it had force feedback.

25:40.360 --> 25:43.480
So it had all the techniques of robotics.

25:43.480 --> 25:47.800
And you looked down into this mirror, it actually was,

25:47.800 --> 25:49.600
and it looked like you were looking down

25:49.600 --> 25:51.360
onto the body you were working on.

25:51.360 --> 25:52.760
Your hands were underneath the mirror,

25:52.760 --> 25:55.120
so they were where you were looking.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.560
And you had tools in your hands that were connected

25:57.560 --> 25:59.680
up to these force feedback devices

25:59.680 --> 26:03.800
made by another MIT spin-out, Sensible Technologies.

26:03.800 --> 26:05.400
So they made the force feedback device.

26:05.400 --> 26:08.440
We attached the tools and we wrote all the software

26:08.440 --> 26:09.480
and did all the graphics.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.740
So we had 3D computer graphics.

26:11.740 --> 26:14.500
It was in the old days when, this was in the late 90s,

26:14.500 --> 26:17.480
when you had a silicon graphics computer

26:17.480 --> 26:18.760
that was about this big.

26:19.760 --> 26:22.920
It was the heater in the office, basically.

26:22.920 --> 26:26.760
And we were doing surgical operations,

26:26.760 --> 26:30.600
anastomosis, which was stitching tubes together,

26:30.600 --> 26:33.680
tubes like blood vessels or other things in their body.

26:33.680 --> 26:37.200
And you could feel, and you could see the tissues move,

26:37.200 --> 26:38.720
and it was really exciting.

26:38.720 --> 26:41.960
And the idea was to make a trainer to teach surgeons

26:41.960 --> 26:42.860
how to do stuff.

26:42.860 --> 26:46.400
We built a scoring system because we interviewed surgeons

26:46.400 --> 26:49.280
that told us what you're supposed to do

26:49.280 --> 26:50.360
and what you're not supposed to do.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.520
You're not supposed to tear the tissue.

26:52.520 --> 26:54.360
You're not supposed to touch it in any place

26:54.360 --> 26:56.120
except for where you're trying to engage.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.680
There were a bunch of rules.

26:57.680 --> 27:00.200
So we built this thing and took it to a trade show,

27:00.200 --> 27:02.480
a surgical trade show.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.960
And the surgeons were practically lined up.

27:04.960 --> 27:07.560
Well, we kept a score and we posted their scores

27:07.560 --> 27:08.800
like on a video game.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.800
And those guys are so competitive

27:10.800 --> 27:13.640
that they really, really loved doing it.

27:13.640 --> 27:14.480
And they would come around

27:14.480 --> 27:16.020
and they'd see someone's score was higher there,

27:16.020 --> 27:18.020
so they would come back.

27:18.020 --> 27:20.460
But we figured out shortly after

27:20.460 --> 27:22.900
that we thought surgeons were gonna pay us

27:22.900 --> 27:24.840
to get trained on these things.

27:24.840 --> 27:27.820
And the surgeons thought we should pay them

27:27.820 --> 27:31.620
in order to, so they could teach us about the thing.

27:31.620 --> 27:34.140
And there was no money from the surgeons.

27:34.140 --> 27:35.300
And we looked at it and thought,

27:35.300 --> 27:37.260
well, maybe we could sell it to hospitals

27:37.260 --> 27:39.260
that would teach, train their surgeons.

27:39.260 --> 27:40.900
And then we said, well, we're this,

27:40.900 --> 27:42.960
at the time we were probably a 12 person company

27:42.960 --> 27:44.860
or maybe 15 people, I don't remember.

27:45.700 --> 27:49.420
There's no way we could go after a marketing activity.

27:49.420 --> 27:51.900
The company was all bootstrapped in those years.

27:51.900 --> 27:54.540
We never had investors until Google bought us,

27:54.540 --> 27:56.460
which was after 20 years.

27:56.460 --> 28:00.420
So we didn't have any resources to go after hospitals.

28:00.420 --> 28:05.220
So at one day, Rob and I were looking at that

28:05.220 --> 28:07.780
and we said, we'd built another simulator

28:07.780 --> 28:09.980
for knee arthroscopy.

28:09.980 --> 28:11.740
And we said, this isn't gonna work.

28:11.740 --> 28:14.700
And we killed it and we moved on.

28:15.540 --> 28:17.100
And that was really a milestone in the company

28:17.100 --> 28:20.260
because we sort of understood who we were

28:20.260 --> 28:22.260
and what would work and what wouldn't,

28:22.260 --> 28:24.940
even though technically it was really a fascinating thing.

28:24.940 --> 28:26.500
What was that meeting like?

28:26.500 --> 28:30.020
Where you're just like sitting at a table, you know what?

28:30.020 --> 28:30.860
Probably.

28:30.860 --> 28:32.520
We're going to pivot completely.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.900
We're going to let go of this thing

28:34.900 --> 28:36.540
we put so much hard work into

28:37.380 --> 28:39.020
and then go back to the thing.

28:39.020 --> 28:42.060
It just always felt right once we did it.

28:42.060 --> 28:45.340
Just look at each other and said, let's build robots.

28:45.340 --> 28:47.900
What was the first robot you built

28:47.900 --> 28:51.340
under the flag of Boston Dynamics, big dog?

28:51.340 --> 28:54.660
Well, there was the IBO runner,

28:54.660 --> 28:55.900
but it wasn't even a whole robot.

28:55.900 --> 28:59.100
It was just legs that we took off the legs on IBOs

28:59.100 --> 29:01.660
and attached the legs we'd made.

29:01.660 --> 29:05.640
And we got that working and showed it to the Sony people.

29:06.580 --> 29:09.060
We worked pretty closely with Sony in those years.

29:09.060 --> 29:11.500
One of the interesting things is that

29:11.540 --> 29:15.780
it was before the internet and Zoom and anything like that.

29:15.780 --> 29:19.420
So we had six ISDN lines installed

29:19.420 --> 29:21.700
and we would have a telecon every week

29:21.700 --> 29:25.240
that worked at very low frame rate, something like 10 Hertz.

29:27.180 --> 29:31.740
English across the boundary with Japan was a challenge,

29:31.740 --> 29:34.520
trying to understand what each of us was saying

29:34.520 --> 29:39.260
and have meetings every week for several years doing that.

29:39.260 --> 29:42.020
And it was a pleasure working with them.

29:42.020 --> 29:43.660
They were really supporters.

29:43.660 --> 29:46.700
They seemed to like us and what we were doing.

29:46.700 --> 29:47.860
That was the real transition

29:47.860 --> 29:49.780
from us being a simulation company

29:49.780 --> 29:51.860
into being a robotics company again.

29:51.860 --> 29:55.060
It was a quadruped, the legs were four legs or two legs?

29:55.060 --> 29:56.340
Yeah, no, four legs, yeah.

29:56.340 --> 29:58.600
And what did you learn from that experience

29:58.600 --> 30:02.880
of building basically a fast moving quadruped?

30:03.800 --> 30:06.100
Mostly we learned that something that small

30:06.940 --> 30:09.340
doesn't look very exciting when it's running.

30:09.340 --> 30:10.580
It's like it's scampering.

30:10.580 --> 30:12.740
And you had to watch a slow-mo

30:12.740 --> 30:14.780
for it to look like it was interesting.

30:14.780 --> 30:17.660
If you watch it fast, it was just like a-

30:17.660 --> 30:18.500
That's funny.

30:18.500 --> 30:21.020
One of my things was to show stuff in video

30:21.020 --> 30:23.580
from the very early days of the hopping machines.

30:25.060 --> 30:26.340
And so I was always focused on

30:26.340 --> 30:28.020
how's this gonna look through the viewfinder?

30:28.020 --> 30:31.520
And running IBO didn't look so cool through the viewfinder.

30:32.480 --> 30:36.400
So what came next in terms of,

30:36.400 --> 30:38.000
what was a big next milestone

30:38.000 --> 30:40.120
in terms of a robot you built?

30:40.120 --> 30:42.760
I mean, you got to say that Big Dog was,

30:42.760 --> 30:44.720
sort of put us on the map

30:44.720 --> 30:47.140
and got our heads really pulled together.

30:47.140 --> 30:48.840
We scaled up the company.

30:48.840 --> 30:53.480
Big Dog was the result of Alan Rudolph at DARPA

30:53.480 --> 30:57.200
starting a biodynamics program.

30:57.200 --> 31:00.380
And he put out a request for proposals

31:00.380 --> 31:05.080
and I think there were 42 proposals written

31:05.080 --> 31:06.700
and three got funded.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.100
One was Big Dog.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.260
One was a climbing robot rise.

31:10.260 --> 31:11.940
And that put things in motion.

31:11.940 --> 31:14.360
We hired Martin Buehler.

31:14.360 --> 31:17.940
He was a professor in Montreal at McGill.

31:17.940 --> 31:21.540
He was incredibly important for getting Big Dog

31:21.540 --> 31:23.600
out of the lab and into the mud,

31:23.600 --> 31:27.460
which is a key step to really be willing to go out there

31:27.460 --> 31:30.060
and build it, break it, fix it,

31:30.740 --> 31:32.300
which is sort of one of our mottos at the company.

31:32.300 --> 31:34.420
So testing in the real world.

31:34.420 --> 31:35.980
For people who don't know, Big Dog,

31:35.980 --> 31:36.900
maybe you can correct me,

31:36.900 --> 31:41.460
but it's a big quadruped, four-legged robot.

31:41.460 --> 31:44.500
It looks big, could probably carry a lot of weight.

31:44.500 --> 31:47.500
Not the most weight that Boston Dynamics have built,

31:47.500 --> 31:48.720
but a lot.

31:48.720 --> 31:50.160
Well, it was the first thing that worked.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.940
So let's see, if we go back to the leg lab,

31:51.940 --> 31:53.580
we'd built a quadruped

31:53.580 --> 31:55.660
that could do many of the things that Big Dog did,

31:55.660 --> 31:59.420
but it had a hydraulic pump sitting in the room

31:59.420 --> 32:01.220
with hoses connected to the robot.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.900
It had a VAX computer in the next room.

32:03.900 --> 32:04.980
It needed its own room

32:04.980 --> 32:07.420
because it was this giant thing with air conditioning,

32:07.420 --> 32:12.120
and it had this very complicated bus connected to the robot.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.460
And the robot itself just had the actuators.

32:14.460 --> 32:18.860
It had gyroscopes for sensing and some other sensors,

32:18.860 --> 32:22.220
but all the power and computing was off board.

32:22.220 --> 32:26.580
Big Dog had all that stuff integrated on the platform.

32:26.580 --> 32:28.360
It had a gasoline engine for power,

32:28.360 --> 32:31.920
which was a very complicated thing to undertake.

32:31.920 --> 32:34.760
It had to convert the rotation of the engine

32:34.760 --> 32:38.960
into hydraulic power, which is how we actuated it.

32:38.960 --> 32:42.240
So there was a lot of learning just on the,

32:42.240 --> 32:43.960
building the physical robot

32:43.960 --> 32:46.400
and the system integration for that.

32:46.400 --> 32:49.120
And then there was the controls of it.

32:49.120 --> 32:51.020
So for Big Dog, you brought it all together

32:51.020 --> 32:53.080
onto one platform.

32:53.080 --> 32:54.640
And then, so you could-

32:54.640 --> 32:55.720
You could take it out in the woods.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.080
Yeah, and you did.

32:57.080 --> 32:57.920
We did.

32:58.480 --> 33:01.280
We spent a lot of time down at the Marine Corps base

33:01.280 --> 33:03.440
in Quantico where there was a trail

33:03.440 --> 33:05.720
called the Guadalcanal Trail.

33:05.720 --> 33:09.720
And our milestone that DARPA had specified

33:09.720 --> 33:12.680
was that we could go on this one particular trail

33:12.680 --> 33:15.400
that involved a lot of challenge.

33:15.400 --> 33:16.560
And we spent a lot of time,

33:16.560 --> 33:19.560
our team spent a lot of time down there.

33:19.560 --> 33:20.640
Those were fun days.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.080
Hiking with the robot.

33:22.080 --> 33:23.760
What did you learn about what it takes

33:23.760 --> 33:27.640
to balance a robot like that on a trail?

33:28.400 --> 33:29.240
On a hiking trail in the woods.

33:29.240 --> 33:32.080
Basically, forget the woods, just the real world.

33:32.080 --> 33:35.160
That's the big leap into testing in the real world.

33:35.160 --> 33:36.240
Yeah.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.280
As challenging as the woods were,

33:39.160 --> 33:44.160
working inside of a home or in an office is really harder.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.120
Yeah.

33:46.120 --> 33:46.960
Because when you're in the woods,

33:46.960 --> 33:49.800
you can actually take any path up the hill.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.320
All you have to do is avoid the obstacles.

33:52.320 --> 33:54.560
There's no such thing as damaging the woods,

33:54.560 --> 33:57.160
at least, you know, to first order.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.520
Whereas if you're in a house, you can't leave scuff marks.

33:59.520 --> 34:00.840
You can't bang into the walls.

34:00.840 --> 34:03.000
The robots aren't very comfortable bumping into the walls,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.280
especially in the early days.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.040
So I think those were actually bigger challenges

34:08.040 --> 34:10.280
once we faced them.

34:10.280 --> 34:13.200
It was mostly, you know, getting the systems

34:13.200 --> 34:16.760
to work well enough together, the hardware systems to work.

34:16.760 --> 34:17.960
And the controls.

34:17.960 --> 34:20.760
In those days, we did have a human operator

34:20.760 --> 34:23.640
who did all the visual perception

34:23.640 --> 34:25.320
going up the Guadalcanal Trail.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.520
So there was an operator who was right there,

34:27.520 --> 34:29.800
who was very skilled at,

34:29.800 --> 34:31.760
even though the robot was balancing itself

34:31.760 --> 34:33.720
and placing its own feet,

34:33.720 --> 34:36.360
if the operator didn't do the right thing, it wouldn't go.

34:36.360 --> 34:39.160
But years later, we went back with one of the electric,

34:39.160 --> 34:41.240
the precursor to Spot,

34:41.240 --> 34:44.840
and we had advanced the controls and everything so much

34:44.840 --> 34:47.760
that an amateur, complete amateur,

34:47.760 --> 34:50.240
could operate the robot the first time,

34:50.240 --> 34:52.080
up and down and up and down,

34:52.080 --> 34:54.360
whereas it had taken us years to get there

34:54.360 --> 34:55.920
in the previous robot.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.240
So if you fast forward,

34:57.240 --> 34:59.520
Big Dog eventually became Spot.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.240
So Big Dog became LS3,

35:01.240 --> 35:03.080
which is the big load carrying one.

35:03.080 --> 35:04.640
Just a quick pause.

35:04.640 --> 35:07.480
It can carry 400 pounds.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.040
It was designed to carry 400,

35:09.040 --> 35:12.160
but we had it carrying about 1,000 pounds at one time.

35:12.160 --> 35:13.600
Of course you did.

35:13.600 --> 35:14.440
Just to make sure.

35:14.440 --> 35:15.960
We had one carrying the other one.

35:15.960 --> 35:16.800
We had two of them.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.440
So we had one carrying the other one.

35:18.440 --> 35:19.280
There's a little clip of that.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.880
We should put that out somewhere.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.640
That's from like 20 years ago.

35:22.640 --> 35:24.040
Wow.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.360
And it can go for very long distances.

35:26.360 --> 35:28.200
It can travel 20 miles.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.400
Yeah.

35:29.400 --> 35:30.400
Gasoline.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.880
Gasoline, yeah.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.760
And that eventually just, okay, sorry.

35:33.760 --> 35:38.120
So LS3, then how did that lead to Spot?

35:38.120 --> 35:43.120
So Big Dog and LS3 had engine power and hydraulic actuation.

35:46.840 --> 35:51.840
Then we made a robot that was electric power.

35:52.600 --> 35:56.960
So there's a battery driving a motor, driving a pump,

35:56.960 --> 35:59.400
but still hydraulic actuation.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.480
Larry sort of asked us,

36:00.480 --> 36:02.400
could you make something that weighed 60 pounds

36:02.400 --> 36:04.440
that would not be so intimidating

36:04.440 --> 36:07.200
if you had it in a house where there were people?

36:07.200 --> 36:10.040
And that was the inspiration behind the Spot,

36:10.040 --> 36:11.320
pretty much as it exists today.

36:11.320 --> 36:13.360
We did a prototype the same size.

36:13.360 --> 36:18.360
That was the first all electric, non-hydraulic robot.

36:19.160 --> 36:20.760
What was the conversation with Larry Page like

36:20.800 --> 36:21.960
about?

36:21.960 --> 36:25.760
So here's a guy that kind of is very product focused

36:25.760 --> 36:28.760
and can see a vision for like what the future holds.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.640
That's just interesting kind of a side.

36:31.640 --> 36:34.200
What was the brainstorm about the future robotics

36:34.200 --> 36:35.600
with him like?

36:35.600 --> 36:37.720
I mean, it was almost as simple as what I just said.

36:37.720 --> 36:39.800
He, you know, we were having a meeting.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.320
He said, yeah, geez, you know,

36:41.320 --> 36:42.840
do you think you could make a smaller one

36:42.840 --> 36:44.160
that wouldn't be so intimidating?

36:44.160 --> 36:45.480
Well, you know, like a big dog.

36:45.480 --> 36:46.880
Yeah.

36:46.880 --> 36:47.920
If it was in your house.

36:47.920 --> 36:50.120
And I said, yeah, we could do that.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.640
And we started and did.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.120
Is there a lot of technical challenges

36:54.120 --> 36:57.120
to go from hydraulic to electric?

36:57.120 --> 36:59.160
You know, I had been in love with hydraulics

36:59.160 --> 37:02.160
and still love hydraulics.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.640
You know, it's a great technology.

37:03.640 --> 37:07.680
It's too bad that the somehow the world out there

37:07.680 --> 37:12.640
looks at it like it's old fashioned or that it's icky.

37:12.640 --> 37:13.760
And it's true that you do.

37:13.760 --> 37:16.120
It is very hard to keep it from having some amount

37:16.120 --> 37:18.920
of dripping from time to time.

37:18.920 --> 37:21.400
But if you look at the performance, you know,

37:21.400 --> 37:24.320
how strong you can get in a lightweight package.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.640
And of course we did a huge amount of innovation.

37:26.640 --> 37:29.520
Most of hydraulic control,

37:29.520 --> 37:32.640
that is the valve that controls the flow of oil,

37:32.640 --> 37:36.360
had been designed in the fifties for airplanes.

37:36.360 --> 37:39.880
It had been made robust enough, safe enough

37:39.880 --> 37:41.000
that you could count on it

37:41.000 --> 37:44.640
so that humans could fly in airplanes.

37:44.640 --> 37:47.560
And very little innovation had happened.

37:47.560 --> 37:48.640
You know, that might not be fair

37:48.640 --> 37:49.760
to the people who make the valves.

37:49.760 --> 37:52.240
I'm sure that they did innovate.

37:52.240 --> 37:54.320
But the basic design had stayed the same

37:54.320 --> 37:56.240
and there was so much more you could do.

37:56.240 --> 37:59.480
And so our engineers designed valves,

37:59.480 --> 38:03.480
the ones that are in Atlas, for instance,

38:03.480 --> 38:05.280
that had new kinds of circuits.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.880
They sort of did some of the computing

38:06.880 --> 38:09.280
that could get you much more efficient use.

38:09.280 --> 38:10.800
They were much smaller and lighter

38:10.800 --> 38:13.760
so that the whole robot could be smaller and lighter.

38:13.760 --> 38:16.480
We made a hydraulic power supply

38:16.480 --> 38:18.960
that had a bunch of components

38:18.960 --> 38:20.600
integrated in this tiny package.

38:20.600 --> 38:23.320
It's about this big, the size of a football,

38:23.320 --> 38:25.880
weighs five kilograms

38:25.880 --> 38:28.920
and it produces five kilowatts of power.

38:28.920 --> 38:31.080
Of course it has to have a battery operating,

38:31.080 --> 38:34.240
but it's got a motor, a pump, filters,

38:34.240 --> 38:37.760
heat exchanger to keep it cool, some valves,

38:37.760 --> 38:39.760
all in this tiny little package.

38:39.760 --> 38:44.280
So hydraulics could still have a ways to go.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.280
One of the things that stands out about the robots

38:47.280 --> 38:48.520
Boston Dynamics have created

38:48.520 --> 38:50.440
is how beautiful the movement is,

38:50.440 --> 38:55.160
how natural the walking is and running is,

38:55.160 --> 38:57.360
even flipping is, throwing is.

38:57.360 --> 39:00.120
So maybe you can talk about what's involved

39:00.120 --> 39:02.840
in making it look natural.

39:02.840 --> 39:06.400
Well, I think having good hardware is part of the story

39:06.400 --> 39:08.640
and people who think you don't need

39:08.640 --> 39:12.240
to innovate hardware anymore are wrong, in my opinion.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.440
So I think one of the things,

39:14.440 --> 39:16.640
certainly in the early years for me,

39:16.640 --> 39:18.040
taking a dynamic approach,

39:18.040 --> 39:21.120
where you think about what's the evolution

39:21.120 --> 39:24.880
of the motion of the thing gonna be in the future

39:24.880 --> 39:28.160
and having a prediction of that that's used at the time

39:28.160 --> 39:30.240
that you're giving signals to it,

39:30.240 --> 39:32.000
as opposed to it all being servoing,

39:32.000 --> 39:33.880
which is servoing is sort of backward looking.

39:33.880 --> 39:36.080
It says, okay, where am I now?

39:36.080 --> 39:37.920
I'm gonna try and adjust for that.

39:37.920 --> 39:40.400
But you really need to think about what's coming.

39:40.400 --> 39:44.040
So how far ahead do you have to look in time?

39:44.040 --> 39:44.880
It's interesting.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.720
I think that the number is only a couple of seconds

39:47.720 --> 39:48.880
for a spot.

39:48.880 --> 39:52.880
So there's a limited horizon type approach

39:52.880 --> 39:54.840
where you're recalculating,

39:54.840 --> 39:57.960
assuming what's gonna happen in the next second

39:57.960 --> 39:59.280
or a second and a half.

39:59.280 --> 40:01.080
And then you keep iterating,

40:01.080 --> 40:03.400
the next, even though a 10th of a second later,

40:03.400 --> 40:05.240
you'll say, okay, let's do that again

40:05.240 --> 40:06.440
and see what's happening.

40:06.440 --> 40:08.240
And you're looking at what the obstacles are,

40:08.240 --> 40:10.120
where the feet are gonna be placed,

40:11.000 --> 40:12.800
you have to coordinate a lot of things

40:12.800 --> 40:16.280
if you have obstacles and you're balancing at the same time.

40:16.280 --> 40:19.320
And it's that limited horizon type calculation

40:19.320 --> 40:20.960
that's doing a lot of that.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.300
But if you're doing something like a somersault,

40:23.300 --> 40:25.340
you're looking out a lot further, right?

40:25.340 --> 40:26.880
If you wanna stick the landing,

40:26.880 --> 40:28.240
you have to get the right,

40:28.240 --> 40:30.680
you have to, at the time of launch,

40:30.680 --> 40:34.640
have momentum and rotation,

40:34.640 --> 40:36.080
all those things coordinated

40:36.080 --> 40:38.240
so that a landing is within reach.

40:38.280 --> 40:40.480
How hard is it to stick a landing?

40:40.480 --> 40:44.040
I mean, it's very much under-actuated.

40:44.040 --> 40:47.400
Like you, once you've in the air,

40:47.400 --> 40:51.320
you don't have as much control about anything.

40:51.320 --> 40:54.320
So how hard is it to get that to work?

40:54.320 --> 40:57.520
First of all, it did flips with a hopping robot.

40:57.520 --> 40:58.940
If you look at the first time

40:58.940 --> 41:00.960
we ever made a robot do a somersault,

41:00.960 --> 41:03.800
it was in a planar robot.

41:03.800 --> 41:06.680
It had a boom, so it was restricted

41:06.680 --> 41:09.040
to the surface of a sphere, we call that planar.

41:09.040 --> 41:10.560
So it could move fore and aft,

41:10.560 --> 41:12.880
it could go up and down, and it could rotate.

41:12.880 --> 41:14.920
And so the calculation of what you need to do

41:14.920 --> 41:19.100
to stick a landing isn't all that complicated.

41:19.100 --> 41:20.740
You have to look at, you know,

41:20.740 --> 41:22.760
you have to get time to make the rotation.

41:22.760 --> 41:25.700
So how high you jump gives you time.

41:27.240 --> 41:29.960
You look at how quickly you can rotate.

41:29.960 --> 41:32.160
And so, you know, if you get those two right,

41:32.160 --> 41:34.680
then when you land, you have the feet in the right place.

41:34.680 --> 41:37.360
And you have to get rid of all that rotational

41:37.360 --> 41:39.640
and linear momentum.

41:39.640 --> 41:42.300
But, you know, that's not too hard to figure out.

41:42.300 --> 41:46.360
And we made, you know, back in about 1985 or six,

41:46.360 --> 41:50.380
I can't remember, we had a simple robot doing somersaults.

41:50.380 --> 41:53.440
To do it in 3D, really the calculation is the same,

41:53.440 --> 41:54.680
you just have to be balancing

41:54.680 --> 41:55.880
and the other degrees of freedom.

41:55.880 --> 41:57.120
If you're just doing a somersault,

41:57.120 --> 41:59.280
it's just a planar thing.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.960
Roy Murab was my graduate student when we were at MIT,

42:02.000 --> 42:04.760
which is when we made, you know, a two-legged robot

42:04.760 --> 42:06.800
do a 3D somersault for the first time.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.800
There we, in order to get enough rotation rate,

42:10.800 --> 42:13.740
you needed to do tucking also, you know,

42:13.740 --> 42:15.960
withdraw the legs in order to accelerate it.

42:15.960 --> 42:18.280
And he did some really fascinating work

42:18.280 --> 42:21.800
on how you stabilize more complicated maneuvers.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.040
You remember he was a gymnast,

42:23.040 --> 42:25.520
a champion gymnast before he'd come to me.

42:25.520 --> 42:29.720
So he had the physical abilities and he was, you know,

42:29.720 --> 42:32.560
an engineer so he could translate some of that

42:32.560 --> 42:37.040
into the math and the algorithms that you need to do that.

42:37.040 --> 42:38.600
He knew how humans do it,

42:38.600 --> 42:41.160
he just had to get robots to do the same.

42:41.160 --> 42:42.600
Unfortunately though,

42:42.600 --> 42:45.600
humans don't really know how they do it, right?

42:45.600 --> 42:49.640
We were coached, we have ways of learning,

42:49.640 --> 42:53.000
but do we really understand in a physics way

42:53.000 --> 42:54.600
what we're doing?

42:54.600 --> 42:57.800
Probably most gymnasts and athletes don't know.

42:57.800 --> 43:00.400
So in some way, by building robots,

43:00.400 --> 43:03.120
you are in part understanding how humans do it,

43:03.120 --> 43:04.440
like walking.

43:04.440 --> 43:08.200
Most of us walk without considering how we walk really,

43:08.200 --> 43:10.280
and how we make it so natural and efficient,

43:10.280 --> 43:11.120
all those kinds of things.

43:11.120 --> 43:13.140
Atlas still doesn't walk like a person,

43:13.140 --> 43:15.560
and it still doesn't walk quite as gracefully as a person,

43:15.560 --> 43:18.480
even though it's been getting closer and closer.

43:18.480 --> 43:21.260
The running might be close to a human,

43:21.260 --> 43:23.600
but the walking is still a challenge.

43:23.600 --> 43:24.800
That's interesting, right?

43:24.800 --> 43:26.800
That running is closer to a human.

43:26.840 --> 43:29.360
It just shows that the more aggressive

43:29.360 --> 43:34.000
and the more you leap into the unknown,

43:34.000 --> 43:35.080
the more natural it is.

43:35.080 --> 43:37.640
I mean, walking is kind of falling always, right?

43:37.640 --> 43:39.640
And something weird about the knee,

43:39.640 --> 43:43.200
that you can kind of do this folding and unfolding,

43:43.200 --> 43:44.600
and get it to work out just,

43:44.600 --> 43:46.440
a human can get it to work out just right,

43:46.440 --> 43:48.120
there's compliances.

43:48.120 --> 43:50.620
Compliance means springiness in the design

43:50.620 --> 43:52.840
that are important to how it all works.

43:52.840 --> 43:53.920
Well, we used to have a motto

43:53.920 --> 43:55.740
at the Boston Dynamics in the early days,

43:55.740 --> 43:58.180
which was, you have to run before you can walk.

44:00.540 --> 44:02.020
That's a good motto.

44:02.020 --> 44:05.020
Because you also had Wildcat,

44:05.020 --> 44:07.460
which was one of the along the way towards Spot,

44:07.460 --> 44:10.500
which is a quadruped that went 19 miles an hour

44:10.500 --> 44:12.060
on flat terrain.

44:12.060 --> 44:14.620
Is that the fastest you've ever built?

44:14.620 --> 44:17.060
Might be the fastest quadruped in the world, I don't know.

44:17.060 --> 44:18.900
For a quadruped, probably.

44:18.900 --> 44:21.180
Of course, it was probably the loudest too.

44:21.180 --> 44:24.220
So we had this little racing go-kart engine on it,

44:24.220 --> 44:27.540
and we would get people from three buildings away,

44:27.540 --> 44:31.820
sending us complaining about how loud it was.

44:31.820 --> 44:33.540
So at the leg lab,

44:33.540 --> 44:36.160
I believe most of the robots didn't have knees.

44:39.300 --> 44:42.020
How do you figure out what is the right number of actuators?

44:42.020 --> 44:44.100
What are the joints to have?

44:44.100 --> 44:46.060
What do you need to have?

44:46.060 --> 44:47.500
We humans have knees,

44:47.500 --> 44:51.220
and all kinds of interesting stuff on the feet.

44:51.220 --> 44:53.740
The toe is an important part, I guess, for humans.

44:54.340 --> 44:55.540
Or maybe it's not.

44:55.540 --> 44:57.020
I injured my toe recently,

44:57.020 --> 44:59.140
and it made running very unpleasant.

44:59.140 --> 45:01.020
So that seems to be kind of important.

45:01.020 --> 45:04.500
So how do you figure out for efficiency, for function,

45:04.500 --> 45:07.780
for aesthetics, how many joints to have,

45:07.780 --> 45:09.260
how many actuators to have?

45:09.260 --> 45:10.700
Well, it's always a balance

45:10.700 --> 45:14.100
between wanting to get where you really want to get,

45:14.100 --> 45:18.660
and what's practical to do based on your resources,

45:18.660 --> 45:20.780
or what you know, and all that.

45:20.780 --> 45:24.620
So, I mean, the whole idea of the Poga stick

45:24.620 --> 45:26.420
was to do simplification.

45:26.420 --> 45:28.620
Obviously, it didn't look like a human.

45:28.620 --> 45:31.940
I think a technical scientist could appreciate

45:31.940 --> 45:33.900
that we were capturing some of the things

45:33.900 --> 45:35.900
that are important in human locomotion

45:35.900 --> 45:40.340
without it looking like it, without having a knee, an ankle.

45:40.340 --> 45:43.220
I'll tell you the first sketch that Ben Brown made

45:44.100 --> 45:45.840
when we were talking about building this thing

45:45.840 --> 45:48.100
was a very complicated thing

45:48.100 --> 45:51.220
with zillions of springs, lots of joints.

45:51.220 --> 45:54.900
It looked like much more like a kangaroo

45:54.900 --> 45:57.500
or an ostrich or something like that,

45:57.500 --> 46:00.300
things we were paying a lot of attention to at the time.

46:01.580 --> 46:03.940
Yeah, so my job was to say,

46:03.940 --> 46:08.020
okay, well, let's do something simpler to get started,

46:08.020 --> 46:10.300
and maybe we'll get there at some point.

46:10.300 --> 46:12.820
I just love the idea that you two

46:12.820 --> 46:14.700
were studying kangaroos and ostriches.

46:14.700 --> 46:16.500
Oh yeah, we did.

46:16.540 --> 46:21.540
We filmed and digitized data from horses.

46:21.700 --> 46:25.340
I did a dissection of an ostrich at one point,

46:25.340 --> 46:27.740
which has absolutely remarkable legs.

46:27.740 --> 46:28.820
Dumb question.

46:28.820 --> 46:33.560
Do ostriches have a lot of musculature on the legs or no?

46:33.560 --> 46:35.260
Most of it's up in the feathers,

46:35.260 --> 46:37.200
but there's a huge amount going on in the feathers,

46:37.200 --> 46:38.860
including a knee joint.

46:38.860 --> 46:40.140
The knee joint's way up there.

46:40.140 --> 46:42.060
The thing that's halfway down the leg

46:42.060 --> 46:46.480
that looks like a backwards knee is actually the ankle.

46:47.480 --> 46:49.040
The thing on the ground which looks like the foot

46:49.040 --> 46:52.760
is actually the toes, it's an extended toe.

46:52.760 --> 46:57.760
But the basic morphology is the same in all these animals.

46:58.920 --> 47:02.880
What do you think is the most beautiful movement

47:02.880 --> 47:03.720
of an animal?

47:03.720 --> 47:06.560
Like what animal do you think is the coolest?

47:06.560 --> 47:07.680
Land animal, that's cool,

47:07.680 --> 47:08.720
because fish is pretty cool,

47:08.720 --> 47:11.800
like the water, but like leggy locomotion.

47:11.800 --> 47:15.000
You know, the slo-mos of cheetahs running are incredible.

47:15.000 --> 47:20.000
You know, there's so much back motion and, you know, grace,

47:20.780 --> 47:22.680
and of course they're moving very fast.

47:24.080 --> 47:25.680
The animals running away from the cheetah

47:25.680 --> 47:26.740
are pretty exciting.

47:26.740 --> 47:29.480
You know, the pronghorn, which, you know,

47:29.480 --> 47:33.500
they do this all four legs at once jump called the prong

47:33.500 --> 47:36.760
to kind of confuse the, especially if there's a group of them

47:36.760 --> 47:39.240
to confuse whoever's chasing them.

47:39.240 --> 47:41.000
So they do like a misdirection type of thing?

47:41.000 --> 47:42.880
Yep, they do a misdirection thing.

47:42.880 --> 47:45.120
The front-on views of the cheetahs running fast

47:45.120 --> 47:48.520
where the tail is whipping around to help in the turns,

47:48.520 --> 47:51.360
to help us stabilize in the turns, that's pretty exciting.

47:51.360 --> 47:53.360
Because they spend a lot of time in the air, I guess,

47:53.360 --> 47:55.000
as they're running that fast.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.960
But they also turn very fast.

47:56.960 --> 47:58.800
Is that a tail thing or is that,

47:58.800 --> 48:00.400
do you have to have contact with ground?

48:00.400 --> 48:02.560
Everything in the body is probably helping turn

48:02.560 --> 48:04.860
because they're chasing something that's trying to get away

48:04.860 --> 48:07.880
that's also zigzagging around.

48:07.880 --> 48:10.700
But I would be remiss if I didn't say, you know,

48:10.700 --> 48:12.900
humans are pretty good too.

48:12.900 --> 48:15.860
You know, you watch gymnasts, especially these days,

48:15.860 --> 48:19.420
they're doing just incredible stuff.

48:19.420 --> 48:22.220
Well, like, especially like Olympic level gymnasts.

48:22.220 --> 48:24.420
See, but there could be, I think there could be cheetahs

48:24.420 --> 48:25.260
that are Olympic level.

48:25.260 --> 48:28.220
We might be watching the average cheetah versus like,

48:28.220 --> 48:30.300
there could be like a really special cheetah

48:30.300 --> 48:31.140
that can do like-

48:31.140 --> 48:32.300
You're right.

48:32.300 --> 48:35.340
When did the knees first come into play

48:35.340 --> 48:37.620
in you building legged robots?

48:37.620 --> 48:38.580
In Big Dog.

48:38.580 --> 48:39.420
Big Dog.

48:39.580 --> 48:42.940
Big Dog came first and then Little Dog was later.

48:42.940 --> 48:47.180
And you know, there's a big compromise there.

48:47.180 --> 48:50.340
Human knees have multiple muscles

48:50.340 --> 48:52.900
and you could argue that there's,

48:54.780 --> 48:57.700
I mean, it's a technical thing about negative work.

48:57.700 --> 49:00.380
When you're contracting a joint,

49:00.380 --> 49:03.740
but you're pushing out, that's negative work.

49:03.740 --> 49:05.780
And if you don't have a place to store that,

49:05.780 --> 49:08.100
it can be very expensive to do negative work.

49:08.780 --> 49:10.660
And in Big Dog, there was no place

49:10.660 --> 49:13.980
to store negative work in the knees.

49:14.860 --> 49:19.500
But Big Dog also had pogo stick springs down below.

49:19.500 --> 49:23.660
So part of the action was to comply in a bouncing motion.

49:23.660 --> 49:27.020
You know, later on in spot, we took that out.

49:27.020 --> 49:29.900
As we got further and further away from the leg lab,

49:29.900 --> 49:33.860
we had more, you know, energy driven controls.

49:34.820 --> 49:36.900
Is there something to be said about like knees

49:36.900 --> 49:40.740
that go forward versus backward?

49:40.740 --> 49:41.580
Sure.

49:41.580 --> 49:45.460
There's this idea called the passive dynamics,

49:45.460 --> 49:48.620
which says that although you can use computers

49:48.620 --> 49:51.020
and actuators to make a motion,

49:51.020 --> 49:54.220
a mechanical system can make a motion just by itself

49:54.220 --> 49:56.300
if it gets stimulated the right way.

49:57.740 --> 50:02.740
So Tad McGeer in the, I think in the mid 80s,

50:03.020 --> 50:05.980
maybe it was in the late 80s, started to work on that.

50:05.980 --> 50:09.380
And he made this legged system

50:09.380 --> 50:11.780
that could walk down an inclined plane

50:11.780 --> 50:14.660
where the legs folded and unfolded and swung forward,

50:14.660 --> 50:17.100
you know, do the whole walking motion

50:17.100 --> 50:19.500
where the only thing, there was no computer.

50:19.500 --> 50:22.140
There were some adjustments to the mechanics

50:22.140 --> 50:24.860
so that there were dampers and springs in some places

50:24.860 --> 50:28.420
that helped the mechanical action happen.

50:28.420 --> 50:30.700
It was essentially a mechanical computer.

50:30.700 --> 50:34.060
And the idea, the interesting idea there is

50:34.060 --> 50:38.380
that it's not all about the brain dictating to the body

50:38.380 --> 50:39.420
what the body should do.

50:39.420 --> 50:42.460
The body is a participant in the motion.

50:42.460 --> 50:46.180
So a great design for a robot has a mechanical component

50:46.180 --> 50:49.620
where the movement is efficient even without a brain.

50:49.620 --> 50:50.540
Yes.

50:50.540 --> 50:52.140
How do you design that?

50:52.140 --> 50:54.660
I think that these days, most robots aren't doing that.

50:54.660 --> 50:58.620
Most robots are basically using the computer

50:58.620 --> 51:00.500
to govern the motion.

51:00.500 --> 51:03.940
Now the brain though is taking into account

51:04.820 --> 51:07.020
what the mechanical thing can do

51:07.020 --> 51:08.180
and how it's going to behave.

51:08.180 --> 51:11.660
Otherwise it would have to really forcefully move

51:11.660 --> 51:13.580
everything around all the time,

51:13.580 --> 51:15.860
which probably some solutions do,

51:15.860 --> 51:18.380
but I think you end up with a more efficient

51:18.380 --> 51:21.260
and more graceful thing if you're taking into account

51:21.260 --> 51:23.260
what the machine wants to do.

51:23.260 --> 51:25.380
So this might be a good place to mention

51:25.380 --> 51:28.700
that you're now leading up

51:28.700 --> 51:32.980
the Boston Dynamics AI Institute, newly formed,

51:33.020 --> 51:37.060
which is focused more on designing the robots of the future.

51:38.180 --> 51:39.700
I think one of the things,

51:39.700 --> 51:42.340
maybe you can tell me the big vision for what's going on,

51:42.340 --> 51:47.140
but one of the things is this idea that hardware

51:47.140 --> 51:50.300
still matters with organic design and so on.

51:50.300 --> 51:52.060
Maybe before that, can you zoom out

51:52.060 --> 51:55.900
and tell me what the vision is for the AI Institute?

51:57.300 --> 52:00.260
I like to talk about intelligence having two parts,

52:00.260 --> 52:04.100
an athletic part and a cognitive part.

52:04.100 --> 52:07.180
And I think Boston Dynamics, in my view,

52:07.180 --> 52:08.540
has sort of set the standard

52:08.540 --> 52:12.060
for what athletic intelligence can be.

52:12.060 --> 52:13.340
And it has to do with all the things

52:13.340 --> 52:17.260
we've been talking about, the mechanical design,

52:17.260 --> 52:19.940
the real time control, the energetics

52:19.940 --> 52:21.420
and that kind of stuff.

52:21.420 --> 52:24.580
But obviously people have another kind of intelligence

52:24.580 --> 52:26.940
and animals have another kind of intelligence.

52:26.940 --> 52:28.180
We can make a plan.

52:29.140 --> 52:31.380
Our meeting started at 9.30.

52:31.380 --> 52:34.940
I looked up on Google Maps how long it took to walk over here.

52:34.940 --> 52:36.820
It was 20 minutes.

52:36.820 --> 52:40.420
So I decided, okay, I'd leave my house at nine,

52:40.420 --> 52:41.420
which is what I did.

52:42.780 --> 52:43.740
Simple intelligence,

52:43.740 --> 52:46.260
but we use that kind of stuff all the time.

52:46.260 --> 52:48.940
It's sort of what we think of as going on in our heads.

52:50.260 --> 52:53.260
And I think that's in short supply for robots.

52:53.260 --> 52:55.380
Most robots are pretty dumb.

52:55.620 --> 52:58.660
And as a result, it takes a lot of skilled people

52:58.660 --> 53:01.300
to program them to do everything they do.

53:02.180 --> 53:03.900
And it takes a long time.

53:03.900 --> 53:08.220
And if robots are gonna satisfy our dreams,

53:08.220 --> 53:09.420
they need to be smarter.

53:11.180 --> 53:16.180
So the AI Institute is designed to combine

53:16.820 --> 53:19.540
that physicality of the athletic side

53:19.540 --> 53:21.980
with the cognitive side.

53:21.980 --> 53:24.500
So for instance, we're trying to make robots

53:24.500 --> 53:27.380
that can watch a human do a task,

53:27.380 --> 53:29.700
understand what they're seeing,

53:29.700 --> 53:31.220
and then do the task itself.

53:31.220 --> 53:36.220
So sort of OJT on-the-job training for robots as a paradigm.

53:37.620 --> 53:40.020
Now, that's pretty hard,

53:40.020 --> 53:42.180
and it's sort of science fiction,

53:42.180 --> 53:46.100
but our idea is to work on a longer timeframe

53:46.100 --> 53:48.940
and work on solving those kinds of problems.

53:48.940 --> 53:50.060
And I have a whole list of things

53:50.060 --> 53:53.100
that are kind of like in that vein.

53:53.100 --> 53:57.540
Maybe we can just take many of the things you mentioned,

53:57.540 --> 53:59.260
just take it as a tangent.

53:59.260 --> 54:02.100
First of all, athletic intelligence is a super cool term.

54:03.580 --> 54:05.620
And that really is intelligence.

54:05.620 --> 54:07.740
We humans kind of take it for granted

54:07.740 --> 54:10.220
that we're so good at walking and moving about the world.

54:10.220 --> 54:13.340
And using our hands, the mechanics of interacting

54:13.340 --> 54:16.660
with all these parts, these two things.

54:16.660 --> 54:18.620
You've never touched those things before, right?

54:18.620 --> 54:20.300
Well, I've touched ones like this.

54:20.300 --> 54:21.780
Look at all the things I can do, right?

54:21.940 --> 54:25.660
I can juggle them, this way I can rotate it without looking.

54:25.660 --> 54:27.540
I could fetch these things out of my pocket

54:27.540 --> 54:29.140
and figure out which one was which

54:29.140 --> 54:30.620
and all that kind of stuff.

54:30.620 --> 54:33.420
And I don't think we have much of a clue

54:33.420 --> 54:35.300
how all that works yet.

54:35.300 --> 54:37.460
Right, and I really like putting that

54:37.460 --> 54:41.380
under the banner of athletic intelligence.

54:41.380 --> 54:44.340
What are the big open problems in athletic intelligence?

54:44.340 --> 54:48.780
So Boston Dynamics with Spot, with Atlas,

54:48.780 --> 54:51.500
just have shown time and time again,

54:52.180 --> 54:54.900
push the limits of what we think is possible with robots.

54:54.900 --> 54:58.420
But where do we stand actually, if we kind of zoom out?

54:58.420 --> 54:59.820
What are the big open problems

54:59.820 --> 55:01.580
on the athletic intelligence side?

55:01.580 --> 55:04.220
I mean, one question you could ask, it isn't my question,

55:04.220 --> 55:06.740
but are they commercially viable?

55:08.380 --> 55:10.180
Will they increase productivity?

55:10.180 --> 55:12.860
And I think we're getting very close to that.

55:13.860 --> 55:15.940
I don't think we're quite there still.

55:15.940 --> 55:20.020
Most of the robotics companies, it's a struggle.

55:20.020 --> 55:22.260
It's really the lack of the cognitive side

55:22.260 --> 55:25.060
that probably is the biggest barrier at the moment,

55:25.060 --> 55:27.860
even for the physically successful robots.

55:27.860 --> 55:30.940
But your question's, I mean, you can always do a thing

55:30.940 --> 55:34.900
that's more efficient, lighter, more reliable.

55:34.900 --> 55:36.580
I'd say reliability.

55:36.580 --> 55:40.260
I know that Spot, they've been working very hard

55:40.260 --> 55:44.380
on getting the tail of the reliability curve up

55:44.380 --> 55:46.180
and they've made huge progress.

55:46.260 --> 55:50.380
So the robots, there's 1,500 of them out there now,

55:50.380 --> 55:54.580
many of them being used in practical applications

55:54.580 --> 55:59.580
day in and day out, where they have to work reliably.

56:00.060 --> 56:02.660
And it's very exciting that they've done that,

56:02.660 --> 56:03.780
but it takes a huge effort

56:03.780 --> 56:07.220
to get that kind of reliability in the robot.

56:07.220 --> 56:10.580
There's cost too, you'd like to get the cost down.

56:10.580 --> 56:12.220
Spots are still pretty expensive

56:13.660 --> 56:15.980
and I don't think that they have to be,

56:16.780 --> 56:19.940
but it takes a different kind of activity to do that.

56:21.060 --> 56:25.900
Now that, I think that Boston Dynamics

56:25.900 --> 56:28.420
is owned primarily by Hyundai now,

56:28.420 --> 56:32.620
and I think that the skills of Hyundai in making cars

56:32.620 --> 56:36.740
can be brought to bear in making robots

56:36.740 --> 56:38.700
that are less expensive and more reliable

56:38.700 --> 56:39.820
and those kinds of things.

56:39.820 --> 56:43.820
So on the cognitive side for the Eye Institute,

56:44.100 --> 56:47.860
what's the trade-off between moonshot projects for you

56:47.860 --> 56:50.580
and maybe incremental progress?

56:50.580 --> 56:51.580
That's a good question.

56:51.580 --> 56:53.780
I think we're using the paradigm

56:53.780 --> 56:56.100
called stepping stones to moonshots.

56:56.100 --> 57:00.260
I don't believe, that was in my original proposal

57:00.260 --> 57:02.900
for the Institute, stepping stones to moonshots.

57:02.900 --> 57:05.580
I think if you go more than a year

57:05.580 --> 57:10.060
without seeing a tangible status report of where you are,

57:10.060 --> 57:12.180
which is the stepping stone,

57:12.180 --> 57:14.100
and it could be a simplification, right?

57:14.100 --> 57:16.140
You don't necessarily have to solve

57:16.140 --> 57:18.180
all the problems of your target goal,

57:18.180 --> 57:21.060
even though your target goal is going to take several years.

57:22.460 --> 57:25.420
Those stepping stone results give you feedback,

57:25.420 --> 57:26.380
give motivation,

57:26.380 --> 57:29.580
because usually there's some success in there.

57:29.580 --> 57:33.500
And so that's the mantra we've been working on.

57:33.500 --> 57:37.820
And that's pretty much how I'd say Boston Dynamics has worked

57:38.820 --> 57:43.180
where you make progress and show it as you go.

57:43.180 --> 57:45.780
Show it to yourself, if not to the world.

57:45.780 --> 57:47.340
What does success look like?

57:47.340 --> 57:50.740
What are some of the milestones you're chasing?

57:51.900 --> 57:54.660
Well, with Watch, Understand, Do,

57:54.660 --> 57:56.380
the project I mentioned before,

57:56.380 --> 57:59.860
we've broken that down into getting some progress

57:59.860 --> 58:03.020
with what does meaningfully watching something mean,

58:04.020 --> 58:06.700
breaking down an observation of a person

58:06.700 --> 58:11.500
doing something into the components, segmenting.

58:11.500 --> 58:12.580
You watch me do something,

58:12.580 --> 58:14.460
I'm going to pick up this thing and put it down here

58:14.460 --> 58:15.740
and stack this on it.

58:15.740 --> 58:18.660
Well, it's not obvious if you just look at the raw data,

58:19.900 --> 58:21.900
what the sequence of acts are.

58:21.900 --> 58:24.700
It's really a creative, intelligent act for you

58:24.700 --> 58:26.740
to break that down into the pieces

58:26.740 --> 58:29.140
and understand them in a way so you could say,

58:29.260 --> 58:31.500
okay, what skill do I need

58:31.500 --> 58:34.180
to accomplish each of those things?

58:34.180 --> 58:37.380
So we're working on the front end of that kind of a problem

58:37.380 --> 58:41.300
where we observe and translate the,

58:41.300 --> 58:43.460
if it may be video, it may be live

58:43.460 --> 58:47.060
into a description of what we think is going on

58:47.060 --> 58:49.460
and then trying to map that into skills to accomplish that.

58:49.460 --> 58:51.260
And we've been developing skills as well.

58:51.260 --> 58:53.540
So we have kind of multiple stabs

58:53.540 --> 58:55.460
at the pieces of doing that.

58:55.500 --> 58:59.540
And this is usually video of humans manipulating objects

58:59.540 --> 59:01.500
with their hands kind of thing?

59:01.500 --> 59:03.220
We're starting out with bicycle repair,

59:03.220 --> 59:05.380
some simple bicycle repair tasks.

59:05.380 --> 59:06.460
That seems complicated.

59:06.460 --> 59:07.460
That seems really complicated.

59:07.460 --> 59:10.260
It is, but there's some parts of it that aren't,

59:10.260 --> 59:14.300
like putting the seat in into the,

59:14.300 --> 59:16.420
you have a tube that goes inside of another tube

59:16.420 --> 59:19.740
and there's a latch, that should be within range.

59:19.740 --> 59:23.420
Is it possible to observe, to watch a video like this

59:23.420 --> 59:25.060
without having an explicit model

59:25.060 --> 59:26.620
of what a bicycle looks like?

59:26.620 --> 59:27.900
I think it is.

59:27.900 --> 59:29.420
And I think that's the kind of thing

59:29.420 --> 59:30.900
that people don't recognize.

59:30.900 --> 59:33.220
Let me translate it to navigation.

59:35.100 --> 59:38.900
I think the basic paradigm for navigating a space

59:38.900 --> 59:41.100
is to get some kind of sensor that tells you

59:41.100 --> 59:43.260
where an obstacle is and what's open,

59:43.260 --> 59:46.220
build a map and then go through the space.

59:46.220 --> 59:48.540
But if we were doing on the job training

59:48.540 --> 59:49.980
where I was giving you a task,

59:49.980 --> 59:51.940
I wouldn't have to say anything about the room, right?

59:51.940 --> 59:54.980
We came in here, all we did is adjust the chair

59:54.980 --> 59:57.100
but we didn't say anything about the room

59:57.100 --> 59:58.820
and we could navigate it.

59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.620
So I think there's opportunities to build

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.980
that kind of navigation skill into robots

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:07.380
and we're hoping to be able to do that.

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:10.460
So operate successfully under a lot of uncertainty.

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:13.180
Yeah, and lack of specification.

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.620
Lack of specification.

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.700
I mean, that's what sort of intelligence is, right?

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:20.180
Kind of dealing with understanding a situation

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.260
even though it wasn't explained.

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:24.460
So how big of a role does machine learning

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:26.820
play in all of this?

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.340
Is this more and more learning-based?

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.860
Since chat GBT, which is a year ago, basically,

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:39.620
there's a huge interest in that

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:42.540
and a huge optimism about it.

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.300
And I think that there's a lot of things

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:46.580
that machine learn, that kind of machine learning.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:47.780
Now, Chris, there's lots of different kinds

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:48.860
of machine learning.

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:52.460
I think there's a lot of interest and optimism about it.

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:56.340
I think the facts on the ground are that

01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:58.620
doing physical things with physical robots

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:00.900
is a little bit different than language

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.620
and the tokens sort of don't exist.

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:07.660
You know, pixel values aren't like words

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:12.500
but I think that there's a lot that can be done there.

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.740
We have several people working

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.380
on machine learning approaches.

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:19.220
I don't know if you know,

01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:22.340
but we opened an office in Zurich recently

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:25.540
and Marco Hutter, who's one of the real leaders

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:28.740
in reinforcement learning for robots,

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:31.340
is the director of that office.

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:36.340
He's still half time at ETH, the university there

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.340
where he has an unbelievably fantastic lab

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:42.300
and then he's half time leading,

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:45.500
will be leading off efforts in the Zurich office.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:48.300
So we have a healthy learning component

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:51.820
but there's part of me that still says

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:53.140
if you look out in the world

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:56.860
at what the most impressive performances are,

01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:58.500
they're still pretty much,

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.460
I hate to use the word traditional

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:02.460
but that's what everybody's calling it,

01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:05.540
traditional controls like model predictive control.

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:10.100
The Atlas performances that you've seen

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.900
are mostly model predictive control.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:13.340
They've started to do some learning stuff

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:14.700
that's really incredible.

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:16.460
I don't know if it's all been shown yet

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:20.380
over time and then Marco has done some great stuff

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:21.580
and others.

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:25.060
So especially for the athletic intelligence piece,

01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:27.060
the traditional approach seems to be the one

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.220
that still performs the best.

01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:31.580
I think we're gonna find a mating of the two

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:33.420
and we'll have the best of both worlds

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:36.060
and we're working on that at the Institute too.

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.980
If I can talk to you about teams,

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:40.020
you've built an incredible team of Boston Dynamics

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:43.180
before at MIT and CMU and Boston Dynamics

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:45.100
and now at the AI Institute

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:48.860
and you said that there's four components to a great team,

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:52.260
technical, fearlessness, diligence,

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:55.060
intrepidness and fun, technical fun.

01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:56.220
Can you explain each?

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:58.220
Technical fearlessness, what do you mean by that?

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:01.380
Sure, technical fearlessness means being willing

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:04.460
to take on a problem that you don't know how to solve

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:09.460
and study it, figure out an entry point,

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:12.220
maybe a simplified version

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:14.980
or a simplified solution or something,

01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:19.820
learn from the stepping stone and go back

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:24.820
and eventually make a solution that meets your goals.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.220
And I think that's really important.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.620
The fearlessness comes into play

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:32.500
because some of it has never been done before.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.380
Yeah, and you don't know how to do it

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:37.020
and there's easier stuff to do in life.

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:43.220
So, I mean, I don't know, watch, understand, do.

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:45.860
It's a mountain of a challenge.

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:48.580
So that's the really big challenge you're tackling now.

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:52.300
Can we watch humans at scale and have robots

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:57.300
by watching humans become effective actors in the world?

01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:59.740
Yeah, I mean, we have others like that.

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:02.340
We have one called Inspect, Diagnose, Fix.

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:06.460
Like, you know, you call up the Maytag repairman.

01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:08.260
Okay, he's the one who you don't have to call,

01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:12.780
but you know, you call up the dishwasher repair person

01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:16.180
and they come to your house and they look at your machine.

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.900
It's already been actually figured out

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.060
that something doesn't work,

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.780
but they have to kind of examine it

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:25.260
and figure out what's wrong and then fix it.

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:28.340
And I think robots should be able to do that.

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.580
Boston Dynamics already has spot robots

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:37.140
collecting data on machines, things like thermal data,

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:40.460
reading the gauges, listening to them, getting sounds.

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:44.020
And that data are used to determine

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.980
whether they're healthy or not.

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:49.140
But the interpretation isn't done by the robots yet.

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:54.140
And certainly the diagnosing and the fixing isn't done yet,

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:55.500
but I think it could be.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:58.060
And that's bringing the AI and combining it

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.860
with the physical skills to do it.

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:02.940
And you're referring to the fixing in the physical world.

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.420
I can't wait until you can fix

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:05.980
the psychological problems of humans

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:08.820
and show up and do therapy.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:10.300
Yeah, that's a different thing.

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.340
Well, that's all part of the same thing.

01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:14.460
Again, humanity.

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.740
Maybe, maybe.

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:19.060
You mean convincing you it's okay

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.940
that the dishwasher's broken just through the hands?

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:21.780
Oh yeah.

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:23.820
The marketing approach.

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:25.060
Yeah, exactly.

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:28.460
It's all, yeah, don't sweat the small stuff.

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:31.540
Yeah, as opposed to fixing the dishwasher,

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:32.620
it'll convince you that it's okay

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:34.260
that the dishwasher's broken.

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:35.620
It's a different approach.

01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:38.500
Diligence.

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.940
Why is diligence important?

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:42.460
Well, if you want a real robot solution,

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:46.900
it can't be a very narrow solution

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:49.340
that's gonna break at the first variation

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:52.460
in what the robot does or the environment

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:55.020
if it wasn't exactly as you expected it.

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:56.060
So how do you get there?

01:05:56.060 --> 01:06:01.060
I think having an approach that leaves you unsatisfied

01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:03.740
until you've embraced the bigger problem

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:06.380
is the diligence I'm talking about.

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:09.660
And again, I'll point out Boss Dynamics.

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:15.140
Some of the videos that we had showing the engineer

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:17.460
making it hard for the robot to do its task.

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:20.540
Spot opening a door,

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:22.620
and then the guy gets there and pushes on the door

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:24.420
so it doesn't open the way it's supposed to,

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:27.420
pulling on the rope that's attached to the robot

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:30.460
so its navigation has been screwed up.

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:32.580
We have one where the robot's climbing stairs

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.500
and the engineer is tugging on a rope

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.860
that's pulling it back down the stairs.

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:37.980
That's totally different

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:40.300
than just the robot seeing the stairs,

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:43.700
making a model, putting its feet carefully on each step.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:46.700
But that's what probably robotics needs to succeed.

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:50.220
And having that broader idea

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:52.260
that you wanna come up with a robust solution

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:54.780
is what I meant by diligence.

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:56.580
So really testing it in all conditions,

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.140
perturbing the system in all kinds of ways.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:02.100
And as a result, creating some epic videos,

01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:04.780
the legendary. The fun part, the hockey stick.

01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:06.780
And then yes, tugging on Spot

01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:09.060
as it's trying to open the door.

01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:12.740
I mean, it's great testing, but it's also,

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:18.300
I don't know, it's just somehow extremely compelling

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:21.260
demonstration of robotics in video form.

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:22.980
I learned something very early on

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:26.500
with the first three-dimensional hopping machine.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.900
If you just show a video of it hopping,

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:31.540
it's a so what.

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:33.700
If you show it falling over a couple of times

01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:36.860
and you can see how easily and fast it falls over,

01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:39.380
then you appreciate what the robot's doing

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:41.620
when it's doing its thing.

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:44.140
So I think the reaction you just gave

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:48.660
to the robot getting kind of interfered with

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.820
or tested while it's going through the door,

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:53.300
it's showing you the scope of the solution.

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:55.340
The limits of the system,

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.660
the challenges involved in failure.

01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:59.820
If it's shown both failure and success

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:02.980
makes you appreciate the success, yeah.

01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:04.700
And then just the way the videos are done

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.100
in Ball State Dynamics are incredible

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:07.580
because they're not, there's no flash,

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:10.020
there's no extra production.

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:13.060
It's just raw testing of the robot.

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:16.900
Well, I was the final edit for most of the videos

01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:21.900
up until about three years ago or four years ago.

01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:27.420
And my theory of the video is no explanation.

01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:32.300
If they can't see it, then it's not the right thing.

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:35.460
And if you do something worth showing,

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:36.420
then let them see it.

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:41.420
Don't interfere with a bunch of titles that slow you down

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.300
or a bunch of distraction.

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:47.940
Just do something worth showing and then show it.

01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:48.780
That's brilliant.

01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:52.500
It's hard though for people to buy into that.

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:55.860
Yeah, I mean, people always want to add more stuff,

01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:59.380
but the simplicity of just do something worth showing

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:01.020
and show it, that's brilliant.

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:02.660
And don't add extra stuff.

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:07.660
People have criticized, especially the big dog videos

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:11.180
where there's a human driving the robot.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.180
And I understand the criticism now.

01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:14.580
At the time, we wanted to just show,

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:16.980
look, this thing's using its legs to get up the hill.

01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:18.860
So we focused on showing that,

01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:22.500
which was, we thought, the story.

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.780
The fact that there was a human,

01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:25.340
so they were thinking about autonomy,

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:27.940
whereas we were thinking about the mobility.

01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:32.380
And so, we've adjusted to a lot of things

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:36.260
that we see that people care about, trying to be honest.

01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.500
We've always tried to be honest.

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:42.540
But also just show cool stuff in this raw form,

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:44.220
the limits of the system,

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:46.700
the see the system be perturbed and be robust

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:49.100
and resilient and all that kind of stuff.

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.460
And dancing with some music.

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:57.740
Intrepidness and fun, so intrepid.

01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:00.460
It might be the most important ingredient.

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:03.380
And that is, robotics is hard.

01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:05.620
It's not gonna work right, right away.

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:08.420
So don't be discouraged is all it really means.

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:10.940
So usually when I talk about these things,

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:14.420
I show videos and I show a long string of outtakes.

01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:19.420
And you have to have courage to be intrepid

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:23.700
when you work so hard, you built your machine,

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:26.260
and then you're trying and it just doesn't do

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:29.460
what you thought it would do, what you want it to do.

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:34.460
And you have to stick to it and keep trying.

01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:38.180
How long, I mean, we don't often see that,

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.940
the story behind Spot and Atlas.

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.420
How many failures was there along the way

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:48.060
to get a working Atlas, a working Spot in the early days,

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.580
even working Big Dog?

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:53.220
There's a video of Atlas climbing three big steps.

01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.660
And it's very dynamic and it's really exciting,

01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:57.340
a real accomplishment.

01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:01.700
It took 109 tries and we have video of every one of them.

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:03.340
We shoot everything.

01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:05.460
Again, we, this is at Boston Dynamics.

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.940
So it took 109 tries.

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:13.500
But once it did it, it had a high percentage of success.

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.980
So it's not like we're cheating by just showing

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:19.940
the best one, but we do show the evolved performance,

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:21.740
not everything along the way.

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:23.740
But everything along the way is informative

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:28.740
and it shows sort of, there's stupid things that go wrong,

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.180
like the robot just, when you say go

01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:35.020
and it collapses right there on the start,

01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:37.780
that doesn't have to do with the steps.

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:39.460
Or the perception didn't work right,

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.260
so you miss the target when you jump,

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:44.460
or something breaks and there's oil flying everywhere.

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:46.740
But that's fun.

01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:50.260
Yeah, so the hardware failures and maybe some soft.

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:52.900
Lots of control of evolution during that time.

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:57.060
I think it took six weeks to get those 109 trials,

01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:00.500
because there was programming going on.

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.540
It was actually robot learning,

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.460
but there were humans in the loop helping with the learning.

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:08.940
So all data driven, but.

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:11.420
Okay, and so, and you always are learning

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:12.700
from that failure, so.

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:13.540
Right.

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:19.020
And how do you protect Atlas from not getting damaged

01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:22.260
from 109 attempts?

01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:25.380
It's remarkable.

01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:27.580
One of the accomplishments of Atlas

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:29.900
is that the engineers have made a machine

01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:33.380
that's robust enough that it can take that kind of testing

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:34.660
where it's falling and stuff.

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:36.140
And it doesn't break every time.

01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:37.580
It still breaks.

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:41.900
And part of the paradigm is to have people to repair stuff.

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:43.060
You gotta figure that in

01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:44.900
if you're gonna do this kind of work.

01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:48.460
I sometimes criticize the people

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:50.500
who have their gold plated thing

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.820
and they keep it on the shelf

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:54.180
and they're afraid to kind of use it.

01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:55.380
I don't think you can make progress

01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:56.980
if you're working that way.

01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:58.980
You need to be ready to have it break

01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:00.820
and go in there and fix it.

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:01.900
It's part of the thing.

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:04.740
Plan your budget so you have spare parts

01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.620
and a crew and all that stuff.

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:10.980
Yeah, if it falls 109 times, it's okay.

01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:11.820
Wow.

01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:14.940
So Intrepid, truly.

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:16.180
And that applies to Spot,

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:17.020
that applies to all the other.

01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:18.180
It applies to everything.

01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:20.180
I think it applies to everything anybody tries to do

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:21.380
that's worth doing.

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:24.740
And especially with systems in the real world, right?

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:25.900
Yeah.

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:27.060
And so fun.

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:31.460
Fun, technical fun, I usually say, have technical fun.

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:36.340
I think that life as an engineer is really satisfying.

01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:37.740
I think you get to,

01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:41.700
to some degree, it can be like craft's work

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.500
where you get to do things with your own hands

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.700
or your own design or whatever your media is.

01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:49.740
And it's very satisfying to be able to just do the work

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:53.140
unlike a lot of people who have to do something

01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:54.060
that they don't like doing.

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.140
I think engineers typically get to do something

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:59.940
that they like and there's a lot of satisfaction from that.

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:03.620
Then there's, in many cases,

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:07.100
you can have impact on the world somehow

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.820
because you've done something that other people admire,

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:13.540
which is different from the craft fun of building a thing.

01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:19.460
So that's the second way that being engineer is good.

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:22.140
I think the third thing is that if you're lucky

01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:25.540
to be working in a team where you're getting the benefit

01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:29.180
of other people's skills that are helping you do your thing,

01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:31.900
none of us has all the skills needed to do

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.540
most of these projects.

01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:37.660
And if you have a team where you're working well

01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:40.060
with the others, that can be very satisfying.

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:43.100
And then if you're an engineer, you also usually get paid.

01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:46.340
And so you kind of get paid four times

01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:47.900
in my view of the world.

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.500
So what could be better than that?

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:50.980
Get paid to have fun.

01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:53.340
I mean, what do you love about engineering?

01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:55.820
When you say engineering, what does that mean to you exactly?

01:14:55.820 --> 01:15:00.300
What is this kind of big thing that we call engineering?

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:03.420
I think it's both being a scientist

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:06.300
or getting to use science at the same time

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:08.420
as being kind of an artist or a creator,

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.740
because you're making some,

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:13.380
scientists only get to study what's out there

01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:16.660
and engineers get to make stuff that didn't exist before.

01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:18.780
And so it's really, I think, a higher calling,

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:20.540
even though I think most, you know,

01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:23.060
the public out there thinks science is top

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.700
and engineering is somehow secondary,

01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:26.580
but I think it's the other way around.

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:28.180
And at the cutting edge, I think,

01:15:28.180 --> 01:15:29.980
when you talk about robotics,

01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:34.500
there is a possibility to do art

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:37.380
in that you do like the first of its kind thing.

01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:39.860
So then there's the production at scale,

01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:41.260
which is it's own beautiful thing,

01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:44.620
but when you do the first new robot or the first new thing,

01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:47.540
that's the possibility to create something totally new.

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:48.380
That is art.

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:49.740
I mean, bringing metal to life

01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:52.700
or a machine to life is kind of, is fun.

01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:56.860
And, you know, it was fun doing the dancing videos

01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:00.300
where got a huge, you know, public response

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:01.300
and we're going to do more.

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:02.140
We're going to do some,

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:05.580
we're doing some at the Institute and we'll do more.

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:07.100
Well, that metal to life moment,

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.820
I mean, to me, that's still magical.

01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:13.820
Like when inanimate objects comes to life,

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:15.780
that's still like, to me,

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:18.060
it's to this day is still an incredible moment.

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:21.660
The human intelligence can create systems

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:25.980
that instill life or whatever that is

01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:27.660
into inanimate objects.

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:30.260
It's really, it's truly magical,

01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:32.620
especially when it's at the scale

01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:36.220
that humans can perceive and appreciate like directly.

01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:39.140
But I think sort of with it going back

01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.820
to the pieces of that,

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:42.720
you know, you design a linkage

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:45.160
that turns out to be half the weight

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:48.480
and just as strong, that's very satisfying.

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.280
And, you know, there are people who do that

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:53.600
and it's a creative act.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:58.000
What to you is the most beautiful about robotics?

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.440
Sorry for the big romantic question.

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.320
I think having the robots move in a way

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:08.320
that's evocative of life is pretty exciting.

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.600
So the elegance of movement.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.880
Yeah, or if it's a high performance act

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:16.120
where it's doing it faster, bigger than other robots.

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.400
Usually we're not doing it bigger, faster than people,

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:22.120
but we're getting there in a few narrow dimensions.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:27.120
So faster, bigger, smoother, more elegant, more graceful.

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:30.200
I mean, I'd like to do dancing that starts,

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.960
you know, we're nowhere near

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:34.800
the dancing capabilities of a human.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.760
We've been having a ballerina in

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:39.600
who's kind of a well-known ballerina

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.000
and she's been programming the robot.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.880
We've been working on the tools that can make it

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.400
so that she can use her way of talking,

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.480
you know, way of doing a choreography

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.400
or something like that, more accessible

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.480
to get the robot do things.

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:58.200
And starting to produce some interesting stuff.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.840
Well, we should mention that there is a choreography tool.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.240
There is.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:05.080
I mean, I guess I saw versions of it,

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:07.400
which is pretty cool.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:10.600
You can kind of, at slices of time,

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:13.280
control different parts at the high level,

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.040
the movement of the robot.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.520
We hope to take that forward and make it, you know,

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:21.880
more tuned to how the dance world wants to talk,

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:25.360
wants to communicate and get better performances.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:28.800
I mean, we've done a lot, but there's still a lot possible.

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.680
And I'd like to have performances

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:33.080
where the robots are dancing with people.

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:36.960
So right now, almost everything that we've done on dancing,

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:40.160
is to a fixed time base.

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.640
So once you press go, the robot does its thing

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:43.760
and plays its thing.

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:46.800
It's not listening, it's not watching,

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.960
but I think it should do those things.

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:53.360
I think I would love to see a professional ballerina,

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.960
like alone in a room with a robot,

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.680
slowly teaching the robot.

01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:00.000
Just actually the process of a clueless robot,

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.720
trying to figure out a small little piece of a dance.

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.600
So it's not like, because right now Atlas and Spot

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:10.760
have done like perfect dancing to a beat and so on,

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:13.120
one, you know, to a degree.

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:17.520
But like the learning process of interacting with a human

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.480
would be like incredible to watch.

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.040
One of the cool things going on,

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.880
you know that there's a class at Brown University

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.280
called Choreo Robotics.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:29.200
Sydney Skybetter is a dancer, choreographer,

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:32.280
and he teamed up with Stephanie Tellex,

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:34.320
who's a computer science professor.

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.680
And they taught this class,

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.600
I think they have some graduate students help them teach it,

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:41.880
where they have two spots and people come in.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:44.840
I think it's 50-50 of computer science people

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:46.240
and dance people.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:50.640
And they program performances that are very interesting.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.120
I show some of them sometimes when I give a talk.

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:55.480
And making that process of a human teaching the robot

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.640
more efficient, more intuitive,

01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:00.760
maybe language, part movement.

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.520
That'd be fascinating, that'd be really fascinating.

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:05.360
Because I mean, one of the things I've kind of realized

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:10.360
is humans communicate with movement a lot.

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:12.760
It's not just language.

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:14.240
There's a lot, there's body language.

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:16.640
There's so many intricate little things.

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:17.960
Totally.

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:20.240
And like that, you know,

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:23.560
to watch a human and a spot communicate back and forth

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:26.000
with movement is, I mean,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.760
there's just so many wonderful possibilities there.

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.640
But it's also a challenge, you know.

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:35.040
We get asked to have our robots perform

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:38.200
with famous dancers.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.120
And they can, you know,

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:42.760
they have 200 degrees of freedom or something, right?

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.800
Every little ripple and thing.

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:46.200
And they have all this head and neck

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.760
and shoulders and stuff.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:50.200
And the robots mostly don't have all that stuff.

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:55.200
And it's a daunting challenge to not look stupid,

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.640
you know, physically stupid next to them.

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:01.760
So we've pretty much avoided that kind of performance,

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:04.120
but we'll get to it.

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:06.040
I think even with the limited degrees of freedom,

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.400
we could still have some sass and flavor and so on.

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.840
You can figure out your own thing, even if you can't.

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:13.040
And we can reverse things.

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.240
Like if you watch a human do robot animation,

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.160
which is a dance style where, you know,

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:19.400
you jerk around sort of,

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:23.000
and you pop and pop and lock and all that stuff.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.480
I think the robots could show up the humans

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.960
by, you know, doing unstable oscillations

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:32.480
and things that are faster than a person could.

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:36.360
So that's sort of on my, you know, my plan,

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:39.000
but we haven't quite gotten there yet.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.800
You mentioned about building teams

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:42.240
and robotics teams and so on.

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.040
How do you find great engineers?

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:46.000
How do you hire great engineers?

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.560
I think you even need to have an environment

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:49.120
where interesting engineers,

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.240
well, you know, it's a chicken and egg.

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.120
If you have an environment

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.440
where interesting engineering is going on,

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.480
then engineers want to work there.

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:59.920
And, you know, I think it took a long time

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.760
to develop that at Boston Dynamics.

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:05.880
In fact, when we started, although, you know,

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.920
I had the experience of building things in the leg lab,

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.360
both at CMU and at MIT,

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:15.560
we weren't that sophisticated of an engineering thing

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:17.680
compared to what Boston Dynamics is now.

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:20.400
But it was our ambition to do that.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.960
And, you know, Sarcos was another robot company.

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:26.560
So I always thought of us as being

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:29.120
this much on the computing side

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:31.480
and this much on the hardware side.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:32.760
And they were like this.

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.040
And then over the years, we, you know,

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:41.040
I think we achieved the same or better levels of engineering.

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:43.040
Meanwhile, you know, Sarcos got acquired

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.880
and then they went through all kinds of changes.

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:48.420
And I don't know exactly what their current status is, but.

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:52.560
So it took many years is part of the answer.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.080
I think you get, you got to find people who love it.

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:59.120
In the early days, we paid a little less.

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.840
So we only got people who were doing it

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:03.200
because they really loved it.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.760
We also hired people who might not have professional degrees,

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.320
you know, people who were building bicycles

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:10.880
and building kayaks.

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:14.720
We have some people who come from that kind of the maker world.

01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:18.320
And that's really important for the kind of work we do

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.080
to have that be part of the mix.

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:23.040
Whatever that is, the, whatever the magic ingredient

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.200
that makes a great builder maker.

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.040
Yeah.

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:26.880
That's the big part of it.

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:29.480
People who took, who repaired the car, the cars

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:32.880
or built or motorcycles or whatever in their garages

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:33.960
when they were kids.

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.400
There's a kind of like the robotics students,

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:39.080
grad students and just roboticists that I know

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.400
and I hang out with.

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:45.280
There's a kind of endless energy and like,

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:47.080
there's just, they're just happy.

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:49.600
Like say, I compare it in another group of people

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:52.880
that are people that skydive professionally.

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:56.360
There's just like a excitement and general energy

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.440
that I think probably has to do with the fact

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:02.520
that they're just constantly, first of all, fail a lot.

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:05.040
And then the joy of building a thing

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.800
that you eventually works.

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.160
Yeah, talking about being happy,

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:10.360
there used to be a time when I was doing

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:13.400
the machine shop work myself back in those JPL

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:14.800
and Caltech days.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.800
When if I came home smelling like the machine shop,

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.280
you know, cause it's an oily place.

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:22.040
My wife would say, oh, you had a good day today.

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:24.440
Cause you could tell that that's where I've been.

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:27.280
You've done, you've actually built something.

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.480
You've done something in the physical world.

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.120
And probably the videos help, right?

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:35.480
The videos help show off what robotics is.

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:38.880
Oh, you know, at Boston Dynamics, it put us on the map.

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.840
We, I remember interviewing some sales guy

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:47.200
and he was from a company and he said, well,

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:48.520
no one's ever heard of my company,

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:52.760
but we have products, you know, really good products.

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:55.000
You guys, everybody knows who you are,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.280
but you don't have any products at all, which was true.

01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:01.360
So it was, and you know, we thank YouTube for that.

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.160
YouTube came, we caught the YouTube wave

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.800
and it had a huge impact on our company.

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:10.840
I mean, it's a big impact on not just in your company,

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:15.040
but on robotics in general and helping people understand,

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:18.440
inspire what is possible with robots.

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:21.480
Inspire imagination, fear and everything.

01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:24.080
The full spectrum of human emotion was aroused,

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.920
which is great, which is great for the entirety of humanity

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.920
and also is probably inspiring for young people

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.840
that want to get into AI and robotics.

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.480
Let me ask you about some competitors.

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:36.320
Sure.

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:38.000
You've been a complimentary of Elon

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.240
and Tesla's work on the Optimus robot,

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.400
with their humanoid robot.

01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.360
What do you think of their efforts there

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.560
with the humanoid robot?

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:52.640
You know, I really admire Elon as a technologist.

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.000
I think that what he did with Tesla

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.040
it was just totally mind boggling

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:01.960
that he could go from this totally niche area

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:06.800
that less than 1% of anybody seemed to be interested

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.760
to making it so that essentially every car company

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:13.440
in the world is trying to do what he's done.

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.920
So you got to give it to him.

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.360
Then look at SpaceX.

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:20.680
He's basically replaced NASA, if you could.

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:23.320
That might be a little exaggeration, but not by much.

01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.480
So you got to admire the guy

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:31.000
and I wouldn't count him out for anything.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.000
I don't think Optimus today is where Atlas is, for instance.

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:39.120
I don't know, it's a little hard to compare him

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:40.880
to the other companies.

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.360
You know, I visited Figure.

01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.960
I think they're doing well and they have a good team.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:52.760
I've visited Eptronic and I think they have a good team

01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:53.920
and they're doing well.

01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:58.120
But Elon has a lot of resources.

01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:00.960
He has a lot of ambition.

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:03.120
I'd like to take some credit for his ambition.

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:06.760
I think if I read between the lines,

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:10.360
it's hard not to think that him seeing what Atlas is doing

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.080
is a little bit of an inspiration.

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.400
I hope so.

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.960
Do you think Atlas and Optimus will hang out at some point?

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:18.000
I would love to host that.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.240
You know, now that I'm not at Boston Dynamics,

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:23.560
I'm not officially connected.

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:26.120
I am on the board, but I'm not officially connected.

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:27.760
I would love to host a-

01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:28.600
Robot meetups?

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:29.880
A road up meetup, yeah.

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.840
Does the AI Institute work with spots

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:36.880
and Atlas is it focused on spots mostly right now

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:37.720
as a platform?

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:39.040
We have a bunch of different robots.

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:40.600
We bought everything we could buy.

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:43.880
So we have spots.

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.600
I think we have a good size fleet in them.

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:47.800
I don't know how many it is, but a good size fleet.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:49.640
We have a couple of Animal robots.

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:53.400
You know, Animal is a company founded by Marco Hunter,

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:55.280
even though he's not that involved anymore,

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:56.800
but we have a couple of those.

01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:58.720
We have a bunch of arms like, you know,

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:02.120
Frank is and US Robotics.

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.120
Cause you know, even though we have ambitions

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.560
to build stuff and we are starting to build stuff,

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.400
you know, day one getting off the ground,

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.280
we just, you know, just bought stuff.

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:17.600
I love this like robot playground you've built.

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.200
You can come over and take a look if you want.

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.040
That's great.

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.400
So it's like all these kinds of robots,

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:23.360
legged, arms.

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:24.560
It doesn't feel that much like,

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.560
well, there's some areas that feel like a playground,

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:29.640
but it's not like they're all frolic together.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.640
Hey, again, maybe you'll arrange it, a robot meetup.

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:39.080
But in general, what's your view on competition

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.080
in this space for, especially like humanoid

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:42.320
and legged robots.

01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:45.160
Are you excited by the competition

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:46.880
or the friendly competition?

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:51.280
I think that it doesn't, you know,

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:54.880
I don't think about competition that much.

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:56.680
You know, I'm not a commercial guy.

01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:58.480
I think for many years at Boston,

01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:01.320
you know, the many years I was at Boston Dynamics,

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:02.840
we didn't think about competition.

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:04.400
We were just kind of doing our thing.

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:07.280
There wasn't like there were products out there

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:09.200
that we were competing with.

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:12.640
Maybe there was some competition for DARPA funding,

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:16.200
which we got a lot of, got very good at getting.

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:20.560
But even there, in a couple of cases

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:21.800
where we might've competed,

01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:24.520
we ended up just being the robot provider.

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:26.600
That is for the little dog program.

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:28.680
You know, we just made the robots.

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.880
We didn't participate as developers,

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:32.520
except for developing the robot.

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:36.840
And in the DARPA Robotics Challenge, we didn't compete.

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.920
We provided the robots.

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:43.760
So, you know, in the AI world now,

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.320
now that we're working on cognitive stuff,

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:47.920
it feels much more like a competition.

01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:52.320
You know, the entry requirements

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.640
in terms of computing hardware

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:58.160
and the skills of the team are,

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:02.280
and hiring talent, it's a much tougher place.

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.960
So I think much more about competition now

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:06.400
on the cognitive side.

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.480
On the physical side, it doesn't feel like

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:11.040
it's that much about competition yet.

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.160
Obviously with 10 humanoid companies out there,

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:15.320
10 or 12, I mean, there's probably others

01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:16.520
that I don't know about.

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:20.600
They're definitely in competition,

01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:22.200
will be in competition.

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:26.720
How much room is there for a quadruped

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:30.960
and especially a humanoid robot to become cheaper?

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:35.040
So like cutting costs and like how low can you go?

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:39.000
And how much of it is just mass production?

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.440
So questions of, you know, Hyundai,

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:46.200
like how to produce versus like engineering innovation,

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.920
how to simplify?

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.760
I think there's a huge way to go.

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.520
I don't think we've seen the bottom of it

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:53.760
or the bottom in terms of lower prices.

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:57.600
You know, I think you should be totally optimistic

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.600
that at Asymptote, things don't have to be anything

01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:02.880
like as expensive as they are now.

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:04.760
Back to competition, I wanted to say one thing.

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.560
I think in the quadruped space,

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:09.480
having other people selling quadrupeds

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:11.800
is a great thing for Boston Dynamics

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.440
because the question, I believe the question

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:17.520
in the user's minds is which quadruped do I want?

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:20.280
It's not, oh, can a quadruped, do I want a quadruped?

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:22.520
Can a quadruped do my job?

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:23.520
It's much more like that,

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:25.880
which is a great place for it to be.

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:29.400
Then you're just, you know, doing the things

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:31.320
that you normally do to make your product better

01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:34.800
and compete and selling and all that stuff.

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:37.320
And that'll be the way it is with humanoids at some point.

01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:40.280
Well, there's a lot of humanoids and you're just not even,

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:43.960
it's like iPhone versus Android

01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:46.760
and people are just buying both and it's kind of just.

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:47.840
Yeah.

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:48.680
You're not really.

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:50.440
You're creating the category,

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:52.680
or the category is happening.

01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.280
I mean, right now, the use cases, you know,

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:59.080
that's the key thing, having realistic use cases

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:03.600
that are money-making in robotics is a big challenge.

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.520
You know, there's the warehouse use case.

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:08.240
That's probably the only thing that makes anybody any money

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:09.960
in robotics at this point.

01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:11.360
There's gotta be a moment.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:12.360
There's old-fashioned robots.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.880
I mean, there's fixed arms doing manufacturing.

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:17.600
I don't wanna say that they're not making money.

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:20.800
Industrial robotics, yes, but there's gotta be a moment

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:23.360
when social robotics starts making real money,

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:26.200
meaning like a spa-type robot in the home

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:28.680
and there's tens of millions of them in the home

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:30.160
and they're like, you know,

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:31.000
I don't know how many dogs there are

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.760
in the United States as pets, but this feels.

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:34.600
Many.

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:35.440
Many.

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.720
It feels like there's something we love

01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:40.920
about having a intelligent companion with us

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:42.840
that remembers us, that's excited to see us,

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:44.080
all that kind of stuff.

01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:47.200
But it's also true that the company's making those things.

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:49.640
There've been a lot of failures in recent times, right?

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:53.000
There's that one year when I think three of them went under.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.200
So it's not that easy to do that, right?

01:32:56.200 --> 01:33:01.200
Getting performance, safety, and cost

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:04.600
all to be where they need to be at the same time is,

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:07.240
that's hard.

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:09.120
But also some of it is, like you said,

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:13.040
you can have a product, but people might not be aware of it.

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:14.960
So like also part of it is the videos

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:17.440
or however you connect with the public,

01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:20.920
the culture and create the category.

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:22.920
Make people realize this is the thing you want.

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:23.760
Because from, you know,

01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:25.840
there's a lot of negative perceptions you can have.

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.560
So if you really want a system with a camera

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:30.960
in your home walking around, right?

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.120
If it's presented correctly

01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:36.720
and if there's like the right kind of boundaries around it

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:38.760
that you understand how it works and so on,

01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:40.760
that a lot of people would want to.

01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:43.400
And if they don't, they might be suspicious of it.

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:45.040
So that's an important one.

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.520
Like we all use smartphones

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.960
and that has a camera that's looking at us.

01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:50.680
That has two or three or four.

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:51.520
And it's listening.

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:56.160
Very few people are, you know, suspicious about it.

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.000
They kind of take it for granted and so on.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
I think robots would be the same kind of way.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:00.840
I agree.

01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:06.920
So as you work on the cognitive aspect of these robots,

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:10.160
do you think we'll ever get to human level

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:11.840
or superhuman level intelligence?

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:16.600
There's been a lot of conversations about this recently

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:19.640
given the rapid development in large language models.

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:25.200
I think that intelligence is a lot of different things.

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.720
And I think some things,

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:29.080
computers are already smarter than people.

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:32.040
And some things, they're not even close.

01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:34.600
And, you know, I think you'd need a menu

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:39.600
of detailed categories to come up with that.

01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:45.360
But I also think that the conversation

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:49.320
that seems to be happening about AGI puzzles me.

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:52.480
It's sort of, so I ask you a question.

01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:55.600
Do you think there's anybody smarter than you in the world?

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:56.920
Absolutely, yes.

01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:58.280
Do you find that threatening?

01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:59.200
No.

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:02.640
So I don't understand even if computers

01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:04.160
were smarter than people,

01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:06.840
why we should assume that that's a threat.

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.520
Especially since they could easily be smarter

01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:13.680
but still available to us or under our control,

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:17.240
which is basically how computers generally are.

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:22.280
I think the fears that they would be 10X, 100X smarter

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:27.760
and operating under different morals and ethical codes

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:30.480
than humans naturally do.

01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:35.480
And so almost become misaligned in unintended ways

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:39.320
and therefore harm humans in ways we just can't predict.

01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:43.360
And even if we program them to do a thing,

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.440
as on the way of doing that thing,

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:47.160
they would cause a lot of harm.

01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:51.760
And when they're 100X, 1,000X, 10,000X smarter than us,

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:53.040
we won't be able to stop it

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:55.720
or we won't be able to even see the harm as it's happening

01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:57.520
until it's too late, that kind of stuff.

01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:01.200
So you can construct all kinds of possible trajectories

01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:04.480
of how the world ends because of super intelligent systems.

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:08.320
It's a little bit like that line in the Oppenheimer movie

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.600
where they contemplate whether the first time

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.400
they set off a reaction,

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:19.400
all matter on earth is gonna go up.

01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:22.000
I don't remember what the verb they used was

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.480
for the chain reaction, right?

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:30.200
Yeah, I guess it's possible,

01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:35.000
but I personally don't think it's worth worrying about that.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.920
I think that it's an opportunity,

01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:40.240
balancing opportunities and risk.

01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:42.320
I think if you take any technology,

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:44.840
there's opportunity and risk.

01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:47.080
And it's easy to, I'll point at the car.

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:53.240
They pollute and about 1.25 million people

01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:57.440
get killed every year around the world because of them.

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:01.880
Despite that, I think they're a boon to humankind,

01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:04.760
very useful, many of us love them.

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.400
And those technical problems can be solved.

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.360
I think they are becoming safer.

01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:11.920
I think they're becoming less polluting,

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:13.400
but at least some of them are.

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:17.520
And every technology you can name

01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:19.280
has a story like that in my opinion.

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:22.880
What's the story behind the Hawaiian shirt?

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:26.080
Is it a fashion statement, philosophical statement?

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:27.920
Is it just a statement of rebellion?

01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:31.480
Engineering statement?

01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:34.080
It was born of me being a contrarian.

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:36.160
Yes, it's a symbol.

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:40.080
Someone told me once that I was wearing one

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.840
when I only had one or two.

01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:44.640
And they said, oh, those things are so old fashioned,

01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:46.080
you can't wear that mark.

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:48.440
And I stopped wearing them for about a week.

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:52.520
And then I said, I'm not gonna let them tell me what to do.

01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:55.720
And so every day since pretty much,

01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:58.600
that was years ago, that was 20 years ago,

01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.480
15 years ago probably.

01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:02.040
That says something about your personality.

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:04.200
That's great, that's your nut.

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.480
It took me a while to realize I was a contrarian,

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.400
but it can be a useful tool.

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:12.240
Have you had people tell you on the robotic side

01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:14.920
that like, I don't think you could do this?

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:17.160
That kind of negative motivation.

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:23.600
I'd rather talk about, there's a guy,

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:25.000
when we were doing a lot of DARPA work,

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.480
there was a Marine, Ed Tovar, who's still around.

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:33.000
What he would always say is when someone would say,

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.440
oh, you can't do that, he'd say, why not?

01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:37.680
And it's a great question.

01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:39.880
I ask all the time when I'm thinking,

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:43.800
oh, we're not gonna do that, and I say, why not?

01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:48.800
And I give him credit for opening my eyes to resisting that.

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:52.400
So yeah, yeah, the Hawaiian shirt

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:55.120
is almost like a symbol of why not.

01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:59.480
Okay, what advice would you give to young folks

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:01.040
that are trying to figure out

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:02.520
what they wanna do with their life,

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.480
how to have a life they can be proud of,

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:06.560
they can have a career they can be proud of?

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:09.760
When I was teaching at MIT, for a while,

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:12.960
I had undergraduate advisees where people

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:17.160
would have to meet with me once a semester or something,

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:20.840
and they frequently would ask what they should do.

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:23.920
And I think the advice I used to give was something like,

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.320
well, if you had no constraints on you,

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:31.400
no resource constraints, no opportunity constraints,

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:35.440
and no skill constraints, what could you imagine doing?

01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:39.480
And I said, well, start there and see how close you can get,

01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:42.560
what's realistic for how close you can get.

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:45.280
The other version of that is try and figure out

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:47.040
what you wanna do and do that,

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:49.400
because I don't think, a lot of people think

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:50.640
that they're in a channel, right,

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:52.760
and there's only limited opportunities,

01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:56.880
but it's usually wider than they think.

01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:59.040
Yeah, the opportunities really are limitless,

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:04.040
but at the same time, you want to pick a thing, right?

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:09.520
And it's the diligence, and really, really pursue it, right?

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:10.840
Really pursue it.

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:16.680
Because sometimes the really special stuff happens

01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:18.200
after years of pursuit.

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:21.720
Yeah, oh, absolutely, it can take a while.

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:24.800
I mean, you've been doing this for 40 plus years.

01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:26.520
Some people think I'm in a rut, right?

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.360
Why don't I do?

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:31.760
And in fact, some of the inspiration for the AI Institute

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:35.320
is to say, okay, I've been working on locomotion

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:39.920
for however many years it was, let's do something else.

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:44.920
And it's a really fascinating and interesting challenge.

01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:47.640
And you're hoping to show it off also

01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:50.120
in the same way as we've done with Boston Dynamics?

01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:51.840
Just about to start showing some stuff off, yeah.

01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.360
I hope we have a YouTube channel.

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.040
I mean, one of the challenges is it's one thing

01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:59.080
to show athletic skills on YouTube.

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:02.560
Showing cognitive function is a lot harder,

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.560
and I haven't quite figured out yet

01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:05.600
how that's gonna work.

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:07.920
There might be a way.

01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:08.760
There's a way.

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:09.600
There's a way.

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:10.440
Why not?

01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:15.440
I also do think sucking at a task is also compelling.

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:19.080
Like the incremental improvement,

01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:21.560
a robot being really terrible at a task

01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:23.280
and then slowly becoming better.

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:25.320
Even in athletic intelligence, honestly,

01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:26.800
learning to walk and falling

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:29.240
and slowly figuring that out,

01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:32.440
I think there's something extremely compelling about that.

01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:35.440
We like flaws, especially with the cognitive task.

01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:36.560
It's okay to be clumsy.

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:39.640
It's okay to be confused and a little silly

01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:40.960
and all that kind of stuff.

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:45.240
It feels like in that space is where we can...

01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:46.240
There's charm.

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:47.080
There's charm.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.880
There's charm and there's something inspiring

01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:54.800
about a robot sucking and then becoming less terrible

01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:56.960
slowly at a task.

01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:57.960
I think you're right.

01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:01.080
That kind of reveals something about ourselves.

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:04.080
Ultimately, that's what's one of the coolest things

01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:05.720
about robots is it's kind of a mirror

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:08.840
about what makes humans special.

01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:11.960
Just by watching how hard it is to make a robot

01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:13.560
do the things that humans do,

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:15.120
you realize how special we are.

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:20.120
What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:21.040
Why are we here?

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:23.040
Mark?

01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:26.240
Do you ever ask about the big questions

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:28.720
as you try to create these humanoid,

01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:31.880
human-like intelligence systems?

01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:32.720
I don't know.

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:34.760
I think you have to have fun while you're here.

01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:36.040
That's about all I know.

01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:40.200
It would be a waste not to, right?

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:43.160
The ride is pretty short, so might as well have fun.

01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:47.080
Mark, I'm a huge fan of yours.

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:48.920
It's a huge honor that you would talk with me.

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:51.880
This is really amazing and your work for many decades

01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:52.880
has been amazing.

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:56.080
I can't wait to see what you do at the AI Institute.

01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:00.600
I'm gonna be waiting impatiently for the videos

01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:03.560
and the demos and the next robot meetup

01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:07.160
for maybe Atlas and Optimus to hang out.

01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:08.360
I would love to do that.

01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:09.480
That would be fun.

01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:10.800
Thank you so much for talking to me.

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:11.640
Thank you.

01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:13.240
It was fun talking to you.

01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:16.040
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Mark Riebert.

01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:18.640

01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:20.000

01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:21.760
And now, let me leave you with some words

01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.240
from Arthur C. Clarke.

01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:27.400
Whether we're based on carbon or on silicon

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.760
makes no fundamental difference.

01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:34.760
We should each be treated with appropriate respect.

01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:38.000
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
