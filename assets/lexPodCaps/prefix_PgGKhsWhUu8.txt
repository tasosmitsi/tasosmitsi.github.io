00:00.000 --> 00:01.520
The only person who can cause you more harm

00:01.520 --> 00:04.080
than a thief with a dagger is a journalist with a pen.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.160
The following is a conversation with Bill Ackman,

00:09.160 --> 00:12.080
a legendary activist investor who has been part

00:12.080 --> 00:15.240
of some of the biggest and at times controversial trades

00:15.240 --> 00:16.600
in history.

00:16.600 --> 00:21.360
Also, he is fearlessly vocal on X, FKA Twitter,

00:21.360 --> 00:25.360
and uses the platform to fight for ideas he believes in.

00:25.360 --> 00:29.040
For example, he was a central figure in the resignation

00:29.040 --> 00:32.760
of the president of Harvard University, Claudine Gay,

00:32.760 --> 00:35.720
the saga of which we discuss in this episode.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.800
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.240
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:41.240 --> 00:42.600
in the description.

00:42.600 --> 00:46.280
And now, dear friends, here's Bill Ackman.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.800
In your lecture on the basics of finance and investing,

00:49.800 --> 00:52.320
you mention a book, Intelligent Investor,

00:52.320 --> 00:56.120
by Benjamin Graham, as being formative in your life.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.600
What key lesson do you take away from that book,

00:59.120 --> 01:00.440
that informs your own investing?

01:00.440 --> 01:03.320
Sure, actually, it was the first investment book I read.

01:03.320 --> 01:06.360
And as such, it was kind of the inspiration for my career

01:06.360 --> 01:09.040
and a lot of my life, so important book.

01:09.040 --> 01:12.600
Bear in mind, this is sort of after the Great Depression,

01:12.600 --> 01:16.800
people lost confidence investing in markets, World War II.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.920
And then he writes this book, it's for like the average man.

01:19.920 --> 01:23.200
And basically, he says that you have to understand

01:23.200 --> 01:26.600
the difference between price and value, right?

01:26.600 --> 01:30.240
Price is what you pay, value is what you get.

01:30.240 --> 01:34.000
And he said the stock market is here to serve you, right?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.040
And it's a bit like the neighbor that comes by every day

01:36.040 --> 01:38.000
and makes you an offer for your house.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.760
Makes you a stupid offer, you ignore it.

01:40.760 --> 01:43.080
Makes you a great offer, you can take it.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.120
And that's the stock market.

01:44.120 --> 01:47.240
And the key is to figure out what something's worth,

01:47.240 --> 01:49.040
and you have to kind of weigh it.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.640
He talked about the difference between,

01:51.640 --> 01:53.480
you said the stock market in the short term

01:53.480 --> 01:54.560
is a voting machine.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.560
It represents speculative interests,

01:57.560 --> 02:00.360
supply and demand of people in the short term.

02:00.360 --> 02:03.360
But in the long term, the stock market's a weighing machine,

02:03.360 --> 02:04.720
much more accurate.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.400
It's gonna tell you what something's worth.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.240
And so if you can divine what something's worth,

02:09.240 --> 02:11.040
then you can really take advantage of the market

02:11.040 --> 02:13.080
because it's really here to help you.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.640
And that's kind of the message of the book.

02:14.640 --> 02:16.520
In that same way, there's a kind of difference

02:16.520 --> 02:18.960
between speculation and investing.

02:18.960 --> 02:22.520
Yeah, speculation is just, it's a bit like buying,

02:22.560 --> 02:25.120
trading crypto, right?

02:25.120 --> 02:25.960
Your-

02:25.960 --> 02:27.240
Strong words.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.960
Well, short-term trading crypto.

02:29.960 --> 02:31.760
Maybe in the long run, there's intrinsic value,

02:31.760 --> 02:36.760
but many investors in a bubble going into the crash

02:41.960 --> 02:43.360
were really just pure speculators.

02:43.360 --> 02:44.440
They didn't know what things were worth,

02:44.440 --> 02:46.240
they just knew they were going up, right?

02:46.240 --> 02:47.200
That's speculation.

02:47.200 --> 02:51.880
And investing is doing your homework,

02:52.840 --> 02:54.360
digging down, understanding a business,

02:54.360 --> 02:56.920
understanding the competitive dynamics of an industry,

02:56.920 --> 02:58.360
understanding what management's gonna do,

02:58.360 --> 03:00.040
understanding what price you're gonna pay.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.680
The value of anything, I would say,

03:03.680 --> 03:06.680
other than love, let's say, is the present value

03:06.680 --> 03:09.120
of the cash you can take out of it over its life.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.400
Now, some people think about love that way,

03:11.400 --> 03:13.680
but it's not the right way to think about love.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.400
But it's, yeah, so investing is about

03:16.440 --> 03:20.320
basically building a model of what this business

03:20.320 --> 03:22.320
is gonna produce over its lifetime.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.000
So how do you get to that,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.240
this idea of called value investing?

03:26.240 --> 03:28.360
How do you get to the value of a thing?

03:28.360 --> 03:31.000
Even like philosophically, value of anything, really,

03:31.000 --> 03:32.840
but we can just talk about the things

03:32.840 --> 03:35.400
that are on the stock market, companies.

03:35.400 --> 03:40.400
The value of a security is the present value of the cash

03:40.720 --> 03:43.520
you can take out of it over its life.

03:43.560 --> 03:44.760
If you think about a bond,

03:44.760 --> 03:48.320
a bond pays a 5% coupon interest rate.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.680
You get that, let's say, every year or twice a year,

03:50.680 --> 03:53.320
split in half, and it's very predictable.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.440
And if it's a U.S. government bond,

03:54.440 --> 03:55.280
you know you're gonna get it.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.240
So that's a pretty easy thing to value.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.600
A stock is an interest in a business.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.920
It's like owning a piece of a company.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.640
And a business, a profitable one, is like a bond

04:05.640 --> 04:08.760
in that it generates these coupons or these earnings

04:08.760 --> 04:11.360
or cash flow every year.

04:11.400 --> 04:14.200
The difference with a stock and a bond

04:14.200 --> 04:16.680
is that the bond, it's a contract.

04:16.680 --> 04:17.840
You know what you're gonna get

04:17.840 --> 04:20.600
as long as they don't go bankrupt and default.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.920
With a stock, you have to make predictions about the business.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.360
How many widgets are you gonna sell this year?

04:24.360 --> 04:26.680
How many are you gonna sell next year?

04:26.680 --> 04:27.920
What are the costs gonna be?

04:27.920 --> 04:29.520
How much of the money that they generate

04:29.520 --> 04:31.040
do they need to reinvest in the business

04:31.040 --> 04:32.400
to keep the business going?

04:33.280 --> 04:35.460
And that's more complicated.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.600
But what we do is we try to find businesses

04:39.600 --> 04:41.040
with a very high degree of confidence.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.360
We know what those cash flows are gonna be

04:43.360 --> 04:45.080
for a very long time.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.840
And there are a few businesses that you can have

04:46.840 --> 04:48.320
really high degree of certainty about.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.960
As a result, many investments are speculations

04:50.960 --> 04:54.040
because it's really very difficult to predict the future.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.720
So what we do for a living, what I do for a living,

04:56.720 --> 04:59.200
is find those rare companies that you can kind of predict

04:59.200 --> 05:01.560
what they're gonna look like over a very long period of time.

05:01.560 --> 05:06.280
So what are the factors that indicate

05:06.280 --> 05:08.680
that a company is something, is going to be something

05:08.680 --> 05:10.280
that's going to make a lot of money,

05:10.280 --> 05:11.840
it's gonna have a lot of value,

05:11.840 --> 05:15.040
and it's going to be reliable over a long period of time?

05:15.040 --> 05:17.040
And what is your process of figuring out

05:17.040 --> 05:18.840
whether a company is or isn't that?

05:19.720 --> 05:24.040
So every consumer has a view on different brands

05:24.040 --> 05:26.000
and different companies.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.280
And what we look for are sort of

05:28.280 --> 05:30.440
these non-disruptible businesses.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.380
A business where you can kind of close your eyes,

05:33.380 --> 05:35.680
stock market shuts for a decade,

05:35.680 --> 05:37.240
and you know that 10 years from now

05:37.240 --> 05:39.600
it's gonna be a more valuable, more profitable company.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.800
So we own a business called Universal Music Group.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.160
It's in the business of helping artists

05:45.160 --> 05:49.120
become global artists, sort of the recorded music business.

05:49.120 --> 05:52.840
And it's in the business of owning rights

05:52.840 --> 05:56.280
to sort of the music publishing rights of songwriters.

05:56.280 --> 05:59.280
And I think music is forever.

05:59.280 --> 06:04.280
Music is a many thousand year old part of the human experience

06:05.000 --> 06:08.400
and I think it will be thousands of years from now.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.800
So that's a pretty good backdrop to invest in a company.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.160
And the company basically owns

06:14.160 --> 06:16.960
a third of the global recorded music.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.680
That's the most dominant sort of market share

06:19.680 --> 06:20.760
in the business.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.000
They're the best at taking an artist

06:23.000 --> 06:24.760
who's 18 years old, who's got a great voice

06:24.760 --> 06:29.760
and has started to get a presence on YouTube and Instagram

06:30.240 --> 06:33.760
and helping that artist become a superstar.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.520
And that's a unique talent.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.640
And the result is the best artists in the world

06:37.640 --> 06:39.200
want to come work for them.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.400
But they also have this incredible library of the Beatles,

06:42.400 --> 06:45.080
the Rolling Stones, YouTube, et cetera.

06:45.080 --> 06:49.240
So, and then if you think about what music has become,

06:49.240 --> 06:53.680
used to be about records and CDs and eight track tapes

06:53.680 --> 06:56.040
for those of whom, and it was about a new format

06:56.040 --> 06:57.840
and that's how they drive sales.

06:57.840 --> 06:58.920
And it's become a business,

06:58.920 --> 07:01.960
which is like the podcast business about streaming.

07:01.960 --> 07:05.080
And you can, streaming is a lot more predictable

07:05.080 --> 07:06.920
than selling records, right?

07:06.920 --> 07:10.520
You can sort of say, okay, how many people have smartphones?

07:10.520 --> 07:12.160
How many people are gonna have smartphones next year?

07:12.160 --> 07:13.920
There's a kind of global penetration

07:13.920 --> 07:15.800
over time of smartphones.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.000
You pay, call it 10, 11 bucks a month for a subscription

07:19.000 --> 07:21.280
or last for a family plan.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.200
And you can kind of build a model

07:23.200 --> 07:25.720
of what the world looks like and predict,

07:25.720 --> 07:27.560
the growth of the streaming business.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.520
You predict what kind of market share Universal

07:29.520 --> 07:31.120
is gonna have over time.

07:31.120 --> 07:34.060
And you can't get to a precise view of value.

07:34.060 --> 07:35.560
You can get to an approximation.

07:35.560 --> 07:38.080
And the key is to buy at a price

07:38.080 --> 07:40.800
that represents a big discount to that approximation.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.120
And that gets back to Ben Graham.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.960
Ben Graham was about what he called,

07:43.960 --> 07:47.120
invented this concept of margin of safety, right?

07:47.120 --> 07:49.720
You wanna buy a company at a price

07:49.720 --> 07:52.160
that if you're wrong about what you think it's worth,

07:52.160 --> 07:54.600
and it turns out to be worth 30% less,

07:54.600 --> 07:57.440
you paid a deep enough discount to your estimate

07:57.440 --> 07:58.920
that you're still okay.

07:58.920 --> 07:59.960
It's about investing.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.640
A big part of investing is not losing money.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.000
If you can avoid losing money

08:05.000 --> 08:07.400
and then have a few great hits,

08:07.400 --> 08:09.400
you can do very, very well over time.

08:09.400 --> 08:10.480
Well, music is interesting

08:10.480 --> 08:13.600
because yes, music's been around for a very long time,

08:13.600 --> 08:16.500
but the way to make money from music has been evolving.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.880
Like you mentioned streaming,

08:17.880 --> 08:21.520
there's a big transition initiated by, I guess, Napster

08:21.520 --> 08:26.280
that created Spotify of how you make money on music

08:26.280 --> 08:28.880
with Apple and with all of this.

08:28.880 --> 08:33.160
And the question is how well are companies like UMG

08:33.160 --> 08:35.840
able to adjust to such transformations?

08:35.840 --> 08:38.560
One, I could ask you about the future,

08:38.560 --> 08:40.880
which is artificial intelligence,

08:40.880 --> 08:43.160
being able to generate music, for example,

08:43.160 --> 08:46.240
which there have been a lot of amazing advancements with.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.400
So do you have to also think about that?

08:48.400 --> 08:51.460
When you close your eyes, all the things you think about,

08:51.460 --> 08:53.140
are you imagining the possible ways

08:53.140 --> 08:57.040
that the future's completely different from the present

08:57.040 --> 08:58.560
and how well this company will be able

08:58.560 --> 09:00.680
to surf the wave of that?

09:00.680 --> 09:02.420
Sure, and they've had to surf a lot of waves.

09:02.420 --> 09:04.980
And actually the music business peaked the last time

09:04.980 --> 09:08.340
in like the late 90s or 2000 timeframe.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.060
And then really innovation, Napster,

09:10.060 --> 09:13.240
digitization of music almost killed the industry.

09:13.240 --> 09:17.060
And Universal really led an effort to save the industry

09:17.060 --> 09:20.160
and actually made an early deal with Spotify

09:20.160 --> 09:23.380
that enabled the industry to really recover.

09:23.380 --> 09:25.060
And so by virtue of their market position

09:25.060 --> 09:27.140
and their credibility and their willingness

09:27.140 --> 09:29.260
to kind of adopt new technologies,

09:29.260 --> 09:30.240
they've kept their position.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.260
Now they of course had this huge advantage

09:32.260 --> 09:33.740
because I think the Beatles are forever.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.100
I think U2 is forever.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.260
I think Rolling Stones are forever.

09:37.260 --> 09:41.740
So they had a nice base of assets that were important

09:41.740 --> 09:44.420
and I think will forever be, and forever is a long time.

09:44.420 --> 09:48.660
But again, there's enormous,

09:48.660 --> 09:50.340
there are all kinds of risks in every business.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.900
This is one that I think has a very high degree

09:51.900 --> 09:55.540
of persistence and I can't envision a world

09:55.540 --> 09:57.940
where beyond streaming in a sense.

09:57.940 --> 10:00.860
Now you may have a Neuralink chip in your head

10:01.260 --> 10:02.780
instead of a phone,

10:02.780 --> 10:06.100
but the music can come in a digitized format.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.060
You're gonna wanna have an infinite library

10:08.060 --> 10:10.780
that you can walk around in your pocket or in your brain.

10:10.780 --> 10:13.420
It's not gonna matter that much of the form factor.

10:13.420 --> 10:15.220
The device changes.

10:15.220 --> 10:16.560
It's not really that important,

10:16.560 --> 10:19.340
whether it's Spotify or Apple or Amazon

10:19.340 --> 10:23.020
that are the so-called DSPs or the providers.

10:23.880 --> 10:28.880
I think the values really can reside in the content owners

10:29.720 --> 10:32.920
and that's really the artists and the label.

10:32.920 --> 10:36.560
And I actually think AI is not going to be

10:36.560 --> 10:38.120
the primary creator of music.

10:38.120 --> 10:41.980
I think we're going to actually face the reality

10:41.980 --> 10:45.040
that it's not that music has been around

10:45.040 --> 10:47.480
for thousands of years,

10:47.480 --> 10:51.040
but musicians and music has been around.

10:51.040 --> 10:54.420
We actually care to know who's the musician that created it.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.760
Just like we wanna know who's the artist,

10:56.760 --> 10:59.000
human artist that created a piece of art.

10:59.000 --> 10:59.840
I totally agree.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.160
And I think if you think about it,

11:01.160 --> 11:05.040
there's lots of other technologies and computers

11:05.040 --> 11:07.600
that have been used to generate music over time,

11:07.600 --> 11:08.720
but no one wants to,

11:08.720 --> 11:13.880
no one falls in love with a computer generated track, right?

11:13.880 --> 11:17.120
And Taylor Swift, incredible music,

11:17.120 --> 11:19.960
but it's also about the artist and her story

11:19.960 --> 11:24.960
and her physical presence and the live experience.

11:25.320 --> 11:27.080
I don't think you're gonna sit there

11:27.080 --> 11:29.280
and someone's gonna put computer up on stage

11:29.280 --> 11:31.040
and then it's gonna play

11:31.040 --> 11:32.320
and people are gonna get excited around it.

11:32.320 --> 11:35.500
So I think AI is really gonna be a tool

11:35.500 --> 11:38.740
to make artists better artists.

11:38.740 --> 11:43.660
And I think like a synthesizer, right?

11:43.660 --> 11:46.140
Really created the opportunity for one man

11:46.140 --> 11:47.140
to have an orchestra.

11:48.720 --> 11:53.400
Maybe a bit of a threat to a percussionist, but maybe not.

11:53.400 --> 11:57.280
Maybe it drove even more demand for the live experience.

11:57.280 --> 12:01.520
Unless that computer has human-like sentience,

12:01.520 --> 12:03.860
which I believe is a real possibility,

12:03.860 --> 12:06.480
but then it's really from a business perspective,

12:06.480 --> 12:07.720
no different than a human.

12:07.720 --> 12:11.320
If it has an identity that's basically fame and influence

12:11.320 --> 12:13.680
and there'd be a robot, Taylor Swift,

12:13.680 --> 12:14.520
and it doesn't really matter.

12:14.520 --> 12:17.120
That's a copyrightable asset, I would think.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.520
Right, yeah.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.360
And then there'll be-

12:19.360 --> 12:21.000
I'm not sure that's the world I'm excited about.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.400
That's a different discussion.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.000
The world is not gonna ask your permission

12:25.000 --> 12:26.200
to become what it's becoming.

12:26.200 --> 12:29.320
So, but you can still make money on it.

12:29.320 --> 12:30.920
Presumably there'd be a capital system

12:30.920 --> 12:33.560
and there'd be some laws under which AI,

12:33.560 --> 12:36.120
which I believe AI systems will have rights

12:36.120 --> 12:37.920
that are akin to human rights.

12:37.920 --> 12:40.760
And we're gonna have to contend with what that means.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.640
Well, there's sort of name and likeness rights

12:43.640 --> 12:44.720
that have to be protected.

12:44.720 --> 12:49.040
Now, can a name be attributed to a Tesla robot?

12:49.040 --> 12:50.620
I don't know.

12:50.620 --> 12:51.460
I think so.

12:51.460 --> 12:52.760
I think it's quite obvious to me.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.440
Okay, so those are more potential artists

12:54.440 --> 12:55.560
for us to represent at Universal.

12:55.560 --> 12:56.920
Exactly, exactly.

12:56.920 --> 12:57.760
All right.

12:57.760 --> 12:58.580
That's sort of one example.

12:58.580 --> 13:00.480
Another example could be just the restaurant industry, right?

13:00.480 --> 13:03.920
If you look at businesses like McDonald's, right?

13:03.920 --> 13:06.880
It's a whatever, the company's like a 1950

13:06.880 --> 13:10.480
vintage business and here we are, it's 75 years later.

13:10.480 --> 13:12.360
And you can kind of predict

13:12.360 --> 13:13.880
what it's gonna look like over time.

13:13.880 --> 13:17.680
And the menu's gonna adjust over time to consumer tastes.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.480
But I think the hamburger and fries is probably forever.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.080
The Beatles, the Rolling Stones,

13:23.080 --> 13:25.120
the hamburger and fries are forever.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.840
I was eating at Chipotle last night

13:27.840 --> 13:29.960
as I was preparing these notes.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.200
Thank you.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.040
Thank you.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.600
And yeah, it is one of my favorite places to eat.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.920
You said it is a place that you eat.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.740
You obviously also invest in it.

13:39.780 --> 13:41.480
What do you get at Chipotle?

13:41.480 --> 13:43.360
I tend to get a double chicken.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.360
Bowl or burrito?

13:45.360 --> 13:46.200
I like the burrito,

13:46.200 --> 13:48.680
but I generally try to order the bowl.

13:48.680 --> 13:49.520
Yeah.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.080
For health reasons, all right.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.920
And double chicken, guac, lettuce, black beans.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.240
And I'm more of a steak guy,

13:57.240 --> 13:59.240
just putting that on the record.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.320
What's the actual process you go through?

14:03.320 --> 14:08.200
Like literally, like the process of figuring out

14:08.200 --> 14:10.160
what the value of a company is.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.400
Like how do you do the research?

14:12.400 --> 14:13.720
Is it reading documents?

14:13.720 --> 14:15.320
Is it talking to people?

14:15.320 --> 14:16.200
How do you do it?

14:16.200 --> 14:17.120
It's all of the above.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.080
So Chipotle, what attracted us initially

14:19.560 --> 14:22.600
is the stock price dropped by about 50%.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.360
Great company, great concept.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.680
Athletes love it, consumers love it.

14:28.680 --> 14:32.440
Healthy, sustainable, fresh food made in front of your eyes.

14:32.440 --> 14:36.760
And great, Steve Ells, the founder, did an amazing job.

14:36.760 --> 14:40.080
But ultimately, the company's lacking some of the systems

14:40.080 --> 14:42.180
and had a food safety issue.

14:42.180 --> 14:44.380
Consumers got sick, almost killed their rent.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.920
But the reality of the fast food, quick service industry

14:49.760 --> 14:51.320
is almost every fast food company

14:51.320 --> 14:53.840
has had a food safety issue over time.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.200
And the vast majority have survived.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.520
And we said, look, such a great concept.

14:58.520 --> 15:02.280
But their approach was not as far from ideal.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.080
But we start with usually reading the SEC filing.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.720
So the companies file a 10K or an annual report.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.160
They file these quarterly reports called 10Qs.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.080
They have a proxy statement,

15:11.080 --> 15:14.120
which describes kind of the governance, the board structure.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.720
Conference call transcripts are publicly available.

15:16.720 --> 15:19.320
It's kind of very helpful to go back five years

15:19.320 --> 15:20.620
and kind of learn the story.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.280
Here's how management describes their business.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.840
Here's what they say they're gonna do.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.080
Then you can follow along to see what they do.

15:27.080 --> 15:31.560
It's like a historical record of how competent

15:31.560 --> 15:34.000
and truthful they are.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.520
It's a very useful device.

15:35.520 --> 15:38.520
And then of course, looking at competitors

15:38.520 --> 15:42.120
and thinking about what could dislodge this company.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.520
And then we'll talk to, if it's an industry

15:47.200 --> 15:49.080
we know the restaurant industry really well.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.320
Music industry, we'll talk to people in the industry.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.720
We'll try to understand the difference

15:53.720 --> 15:55.340
between publishing and recorded music.

15:55.340 --> 15:56.800
We'll look at the competitors.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.560
We'll talk to, we'll read books.

15:59.560 --> 16:01.480
I read a book about the music industry

16:01.480 --> 16:03.480
or a couple of books about the industry.

16:04.640 --> 16:07.840
So it's a bit like a big research project.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.840
And there are these so-called expert networks now.

16:10.840 --> 16:13.120
And you can get pretty much anyone on the phone.

16:13.120 --> 16:16.240
And they'll talk to you about an aspect of the industry

16:16.240 --> 16:19.520
that you don't understand and wanna learn more about.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.000
Try to get a sense, public filings of companies

16:22.000 --> 16:23.640
generally give you a lot of information

16:23.640 --> 16:25.320
but not everything you wanna know.

16:25.320 --> 16:27.240
And you can learn more by talking to experts

16:27.240 --> 16:31.000
about some of the industry dynamics, the personalities.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.960
You wanna get a sense of management.

16:32.960 --> 16:35.840
I like watching podcasts.

16:35.840 --> 16:38.240
If a CEO were to do a podcast or a YouTube interview

16:38.240 --> 16:40.040
you get a sense of the people.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.480
So in the case of Chipotle, for example

16:41.480 --> 16:43.240
by the way, I could talk about Chipotle all day.

16:43.240 --> 16:44.080
I just love it.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.040
I love it.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.440
I wish there was a sponsor.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.000
I'll mention it to the CEO.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.960
Don't make promises you can't keep, Bill.

16:51.960 --> 16:55.280
I'm not making, Brian Nichols is a fantastic CEO.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.520
He's not gonna spend $1

16:56.520 --> 16:58.200
that he doesn't think is the company's best interest.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.800
All right, all I want is free Chipotle, come on now.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.000
What was I saying?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.720
And so you look at a company like Chipotle

17:06.720 --> 17:09.720
and then you see there's a difficult moment in its history

17:09.720 --> 17:12.680
like you said that there was a food safety issue.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.560
And then you say, okay, well I see a path

17:15.240 --> 17:17.840
where we can fix this and therefore

17:17.840 --> 17:20.440
even though the price is low, we can get it

17:20.440 --> 17:23.160
to where the price goes up to its value.

17:24.120 --> 17:27.080
So the kind of business we're looking for

17:27.080 --> 17:28.400
is sort of the kind of business

17:28.400 --> 17:29.880
everyone should be looking for, right?

17:29.880 --> 17:32.720
A great business, it's got a long-term trajectory

17:32.720 --> 17:35.560
of growth out into the force, you know

17:35.560 --> 17:37.440
even beyond the foreseeable distance, right?

17:37.440 --> 17:38.760
Those are the kind of businesses you wanna own.

17:38.760 --> 17:41.040
You want businesses that generate a lot of cash.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.240
You want businesses you can easily understand.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.200
You want businesses with these sort of huge barriers

17:45.200 --> 17:47.560
to entry where it's difficult for others to compete.

17:47.560 --> 17:48.560
You want companies that don't have

17:48.560 --> 17:50.840
to constantly raise capital.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.800
And these are some of the great business of the world

17:52.800 --> 17:53.960
but people have figured out

17:53.960 --> 17:55.200
that those are the great businesses.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.040
So the problem is those companies tend

17:57.040 --> 17:58.600
to have very high stock prices

17:58.600 --> 18:01.800
and the value is generally built into the price

18:01.800 --> 18:02.640
you have to pay for the business.

18:02.640 --> 18:06.560
So we can't earn the kind of returns we wanna earn

18:06.560 --> 18:08.960
for investors by paying a really high price.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.160
Price matters a lot.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.480
You can buy the best business in the world

18:11.480 --> 18:14.080
and if you overpay, you're not gonna earn

18:14.080 --> 18:16.240
particularly attractive returns.

18:16.240 --> 18:19.600
So we get involved in cases where a great business

18:19.600 --> 18:22.280
has kind of made a big mistake

18:22.280 --> 18:25.480
or you've a company that's kind of lost its way

18:25.480 --> 18:28.880
but it's recoverable and that's we buy from shareholders

18:28.880 --> 18:31.440
who are disappointed, who've lost confidence

18:31.440 --> 18:34.280
selling at a low price relative to what it's worth

18:34.280 --> 18:36.640
if fixed and then we try to be helpful

18:36.640 --> 18:37.840
in fixing the company.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.960
You said that barriers to entry,

18:41.960 --> 18:45.320
you said a lot of really interesting qualities

18:45.320 --> 18:48.720
of companies very quickly in a sequence of statements

18:48.720 --> 18:51.240
that took like less than 10 seconds to say

18:51.240 --> 18:52.800
but some of them were fascinating,

18:52.800 --> 18:53.840
all of them were fascinating.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.880
So you said barriers to entry.

18:55.880 --> 18:59.280
How do you know if there's a type of moat

18:59.280 --> 19:04.280
protecting the competitors from stepping up to the plate?

19:04.640 --> 19:07.720
The most difficult analysis to do as an investor

19:07.760 --> 19:11.520
is that, is kind of figuring out how wide is the moat,

19:11.520 --> 19:16.080
how much at risk is the business to disruption

19:16.080 --> 19:17.720
and we're in, I would say a period,

19:17.720 --> 19:21.200
the greatest period of disruptability in history, right?

19:21.200 --> 19:25.880
Technology, a couple of 19 year olds can leave

19:25.880 --> 19:27.600
whatever university or maybe they didn't go

19:27.600 --> 19:32.200
in the first place, they can raise millions of dollars,

19:32.200 --> 19:36.120
they can get access to infinite bandwidth storage,

19:36.160 --> 19:38.800
they can contract with engineers

19:38.800 --> 19:42.000
in low cost markets around the world,

19:42.000 --> 19:43.840
they could build a virtual company

19:43.840 --> 19:45.160
and they can disrupt businesses

19:45.160 --> 19:47.360
that seem super established over time

19:47.360 --> 19:50.000
and then on top of that you have major companies

19:50.000 --> 19:52.400
with multi-trillion dollar market caps

19:52.400 --> 19:54.960
working to find profits wherever they can

19:54.960 --> 19:58.440
and so that's a dangerous world in a way to be an investor

19:58.440 --> 20:01.040
and so you wanna, you have to find businesses

20:01.040 --> 20:03.840
that it's hard to foresee a world

20:03.840 --> 20:04.840
in which they get disrupted

20:04.840 --> 20:06.400
and the beauty of the restaurant business

20:06.400 --> 20:09.080
and we've actually, our best track record is in restaurants,

20:09.080 --> 20:12.320
we've never lost money, we've only made a fortune,

20:12.320 --> 20:14.280
interestingly, investing in restaurants,

20:14.280 --> 20:16.440
a big part of it's a really simple business

20:16.440 --> 20:21.160
and if you get Chipotle right and you're at 100 stores,

20:21.160 --> 20:23.920
it's not so hard to envision getting to 200 stores

20:23.920 --> 20:26.000
and then getting to 500 stores, right?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.560
And the key is maintaining the brand image,

20:28.560 --> 20:32.240
growing intelligently, having the right systems,

20:32.280 --> 20:36.000
and when you go from 100 stores to 3,500 stores,

20:36.000 --> 20:37.160
you have to know what you're doing

20:37.160 --> 20:38.920
and there's a lot of complexity, right?

20:38.920 --> 20:41.240
If you think about your local restaurant,

20:42.440 --> 20:44.280
the family's working in the business,

20:44.280 --> 20:46.720
they're watching the cash register

20:46.720 --> 20:51.160
and you can probably open another restaurant across town

20:51.160 --> 20:52.960
but there are very few restaurant operators

20:52.960 --> 20:54.680
that own more than a few restaurants

20:54.680 --> 20:56.000
and operate them successfully

20:56.000 --> 20:59.200
and the quick service business is about systems

20:59.200 --> 21:02.720
and building a model that a stranger

21:02.720 --> 21:05.000
who doesn't know the restaurant industry can come in

21:05.000 --> 21:09.600
and enter the business and build a successful franchise.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.160
Now, Chipotle is not a franchise company,

21:11.160 --> 21:12.840
they actually own all their own stores

21:12.840 --> 21:14.600
but many of the most successful restaurant companies

21:14.600 --> 21:17.600
are franchise models like a Burger King, a McDonald's,

21:17.600 --> 21:20.720
Tim Hortons, you know, all these various brands, Popeyes

21:20.720 --> 21:22.080
and there it's about systems

21:22.080 --> 21:25.360
but the same systems apply whether you own all the stores

21:25.360 --> 21:26.840
and it's run by a big corporation

21:26.840 --> 21:29.120
or whether the owners of the restaurants

21:29.120 --> 21:32.200
are sort of franchisees, you know, local entrepreneurs.

21:32.200 --> 21:35.120
So if the restaurant has scaled to a certain number

21:35.120 --> 21:37.600
that means they've figured out some kind of system

21:37.600 --> 21:39.320
that works and it's very difficult to develop

21:39.320 --> 21:41.520
that kind of system, so that's a moat.

21:41.520 --> 21:44.000
A moat is you get to a certain scale

21:44.000 --> 21:45.600
and you do it successfully

21:45.600 --> 21:50.120
and the brand is now understood by the consumer

21:50.120 --> 21:51.840
and what's interesting about Chipotle

21:51.840 --> 21:54.800
is what they've achieved is difficult, right?

21:54.800 --> 21:57.680
They're not buying frozen hamburgers getting shipped in,

21:57.680 --> 21:59.520
they're buying fresh, you know,

21:59.520 --> 22:01.640
sustainably sourced ingredients

22:01.640 --> 22:04.440
and preparing food in the store, that was a first, right?

22:04.440 --> 22:06.960
The quality of the product at Chipotle is incredible.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.320
It's the highest quality food you can get for,

22:09.320 --> 22:12.600
you can get a serious dinner for under 20 bucks

22:12.600 --> 22:14.800
and eat really healthfully

22:14.800 --> 22:18.040
and very high quality ingredients

22:18.040 --> 22:19.920
and that's just not available anywhere else

22:19.920 --> 22:21.160
and it's very hard to replicate

22:21.160 --> 22:22.400
and to build those relationships

22:22.400 --> 22:24.720
with, you know, farmers around the country.

22:25.640 --> 22:26.960
It's a lot easier to make a deal

22:26.960 --> 22:30.400
with one of the big, you know, massive food producers

22:30.400 --> 22:32.240
and buy your pork from them

22:32.240 --> 22:34.520
than to buy from a whole bunch of farmers around the country

22:34.520 --> 22:37.760
and so it's, that is a big moat for Chipotle,

22:37.760 --> 22:39.320
very difficult to replicate.

22:39.320 --> 22:40.640
And by the way, another company

22:40.640 --> 22:43.160
I think you have a stake in is McDonald's?

22:43.160 --> 22:45.480
No, we own a company called Restaurant Brands.

22:45.480 --> 22:48.120
Restaurant Brands owns a number of quick service companies,

22:48.120 --> 22:49.600
one of which is Burger King.

22:49.600 --> 22:53.040
Burger King, okay, well, it's been a meme for a while,

22:53.080 --> 22:55.400
Burger King is great too, Wendy's, whatever,

22:55.400 --> 22:57.280
but usually they go McDonald's.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.840
I'll just eat burger patties.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.440
I don't know if you knew you could do this,

23:00.440 --> 23:03.480
but a burger patty at Burger King can do this,

23:03.480 --> 23:05.560
McDonald's, it's actually way cheaper.

23:05.560 --> 23:06.400
They'll just sell you the patty.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.760
The patty, and it's cheap.

23:07.760 --> 23:10.880
It's like $1.50 or $2 per patty

23:10.880 --> 23:14.200
and it's about 250 calories and it's just meat

23:14.200 --> 23:17.280
and despite like the criticism of memes out there,

23:17.280 --> 23:18.480
that's-

23:18.480 --> 23:19.320
Pretty healthy stuff.

23:19.320 --> 23:22.000
It's healthy stuff and so when I go,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.760
the healthiest I feel is when I do carnivore.

23:24.760 --> 23:25.800
It doesn't sound healthy,

23:25.800 --> 23:28.120
but if I eat only meat, I feel really good.

23:28.120 --> 23:30.880
I lose weight, I have all this energy, it's crazy

23:30.880 --> 23:34.160
and when I'm traveling, the easiest way to get meat is that-

23:34.160 --> 23:35.880
So you go to McDonald's, you order six patties.

23:35.880 --> 23:38.320
Exactly, so there's this sad meme

23:38.320 --> 23:40.760
of me just sitting alone in a car when I'm traveling,

23:40.760 --> 23:42.680
just eating beef patties at McDonald's,

23:42.680 --> 23:44.920
but I love it and you gotta do what you love,

23:44.920 --> 23:46.480
what makes you happy and that's what makes me happy.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.680
Okay, we should maybe, we'll have Burger King feature in it.

23:48.680 --> 23:49.920
What about flame broiled?

23:49.920 --> 23:51.000
What's with these fried burgers?

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
We gotta get you to Burger King grilled burgers.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.160
Wait, is this like fast food trash?

23:56.160 --> 23:58.560
I didn't know, I don't know the details of how they're made.

23:58.560 --> 24:00.400
I'm not, I don't have allegiance to McDonald's.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.320
I think we got a chance to switch you to Burger King.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.640
Great, we'll see.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.840
I'm making so many deals today, it's wonderful.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.520
Okay, you were talking about most

24:09.520 --> 24:13.160
and this kind of remind me of Alphabet, the parent company.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.800
Sure, it's a big position for us.

24:15.800 --> 24:19.360
So it's interesting that you think

24:19.360 --> 24:24.160
that maybe Alphabet fits some of these characteristics.

24:25.320 --> 24:29.640
It's tricky to know with everything that's happening in AI

24:29.640 --> 24:31.960
and I'm interviewing Sundar Pichai soon.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.960
It's interesting that you think that there's a moat

24:33.960 --> 24:35.600
and it's also interesting to analyze it

24:35.600 --> 24:38.440
because the consumer is just a fan of technology.

24:38.440 --> 24:40.520
Why is Google still around?

24:40.520 --> 24:43.480
Like they've been, it's not just the search engine

24:43.480 --> 24:47.600
is doing it all, the basics of the business of search

24:47.600 --> 24:49.280
really well, but they're doing all these other stuff.

24:50.200 --> 24:51.800
What's your analysis of Alphabet?

24:51.800 --> 24:53.320
Why are you still positive about it?

24:53.320 --> 24:56.760
Sure, so it's a business we've admired as a firm

24:56.760 --> 25:01.760
for whatever, 15 years, but rarely got to a price

25:02.720 --> 25:04.160
that we felt we could own it because again,

25:04.160 --> 25:07.440
the expectations were so high and price really matters.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.080
Really the sort of AI scare, I would call it.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.480
Microsoft comes out with chat GPT.

25:12.480 --> 25:13.960
They do an amazing demonstration.

25:13.960 --> 25:16.120
People like this most incredible product

25:16.120 --> 25:19.000
and Google, which had been working on AI even earlier,

25:19.720 --> 25:21.360
Microsoft was behind in AI.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.520
That was really their chat GPT deal

25:23.520 --> 25:25.760
that gave them a kind of a market presence.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.720
And then Google does this fairly disastrous

25:30.720 --> 25:33.400
demonstration of Bard and the world says,

25:33.400 --> 25:35.600
oh my God, Google's fallen behind in AI.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.160
AI is the future, stock gets crushed.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.840
Google gets to a price around 15 times earnings,

25:41.960 --> 25:44.080
which for a business of this quality

25:44.080 --> 25:46.080
is an extremely, extremely low price.

25:46.080 --> 25:49.680
And our view on Google, one way to think about it,

25:49.680 --> 25:52.120
when a business becomes a verb,

25:52.120 --> 25:53.320
that's usually a pretty good sign

25:53.320 --> 25:55.200
about the mode around the business.

25:55.200 --> 25:58.760
So you open your computer and you open your search

25:58.760 --> 26:00.920
and very high percentage of the world

26:00.920 --> 26:03.600
starts with a Google page in a one line.

26:04.760 --> 26:07.240
We type in your search.

26:07.240 --> 26:11.000
The Google advertising search YouTube franchise

26:11.000 --> 26:14.480
is one of the most dominant franchises in the world.

26:14.480 --> 26:18.240
Very difficult to disrupt, extremely profitable.

26:18.240 --> 26:20.480
The world is moving from offline advertising

26:20.480 --> 26:23.280
to online advertising and that trend I think continues.

26:23.280 --> 26:24.120
Why?

26:24.120 --> 26:26.000
Because you can actually see with your ads work.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.040
You know, they used to say about advertising,

26:29.640 --> 26:32.000
spend a fortune and you just don't know

26:32.000 --> 26:34.360
which 50% of its works, but you just sort of spend the money

26:34.360 --> 26:36.680
because you know, ultimately that's gonna bring

26:36.680 --> 26:37.520
in the customer.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.040
And now with online advertising,

26:39.040 --> 26:43.400
you can see with granularity which dollars I'm spending.

26:43.400 --> 26:44.760
When people click on the search term

26:44.760 --> 26:47.520
and end up buying something and I pay,

26:47.520 --> 26:50.880
it's a very high return on investment for the advertiser

26:50.880 --> 26:53.000
and they really dominate that business.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.080
Now AI of course is a risk.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.800
If all of a sudden people start searching

26:56.800 --> 27:00.240
or asking questions of chat GPT

27:00.240 --> 27:02.160
and don't start with the Google search bar,

27:02.160 --> 27:03.400
that's a risk to the company.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.840
And so our view based on work we had done

27:05.840 --> 27:08.120
and talked to industry experts is that Google,

27:08.120 --> 27:12.520
if anything had a virtue of the investment they've made

27:12.520 --> 27:14.880
at the time, the energy that people put into it.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.680
We felt their AI capabilities were if anything

27:17.680 --> 27:21.120
potentially greater than Microsoft chat GPT

27:21.120 --> 27:23.480
and that the market had overreacted.

27:23.480 --> 27:28.320
And because Google, you know, is a big company,

27:28.320 --> 27:31.600
global business, regulators scrutinize it

27:31.600 --> 27:33.400
incredibly carefully, they couldn't take

27:33.400 --> 27:34.640
some of the same liberties.

27:34.640 --> 27:37.040
A startup like OpenAI did in releasing a product

27:37.040 --> 27:39.760
and I think Google took a more cautious approach

27:39.760 --> 27:41.480
in releasing an early version of Bard

27:41.480 --> 27:43.680
in terms of its capabilities.

27:43.680 --> 27:45.320
And that let the mark the world to believe

27:45.320 --> 27:46.560
that they were behind.

27:46.560 --> 27:49.640
And we ultimately concluded if they're tied or ahead

27:49.640 --> 27:52.600
and you pay nothing for that potential business

27:52.600 --> 27:54.720
and they also have huge advantages by virtue.

27:54.720 --> 27:58.200
You think of all the data Google has, like the search data,

27:58.200 --> 28:01.120
all the various applications, you know,

28:01.120 --> 28:03.560
email and otherwise, and the kind of Google suite

28:03.560 --> 28:05.720
of products, it's an incredible data set.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.960
So they have more training data

28:07.960 --> 28:09.360
than pretty much any company in the world.

28:09.360 --> 28:10.480
They have incredible engineers,

28:10.480 --> 28:12.720
they have enormous financial resources.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.440
So that was kind of the bet.

28:14.440 --> 28:17.840
And we still think it's probably the cheapest

28:17.840 --> 28:20.880
of the big seven companies in terms of the price

28:20.880 --> 28:22.080
you're paying for the business relative

28:22.080 --> 28:23.640
to its current earnings.

28:23.640 --> 28:26.560
It also is a business that has a lot of potential

28:26.560 --> 28:28.320
for efficiency.

28:28.320 --> 28:29.960
You know, sometimes when you have this enormously

28:29.960 --> 28:33.280
profitable dominant company, you know,

28:33.280 --> 28:36.880
all of the technology companies in the post March 20 world

28:37.800 --> 28:39.840
grew enormously in terms of their teams

28:39.840 --> 28:41.440
and they probably over hired.

28:41.440 --> 28:42.960
And so you've seen some, you know,

28:42.960 --> 28:45.320
the Facebooks of the world and now even Google

28:45.320 --> 28:46.480
starting to get a little more efficient

28:46.480 --> 28:48.160
in terms of their operations.

28:48.160 --> 28:52.080
So we paid a low multiple for the business.

28:52.080 --> 28:53.440
One way to think about the value of the business

28:53.440 --> 28:55.960
is the price you pay for the earnings.

28:55.960 --> 28:58.000
Or alternatively, what's the yield?

28:58.000 --> 29:00.120
If you flip over the price over the earnings,

29:00.120 --> 29:02.080
it gives you kind of the yield of the business.

29:02.080 --> 29:06.560
So a 15 multiple is about almost a 7.5% yield

29:06.560 --> 29:09.400
and that earnings yield is growing over time

29:09.400 --> 29:10.440
as the business grows.

29:10.440 --> 29:14.320
That's a, you know, compared to what you can earn

29:14.320 --> 29:16.360
lending your money to the government, you know, 4%,

29:16.360 --> 29:18.040
that's a very attractive going and yield.

29:18.040 --> 29:21.440
And then there's all kinds of what we call optionality

29:21.440 --> 29:23.360
in all the various businesses and investments they've made

29:23.360 --> 29:24.560
that are losing money.

29:24.560 --> 29:27.160
They've got a cloud business that's growing very rapidly,

29:27.160 --> 29:29.600
but they're investing basically 100% of the profits

29:29.600 --> 29:31.040
from that business and growth.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.560
So you're in that earnings number,

29:32.560 --> 29:34.480
you're not seeing any earnings from the cloud business

29:34.480 --> 29:36.880
and you know, they're one of the top cloud players.

29:36.880 --> 29:41.480
So very interesting, generally well-managed company

29:41.480 --> 29:45.080
with incredible assets and resources and dominance,

29:45.080 --> 29:48.760
you know, and has no debt and it's got a ton of cash.

29:48.760 --> 29:50.280
And so pretty good story.

29:51.200 --> 29:54.720
Is there something fundamentally different about AI

29:54.720 --> 29:57.160
that makes all of this more complicated,

29:57.160 --> 30:01.080
which is the sort of the exponential possibilities

30:01.080 --> 30:06.080
of the kinds of products and impact that AI could create

30:06.240 --> 30:11.160
when you're looking at Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, Google,

30:11.160 --> 30:15.800
all these companies, XAI, or maybe startups,

30:15.800 --> 30:18.880
like is there some more risk introduced

30:18.880 --> 30:20.840
by the possibilities of AI?

30:20.840 --> 30:22.680
Absolutely, that's a great question.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.040
You know, business investing is about finding companies

30:26.040 --> 30:27.720
that can't be disrupted.

30:27.720 --> 30:32.080
AI is the ultimate disruptable asset or technology.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.440
And that's what makes investing treacherous

30:35.440 --> 30:36.360
is that you own a business

30:36.360 --> 30:37.400
that's enormously profitable,

30:37.400 --> 30:39.720
management gets, if you will, fat and happy,

30:39.720 --> 30:41.160
and then a new technology emerges

30:41.160 --> 30:43.880
that just takes away all their profitability.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.680
And AI is this incredibly powerful tool,

30:45.680 --> 30:48.000
which is why every business is saying,

30:48.000 --> 30:49.920
how can I use AI in my business

30:49.920 --> 30:53.880
to make us more profitable, more successful, grow faster,

30:53.880 --> 30:57.880
and also disrupt or protect ourselves from the,

30:57.880 --> 30:59.520
you know, the incomings?

30:59.520 --> 31:00.840
You know, it's a bit like, you know,

31:00.840 --> 31:04.760
Buffett talks about a great business like a castle

31:04.760 --> 31:06.680
surrounded by this really wide moat,

31:06.680 --> 31:08.960
but you have all these barbarians trying to get in

31:08.960 --> 31:12.560
and steal the princess.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.640
And it happens, you know, Kodak, for example,

31:15.640 --> 31:18.720
was an amazing, incredibly dominant company

31:18.720 --> 31:20.480
until it disappeared.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.720
Polaroid, you know, this incredible technology.

31:23.720 --> 31:25.880
And that's why we have tended to stay away

31:25.880 --> 31:27.680
from companies that are technology companies,

31:27.680 --> 31:29.360
because technology companies, generally,

31:29.360 --> 31:30.800
the world is such a dynamic place

31:30.800 --> 31:33.480
that someone's always working on a better version.

31:33.480 --> 31:38.480
And, you know, Kodak was caught up in the analog film world.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.080
And then the world changed.

31:40.080 --> 31:42.520
Well, Google was pretty fat and happy

31:42.520 --> 31:44.280
until Chagipati came out.

31:44.280 --> 31:47.520
How would you rate their ability to wake up,

31:47.520 --> 31:50.960
lose weight, and be less happy

31:50.960 --> 31:55.720
and aggressively rediscover their search for happiness?

31:55.720 --> 31:58.560
I think you've seen a lot of that in the last year.

31:58.560 --> 32:02.520
And I would say some combination of embarrassment

32:02.520 --> 32:06.480
and pride are huge motivators for everyone

32:06.480 --> 32:08.120
from Sergey Brin, you know,

32:08.120 --> 32:10.360
to the management of the company.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.840
And Demis Kassab has thrown them into the picture

32:12.840 --> 32:15.960
and all of DeepMind teams and the unification of teams

32:15.960 --> 32:17.080
and like all the shakeups.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.080
It was interesting to watch the chaos.

32:19.080 --> 32:19.920
I love it.

32:19.920 --> 32:22.080
I love it when everybody freaks out,

32:22.080 --> 32:24.600
like you said, partly embarrassment

32:24.600 --> 32:26.480
and partly that competitive drive

32:26.480 --> 32:28.720
that drives engineers is great.

32:28.720 --> 32:30.600
I can't wait to see what,

32:30.600 --> 32:32.480
they've diminished a lot of improvement in the product

32:33.480 --> 32:34.320
so let's see where it goes.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.240
You mentioned management.

32:36.240 --> 32:39.240
How do you analyze the governance structure

32:39.240 --> 32:41.240
and the individual humans

32:41.240 --> 32:42.760
that are the managers of a company?

32:42.760 --> 32:47.680
So as I like to say, incentives drive all human behavior

32:47.680 --> 32:50.400
and that certainly applies in the business world.

32:50.400 --> 32:53.240
So understanding the people and what drives them

32:53.240 --> 32:55.240
and what the actual financial

32:55.240 --> 32:56.440
and other incentives of a business

32:56.440 --> 32:59.720
are very important part of the analysis

32:59.720 --> 33:01.120
for investing in a company.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
And you can learn a lot.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.320
I mentioned before one great way to learn about a business

33:05.320 --> 33:08.120
is go back a decade and read everything

33:08.120 --> 33:10.080
that management has written about the business

33:10.080 --> 33:11.560
and see what they've done over time.

33:11.560 --> 33:12.480
See what they've said.

33:12.480 --> 33:17.240
Conference calls are actually relatively recent.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.160
When I started in the business,

33:18.160 --> 33:19.800
there weren't conference call transcripts.

33:19.800 --> 33:22.600
Now you have a written record

33:22.600 --> 33:23.960
of everything management has said

33:23.960 --> 33:25.880
in response to questions from analysts

33:25.880 --> 33:27.560
at conferences and otherwise.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.120
And so just you learn a lot about people

33:29.120 --> 33:30.760
by listening to what they say,

33:30.760 --> 33:32.520
how they answer questions,

33:32.520 --> 33:33.680
and ultimately their track record

33:33.680 --> 33:35.320
for doing what they say they're gonna do.

33:35.320 --> 33:37.400
Do they under promise and over deliver?

33:37.400 --> 33:39.840
Do they over promise and under deliver?

33:39.840 --> 33:41.240
Do they say what they're gonna do?

33:41.240 --> 33:42.640
Do they admit mistakes?

33:44.240 --> 33:46.480
Do they build great teams?

33:46.480 --> 33:48.400
Do people wanna come work for them?

33:48.400 --> 33:50.200
Are they able to retain their talent?

33:51.680 --> 33:53.240
And then part of it is,

33:54.360 --> 33:55.960
how much are they running the business

33:55.960 --> 33:56.880
for the benefit of the business?

33:56.880 --> 33:57.760
How much are they running the business

33:57.760 --> 33:59.360
for the benefit of themselves?

34:00.360 --> 34:03.440
And that's kind of the analysis you do.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.040
Are we talking about CEO, COO?

34:06.040 --> 34:08.000
What does management mean?

34:08.000 --> 34:09.240
How deep does it go?

34:09.240 --> 34:10.080
Sure.

34:10.080 --> 34:13.080
So this very senior management matters enormously.

34:13.080 --> 34:14.800
We use the Chipotle example.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.560
Steve Ells, great entrepreneur,

34:16.560 --> 34:19.400
business got to a scale he really couldn't run it.

34:19.400 --> 34:20.600
We recruited a guy named Brian,

34:20.600 --> 34:23.960
helped the company recruit a guy named Brian Nickell.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.080
And he was considered the best person

34:26.080 --> 34:27.680
in the quick service industry.

34:27.760 --> 34:30.120
He came in and completely rebuilt the company.

34:30.120 --> 34:31.920
Actually, we moved the company.

34:31.920 --> 34:34.240
Chipotle was moved to California.

34:34.240 --> 34:37.080
And sometimes one way to redo the culture of a company

34:37.080 --> 34:39.040
is just to move it geographically.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.480
And then you can kind of reboot the business.

34:40.480 --> 34:43.680
But a great leader has great followership.

34:43.680 --> 34:44.680
Over the course of their career,

34:44.680 --> 34:45.760
they'll have a team they've built

34:45.760 --> 34:48.520
that will come follow them into the next opportunity.

34:49.480 --> 34:53.600
But the key is really the top person matters enormously

34:53.600 --> 34:55.600
because, and then it's who they recruit.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.400
You recruit an A plus leader

34:58.400 --> 35:00.600
and they're gonna recruit other A type people.

35:00.600 --> 35:01.440
If you're a B leader,

35:01.440 --> 35:04.560
you're not gonna recruit any great talent beneath them.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.520
You mentioned Warren Buffett.

35:07.520 --> 35:10.600
You said you admire him as an investor.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.200
What do you find most interesting

35:12.200 --> 35:14.800
and powerful about his approach?

35:14.800 --> 35:17.760
What aspects of his approach to investing

35:17.760 --> 35:19.800
do you also practice?

35:19.800 --> 35:21.240
Sure, so most of what I've learned

35:21.240 --> 35:22.880
in the investment business, I've learned from Warren Buffett.

35:22.880 --> 35:26.240
He's been my great professor of this business.

35:26.240 --> 35:27.480
My first book I read in the business

35:27.480 --> 35:30.400
was the Ben Graham Intelligent Investor.

35:30.400 --> 35:33.120
But fairly quickly, you get to learn about Warren Buffett.

35:33.120 --> 35:36.480
And I started by reading the Berkshire Hathaway and reports.

35:36.480 --> 35:39.400
And then I eventually got the Buffett partnership letters

35:39.400 --> 35:41.920
that you could see, which are an amazing read

35:41.920 --> 35:44.520
to go back to the mid 1950s

35:44.520 --> 35:46.720
and read what he wrote to his limited partners

35:46.720 --> 35:47.640
when he first started out

35:47.640 --> 35:49.960
and just follow that trajectory over a long period of time.

35:49.960 --> 35:53.680
So what's remarkable about him is one, duration, right?

35:53.680 --> 35:55.120
He's still at it at 93.

35:56.800 --> 36:00.000
Two, it takes a very long-term view.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
But a big thing that you learn from him,

36:03.000 --> 36:07.120
investing requires this incredible dispassionate

36:07.120 --> 36:08.480
on emotional quality.

36:08.480 --> 36:11.640
You have to be extremely economically rational,

36:11.640 --> 36:15.280
which is not a basic,

36:15.280 --> 36:16.960
it's not something you learn in the jungle.

36:16.960 --> 36:18.800
I don't think it's something that,

36:18.840 --> 36:23.840
if you think about surviving the jungle,

36:24.400 --> 36:27.560
the lion shows up and everyone starts running,

36:27.560 --> 36:29.280
you run with them.

36:29.280 --> 36:31.600
That does not work well in markets.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.520
In fact, you generally have to do the opposite, right?

36:33.520 --> 36:35.560
When the lemmings are running over the cliff,

36:35.560 --> 36:37.240
that's the time where you're facing the other direction

36:37.240 --> 36:38.400
and you're running the other direction,

36:38.400 --> 36:39.360
i.e. you're stepping in,

36:39.360 --> 36:41.920
you're buying stocks at really low prices.

36:43.280 --> 36:44.760
Buffett's been great at that

36:44.760 --> 36:46.960
and great at teaching about what he calls temperament,

36:46.960 --> 36:49.760
which is this sort of emotional kind of,

36:49.760 --> 36:53.040
or unemotional quality that you need

36:53.040 --> 36:54.800
to be able to dispassionately look at the world

36:54.800 --> 36:57.720
and say, okay, is this a real risk?

36:57.720 --> 36:59.040
Are people overreacting?

37:00.240 --> 37:02.200
People tend to get excited about investments

37:02.200 --> 37:03.600
when stocks are going up

37:03.600 --> 37:05.480
and they get depressed when they're going down.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.680
And I think that's just inherently human.

37:07.680 --> 37:08.680
You have to reverse that.

37:08.680 --> 37:11.440
You have to get excited when things get cheaper

37:11.440 --> 37:13.200
and you gotta get concerned

37:13.200 --> 37:15.320
when things get more expensive.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.800
You've been a part of some big battles,

37:17.800 --> 37:20.520
some big losses, some big wins.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.640
So it's been a roller coaster.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.440
So in terms of temperament, psychologically,

37:25.440 --> 37:28.520
how do you not let that break you?

37:28.520 --> 37:32.880
How do you maintain a calm demeanor

37:32.880 --> 37:34.640
and avoid running with the lemmings?

37:36.160 --> 37:38.640
I think it's something you kind of learn over time.

37:38.640 --> 37:42.040
A key success factor is you wanna have enough money

37:42.040 --> 37:44.000
in the bank that you're gonna survive.

37:45.840 --> 37:49.000
Regardless of what's going on with volatility in markets.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.400
People who, one, you shouldn't borrow money.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.600
So if you borrow money, you own stocks on margin,

37:55.600 --> 37:59.880
markets are going down and you have your livelihood at risk.

37:59.880 --> 38:01.560
It's very difficult to be rational.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.720
So key is getting yourself to a place

38:03.720 --> 38:06.240
where you're financially secure.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.200
You're not gonna lose your house.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.960
That's a kind of a key thing.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.960
And then also doing your homework.

38:14.920 --> 38:17.560
Stocks can trade at any price in the short term.

38:17.560 --> 38:20.400
And if you know what a business is worth

38:21.320 --> 38:22.440
and you understand the management,

38:22.440 --> 38:24.360
you know it extremely well.

38:24.360 --> 38:27.040
It's not nearly as, it doesn't bother you

38:27.040 --> 38:28.600
when a stock price goes down

38:28.600 --> 38:30.160
or it has much less impact on you

38:30.160 --> 38:33.560
because you know, again, as Mr. Graham said,

38:33.560 --> 38:35.400
in the short term, the market's a voting machine.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.480
You have a bunch of lemmings voting one direction.

38:37.480 --> 38:38.320
That's concerning.

38:38.320 --> 38:41.320
But if it's a great business, doesn't have a lot of debt

38:41.320 --> 38:43.640
and people are gonna just listen to more music next year

38:43.640 --> 38:45.880
than this year, you know you're gonna do well.

38:45.880 --> 38:50.440
So it's a bit, some combination of being personally secure

38:50.440 --> 38:53.280
and also just knowing what you own.

38:53.280 --> 38:58.280
And over time, you build calluses, I would say.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.800
So psychologically, just as a human being,

39:01.800 --> 39:04.600
speaking of lines and gazelles and all this kind of stuff,

39:04.600 --> 39:06.960
is there some, is it as simple

39:06.960 --> 39:09.400
as just being financially secure?

39:09.400 --> 39:12.720
Is there some just human qualities

39:12.720 --> 39:16.920
that you have to be born with slash develop?

39:16.920 --> 39:17.800
I think so.

39:17.800 --> 39:21.720
I think, now I'm a pretty emotional person, I would say,

39:21.720 --> 39:25.800
or feel pretty strong emotions, but not in investing.

39:25.800 --> 39:29.720
I'm remarkably immune to kind of volatility

39:29.720 --> 39:31.720
and that's a big advantage

39:31.720 --> 39:33.960
and it took some time for me to develop that.

39:33.960 --> 39:35.320
So you weren't born with that, you think?

39:35.320 --> 39:36.160
No.

39:36.160 --> 39:40.280
So being emotional, do you want to respond to volatility?

39:40.280 --> 39:42.520
Yeah, and you just, it's a bit,

39:42.520 --> 39:45.680
again, you can learn a lot from other people's experience.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.880
It's one of the few businesses

39:47.880 --> 39:49.800
where you can learn an enormous amount

39:49.800 --> 39:53.120
by reading about other periods in history,

39:55.160 --> 39:58.800
following Buffett's career, the mistakes he made.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.600
If you're investing a lot of capital,

40:00.600 --> 40:02.960
every one of your mistakes can be big, right?

40:02.960 --> 40:05.240
So we've made big mistakes.

40:05.240 --> 40:07.080
The good news is that the vast majority

40:07.080 --> 40:08.920
of things we've done have worked out really well

40:08.960 --> 40:12.480
and so that also gives you confidence over time.

40:12.480 --> 40:15.520
But because we make very few investments,

40:15.520 --> 40:19.640
we own eight things today or seven companies of that matter.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.440
If we get one wrong, it's gonna be big news

40:23.440 --> 40:25.360
and so the other nature of our business

40:25.360 --> 40:26.800
you have to be comfortable with

40:26.800 --> 40:30.600
is a lot of public scrutiny, a lot of public criticism

40:30.600 --> 40:35.320
and that requires some experience, I'm calling that.

40:35.320 --> 40:37.840
I think we'll talk about some of that.

40:37.840 --> 40:40.720
Financially secure is something I believe also recommend

40:40.720 --> 40:43.400
for even just everyday investors.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.400
Is there some general advice

40:46.560 --> 40:48.320
from the things you've been talking about

40:48.320 --> 40:50.200
that applies to everyday investors?

40:50.200 --> 40:55.080
Sure, so never invest money you can't afford to lose

40:55.080 --> 40:58.640
where it would, if you'd lost this money,

40:58.640 --> 41:00.280
you lose your house, et cetera.

41:00.280 --> 41:05.280
So having, being in a place where you're investing money

41:05.600 --> 41:08.920
that you don't care about the price in the short term,

41:08.920 --> 41:10.360
it's money for your retirement

41:10.360 --> 41:13.320
and you take a really long-term view, I think that's key.

41:14.720 --> 41:16.960
Never investing where you borrow money

41:16.960 --> 41:18.240
against your securities.

41:19.200 --> 41:20.920
The markets offer you the opportunity

41:20.920 --> 41:23.360
to leverage your investment

41:23.360 --> 41:26.680
and in most worlds, you'll be okay.

41:26.680 --> 41:30.360
Except if there's a financial crisis

41:30.360 --> 41:33.480
or a nuclear device gets detonated, God forbid,

41:33.480 --> 41:35.000
somewhere in the world

41:35.680 --> 41:37.120
or there's an unexpected war

41:37.120 --> 41:40.000
or someone kills a leader unexpectedly.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.840
Things happen that can change the course of history

41:42.840 --> 41:46.240
and markets react very negatively to those kinds of events

41:46.240 --> 41:47.840
and you can own the greatest business in the world

41:47.840 --> 41:49.040
trading for a hundred dollars a share

41:49.040 --> 41:50.960
and next moment it could be 50.

41:50.960 --> 41:54.120
So as long as you don't borrow against securities,

41:54.120 --> 41:56.120
you own really high quality businesses

41:56.120 --> 41:58.760
and it's not money that you need in the short term,

41:59.800 --> 42:02.640
then you can actually be thoughtful about it

42:02.640 --> 42:04.800
and that is a huge advantage.

42:05.640 --> 42:07.560
The vast majority of investors, it seems,

42:07.560 --> 42:10.760
tend to be the ones that panic in the downturns,

42:10.760 --> 42:14.040
get over-related when markets are doing well.

42:14.040 --> 42:16.800
So be able to think long-term

42:16.800 --> 42:18.920
and be sufficiently financially secure

42:18.920 --> 42:22.680
such that you can afford to think long-term.

42:22.680 --> 42:25.400
Buffett is the ultimate long-term thinker

42:25.400 --> 42:27.520
and just the decisions he makes,

42:28.400 --> 42:32.240
the consistency of the decisions he's made over time

42:32.280 --> 42:34.920
and fitting into that sort of long-term framework

42:34.920 --> 42:38.880
is a very educational,

42:38.880 --> 42:42.520
let's put it that way, for learning about this business.

42:42.520 --> 42:45.560
So you mentioned eight companies,

42:45.560 --> 42:47.760
but what do you think about mutual funds

42:47.760 --> 42:49.200
for everyday investors

42:49.200 --> 42:53.840
that diversify across a larger number of companies?

42:53.840 --> 42:56.120
I think there are very few mutual funds.

42:57.040 --> 42:58.880
There are thousands and thousands of mutual funds.

42:58.880 --> 43:01.520
There are very few that earn their keep

43:01.520 --> 43:03.280
in terms of the fees they charge.

43:03.280 --> 43:05.440
They tend to be too diversified

43:07.000 --> 43:11.600
and too short-term

43:11.600 --> 43:14.680
and you're often much better off just buying an index fund.

43:14.680 --> 43:16.280
And many of them perform,

43:17.720 --> 43:19.160
if you look carefully at their portfolios,

43:19.160 --> 43:23.120
they're not so different from the underlying index itself

43:23.120 --> 43:25.080
and you tend to pay a much higher fee.

43:25.080 --> 43:26.040
Now, all of that being said,

43:26.040 --> 43:29.560
there's some very talented mutual fund managers,

43:29.560 --> 43:31.320
a guy named Will Danoff at Fidelity

43:32.120 --> 43:33.040
who had a great record over a long period of time,

43:33.040 --> 43:36.400
the famous Peter Lynch, Ron Barron,

43:36.400 --> 43:39.440
another great long-term growth stock investor.

43:39.440 --> 43:42.120
So there's some great mutual funds,

43:42.120 --> 43:46.360
but I put them in the handful versus the thousands.

43:46.360 --> 43:50.440
And if you're in the thousands,

43:50.440 --> 43:54.320
I'd rather someone bought just an index fund basically.

43:54.320 --> 43:55.400
Yeah, index funds.

43:55.400 --> 43:59.720
But what would be the leap for an everyday investor

43:59.720 --> 44:02.680
to go to investing in a small number of companies

44:02.680 --> 44:05.800
like two, three, four, five companies?

44:05.800 --> 44:08.160
I even recommend for individual investors

44:08.160 --> 44:11.000
to invest in a dozen companies.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.520
You don't get that much more benefit of diversification

44:13.520 --> 44:18.000
going from a dozen to 25 or even 50.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
Most of the benefits of diversification come in the first,

44:21.000 --> 44:22.320
call it 10 or 12.

44:23.280 --> 44:24.680
And if you're investing in businesses

44:24.680 --> 44:26.240
that don't have a lot of debt,

44:26.240 --> 44:28.440
they're businesses that you can understand yourself.

44:28.440 --> 44:31.440
You understand, actually individual investors

44:31.440 --> 44:33.640
did a much better job analyzing Tesla

44:33.640 --> 44:36.360
than the so-called professional investors or analysts,

44:36.360 --> 44:37.320
the vast majority of them.

44:37.320 --> 44:38.760
So if it's a business you understand,

44:38.760 --> 44:40.480
if you bought a Tesla, you understand the product

44:40.480 --> 44:43.480
and its appeal to consumers.

44:43.480 --> 44:47.080
It's a good place to start when you're analyzing a company.

44:47.080 --> 44:49.440
So I would invest in things you can understand.

44:49.440 --> 44:50.480
That's kind of a key.

44:51.880 --> 44:54.840
You like Chipotle, you understand why they're successful.

44:54.840 --> 44:57.240
You can go there every week and you can monitor

44:58.560 --> 45:00.160
is anything changing?

45:00.160 --> 45:03.520
How are these new kind of house chicken al pastor?

45:03.520 --> 45:07.560
Is that a good upgrade from the basic chicken?

45:08.880 --> 45:12.360
The drink offering's improving, the store's clean.

45:12.360 --> 45:13.640
I think you should invest in companies

45:13.640 --> 45:14.520
you really understand.

45:14.520 --> 45:16.840
Simple businesses where you can predict

45:16.840 --> 45:17.880
with a high degree of confidence

45:17.880 --> 45:19.000
what it's gonna look like over time.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.080
And if you do that in a not particularly

45:21.080 --> 45:22.840
concentrated fashion and you don't borrow money

45:22.840 --> 45:25.280
against your securities, you'll probably do much better

45:25.280 --> 45:26.800
than your typical mutual fund.

45:26.800 --> 45:27.640
Yeah, it's interesting.

45:27.640 --> 45:30.960
Consumers that love a thing are actually good analysts

45:30.960 --> 45:33.000
of that thing, or I guess a good starting point.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.400
And by the way, there's much more information

45:34.400 --> 45:35.240
available today.

45:35.240 --> 45:38.280
When I was first investing, literally we had people

45:38.280 --> 45:42.040
faxing us documents from the SEC filings in Washington DC.

45:42.040 --> 45:43.880
Now everything's available online.

45:43.880 --> 45:45.720
Conference call transcripts are free.

45:47.960 --> 45:52.960
You have AI, you have unlimited data

45:53.960 --> 45:58.040
and all kinds of message boards and Reddit forums

45:58.040 --> 46:00.680
and things where people are sharing advice.

46:00.680 --> 46:04.280
And everyone has their own, by virtue of their career

46:04.280 --> 46:07.960
or experience, they'll know about an industry

46:07.960 --> 46:10.280
or a business, and I would take advantage

46:10.280 --> 46:12.320
of your own competitive advantages.

46:12.320 --> 46:14.360
I'm just afraid if I invest in Chipotle,

46:14.360 --> 46:17.400
I'll be analyzing every little change of menu

46:17.400 --> 46:20.640
from a financial perspective and just be very critical.

46:20.640 --> 46:22.520
If it's gonna affect your experience,

46:22.960 --> 46:24.560
I wouldn't buy the stock.

46:24.560 --> 46:27.400
Yeah, I mean, I should also say that I am somebody

46:27.400 --> 46:29.800
that emotionally does respond to volatility,

46:29.800 --> 46:32.840
which is why I've never bought index funds

46:32.840 --> 46:36.240
and I just noticed myself psychologically being affected

46:36.240 --> 46:37.720
by the ups and downs of the market.

46:37.720 --> 46:40.680
I want to tune out because if I'm at all tuned in,

46:40.680 --> 46:43.320
it has a negative impact on my life.

46:43.320 --> 46:45.560
Yeah, that's really important.

46:45.560 --> 46:48.800
Can you explain what activist investing is?

46:48.800 --> 46:51.360
You've been talking about investing

46:51.400 --> 46:53.880
and then looking at companies when they're struggling,

46:53.880 --> 46:57.800
stepping in and reconfiguring things within that company

46:57.800 --> 47:00.320
and helping it become great.

47:00.320 --> 47:03.520
So that's part of it, but let's just zoom out.

47:03.520 --> 47:05.760
What's this idea of activist investing?

47:05.760 --> 47:07.800
I think recently, in the last couple of days,

47:07.800 --> 47:10.080
I read an article saying that more than 50%

47:10.080 --> 47:11.560
of the capital in the world today

47:11.560 --> 47:14.840
that's invested in the stock market is passive,

47:14.840 --> 47:18.240
indexed money, and that's the most passive form, right?

47:18.240 --> 47:20.280
So if you think about an index fund,

47:20.280 --> 47:24.200
a machine buys a fixed set of securities

47:24.200 --> 47:25.360
in certain proportion.

47:26.320 --> 47:28.840
There's no human judgment at all

47:28.840 --> 47:32.440
and there's no real person behind it in a way.

47:33.520 --> 47:35.960
They never take steps to improve a business.

47:35.960 --> 47:38.560
They just quietly own securities.

47:39.680 --> 47:43.040
What we do is we invest our capital in a handful of things.

47:43.040 --> 47:44.280
We get to know them really, really well

47:44.280 --> 47:46.360
because you're going to put 20% of your assets in something.

47:46.360 --> 47:48.560
You need to know it really well.

47:48.560 --> 47:51.520
But once you become a big holder

47:51.520 --> 47:53.680
and if you've got some thoughts

47:53.680 --> 47:55.720
on how to make a business more valuable,

47:56.560 --> 47:58.360
you can do more than just be a passive investor.

47:58.360 --> 48:02.480
So our strategy is built upon finding great companies

48:02.480 --> 48:04.560
in some cases that have lost their way

48:04.560 --> 48:07.280
and then helping them succeed.

48:07.280 --> 48:10.120
And we can do that with ideas from outside the boardroom.

48:10.120 --> 48:14.200
Sometimes we take a seat on a board or more than one

48:15.880 --> 48:18.240
and we work with the best management teams in the world

48:18.240 --> 48:20.480
to help these businesses succeed.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.360
So when I first went into this business,

48:22.360 --> 48:25.880
no one knew who we were and we didn't have that much money.

48:26.880 --> 48:29.960
And so to influence what was to us a big company,

48:30.920 --> 48:33.560
we had to make a fair bit more noise, right?

48:33.560 --> 48:35.120
So we would buy a stake.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.760
We'd announce it publicly.

48:36.760 --> 48:38.320
We'd attempt to engage with management.

48:38.320 --> 48:39.680
The first activist investment we made

48:39.680 --> 48:41.760
at Pershing Square was Wendy's.

48:41.760 --> 48:44.880
I couldn't get the CEO to ever return my call.

48:44.880 --> 48:46.440
Didn't return my call.

48:46.440 --> 48:50.680
So we actually, in that case, our idea was Wendy's

48:50.680 --> 48:51.800
owned a company called Tim Hortons,

48:51.800 --> 48:54.000
which was this coffee donut chain.

48:54.000 --> 48:58.720
And you could buy Wendy's for basically $5 billion

48:58.720 --> 49:00.720
and they owned 100% of Tim Hortons,

49:00.720 --> 49:03.120
which itself was worth more than 5 billion.

49:03.120 --> 49:05.720
So you could literally buy Wendy's, separate Tim Hortons

49:05.720 --> 49:07.680
and get Wendy's for negative value.

49:07.680 --> 49:09.400
That seemed like a pretty good opportunity,

49:09.400 --> 49:11.920
even though the business wasn't doing that well.

49:11.920 --> 49:14.880
So we bought the stake, called the CEO,

49:14.880 --> 49:16.320
couldn't get a meeting, nothing.

49:17.200 --> 49:18.840
So we hired actually Blackstone,

49:18.840 --> 49:22.000
which was at that time had an investment bank

49:22.000 --> 49:24.920
and we hired them to do what's called a fairness opinion

49:24.920 --> 49:27.320
of what Wendy's would be worth if they followed our advice.

49:27.320 --> 49:30.360
And they agreed to do it, paid them a fee for it.

49:30.360 --> 49:31.680
And then we'd mailed in a letter

49:31.680 --> 49:32.960
with a copy of the fairness opinion,

49:32.960 --> 49:34.800
saying Wendy's would basically be worth 80% more

49:34.800 --> 49:36.000
if they did what we said.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.920
And six weeks later, they did what we said.

49:37.920 --> 49:41.880
So that's activism, at least an early form of activism.

49:41.880 --> 49:43.520
With that kind of under our belt,

49:43.520 --> 49:44.960
we had a little more credibility.

49:45.120 --> 49:46.840
Things and stakes in companies,

49:47.960 --> 49:48.920
the media would pay attention.

49:48.920 --> 49:51.800
So the media became kind of an important partner.

49:51.800 --> 49:54.760
And some combination of shame, embarrassment

49:54.760 --> 49:57.400
and opportunity motivated management teams

49:57.400 --> 49:58.440
to do the right thing.

49:58.440 --> 50:02.880
And then beyond that, there's certain steps you can take

50:02.880 --> 50:04.320
if management is recalcitrant

50:04.320 --> 50:05.680
and the shareholders are on your side.

50:05.680 --> 50:08.000
But it's a bit like running for office.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.400
You've got to get all the constituents

50:09.400 --> 50:11.800
to support you and your ideas.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.480
And if they support you and your ideas,

50:13.480 --> 50:16.920
you can overthrow, if you will, the board of a company.

50:16.920 --> 50:18.600
You bring in new talent

50:18.600 --> 50:21.480
and then take over the management of a business.

50:21.480 --> 50:23.720
And that's the most extreme form of activism.

50:23.720 --> 50:25.960
So that's kind of the early days and what we did.

50:25.960 --> 50:28.600
And a lot of the early things that we did were,

50:30.640 --> 50:32.120
call it what we call sort of like

50:32.120 --> 50:33.600
investment banking activism,

50:33.600 --> 50:35.120
where we'd go in and recommend something

50:35.120 --> 50:37.320
a good investment bank would have recommended.

50:37.320 --> 50:38.640
And if they do it, we make a bunch of money.

50:38.640 --> 50:40.840
And then we moved on to the next one.

50:40.840 --> 50:42.960
And then we realized an investment,

50:43.000 --> 50:45.080
a company called General Growth,

50:45.080 --> 50:47.320
was the first time we took a board seat on a company.

50:47.320 --> 50:50.760
And there was some financial restructuring

50:50.760 --> 50:51.920
and also an opportunity to improve

50:51.920 --> 50:53.400
the operations of the business,

50:53.400 --> 50:54.920
sit on the board of a company.

50:54.920 --> 50:57.360
And that was one of the best investments we ever made.

50:57.360 --> 50:59.000
And we said, okay, we can do more

50:59.000 --> 51:01.480
than just be an outside the boardroom investor.

51:01.480 --> 51:03.920
And we can get involved in helping select

51:03.920 --> 51:05.000
the right management teams

51:05.000 --> 51:06.880
and helping guide the right management teams.

51:06.880 --> 51:09.880
And then we've done that over years.

51:09.880 --> 51:12.200
And then I would say the last seven years,

51:12.240 --> 51:14.360
we haven't had to be an activist.

51:14.360 --> 51:16.840
An activist is generally someone who's outside,

51:16.840 --> 51:18.440
banging on the door, trying to get in.

51:18.440 --> 51:20.120
We're sort of built enough credibility

51:20.120 --> 51:21.960
that they open the door and they say,

51:21.960 --> 51:24.440
hey, Bill, what ideas do you have?

51:24.440 --> 51:27.120
So welcome, would you like to join the board?

51:27.120 --> 51:28.200
We're treated differently today

51:28.200 --> 51:29.840
than we were in the beginning.

51:29.840 --> 51:33.760
And that is, I would say,

51:33.760 --> 51:37.320
some people might just call it being an engaged owner.

51:37.320 --> 51:39.480
By the way, that's the way investing was done

51:39.480 --> 51:44.480
in the Andrew Carnegie, JP Morgan days, 150 years ago.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.560
You had these iconic business leaders

51:47.560 --> 51:49.400
that would own 20% of US steel.

51:49.400 --> 51:51.080
And when things would go wrong,

51:51.080 --> 51:53.760
they'd replace the board and the management and fix them.

51:53.760 --> 51:56.320
And over time, we went to a world

51:56.320 --> 52:01.080
where mutual funds were created like in the 1920s, 30s,

52:01.080 --> 52:04.360
index funds with Vanguard and others.

52:04.360 --> 52:06.920
And that all these controlling shareholders

52:07.400 --> 52:09.560
kind of gave their stock to society

52:09.560 --> 52:11.920
or their children and multiple generations.

52:11.920 --> 52:13.520
And there were no longer kind of controlling

52:13.520 --> 52:15.640
owners of businesses or very few.

52:15.640 --> 52:17.440
And that led to underperformance

52:17.440 --> 52:19.440
and the opportunity for activists over time.

52:19.440 --> 52:20.600
And what activism has done,

52:20.600 --> 52:22.920
and I think we've helped lead this movement,

52:22.920 --> 52:25.080
is it restored kind of the balance of power

52:25.080 --> 52:26.960
between the owners of the business

52:26.960 --> 52:28.400
and the management of the company.

52:28.400 --> 52:29.760
And that's been a very good thing

52:29.760 --> 52:33.560
for the performance of the US stock market, actually.

52:33.560 --> 52:35.360
So the owners meaning the shareholders.

52:35.360 --> 52:36.200
Yes.

52:36.200 --> 52:39.320
There's a more direct channel of communication

52:39.320 --> 52:42.640
with activists investing between the shareholders

52:42.640 --> 52:44.160
and the people running the company.

52:44.160 --> 52:45.000
Yes.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.360
So activists generally never own more than

52:47.360 --> 52:49.120
five or 10% of a business.

52:49.120 --> 52:51.160
So they don't have control.

52:51.160 --> 52:53.040
So the way they get influence

52:53.040 --> 52:54.640
is they have to convince the other,

52:54.640 --> 52:57.640
you know, they have to get to the sort of majority

52:57.640 --> 53:00.200
of the other shareholders to support them.

53:00.200 --> 53:02.040
And if they can get that kind of support,

53:02.040 --> 53:04.800
they can behave almost like a controlling shareholder.

53:04.800 --> 53:06.160
And that's how it works.

53:07.120 --> 53:08.560
So the running of a company is,

53:08.560 --> 53:11.640
according to Bill Ackman, is more democratic now.

53:11.640 --> 53:13.160
It is, it is.

53:13.160 --> 53:14.360
But you need some thought leaders.

53:14.360 --> 53:16.320
So activists are kind of thought leaders

53:16.320 --> 53:19.360
because they can spend the time and the money.

53:19.360 --> 53:21.680
You know, a retail investor that owns a thousand shares

53:21.680 --> 53:24.840
doesn't have the resources or the time.

53:24.840 --> 53:25.680
They got a day job.

53:25.680 --> 53:27.440
Whereas an activist day job is finding

53:27.440 --> 53:30.520
the handful of things where there are opportunities.

53:30.520 --> 53:34.880
So on average, is it good to have such an engaged,

53:34.880 --> 53:38.920
powerful, influential investor

53:38.920 --> 53:42.120
helping control, direct the direction of a company?

53:43.040 --> 53:44.840
It depends whether that investor is,

53:44.840 --> 53:46.800
but generally I think it's a good thing.

53:46.800 --> 53:49.440
And that's why, you know,

53:49.440 --> 53:51.320
one of the problems with being CEO of a company today

53:51.320 --> 53:53.920
and having a very diversified shareholder base

53:53.920 --> 53:57.640
is the kind of short-term, long-term balance.

53:57.640 --> 54:00.040
And you have investors that have all different interests

54:00.040 --> 54:01.280
in terms of what they want to achieve

54:01.280 --> 54:03.160
and when they want it achieved.

54:03.200 --> 54:05.560
And a CEO of a new company,

54:05.560 --> 54:09.000
has a new CEO of an old company, let's say,

54:09.000 --> 54:11.920
hasn't had the chance to develop the credibility

54:11.920 --> 54:14.760
to make the kind of longer-term decisions

54:14.760 --> 54:18.320
and can be stuck in a cycle of being judged

54:18.320 --> 54:19.680
on a quarterly basis.

54:19.680 --> 54:23.880
And a business, the best businesses are forever assets

54:23.880 --> 54:25.840
and decisions you make now have impact

54:25.840 --> 54:28.160
three, four or five years from now.

54:28.160 --> 54:30.400
In order to make, and sometimes there are decisions we make

54:30.400 --> 54:33.840
that have the effect of reducing the earnings of a company

54:33.840 --> 54:36.320
in the short-term, because in the long-term,

54:36.320 --> 54:38.840
it's gonna make the business much more valuable.

54:38.840 --> 54:41.080
But sometimes it's hard to have that kind of credibility

54:41.080 --> 54:42.480
when you're a new CEO of a company.

54:42.480 --> 54:44.880
So when you have a major owner

54:44.880 --> 54:47.120
that's respected by other shareholders,

54:47.120 --> 54:48.160
sitting on the board saying,

54:48.160 --> 54:50.080
hey, the CEO is doing the right thing

54:50.080 --> 54:53.240
and making this expensive investment in a new factory.

54:53.240 --> 54:55.560
We're spending more money on R&D

54:55.560 --> 54:56.760
because we're developing something

54:56.760 --> 54:58.680
that's gonna pay off over time.

54:58.680 --> 55:01.320
That large owner on the board

55:01.320 --> 55:03.600
can help buy the time necessary

55:03.600 --> 55:05.640
for management to behave in a longer-term way.

55:05.640 --> 55:07.520
And that's, I think, good for all the shareholders.

55:07.520 --> 55:10.320
So that's the good story, but can it get bad?

55:10.320 --> 55:13.920
Can you have a CEO who is a visionary

55:13.920 --> 55:16.640
and sees the long-term future of a company

55:16.640 --> 55:20.480
and an investor come in and have very selfish interests

55:20.480 --> 55:22.880
in just making more money in the short-term

55:22.880 --> 55:27.240
and therefore destroy and manipulate

55:27.280 --> 55:28.840
the opinions of the shareholders

55:28.840 --> 55:30.080
and other people on the board

55:30.080 --> 55:33.040
in order to sink the company,

55:34.240 --> 55:37.640
maybe increase the price,

55:37.640 --> 55:41.200
but destroy the possibility of long-term value?

55:41.200 --> 55:42.520
Could theoretically happen.

55:42.520 --> 55:46.280
But again, the activist in your example,

55:46.280 --> 55:48.280
generally doesn't own a lot of stock.

55:48.280 --> 55:49.880
The shareholder basis today,

55:49.880 --> 55:51.680
the biggest shareholders are these index funds

55:51.680 --> 55:53.080
that are forever, right?

55:53.080 --> 55:55.600
The BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street,

55:55.640 --> 55:57.400
their ownership stakes are just at this point

55:57.400 --> 55:59.400
only growing because of the inflows of capital

55:59.400 --> 56:01.120
they have from shareholders.

56:01.120 --> 56:04.080
So they have to think or they should think very long-term

56:04.080 --> 56:05.560
and they're gonna be very skeptical

56:05.560 --> 56:08.160
of someone coming in with a short-term idea

56:08.160 --> 56:11.800
that drives the stock price up in the next six months

56:11.800 --> 56:13.880
but impairs the company's long-term ability to compete.

56:13.880 --> 56:16.160
And basically that ownership group

56:17.560 --> 56:19.840
prevents this kind of activity from really happening.

56:19.840 --> 56:22.760
So people are generally skeptical

56:22.800 --> 56:25.720
of short-term activist investors.

56:25.720 --> 56:28.200
Yes, and they're very few.

56:28.200 --> 56:30.840
I don't really know any short-term activist investors.

56:30.840 --> 56:31.680
That's a hopeful message.

56:31.680 --> 56:33.720
Not ones with credibility.

56:33.720 --> 56:35.640
You mentioned General Growth.

56:35.640 --> 56:37.760
I read somewhere called arguably

56:37.760 --> 56:40.840
one of the best hedge fund trades of all time.

56:42.280 --> 56:47.280
So I guess it went from $60 million to over $3 billion.

56:47.560 --> 56:48.640
It was a good one.

56:48.640 --> 56:50.560
All right, but it wasn't a trade.

56:50.560 --> 56:51.600
I wouldn't describe it as a trade.

56:51.640 --> 56:53.880
A trade is something you buy and you flip.

56:53.880 --> 56:55.600
This is something where we made the investment

56:55.600 --> 56:57.640
initially in November of 2008.

56:59.200 --> 57:02.880
And we still own a company we spun off of General Growth

57:02.880 --> 57:04.600
and it's now 15 years later.

57:04.600 --> 57:08.520
So can you describe what went into making that decision

57:08.520 --> 57:10.800
to actually increase the value of the company?

57:10.800 --> 57:13.800
Sure, so this was at the time of the financial crisis

57:14.800 --> 57:17.040
circa November 2008.

57:17.040 --> 57:19.720
What real estate's always been a kind of sector

57:19.720 --> 57:20.600
that I've been interested in.

57:20.600 --> 57:22.240
I began my career in the real estate business

57:22.240 --> 57:24.360
working for my dad actually,

57:24.360 --> 57:25.920
ranging mortgages for real estate developers.

57:25.920 --> 57:29.520
So I have kind of deep, deep ties

57:29.520 --> 57:30.800
and interest in the business.

57:30.800 --> 57:32.360
And General Growth was the second largest

57:32.360 --> 57:34.280
shopping mall company in the country.

57:34.280 --> 57:36.400
Simon Properties, many people have heard of.

57:36.400 --> 57:38.040
General Growth was number two.

57:38.040 --> 57:39.840
They own some of the best malls in the country.

57:39.840 --> 57:42.520
And at that time, people thought of shopping malls

57:42.520 --> 57:44.960
as these non-disruptible things.

57:44.960 --> 57:46.280
Again, we talk about disruption.

57:46.280 --> 57:49.000
Malls have been disrupted in many ways.

57:49.000 --> 57:53.560
And General Growth stock, General Growth, the company,

57:53.560 --> 57:56.080
the CFO in particular was very aggressive

57:56.080 --> 57:58.040
in the way that he borrowed money.

57:58.040 --> 58:01.080
And he borrowed money from a kind of Wall Street,

58:01.080 --> 58:03.760
not long-term mortgages,

58:03.760 --> 58:05.560
but generally relatively short-term mortgages.

58:05.560 --> 58:06.440
It was pretty aggressive.

58:06.440 --> 58:07.760
As the value went up,

58:07.760 --> 58:09.720
he would borrow more and more against the assets

58:09.720 --> 58:12.760
and that helped the short-term results of the business.

58:12.760 --> 58:14.880
The problem was during the financial crisis,

58:14.880 --> 58:18.360
the market for what's called CMBS,

58:18.400 --> 58:20.960
commercial mortgage-backed securities basically shut.

58:20.960 --> 58:21.800
And the company,

58:21.800 --> 58:23.040
because its debt was relatively short-term,

58:23.040 --> 58:25.200
had a lot of big maturities coming up

58:25.200 --> 58:27.320
that they had no ability to refinance.

58:27.320 --> 58:28.920
And the market said, oh my God,

58:28.920 --> 58:30.800
the lenders are gonna foreclose

58:30.800 --> 58:32.360
and the shareholders are gonna get wiped,

58:32.360 --> 58:34.080
the company's gonna go bankrupt, they're gonna get wiped out.

58:34.080 --> 58:38.280
The stock went from $63 a share to 34 cents.

58:38.280 --> 58:40.880
And there was a family, the Bucksbound family owned,

58:40.880 --> 58:42.800
I think about 25% of the company,

58:42.800 --> 58:46.040
and they had a $5 billion of stock

58:46.040 --> 58:47.360
that was worth 25 million or something

58:47.360 --> 58:50.480
by the time we bought a stake in the business.

58:50.480 --> 58:53.120
And what interested me was,

58:54.840 --> 58:55.960
I thought the assets were worth

58:55.960 --> 58:57.600
substantially more than the liabilities.

58:57.600 --> 58:59.920
The company had 27 billion of debt

58:59.920 --> 59:03.520
and had $100 million value of the equity,

59:03.520 --> 59:06.000
down from like 20 billion, okay?

59:06.000 --> 59:08.240
And one, that's sort of an interesting place to start,

59:08.240 --> 59:10.400
with the stock down 99%.

59:10.400 --> 59:12.480
But the fundamental drivers of the mall business

59:12.480 --> 59:15.200
are occupancy, how occupied are the malls.

59:15.200 --> 59:16.880
Occupancy was up year on year,

59:16.880 --> 59:19.520
between 07 and 08, interestingly.

59:19.520 --> 59:20.560
Net operating income,

59:20.560 --> 59:22.520
which is kind of a measure of cashflow from the malls,

59:22.520 --> 59:24.440
that was up year on year.

59:24.440 --> 59:28.520
So kind of the underlying fundamentals were doing fine.

59:28.520 --> 59:29.440
The only problem they had

59:29.440 --> 59:31.080
is they had billions of dollars of debt

59:31.080 --> 59:33.480
that they had to repay, they couldn't repay.

59:33.480 --> 59:36.280
And if you kind of examine the bankruptcy code,

59:38.080 --> 59:41.000
it's precisely designed for a situation like this,

59:41.000 --> 59:44.040
where it's kind of this resting place you can go

59:44.040 --> 59:48.520
to kind of restructure your business.

59:48.520 --> 59:51.200
Now, the problem was that every other company

59:51.200 --> 59:54.440
that had gone bankrupt, the shareholders got wiped out.

59:54.440 --> 59:56.560
And so the market's seeing every previous example,

59:56.560 --> 59:57.600
the shareholders get wiped out,

59:57.600 --> 59:59.680
the assumption is the stock's gonna go to zero.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.400
But that's not what the bankruptcy code says.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.080
What the bankruptcy code says

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:07.680
is that the value gets apportioned based on value.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.320
And if you could prove to a judge

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.320
that there was the assets worth more than the liabilities,

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.800
then the shareholders actually get

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.040
to keep their investment in the company.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.680
And that was the bet we made.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.960
And so we stepped into the market,

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.640
we bought 25% of the company in the open market for,

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:25.200
we had to pay up, it started out at 34 cents.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:28.320
I think there were 300 million shares.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.920
So it was at $100 million value.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.480
By the time we were done, we paid an average of,

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.600
we paid 60 million for 25% of the business.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.720
So about $240 million for the equity of the company.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.720
And then we had to get on the board

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.440
to convince the directors the right thing to do.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.720
And the board was in complete panic,

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.960
didn't know what to do,

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.760
spending a ton of money on advisors.

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.120
And I was a shareholder activist,

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.960
four years into Pershing Square,

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.800
and no one had any idea what we were doing.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.640
They thought we were crazy.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.920
Every day we'd go into the market,

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.880
we'd buy this penny stock,

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.480
and we'd file what's called a 13-D,

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.240
every 1% increase in our stake.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.520
And people just thought we were crazy.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.560
We're buying stock in a company that's gonna go bankrupt.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.240
Bill, you're gonna lose all your money.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.160
Run, okay.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.200
And I said, well, wait, Bankruptcy Code says

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.840
that if there's more asset value than liabilities,

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.400
we should be fine.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:23.960
And the key moment, if you're looking for fun moments,

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.440
is there's a woman named Maddie Buxbaum,

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.880
who was from the Buxbaum family.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:32.000
And her cousin, John, was chairman of the board,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.680
CEO of the company.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.920
And I said, as she calls me,

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.640
after we disclose our stake in the company,

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.720
she's like, Billy Ackman,

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.080
I'm really glad to see you here.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.680
And I met her like, I don't think it was a date,

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.760
but I kind of met her in a social context

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.840
when I was like 25 or something.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.280
And she said, look, I'm really glad to see you here.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:51.200
And I said, anything I can do to help you.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.200
Call me.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.280
I said, sure.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.120
We kept trying to get on the board of the company.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.720
They wouldn't invite us on.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.920
Couldn't really run a proxy contest,

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.920
not with a company going bankrupt.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.760
And their advisors actually were Goldman Sachs,

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.600
and they're like, you don't want the fox in the hen house.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.600
And they were listening to their advisors.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.480
So I called Maddie up and I said,

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.600
Maddie, I need to get on the board of the company to help.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:13.560
And she says, you know what?

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.000
I will call my cousin and I'll get it done.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.520
Like, you know, she calls back a few hours later,

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.760
you'll be going onto the board.

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.760
I don't know what she said to her cousin.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.600
But she was convincing.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.440
Next thing you know,

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:27.760
I'm invited to on the board of the company

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.360
and the board is talking about

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.440
the old equity of general growth.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:33.840
Old equity is what you talk about

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.000
that the shareholders are getting wiped out.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:35.840
I said, no, no, no.

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:40.160
The board represents the current equity of the company.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.320
And I'm a major shareholder.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:42.520
John's a major shareholder.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.720
There's plenty of asset value here.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.800
This company should be able to be restructured

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.800
for the benefit of shareholders.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.320
And we led a restructuring for the benefit of shareholders.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.760
And it took, let's say eight months

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.720
and the company emerged from chapter 11.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.880
We made an incremental investment into the company

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.040
and the shareholders kept the vast majority of their

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:05.760
investment, all the creditors got their face

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:09.160
amount of their investment, par plus accrued interest.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.720
And it was a great outcome.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.080
All the employees kept their jobs.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.440
The mall stayed open.

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.760
There was no liquidation in the bankruptcy system

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.040
worked the way it should.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.040
I was in court all the time.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.760
And the first meeting with the judge,

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.440
the judge is like, look, this would never have happened

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.720
were it not for a financial crisis.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.360
And once the judge said, I knew we were gonna be fine

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.960
because the company really not done

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.160
anything fundamentally wrong,

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.760
maybe a little too aggressive in how they borrowed money.

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.040
And stock went from 34 cents to $31 a share.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.440
And actually fun little anecdote.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.840
We made a lot of people a lot of money

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.760
who followed us into it.

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.440
I got a lot of nice thank you notes

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.080
which you get on occasion in this business, believe it or not.

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.360
And then one day I get a voicemail.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.880
This is when there was something called voicemail

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.280
probably a few years later.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:58.080
And it's a guy with a very thick Jamaican accent

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.280
leaving a message for Bill Ackman.

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:04.560
So I returned all my calls, called the guy back.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.080
He's like, hi, it's Bill Ackman.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.160
I'm just returning your call.

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:11.600
He's like, oh, Mr. Ackman, thank you so much for calling me.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.720
I said, oh, how can I help?

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.080
He says, I wanted to thank you.

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.520
I said, what do you mean?

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:19.480
He said, I saw you on CNBC a couple of years ago

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.680
and you were talking about this general growth

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:22.520
and the stock.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.440
I said, where was the stock at the time?

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.720
He said, it's 60 cents or something like this.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.120
And I bought a lot of stock.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.200
And I'm like, well, how much did you invest?

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:35.160
Oh, I invest all of my money in the company.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.080
And he was a New York City taxi driver

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:41.840
and he invested like $50,000 or something like this

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.080
at 60 cents a share.

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.520
And he was still holding it and he went into retirement

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:49.200
and he made, you know, 50 times his money.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.560
And, you know, those are the moments

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.880
that you feel pretty good about investing.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.240
Well, it gave you confidence through that

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.640
once a penny stock and I'm sure you were getting

01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:00.800
a lot of naysayers and people saying that this is crazy.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:02.200
It's the same thing.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.240
You just do the work.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.520
Like we got a lot of pushback from our investors actually

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.440
because we had never invested in a bankrupt company before.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.840
It's a field called distressed investing

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:14.240
and they're dedicated distressed investors

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:16.160
and we weren't considered one of them.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.360
So Bill, what are you doing?

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.920
You don't know anything about distressed investing.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:21.120
You don't know anything about bankruptcy investing.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.320
But I can read.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.480
And you learned.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.680
And I learned.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:30.080
And it sometimes is very helpful not to be a practitioner,

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.240
an expert in something

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.200
because you get used to the conventional wisdom.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.440
And so we just, you know,

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.840
abstractly read the step back and look at the facts

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.520
and it was just a really interesting setup

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:43.440
for one of the best investments we ever made.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:46.280
How hard is it to learn some of the legal aspects of this?

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.680
Like you mentioned bankruptcy code.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:52.520
Like I imagine it's very sort of dense language

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:55.320
and dense ideas and the loopholes

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.520
and all that kind of stuff.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.200
Like if you're just stepping in

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.080
and you've never done distressed investing,

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:01.680
how hard is it to figure out?

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:03.560
It's not that hard.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:04.760
No, it's not that hard.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:05.600
Okay.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.520
I mean, I literally read a book on distressed investing.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.360
Okay.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.240
Ben Branch or something, something on distressed investing.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.560
So you were able to pick up the intuition from that,

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:17.040
just all the basic skills involved,

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.360
the basic facts to know, all that kind of stuff.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.080
Most of the world's knowledge

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.720
has already been written somewhere.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.560
You just gotta read the right books.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:27.600
And also had great lawyers,

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.080
built up some great relationships.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.920
We work with Sullivan and Cromwell

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.040
and the lawyer there named Joe Schenker,

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.400
who I met earlier in my career.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.880
Pershing Square is actually my second act

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:38.720
in the hedge fund business.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.840
I started a fund called Gotham Partners when I was 26.

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.160
One of my early investments was a company

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.000
called Rockefeller Center Properties

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.880
that was heading for bankruptcy.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:49.440
And the lawyer on the other side representing Goldman Sachs

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.160
was a guy named Joe Schenker.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.760
So he was like an obvious phone call

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.640
because he had yet another real estate bankruptcy.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.960
And that one we did very well,

01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:58.520
but I missed the big opportunity.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:03.000
And I suffered severe psychological torture

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.320
every time I walked by Rockefeller Center

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.680
because we knew more about that property than anyone else,

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.440
but I knew less about deal making

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.640
and didn't have the resources.

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:12.120
And I was 28 years old or 27.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.760
And they hired a better lawyer than we did.

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.440
And they outsmarted us on that one in a way.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.000
So I said, okay, I'm gonna go hire this guy

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:21.840
the next time around.

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.040
So.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.200
Okay, we'll probably talk about Rockefeller Center

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.160
and some failures.

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:31.120
But first you said Fox in the hen house.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:31.960
Yes.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.520
Something that the board and the chairman were worried about.

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.920
Why would they call you a Fox?

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.000
So you keep saying,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.040
activists investing is nothing to worry about.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.120
It's always good.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:43.960
Sure.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:44.920
Mostly good.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:49.160
But that expression applied in this context,

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.160
they were still worried about that.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.000
Sure.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.120
And so maybe there's a million questions here,

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:54.960
but first of all,

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.400
what is the process of getting on the board look like?

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:01.320
So a board can always admit a member at any time

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.720
in their discretion for a US company.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.200
Maybe there's some jurisdiction

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.120
where you need a shareholder vote,

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:08.960
but in most cases,

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.600
a board can vote on any director that they want.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:14.400
If the board doesn't invite you to the party,

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.000
you have to apply to be a member in effect.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.600
And that process is called,

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.720
basically is the process of ultimately running

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:27.160
a slate for a meeting where you propose a number,

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.840
any shareholder can propose to be on a board of a company

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:33.080
if they own one share of stock in the business.

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:36.560
And getting your name in the company's,

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.600
the materials they sent to shareholders,

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.320
those rules were written in a way that were very unfavorable

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:43.440
and very difficult to get in the door.

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.960
And those rules have been changed very recently

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:48.360
where the company now has to include a candidate,

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.720
really all the candidates in the materials

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:51.560
they sent to shareholders

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.040
so the shareholders pick the best ones.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.520
When we applied, or we applied,

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.040
when we ran proxy contests in the past,

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.400
that was not the case.

01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.960
And so you have to spend a lot of money,

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.840
mostly mailing fees and all kinds of other legal

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.480
and other expenses to let everyone know you're running,

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:05.920
like running a political campaign.

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:06.760
And then you gotta run around

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:08.840
and meet with the big shareholders,

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:11.880
fly around the country, explain your case to them.

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.680
And then there's a shareholder meeting.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:17.240
And if you get a majority of the votes, you get on.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:22.400
What's this proxy contest slash battle idea?

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.240
What's the-

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.240
So the battle comes when they don't want you gone.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:28.840
And a lot of that has to do with, I would say, pride,

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.240
normal human kind of stuff.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:33.480
A lot of times a board of an underperforming company

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:36.920
doesn't wanna admit that they've underperformed.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.640
And boards of directors 20 years ago

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:42.840
when we started Pershing Square were pretty cushy jobs.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.800
Sit on a board of a company,

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:48.080
you play golf with the CEO at nice golf courses,

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:49.440
you make a few hundred thousand dollars a year

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.600
to go to four meetings.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.320
It was kind of a rubber stamp world where boards,

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:59.920
at the end of the day, the CEO really ran the show.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.760
Once shareholders could actually dislodge board members

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.720
and they could lose their seats,

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.240
and that's really the rise of shareholder activism,

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.320
boards started taking their responsibilities

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:14.600
much more seriously because directors are typically,

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:17.520
there are many cases, they're retired CEOs.

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.360
This is kind of how they're making a living

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.440
in the later part of their career.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.040
They sit on four boards, they collect a million,

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.840
a million and a half dollars a year in directors fees.

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.480
If they get thrown off the board by the shareholders,

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:30.560
that's embarrassing, obviously,

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.720
and it affects their ability to get on other boards.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:36.040
So again, incentives, as I said earlier,

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.120
drive all human behavior.

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.720
The incentives of directors,

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.480
they wanna preserve their board seats.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.480
So if you have a director,

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.120
now the directors on board serve in various roles.

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.160
The most vulnerable ones are ones who, for example,

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.840
chair a compensation committee.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.720
And if they put in a bad plan or they overpaid management,

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.560
they're subject to attack by shareholders.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:56.800
But these contests are not dissimilar to political contests

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:57.920
where there's mudslinging

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.000
and the other side puts out false information about you,

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
you have to respond,

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.680
and they're spending the shareholders' money.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.400
So they have sort of unlimited resources

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.480
and you're spending your and your investors' money

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.600
when you're a small firm, finite resources.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.840
So they can outspend you, they can sue you,

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:17.560
they can try to jigger the mechanics

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:19.920
in such a way that you're gonna lose.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:23.080
There's some unfortunate stuff that's happened in the past,

01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.400
manipulative stuff.

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.080
So also some stuff that's public,

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.880
like in the press and all this kind of stuff?

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:32.880
Oh, of course, there'd be articles about the dirty days

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.760
where they would go through your trash

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:40.160
and make sure that you're not sleeping around

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.720
and things like this.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.160
That's okay.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.000
I'm subject to, I can survive extreme scrutiny

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.920
because I've been through this for a long time.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.440
So you're saying the fat and happy hens

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.920
can get very wolf-like

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.320
when the fox is trying to break in?

01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.680
Is this how we extend the-

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.200
Well, the fox is a threat to the hens.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:05.040
Yeah, but you've just,

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:07.600
the charismatic fox just explained to me

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.720
why the fox is good for everybody in the hen house.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:11.560
At the end of the day,

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.240
it's actually very good on a board to have someone,

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:17.000
if you, there are many examples over time

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.600
and some handful of high profile ones

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.080
where the board fought tooth and nail

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.000
to keep the activists off the board.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.320
And then once the activists got on the board

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:25.160
and they said, you know, the guy's not so bad after all,

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:26.720
the shareholders voted them on.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:28.160
He's got some decent ideas

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:30.240
and let's all work together to have this work out.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:33.840
And so there are very few cases where after the contest,

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.960
when the, and by the way,

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:36.520
sometimes you have to replace the entire board.

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:37.360
We've done that.

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:39.960
But some, in most cases,

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:42.520
you got a couple of seats on the board and it's just,

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:45.120
you know, you want to build a board

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.760
comprised of diverse points of view.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.920
And that's how you get to the truth.

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:53.880
What was the most dramatic battle for the board

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:55.680
that you have been a part of?

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:58.320
The Canadian Pacific proxy contest.

01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.880
So Canadian Pacific was like,

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.520
considered the most iconic company in Canada.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:05.000
It literally built the country

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.640
because the rail that got built over Canada

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:12.240
is what united the various provinces into a country.

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.560
And then over time,

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.800
because the railroad business is pretty good business,

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.120
they built a ton of hotels,

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:19.400
they owned a lot of real estate

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.480
and it became this massive conglomerate,

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:25.280
but it was horribly mismanaged for decades.

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.720
By the time we got involved,

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.800
it was by far the worst run railroad in North America.

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.560
They had the lowest profit margins.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.320
They had the lowest growth rate.

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.560
Every quarter management would make excuses

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:37.520
generally about the weather

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.280
as to why they underperformed versus,

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.880
and there there's a direct competitor,

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.400
company called Canadian National

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.200
as the rail goes right across the country.

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.080
And Canadian Pacific would constantly be complaining

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:47.280
about the weather.

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:51.680
And basically, you know, same country, same regions,

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.120
tracks weren't that far apart.

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.720
But it was a really important company

01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.120
and being on this board was like an honorary thing.

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.240
And everyone on the board was an icon of Canada.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.560
The chairman of the Royal Bank of Canada,

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.800
the head of the most important grain,

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.240
privately held grain company,

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.680
the sort of an important collection

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:14.880
of big time Canadian executives.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:19.640
Here we were, this is probably about 13 years ago.

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:24.640
And still maybe 44 year old from New York,

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.320
not Canadian, basically saying

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:31.120
this is the worst run railroad in North America.

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:34.640
And we bought 12% of the railroad at a really low price.

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:38.720
And we brought with us to our first meeting

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.680
the greatest railroader ever,

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:41.680
a guy named Hunter Harrison

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.920
who had turned around Canadian National.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.240
So we'd like, okay, we've got a great asset.

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.000
We've got the greatest railroad CEO of all time.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.720
He's come out of retirement

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:51.640
to step in and run the railroad.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:53.320
And we brought him to the first meeting

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.280
and they wouldn't even meet with him.

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:59.280
And they wouldn't certainly wouldn't consider hiring him.

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.240
And that led us to a proxy contest.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:06.240
And this is where the engine starts churning

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.120
to figure out how this contest can be won.

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.240
So what's involved?

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.880
Well, the key is we had to one,

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.840
come up with a group of directors

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:17.640
who would be willing to step into a battle.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.440
And we didn't want a bunch of New York directors

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.440
or even American directors.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:22.800
We wanted Canadians.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.560
The problem was this was the most iconic company in Canada.

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:27.280
And we wanted high profile people.

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.360
So we talked to all the high profile people in Canada.

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.480
Every one of them would say, Bill, you're entirely right.

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.240
This thing is the worst right off the road.

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.640
It needs to be fixed.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.600
But I see John at the club.

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.640
I see him at the Toronto club.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:41.160
I can't do this, but you're totally right.

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.920
And we had to, and that was the concern

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:47.600
because you have to file your materials by a certain day.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.840
You got to put together a slate.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:50.160
We needed a big slate because we knew

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.720
that we had to replace basically all the directors.

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:56.160
And then one, I spoke to a guy

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.600
who was one of the wealthiest guys in Canada

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:01.480
who was on the board at one point in time.

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:05.600
And he said, Bill, I have an idea for you.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.680
There's this woman, Rebecca McDonald.

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:09.360
Why don't you give her a call?

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.520
And I called Rebecca and she was the first woman

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.320
to take a company public in Canada as CEO.

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.960
And she was a kind of anti-establishment,

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:21.680
not afraid to take on anything kind of person.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.080
And I called her, we had a great conversation.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.360
And she was in the Dominican Republic at her house

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.120
and I flew down to see her.

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:31.000
And she said, yeah, I'm all in.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.000
And actually once we got her, that enabled us to get others.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
And then we put together our slate

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.360
and we had some pretty interesting dialogue

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.200
with the company.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.760
They tried to embarrass us all the time.

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.520
In the press, publicly, what are we talking about?

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.160
Press, publicly.

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:48.040
At one point I wrote an email saying,

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:50.560
look, let's come to peace on this thing.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:54.680
But if we don't, you're really forcing my hand

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:57.560
and we're gonna have to rent the largest hall in Toronto

01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.080
and invite all the shareholders

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.920
and it's gonna be embarrassing for management.

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.800
And I made reference to some nuclear winter.

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.400
Let's not have it be a nuclear winter.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.520
And they thought they'd embarrass me

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:09.920
by releasing the email, but it would only inspire us.

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.440
And we rented the largest hall in Canada

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.520
and we put up a presentation walking through,

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.360
here's Canadian national, here's Canadian Pacific.

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:18.320
Here's what they said, here's what they did.

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.280
And we had Hunter get up.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:23.440
He was this incredibly charismatic guy from Tennessee.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:26.200
An amazing, he's like a lion.

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:30.480
Incredibly deep voice, unbelievable track record,

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.240
incredibly respected guy.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:35.080
It's like getting Michael Jordan to come out of retirement

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.640
and come run the company.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.160
And Hunter was incredible.

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:43.040
And other, Paul Howell, other members of my team

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.620
were super engaged.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:49.160
And the board, Canadians are known to be nice.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:50.760
And one of the problems we had is shareholders

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.960
would never tell management or the board

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.760
that they were losing.

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.160
It was not until the night before the meeting

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.920
when the vote came in, the management realized

01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:01.840
that they lost, we got 99% of the vote

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:05.000
and they offered us a deal.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.240
When they begged us to take a deal,

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.520
they said, look, we'll resign tonight

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.240
so that we don't have to come to the meeting tomorrow.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.800
That's how embarrassed they were.

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.840
That was kind of an interesting one.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:18.680
So in both this proxy battle and the company itself,

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:21.840
this was one of your more successful investments.

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:22.680
It was.

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:24.240
I mean, the stock's up about 10 times

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.000
and it's an industrial company.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
It's a railroad and it's not like a growth,

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
like it's not Google.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:30.840
So it's a great story.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.280
And the company is now run by a guy named Keith Creel.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:36.120
And Keith, it was Hunter's protege.

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:38.960
And in many ways, he's actually better than Hunter.

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:39.960
He's doing an incredible job.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:43.040
And the sad part here is we made it,

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:45.240
we did very well, we tripled our money over several years.

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:46.840
And then I went through a very challenging period

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:49.320
because of a couple of bad investments.

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:52.040
And we had to sell our Canadian Pacific to pay,

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.520
to raise capital to pay for investors who were leaving.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:00.080
But we had another opportunity to buy it back

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.320
in the last couple of years.

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.760
And so we're now again, a major owner of the company.

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.560
But had we held onto original stock,

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.360
it would have been epic, if you will.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.240
So on this one, you were right.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.080
Yes.

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.640
And I read an article by you,

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.080
and there's many articles about you.

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:20.320
I read an article that said,

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.080
Bill is often right,

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:26.600
but you approach it with a scorched earth approach

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:30.520
that can often do more, sort of can do damage.

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:31.960
I haven't read the often right article,

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.600
but the good news is we are often right.

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:36.080
And I say we because we're a team,

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.920
small team, but a fortunately very successful one.

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:42.480
So our batting average as investors is extremely high.

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.600
And the good news is our records totally public.

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.600
You can see everything we've ever done.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.600
But the press doesn't generally write

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:50.320
about the success stories.

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.600
They write about the failures.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.240
And so we've had some epic failures, big losses.

01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.360
Good news is they've been a tiny minority of the cases.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:03.160
Now, no one likes to lose money.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.240
It's even worse to lose other people's money.

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:08.160
And I've done that occasionally.

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.280
The good news is if you stuck with us, you've done very well.

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:13.960
You know, over a long time.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:16.560
On a small tangent, since we're talking about boards,

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:19.560
did you get a chance to see what happened

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.280
with the OpenAI board?

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.080
Cause I'm talking to Sam Altman soon.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:25.960
Is there any insight you have,

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.480
just maybe lessons you draw from this kind of,

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.320
these kinds of events,

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.160
especially with an AI technology company,

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.800
such dramatic things happening?

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.320
Yeah, that was an incredible story.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.200
Look, governance really matters.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.880
And the governance structure of OpenAI,

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:43.520
I think leaves something to be desired.

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:45.840
You know, I think Sam's point was this,

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:48.000
and maybe Elon Musk's point,

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.760
originally set up as a nonprofit.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.720
And it reminds me, actually,

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:57.440
I invested in a nonprofit run by a former Facebook founder

01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:59.760
where he was gonna create a Facebook-like entity

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:04.400
for nonprofits to promote goodness in the world.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.640
And the problem was he couldn't hire the talent he wanted

01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:08.040
cause he couldn't grant stock options.

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:10.200
He couldn't pay market salaries.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.280
And ultimately he ended up selling the business

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:13.960
to a for-profit.

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:16.320
So it taught me for-profit solutions to problems

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:17.720
are much better than nonprofits.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.360
And here you had kind of a blend, right?

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:21.280
It was set up as a nonprofit,

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.840
but I think they found the same thing.

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.080
They couldn't hire the talent they wanted

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.720
without having a for-profit subsidiary.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:30.960
But the nonprofit entity, as I understand it,

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:35.320
owns a big chunk of OpenAI.

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:37.840
And the investors own sort of a capped interest

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:40.280
where their upside is capped

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:43.280
and they don't have representation on the board.

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:47.680
And I think that was a setup for a problem.

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.920
And that's clearly what happened here.

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.120
And there's, I guess,

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.960
some kind of complexity in the governance.

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:58.200
I mean, because of this nonprofit and capped profit thing,

01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.440
it seems like there's a bunch of complexity

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:04.200
and non-standard aspects to it

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:08.720
that perhaps also contributed to the problem.

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:11.640
Yeah, governance really matters.

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:13.400
Boards of directors really matter.

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:18.880
Giving the shareholders the right to have input

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.680
at least once a year on the structure

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:23.440
of the governance of companies is really important.

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:27.640
And private, venture-backed boards are also not ideal.

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:30.240
I'm an active investor in ventures.

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:34.160
And there are some complicated issues that emerge

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:38.200
in private as sort of venture stage companies

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:42.000
where board members have somewhat divergent incentives

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.560
from the long-term owners of a business.

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.600
And what you see a lot in venture boards

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:49.680
is they're presided over generally

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:51.600
by venture capital investors

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.800
who are big investors in the company.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.120
And oftentimes it's more important to them

01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:01.120
to have the public perception that they're good directors

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:03.600
so they get the next best deal.

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.840
If they have a reputation

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.560
for kind of taking on management too aggressively,

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.840
word will get out in the small community of founders

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.680
and they'll miss the next Google.

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:14.760
And so their interests are not just

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:16.480
in that particular company.

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:19.600
That's also one of the problems.

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.640
Again, it all comes back to incentives.

01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:23.160
Can you explain to me the difference

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:26.560
of venture-backed like VCs and shareholders?

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:28.960
So this means before the company goes public?

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:31.720
Yeah, so private venture-backed companies,

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:33.360
the boards tend to be very small.

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:37.680
Could be a handful of the venture investors in management.

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:42.000
They're often very rarely independent directors.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.680
It's just not an ideal structure.

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:45.360
Oh, I see, you want independent.

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:46.800
It's beneficial to have people

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.840
who have an economic interest in the business

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:51.440
and they care only about the success of that company

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.880
as opposed to someone who,

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:56.080
if you think about the venture business,

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.960
getting into the best deals

01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.080
is more important than any one deal.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:03.800
And you see cases where the boards go along with,

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:06.960
in some sense, cases, bad behavior on the part of management

01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.200
because they want a reputation

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.920
for being kind of a founder-friendly director.

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.080
You know, that's kind of problematic.

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.560
You don't have the same issue in public company boards.

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.840
So we talked about some of the big wins

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.760
and you're a track record,

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:22.920
but you said there were some big losses.

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:27.120
So what's the biggest loss of your career?

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.040
Biggest loss of my career

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:29.960
is a company called Valiant Pharmaceuticals.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:31.640
We made an investment in a business

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:33.640
that didn't meet our core principles.

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.000
The problem in the pharmaceutical industry,

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.160
and there are many problems, as I've learned,

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.520
is it's a very volatile business, right?

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:41.040
It's based on drug discovery.

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:46.240
It's based on predicting the future revenues of a drug

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:50.760
before it goes off patent, lots of complexities.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.920
And we thought we had founded

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:54.600
a pharmaceutical company we could own

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:56.040
because of a very unusual founder

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.880
and the way he approached his business.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:02.000
It was a company where another activist

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.600
was on the board of directors of the company

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:06.280
and kind of governing and overseeing the day-to-day decisions.

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:08.760
And we ended up making a passive investment in the company.

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:09.760
And up until this point in time,

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.320
we really didn't make passive investments.

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.200
And the company made a series of decisions

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.800
that were, you know, disastrous.

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.800
And then we stepped in to try to solve the problem.

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.280
It was the first time I ever joined a board

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:23.120
and the mess was much larger than I realized from the outside

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:25.080
and then I was kind of stuck.

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:29.280
And it was very much a confidence sensitive strategy

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.800
because they built their business

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.280
by acquiring pharmaceutical assets

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.960
and they often issued stock when they acquired targets.

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:40.120
And so once the market lost confidence in management,

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:43.120
the stock price got crushed and it impaired their ability

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:46.920
to continue to acquire low costs, you know, drugs.

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.920
And we lost $4 billion.

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:51.000
$4 billion.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:51.840
Yeah.

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:52.680
How's that for a big loss?

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.520
That's...

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:54.360
It's up there.

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:56.840
I'm sweating this whole conversation,

01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:59.800
both the wins and the losses and the stakes involved.

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:03.080
And by the way, that loss catalyzed other,

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.200
what I call mark to market losses.

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.920
So very high profile, huge number, disastrous press.

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.040
Then people said, okay, Bill's gonna go out of business.

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:16.080
So we're gonna bet against everything he's doing.

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.400
And we know his entire portfolio

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.120
because we only own 10 things.

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:23.960
And we were short a company called Herbalife very famously.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.520
We've only really shorted two companies.

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:27.120
The first one, there's a book.

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:29.560
The second one, there's a movie, okay.

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:30.760
We're no longer short companies.

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:34.200
But some people pushed up the price of Herbalife,

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:37.240
which is when you're a short seller,

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:39.400
that's catastrophic, I can explain that.

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:43.000
And then they also shorted the other stocks that we owned.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.920
And so that valiant loss led to an overall

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:49.480
more than 30% loss in the value of our portfolio.

01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:53.080
The valiant loss was real and was crystallized.

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:55.960
You end up selling the position, taking that loss.

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.760
Most of the other losses were

01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:59.200
what I would call mark to market losses.

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.760
They were temporary.

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.200
But many people go out of business

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:05.400
because as I mentioned before, large move in a price,

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:08.120
if investors are redeeming or you have leverage,

01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:09.600
it can put you out of business.

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.600
And if people assumed if we got put out of business,

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:15.040
we'd have to sell everything or cover our short position.

01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.280
And that would make the losses even worse.

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:17.760
So Wall Street is kind of ruthless.

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:19.920
So they can make money off of that whole thing.

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:20.760
Absolutely.

01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:22.000
So they use the opportunity of valiant

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.160
to try to destroy you reputation financially

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:29.040
and then capitalize and make money off of that.

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:29.880
Yes.

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:32.240
Well, that's a terrifying spot to be in.

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.240
What was the light going through that?

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:35.560
That was pretty grim.

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:38.040
It was, it's actually much worse than that

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.720
because I had a lot of stuff going on personally as well.

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:42.800
So, and these things tend to be correlated.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.320
The valiant mistake came at a time

01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:47.640
where I was contemplating my marriage.

01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:51.080
And I was also, you know,

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.280
the problem with the hedge fund business

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.160
is when you get to a certain scale,

01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:57.160
the CEO becomes like the chief marketing officer

01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.440
of the business and I'm really an investor

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.360
as opposed to a marketing guy.

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:01.920
But when you have investors who give you

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:04.320
a few hundred million dollars, they wanna see you,

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.920
you know, once a year, Bill, I'd love to see you for an hour.

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:08.840
But if you've got a couple hundred of those,

01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:11.440
you find yourself on a plane to the Middle East,

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:14.320
to Asia, flying around the country.

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:18.600
This was pre-Zoom and that takes you away

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.720
from the investment process.

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.360
You have to delegate more.

01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:25.360
That was a contributor to the valiant mistake.

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:28.080
So, now we lose a ton of money on valiant.

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:29.760
My ex-wife and I were, you know,

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:32.120
talking about separating, getting divorced.

01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:34.400
I put that on hold because I didn't wanna make a decision

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.480
in the middle of this crisis

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.360
and things just kept getting worse.

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.760
We were also sued.

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:41.960
When you lose a lot of money,

01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:43.000
we didn't get sued by our investors,

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.720
but we got sued by a shareholder

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:47.760
because when the stock price goes down, shareholders sue.

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.800
We'd done nothing wrong other than make a big mistake.

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:52.600
But, you know, so you have litigation,

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.760
your investors are taking their money out.

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.600
I'm in the middle of a divorce.

01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:59.600
The divorce starts to proceed.

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:04.440
My ex-wife's lawyer's expectations of what my net worth was

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.920
was about three times what it actually was

01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:10.080
and it was going lower right in the middle of this.

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:12.480
And I remember the lawyer saying,

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:16.480
look, Bill, you know, we've estimated your net worth at X,

01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:18.920
but don't worry, we only want a third.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:22.200
But X was three X, so a third was a hundred percent.

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.440
And then we had litigation

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:30.480
and actually never before publicly disclosed

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:32.680
and I'll share it with you now.

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:35.360
We had a public company

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:38.920
that owned about a third of our portfolio

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:41.640
that was called our version of Berkshire Hathaway.

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.960
I tried to, you know, learn from Mr. Buffett over time

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.120
and it was so to speak permanent capital.

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:48.400
The beauty of, the problem with hedge funds

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:51.320
is people can take their money out every quarter.

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.320
What Buffett has is a company

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.440
where people want to take their money out,

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:56.600
they sell the stock, but the money stays.

01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:00.040
So we set up a similar structure in October of 2014.

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:02.360
And then a year later, Valiant happens.

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:04.680
And then a year later, we're in the middle of the mess

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:05.880
and we're still in the mess.

01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:09.680
You know, like by kind of mid 2017,

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:11.080
we've got litigation underway

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:14.560
and another activist investor,

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:17.200
a firm called Elliott Associates,

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:20.160
which is run by a guy named Paul Singer,

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:23.240
took a big position in our public company

01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:25.200
that was the bulk of our capital.

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:27.880
And they shorted all the stocks that we owned

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:29.320
and they went long the short,

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:32.160
probably went long the short that we were short.

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.840
And they were making a bet that we'd be forced to liquidate.

01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.880
And then they would make money on, you know,

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:39.120
our public company was trading at a discount

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.040
to what all the securities were.

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:42.480
So they bought the public company,

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.280
they shorted the securities.

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:46.600
And then they, you know, came to see us

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:48.400
and to try to, you know, be activists

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.360
and force us to liquidate.

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.440
And that's sort of-

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:54.240
Wow.

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:55.240
So I thought this was gonna be-

01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:56.320
Wow.

01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:59.320
I envisioned an end where the divorce

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.280
takes all of my resources,

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:04.160
the permanent capital vehicle ends up getting liquidated

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:07.640
and another activist in my industry puts me out of business.

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:11.960
And I had met Neri Oxman right around this time

01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:14.160
and I had fallen completely in love with her.

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.440
And I was envisioning a world where I was bankrupt,

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:20.520
a judge found me guilty of, you know, whatever.

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.400
You know, he sends me off to jail,

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.760
not that judge because he was a civil judge,

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.920
but another judge sues the SEC, Department of Justice.

01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:29.240
And I find myself in this incredible mess.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:32.080
And I decided I didn't want things to end that way.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.480
So I did something I'd never done before.

01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:37.320
I talked to all before about you don't borrow money,

01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.520
I borrowed money.

01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:43.400
And I borrowed $300 million from JP Morgan

01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:44.840
in the middle of this mess.

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:49.680
And I give JP Morgan enormous credit in seeing through it.

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:54.040
And also, you know, I had been a good client

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:54.880
over a long period of time.

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:57.520
And it's like, you know, it's a handshake bank

01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:59.120
and they bet that I would succeed.

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:01.000
And I took that money to buy enough stock

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.680
in my public company that could prevent

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:05.320
an activist from taking over

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:08.360
and effectively by control of our little public company.

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:10.920
And I got that done.

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:13.920
And that I knew was the moment, the turning point.

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:17.000
And I resolved my divorce and divorces get easier

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.720
to resolve when things are going badly.

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:19.680
I was able to resolve that.

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:21.520
We settled the litigation.

01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.440
I was buying blocks of our stock in the market.

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:24.720
I remember a day I bought a big block

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.280
of stock in the market.

01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:28.200
And I get a call from Gordon Singer,

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:29.560
who is Paul Singer's son,

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:33.240
who runs their London part of their business.

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:35.280
He's like, Bill, was that you buying that block?

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.120
I said, yes.

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.400
He's like, fuck.

01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:40.560
So he knew...

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:42.080
He knew that once I got that,

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.800
they were not gonna be able to succeed and they went away.

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.200
And that was the bottom.

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:51.520
We've had an incredible run since then.

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:53.320
And then you were able to protect your reputation

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:56.640
from the valiant failure still?

01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.520
I mean, you know, this is a business

01:32:58.520 --> 01:32:59.760
where you're gonna make some mistakes.

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:01.120
It was a big one.

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:03.440
It was very reputationally damaging.

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:08.120
The press was a total disaster, but I'm not a quitter.

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:11.040
Actually, the key moments for us,

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.080
we'd never taken our core investment principles

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:16.680
and actually really written them down.

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:18.520
Something we talked about at meetings,

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:21.840
kind of our investment team meetings.

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:22.680
I had a member of the team.

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:26.360
I said, look, go find a big piece of granite and a chisel

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.960
and let's take those core principles.

01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:30.160
I want them like Moses's 10 Commandments.

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.000
Okay, we're gonna chisel them

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.480
and then we're gonna put it up on the wall.

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:34.840
And once we produce those, we put one on everyone's desk.

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:36.880
I said, look, if we ever again veer

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:38.520
from the core principles,

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:40.680
you know, hit me with a baseball bat.

01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:41.520
Yeah.

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:42.360
And that was the bottom.

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:44.400
And ever since then, we've had the best six years

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:45.240
in the history of the firm.

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:50.240
So refocus on the fundamentals that helps the story.

01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:51.360
Love helps.

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:53.240
I literally met Neri at the absolute bottom.

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:55.840
Our first date was September 7th, 2017.

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.200
That was very close to the bottom.

01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:59.040
Actually, there's one other element to the story.

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.920
So this went on for a few months after I met her.

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:05.040
The other element is that one day I got a call from Neri.

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.800
She's like, Bill, guess what?

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:07.880
I'm like, what?

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:10.240
Brad Pitt is coming to the Media Lab.

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:12.160
He wants to see my work.

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:13.640
I'm like, that's beautiful, sweetheart.

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:16.240
I didn't know Brad Pitt was interested in your work.

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:19.800
As a man, that's a difficult phone call to take.

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:23.000
And apparently he's really interested in architecture.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.640
Okay.

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:25.960
Now Neri and I were like, you know,

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:28.280
we would WhatsApp all day every day.

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:29.760
We talked throughout the day.

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.920
Brad Pitt shows up at the Media Lab at 10 o'clock.

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:35.000
I, you know, talked to her in the morning.

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:37.480
I'd kind of text her to see how things are going.

01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:38.600
Don't hear back.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.360
And on WhatsApp, you can see like

01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:43.120
whether the other person's read it or not, okay?

01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:44.440
No response.

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:45.840
Couple hours later, send her another text.

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:47.120
No response.

01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:48.720
Six o'clock, no response.

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:49.960
Eight o'clock, no response.

01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:52.040
10 o'clock, no response.

01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:56.080
And you know, she finally calls me at 10.30

01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.840
and tells me how great Brad Pitt is.

01:34:58.840 --> 01:34:59.680
So I had this scenario.

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:02.120
Okay, a judge is gonna find me.

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.640
We're gonna lose to the judge.

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:07.520
All my assets will disappear.

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:08.880
And then Brad Pitt's gonna take my girlfriend.

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:10.960
Yeah, Brad Pitt's your competition.

01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:11.800
This is great.

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:13.280
So it was like a moment.

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.400
That was sort of the bottom.

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.120
And then sort of, you know, the motivational thing.

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.520
I didn't wanna lose to an activist.

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:21.560
Didn't wanna lose my girl to some other guy, so.

01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:25.000
Brad Pitt, and you emerged from all of that

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
the winner on all fronts.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.760
I'm a very fortunate guy.

01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:30.000
Very fortunate and lucky.

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:33.040
You talked about some of the technical aspects of that,

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:35.160
but psychologically, just, is there,

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:39.320
like what are you doing at night by yourself?

01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:40.160
That was a hard time.

01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:41.400
Hard time, because I was separated

01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:42.720
from my wife and my kids.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.240
I was living in, you know, not the greatest apartment.

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:50.720
You know, I had a beautiful home.

01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:53.160
And so I had to go find like a bachelor place.

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:56.480
And I was, I didn't wanna be away from my kids.

01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:59.040
I moved like 10 blocks away and I wasn't seeing them

01:35:59.040 --> 01:35:59.880
and they didn't like it.

01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:02.720
So I ended up buying an apartment I didn't like

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.000
in the same building as my kids,

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.840
like with a different entrance so I could be near them.

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:07.840
But I was home alone.

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:08.920
I got a dog.

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:11.960
That was a Babar.

01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:14.760
You can call him Babar, not the elephant.

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:16.240
He's a black Labradoodle.

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:17.080
Right, nice.

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:19.720
He was supposed to be a mini, but he's not as mini.

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:23.120
But I got him at six weeks old.

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:24.840
And he would keep me company.

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:27.320
And I started meditating, actually.

01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:30.920
And a friend recommended TM.

01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:33.560
And I would meditate 20 minutes in the morning,

01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:34.800
20 minutes in the evening.

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:37.280
And I also, big believer in exercise

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:39.800
and, you know, weightlifting and I played tennis.

01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:44.760
And I had been, this is not my first, you know,

01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:46.600
proximity to disaster.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:51.600
I had another moment in my career, like, you know, 2002.

01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:54.880
And I learned this method for dealing with

01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.920
these kind of moments, which is

01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:59.080
you just make a little progress every day.

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:02.440
So today I'm gonna wake up, I'm gonna make progress.

01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:03.920
You know, I'll make progress in the litigation.

01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:05.640
I'll make progress in the portfolio.

01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:08.000
I'll make progress with my life.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.240
And progress compounds, a bit like money compounds.

01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.760
You don't see a lot of progress in the first few weeks,

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:17.040
but like 30 days in, like, oh, okay.

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.720
You know, like, you can't look up at the mountaintop

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:19.920
where you used to be,

01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:21.880
because then you'll give up, right?

01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:24.680
But you just, okay, just make step by step by step.

01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:26.720
And then 90 days in, you're like,

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.560
okay, I was way down there.

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:31.720
Okay, I'm not, I'm not, okay, I don't wanna look up.

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:34.480
Just keep making, you know, progress, progress, progress.

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:36.280
And progress really does compound.

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:37.720
And one day you wake up and like, wow,

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:39.440
it's amazing how far I've come.

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:42.440
And if you look at a chart of Pershing Square,

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:45.720
our company, you can see the absolute bottom.

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:49.200
You can see where we were, you can see the drop,

01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:51.040
and you can see where we are now.

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:54.240
And that huge drop that felt like

01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:56.680
a complete unbelievable disaster

01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:00.040
looks like a little bump on the curve.

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:03.200
And it really gives you perspective on these things.

01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:04.920
You just have to power through.

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.200
And I think the key is, you know,

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:08.480
I've always been fortunate,

01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:11.520
like from a mental health point of view,

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:15.040
and, you know, nutrition, sleep, exercise,

01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:16.480
and a little progress every day.

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:17.920
You know, very, that's it.

01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:19.520
And, you know, good friends and family.

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:20.960
You know, I had, you know,

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:24.760
go take a walk with a friend every night, you know,

01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:28.120
a sister who loves me, and parents who are supportive.

01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:29.280
But they were, you know,

01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:32.240
they were all worried about their son, their brother.

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:34.480
You know, it was a moment.

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:38.080
And also, by the way, the other thing to think about is

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:40.400
when you recover from something like this,

01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:43.920
you really appreciate it, you know?

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:48.320
And also the, you know, as much as the media loves,

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:51.320
okay, when some successful person falls,

01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:53.440
they love writing the story of success.

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.480
They love you more the story of failure.

01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:56.680
But when you recover from that,

01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:59.560
it's kind of like the American story, right?

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:02.600
America, you know, you think of the great entrepreneurs

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:04.880
and how many failures they had before they succeeded.

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:07.280
You know, how many rocket launches, you know,

01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:10.720
did SpaceX have explode on the pad, right?

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:11.800
And then you look at success.

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:14.200
I mean, that's why Musk is so admired.

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.240
You mentioned Herbalife.

01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:17.880
Can you take me through the saga of that?

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.520
It's historic.

01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:27.200
So we at Pershing Square, short of very few stocks.

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:29.360
And the reason for that is short selling

01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:31.520
is just inherently treacherous.

01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:34.920
So if you buy a stock, it's called going long, right?

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.360
You're buying something.

01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:38.120
Your worst case scenario is you lose your whole investment.

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:39.440
You buy a stock for 100, it goes to zero,

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.280
you lose $100, right, per share.

01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:42.840
You buy one share, you lose 100.

01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:45.360
You short a stock at 100, what it means is

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:47.960
you borrow the security from someone else.

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:51.400
The analogy I gave that made it easy for people to understand

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:53.840
it's a bit like you think, you know,

01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:56.240
silver coins are gonna go down in value.

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:57.960
And you have a friend who's got a whole pile

01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:02.800
of these 1880 silver US dollars.

01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:03.640
And you think you're gonna go down in value.

01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:05.440
You say, hey, can I borrow, you know,

01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:06.960
10 of those dollars from you?

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:08.840
He's like, sure, but what are you gonna pay me to borrow?

01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:12.520
I'll pay, you know, I'll pay interest

01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:14.560
on the value of the dollars today.

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.440
So you borrow the dollars that are worth $100 each today.

01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:20.520
You pay them interest while you're borrowing them.

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:22.240
And then you go sell them in the market for $100.

01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:23.640
That's what they're worth.

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:26.440
And then they go down in price to 50.

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:29.560
You go back in, you buy the silver dollars back at $50,

01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:30.560
and you give them back to your friend.

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:31.880
Your friend is fine.

01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:33.920
You borrowed 10, you gave him the 10 back,

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.040
and he got interest in the meantime.

01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:38.000
He's happy, he made money on his coin collection.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.240
You, however, made $50 times the 10 coins.

01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:42.720
You made 500 bucks, that's pretty good.

01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:45.880
The problem with that is what if you sell them

01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.040
and they go from 100 to 1,000?

01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:50.040
Now you're gonna have to go buy them back

01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:52.880
and you're gonna pay, you know, whatever,

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:55.200
$10,000 to buy back coins, you know,

01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:59.040
that you sold for 500, you're gonna lose $9,500.

01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.880
And there's no limit, right,

01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:02.400
to how high a stock price can go.

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.760
Companies go to $3 trillion in value, right?

01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:06.680
Tesla, a lot of people short at Tesla,

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.240
saying, oh, it's overvalued.

01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:11.520
He's never gonna be able to make a successful electric car.

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:12.800
Well, I'm sure there are people

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:15.040
who went bankrupt shorting Tesla.

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:16.640
That's why we didn't short stocks.

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:20.680
But I was presented with this actually reporter

01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:24.160
that covered the other short investment we made early

01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:25.840
in the career, a company called MBIA,

01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.560
came to me and said, Bill, I found this incredible company,

01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:29.360
you gotta take a look at it, it's a total fraud

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.760
and they're scamming poor people.

01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:33.520
And we should say that MBIA was a very successful short.

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:36.520
It was, a big part of it was that we used

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.440
a different kind of instrument to short it,

01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:40.640
where we reversed that sort of,

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:43.120
we made the investment asymmetric in our favor,

01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:44.720
meaning put up a small amount of money,

01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:46.680
that works to make a fortune.

01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:48.920
Where short selling is, you kind of sell something

01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:51.160
and you have to buy it back at a higher price.

01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:53.360
Urban Life didn't have the,

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:56.160
what's called credit default swaps that you could purchase.

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.240
Not a big enough company,

01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:58.440
didn't have enough debt outstanding

01:41:58.440 --> 01:41:59.600
to be able to implement it.

01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:03.080
You had to short the stock in order to make it as successful

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:04.760
to bet against the company.

01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:06.000
And the more work I did in the company,

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:06.960
the more I was like, oh my God,

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:08.720
this thing's an incredible scam.

01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:12.200
You know, that they purport to sell weight loss shakes.

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:13.840
But in reality, they're selling, you know,

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:15.280
kind of a fake business plan.

01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:17.960
And the people that adopt it lose money

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:20.440
and they go after poor people.

01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:22.400
They go after, actually in many cases,

01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:25.920
undocumented immigrants who were pitched

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:28.840
on the American dream opportunity.

01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:30.800
And because they have few other options,

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:33.640
because they can't get legal employment,

01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:35.320
they become Urban Life distributors.

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:37.400
And it's a business where you,

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:40.000
so-called multi-level marketing or pure, you know,

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:42.920
multi-level marketing is sort of the name

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:45.280
for a legitimate company like this,

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:46.440
or it's a pyramid scheme,

01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.080
where basically your sales are really only coming

01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:50.440
from people who are, you convinced to buy the product

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:52.000
by getting them into the business.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.080
That's precisely what this company is.

01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:57.480
And like, okay, shorting a pyramid scheme seems like,

01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:59.200
one, we'll make a bunch of money,

01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:02.240
but you know, two, the world will be behind us

01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:03.840
because they're harming poor people.

01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:05.240
You know, regulators will get interested

01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:06.200
in a company like this.

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:07.040
And with that, you know,

01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:09.440
the FTC is gonna shut this thing down.

01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:10.880
And we did a ton of work,

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:14.440
and I gave this sort of epic presentation,

01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:16.200
laying out all the facts.

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:18.400
Stock got completely crushed,

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:19.880
and we were on our way.

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:22.000
And the government actually got interested early on,

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.640
launched an investigation pretty early,

01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:25.720
SEC and otherwise.

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:31.360
But then a guy named Carl Icahn showed up,

01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:34.880
and we have a little bit of a backstory,

01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:37.120
but his motivations here were not really principally driven

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:38.600
by thinking Urban Life was a good company.

01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:42.520
He thought it was a good way to hurt me.

01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:44.800
So he basically bought a bunch of stock

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.240
and said it was a really great company.

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:48.040
And, you know, Carl, at least at the time,

01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:49.480
threw his weight around a bit.

01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:52.920
I was a credible investor, had a lot of resources,

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:56.240
and that began the saga.

01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:58.440
So he was, we should say,

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:03.120
a legendary investor himself?

01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:05.840
I'd say legendary in a sense, yes, for sure.

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:06.920
An iconic.

01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:07.760
Iconic.

01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:08.640
Carl Icahn.

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:10.000
Oh, that's very well done.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.880
So definitely an iconic investor.

01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:15.160
So what was the backstory between the two of you?

01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:17.920
So I mentioned that I had another period of time

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:19.880
where significant business challenges.

01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:21.840
This was my first fund called Gotham Partners,

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:23.760
and we had a court stop a transaction

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:27.240
between a private company we owned and a public company.

01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:28.800
It's another long story.

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.360
If you want to go there, you can go there.

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:32.040
I would love to hear it as well.

01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:34.800
But it was really my deciding to wind up my former fund.

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:37.040
And we owned a big stake in a company

01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:38.560
called Hallwood Realty Partners,

01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:40.800
which was a company that owned real estate assets.

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.760
It was worth a lot more than where it was trading,

01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:45.880
but it needed an activist to really unlock the value.

01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:48.800
And we were, in fact, going out of business

01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:51.440
and didn't have the time or the resources to pursue it.

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:53.160
So I sold it to Carl Icahn.

01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:56.360
But, and I sold it to him at a premium

01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:57.320
to where the stock was trading.

01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:58.560
I think the stock was like 66.

01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:02.160
I sold it to him for 80, but it was worth about 150.

01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:05.560
And I said, look, and part of the deal was Carl's like,

01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:08.080
look, I'll give you schmuck insurance.

01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:10.320
I'll make you sure you don't look bad.

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:13.120
And I had another deal at a higher price

01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:14.800
without schmuck insurance.

01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:16.800
But I deal with Carl at a lower price for schmuck insurance.

01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:17.960
And the way the schmuck insurance went,

01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:20.480
he said, look, Bill, if I sell the stock

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:24.440
in the next three years for a higher price,

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:26.160
I'll give you 50% of my profit.

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:29.720
Well, that's a pretty good deal.

01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:31.160
So we made that deal.

01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:33.080
And because I was dealing with Carl Icahn,

01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:36.880
I had a reputation for being difficult.

01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:38.880
I was very focused on the agreement

01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:42.000
and we didn't want him to be able to be cute.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000
So the agreement said, if he sells

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.920
or otherwise transfers his shares,

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:49.920
we came up with a definition,

01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:51.840
include every version of sale, okay?

01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:52.920
Because it's Carl.

01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:57.480
Well, he then buys the stake

01:45:57.480 --> 01:45:59.680
and then makes a bid for the company.

01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:02.200
And plan is for him to get the company.

01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:04.080
And he bids like 120 a share.

01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:07.440
And the company hires Morgan Stanley to sell itself.

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:10.480
And he raises bid to 125 and the 130

01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:13.120
and eventually gets sold, I don't remember the exact price,

01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:15.160
let's say $145 a share.

01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:18.720
And Carl's not the winning bidder.

01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:23.720
And he sells his stock or he loses or transfers his shares

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:25.600
for $145 a share.

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.680
So he owes actually our investors

01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:31.080
the difference between 145 and 80 times 50%.

01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:34.880
Lawyers never like you to put like a arithmetic example.

01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:36.640
I put like a formula,

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:39.200
like out of a math book in the document

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:40.160
so there can be no confusion.

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:42.920
It was only an eight page really simple agreement.

01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:44.560
So the deal closes

01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:46.280
and he's supposed to pay us in two business days

01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:47.960
or three business days.

01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:50.080
I wait a few business days, no money comes in.

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:50.920
I call Carl.

01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:55.720
I'm like, Carl, congratulations on the Hollywood Realty.

01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:57.000
Thanks, Bill.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.240
I said, Carl, just wanna remind you,

01:46:58.240 --> 01:46:59.160
I know it's been a few years,

01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:02.480
but we have this agreement.

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:04.120
Remember the Schmuck Insurance?

01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:05.360
It's like, yeah.

01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:08.280
I said, well, you owe us our Schmuck Insurance.

01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:09.360
He said, what do you mean?

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:10.880
I didn't sell my shares.

01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:14.240
I said, do you still have the shares?

01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:15.320
He says, no.

01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:16.920
I said, well, what happened to them?

01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:21.400
Well, the company did a merger for cash

01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:24.400
and they took away my shares, but I didn't sell them.

01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:27.000
You understand what happened.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.040
So I said, Carl, I'm gonna have to sue you.

01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:30.760
I said, sue me.

01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:31.600
I'm gonna sue you.

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.480
So I sued him.

01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:38.680
And the legal system in America can take some time.

01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:40.400
And what he would do is we sued

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:43.480
and then we won in the, whatever, New York Supreme Court.

01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:47.080
And then he appealed.

01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:49.920
And you can appeal like six months after the case.

01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:53.680
We waited to the 179th day and then he would appeal.

01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:56.440
And then we fought at the next level.

01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:57.280
And then he would appeal.

01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:58.400
He appealed all the way to the Supreme Court.

01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:00.280
Of course, the Supreme Court wouldn't take the case.

01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:01.320
It took years.

01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:02.520
Now we had, as part of our agreement,

01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:05.600
we got 9% interest on the money that he owed us.

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:08.160
So I viewed it as my Carl Icahn money market account

01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:10.280
with a much higher interest rate.

01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:12.440
And eventually I won.

01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:13.520
What was the amount?

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:14.560
Just tiny.

01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:16.440
Now it was material to my investors.

01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:19.640
So my first fund, I wound it down,

01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:22.640
but I wanted to maximize everything for my investors.

01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:24.840
These are the people back me at 26 years old.

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:27.280
I was right out of business school, I had no experience

01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:28.120
and they supported me.

01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:31.040
So I'm gonna go to the end of the earth for them.

01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:33.240
And four and a half million relative to our fund

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:35.120
at the end was maybe 400 million.

01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:37.560
So it wasn't a huge number, but it was a big percentage

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:40.520
of what was left after I sold all our liquid security.

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:42.160
So I was fighting for it.

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.600
So we got four and a half million plus interest

01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:44.920
for eight years or something.

01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:47.000
That's how long the litigation took.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.200
So we got about double.

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:52.280
So he owed me $9 million, which to Carl Icahn,

01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:55.360
who had probably a $20 billion net worth at the time,

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:56.680
this was nothing.

01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:58.520
But to me it was like, okay, this is my investors money,

01:48:58.520 --> 01:48:59.680
I'm gonna get it back.

01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:05.520
And so, eventually we won, eventually he paid.

01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:10.120
And then he called me, he said, Bill, congratulations.

01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:14.560
Now we can be friends and we can invest,

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:15.800
do some investing together.

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:18.240
I'm like, Carl, fuck you.

01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:19.560
You actually said fuck you?

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:21.840
Yes, and I'm not that kind of person generally,

01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:26.920
but he made eight years to pay me, not me, even me,

01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:29.280
my investors money they owed.

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:33.600
So he probably didn't like that.

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:36.000
So he kind of hung around in the weeds

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.400
waiting for an opportunity.

01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:39.160
And then from there, I started Pershing.

01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:42.400
We had a kind of straight line up in the first 12 years,

01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:44.040
we could do nothing wrong.

01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:49.040
Then Valiant, Herbalife, he sees an opportunity

01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:52.000
and he buys the stock.

01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:55.200
He figures he's gonna run me off the road.

01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:57.000
And so that was the beginning of that.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.000
And kind of the moment, and I think it's the,

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.880
I'm told by CNBC, it's the most watched segment

01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:05.400
in business television history.

01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:08.760
They're interviewing me about the Herbalife investment

01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:12.640
on CNBC and then Carl Icahn calls into the show.

01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:15.720
And we have kind of a interesting conversation

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:17.280
where he calls me all kinds of names and stuff.

01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:18.600
So it was a moment.

01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:20.280
It was a moment in my life.

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:24.080
It wasn't public information that he was long on Herbalife?

01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:27.120
He didn't yet disclose he had a stake.

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:28.640
But he was just telling me how stupid I was

01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:30.240
to be short this company.

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:33.640
So for him, it wasn't about the fundamentals of the company.

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:36.160
It was about, it was just personal.

01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:37.680
100%.

01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:40.760
Is there part of you that regrets saying,

01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:44.560
fuck you on that phone call to Carl Icahn?

01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:45.400
No.

01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:50.640
I generally have no regrets

01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:53.280
because I'm very happy with where I am now.

01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:56.520
And I feel like, you know, it's a bit like, you know,

01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:58.480
you step on the butterfly in the forest

01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:00.240
and the world changes because, you know,

01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:02.760
every action has a reaction.

01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:04.240
You know, if you're happy with who you are,

01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:06.600
where you are in life, every decision you've made,

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:07.960
good or bad over the course of your life,

01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:09.080
got you to precisely where you are.

01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:10.720
I wouldn't change anything.

01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:12.600
He said you lost money on Herbalife.

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:16.120
So what, so he did the long-term battle.

01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:19.680
What he did is he got on the board of the company

01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:21.480
and used the company's financial resources

01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:26.480
plus his stake in the business to squeeze us.

01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:28.240
And a squeeze in short selling

01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:31.400
is where you restrict the supply of the securities.

01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:33.720
So that, there's a scarcity.

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:35.680
And then, you know, encourage people to buy the stock

01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:37.360
and you drive the stock up.

01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:38.240
And as I explained before,

01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:41.040
you're short those coins at 10, they go to 100.

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:43.320
You can lose theoretically an unlimited amount of money

01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:45.160
and that's scary.

01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:47.760
That's why we don't short stocks.

01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:50.120
That's why I didn't short stocks before this.

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:51.520
But this was, unfortunately,

01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:53.160
I had to have the personal lesson.

01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:56.200
So how much was, for him, personal versus

01:51:57.200 --> 01:51:59.480
part of sort of the game of investing?

01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:01.680
Well, he thought he could make money doing this.

01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:03.600
He wouldn't have done it if he did otherwise.

01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.560
He thought his bully pulpit,

01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:07.200
his ability to create a short squeeze,

01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:08.600
his control over the company

01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:11.840
would enable him to achieve this.

01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:14.080
And he made a billion, we lost a billion.

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:16.480
So you think it was a financial decision, not a personal?

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:18.640
It was a personal decision to pursue it.

01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:19.920
But he was waiting for an opportunity

01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:21.160
where he could make money at our expense

01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:23.400
and it was kind of a brilliant opportunity for him.

01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:25.600
Now the irony is, well, first of all,

01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:28.120
the FTC found a few interesting facts.

01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:30.640
So one, the government launched an investigation.

01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:32.160
They ended up settling with the company

01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:35.280
and the company paid $220 million in fines.

01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:39.880
I met a professor from Berkeley a couple of years ago

01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:43.080
who told me that he had been hired by the government

01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:45.160
as their expert on Herbalife

01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:46.800
and he got access to all their data,

01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:49.160
was able to prove that their appearance came.

01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:52.120
But the government ultimately settled with Carl

01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:55.480
because they were afraid they could possibly lose in court.

01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:57.560
So they settled with him.

01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:59.080
But if you look at the stock,

01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:01.200
if we'd been able to stay short the entire time,

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:02.720
we would have made a bunch of money

01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:04.760
because the stock had a $6 billion market cap

01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:07.800
and we shorted it today as probably a billion,

01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:08.840
a billion and a half.

01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:10.280
So you left the short position

01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:11.960
or whatever that's called, closed?

01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:13.440
Covered, we closed it out.

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:14.280
Yeah.

01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:16.920
We sold Valiant, we covered Herbalife.

01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:19.000
That was the resetting moment for the firm

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.520
because it would just psychologically,

01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:23.400
and the beauty of investing

01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:25.720
is you don't need to make it back the way you lost it.

01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:27.640
You can just take your loss.

01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:28.800
By the way, losses are valuable

01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:31.560
and that the government allows you to take a tax loss

01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:32.840
and that can shelter other gains.

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:35.280
And we just refocused.

01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:38.480
Can you say one thing you really like about Carl Icahn

01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:40.920
and one thing you really don't like about him?

01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:41.760
Sure.

01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:44.360
So he's a very charming guy.

01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:45.720
So in the midst of all this,

01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:50.040
the Hallwood one, he took me out for dinner

01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:51.440
to his favorite Italian restaurant.

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:52.280
Really?

01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:53.120
Yeah.

01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:54.120
We were in the middle of the litigation

01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:55.560
to see if he could resolve it.

01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:58.120
And he offered 10 million to my favorite charity.

01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:01.120
The problem was that it wasn't my money,

01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:02.080
it was my investor's money,

01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:04.760
so I couldn't settle with him on that basis.

01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:10.160
But I had the chance to spend real time with him at dinner.

01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:14.040
He's funny, he's charismatic, he's got incredible stories.

01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:17.400
And actually I made peace with him over time.

01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:20.040
We had a little hug out on CNBC,

01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:22.640
even had him to my house, believe it or not.

01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:25.720
I hosted something called the Finance Cup,

01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:26.720
which is a tennis tournament

01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:30.400
between people in finance in Europe and the US.

01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:32.760
And we had the event at my house,

01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:35.320
and one guy thought to invite Carl Icahn.

01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:37.920
And so we had Carl Icahn there to present awards.

01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:40.800
And again, I have to say, I kind of liked the guy.

01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:46.400
But I didn't like him much during this.

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:49.560
Is there, because at least from the outsider perspective,

01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:52.200
there's a bit of a personal vengeance here,

01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:55.520
or anger can build up.

01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:57.560
Do you ever worry the personal attacks

01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:01.360
between powerful investors can cloud your judgment,

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:04.000
or what is the right financial decision?

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:04.840
I think it's possible,

01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:07.200
but again, I try to be extremely economically rational.

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:11.000
And actually the last seven years been quite peaceful.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.560
I really have not been an activist

01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:17.920
in the old form for many years.

01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:21.120
And the vast majority of even our activist investments

01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:25.240
historically were very polite, respectful cases.

01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:28.000
The press, of course, focuses on the more interesting ones.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.480
Like Chipotle was one of the best investments we ever made.

01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:34.960
We got four of eight board seats,

01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:36.240
and we worked with management.

01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:37.080
It was a great outcome.

01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:39.160
I don't think there's ever been a story about it.

01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:41.600
And the stock's up almost 10 times

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.920
from the time we hired Brian Nichols, CEO.

01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:47.880
But it's not interesting because there was no battle.

01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:50.640
Whereas Herbalife, of course, was like an epic battle,

01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:52.320
even Canadian Pacific.

01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:54.000
So for a period there,

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.360
most people, when they meet me in person,

01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:57.560
they're like, well, Bill, you seem like a really nice guy.

01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:00.440
But I thought, you know, so,

01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:03.560
but things have been pretty calm for the last seven years.

01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:07.000
Of course, there's more than just the investing

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.680
that your life is about, especially recently.

01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:14.560
Let me just ask you about what's going on in the world first.

01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:17.480
What was your reaction,

01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:20.160
and what is your reaction and thoughts

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:26.040
with respect to the October 7th attacks by Hamas on Israel?

01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:29.680
You know, it's a sad world that we live in,

01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:32.000
that one, we have terrorists,

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.280
and two, that we could have such barbaric terrorism.

01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:38.160
And yeah, just a reminder of that.

01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:40.160
So there's several things I can ask here.

01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:44.840
First, on your views on the prospects of the Middle East,

01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:49.680
but also on the reaction to this war

01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:54.080
in the United States, especially on university campuses.

01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:55.400
So first, let me just ask,

01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:57.840
you've said that you're pro-Palestinian.

01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:59.920
Can you explain what you mean by that?

01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:03.280
You know, with all of my posts about Israel,

01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:06.680
I'm obviously very supportive of the country of Israel,

01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:10.240
Israel's right to exist, Israel's right to defend itself.

01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:13.680
My Arab friends, my Palestinian friends,

01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:16.600
you know, were kind of saying, hey, Bill, where are you?

01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:18.720
What about Palestinian lives?

01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:23.280
And I was pretty early in my life,

01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:24.920
a guy named Marty Peretz, who's been important to me

01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:25.760
over the course of my life,

01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:27.880
a professor, first investor in my fund,

01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:29.120
introduced me to NERI,

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:31.960
asked me when I was right out of school

01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:35.400
to join this nonprofit called the Jerusalem Foundation,

01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:37.840
which was a charitable foundation

01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:41.040
that supported Teddy Kolyk when he was mayor of Jerusalem.

01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:42.480
I ended up becoming the youngest chairman

01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:43.760
of the Jerusalem Foundation in my 30s,

01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:45.680
and I spent some time in Israel.

01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:49.280
And the early philanthropic stuff I did

01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:50.480
with the Jerusalem Foundation,

01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:52.280
the thing I was most interested in

01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:56.400
was kind of the Palestinian, the plight of the Palestinians,

01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:58.800
and kind of peaceful coexistence.

01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:01.960
And so I had kind of an early kind of perspective,

01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:03.480
and, you know, as chairman of the Jerusalem Foundation,

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:06.200
I would go into, you know, Arab communities,

01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:08.480
and I would meet the families in their homes.

01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:12.240
You know, you get a sense of the humanity of a people,

01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:14.360
and I care about humanity.

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:16.880
I generally take the side of people

01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:18.280
who have been disadvantaged.

01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:22.320
Almost all of our philanthropic work

01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:23.800
has been in that capacity,

01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:27.840
so it's sort of my natural perspective.

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:31.280
But I don't take the side of terrorists ever, obviously.

01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:34.480
And, you know, the whole thing is just a tragedy.

01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:37.960
So to you, this is about Hamas, not about Palestine.

01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:41.240
Yes, I mean, you know, the problem, of course,

01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:44.080
is when Hamas controls, you know,

01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:47.920
for the last almost 20 years has controlled Gaza.

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:50.640
You know, including the education system,

01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:53.160
they're educating, you know, you see these, you know,

01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:56.400
training videos of kindergartners

01:58:56.400 --> 01:59:00.480
indoctrinating them into hating Jews and Israel.

01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:05.200
So it's, of course, you don't like to see Palestinians

01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:07.600
celebrating, you know, some of those early videos

01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:10.200
of October 7th with, you know, dead bodies

01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:14.000
in the back of trucks and people, you know, cheering.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.280
So it's a really unfortunate situation.

01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:18.200
But, you know, I think about, you know,

01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:21.160
a Palestinian life as important and as valuable

01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:24.400
as a Jewish life, as an American life.

01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:27.040
And, you know, what do people really want?

01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:29.680
They want a place, they want a home.

01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:32.320
They want to be able to feed their family.

01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:35.960
They want a job that generates the resources

01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:36.800
to feed their family.

01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:40.040
They want their kids to have a better life than they've had.

01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:41.280
They want peace.

01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:43.320
I think these are basic human things.

01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:45.480
I'm sure the vast majority of Palestinians

01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:49.320
share these views, but it's such an embedded situation

01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:53.720
with hatred and, as I say, indoctrination.

01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:55.560
And then, you know, going back to incentives.

01:59:55.560 --> 01:59:58.440
You know, terrorists generate their resources

01:59:58.440 --> 02:00:01.920
by committing terrorism, and that's how they get funding.

02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:04.120
And that's, you know, there's a lot of graft.

02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:07.600
You know, it's a plutocracy, right?

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:10.000
The top of the terrorist pyramid, you know,

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.360
if you accept the numbers that are in the press,

02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:15.040
you know, the top leaders, you know, have billions of dollars.

02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:17.840
You know, 40 billion or so has gone into Gaza over the last,

02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:22.360
and the West Bank over the last 30 years, a number like that.

02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:26.680
And a lot of it's disappeared into some combination

02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:30.200
of corruption or tunnels or weapons.

02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:33.400
And the tragedy is, you know, you look at what Singapore

02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:37.400
has achieved in the last 30 years, right?

02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:38.840
Do you think that's still possible

02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:41.920
if we look into the future of 10, 20, 50 years from now?

02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:43.640
Absolutely.

02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:46.360
So not just peace, but...

02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:47.920
Peace comes with prosperity.

02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:51.400
You know, people are, you know,

02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:53.640
under the leadership of terrorists.

02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:55.240
You're not gonna have prosperity,

02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:56.800
and you're not gonna have peace.

02:00:56.800 --> 02:01:01.440
And I think the, you know, the Israelis withdrew in 2005,

02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:03.960
and fairly quickly Hamas took control of the situation.

02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:06.920
That should never have been allowed to happen.

02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:09.000
And I think, you know, if you think about,

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.720
I had the opportunity to spend what I would call an hour

02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:16.960
with Henry Kissinger a few months before he passed away.

02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:19.800
And we were talking about Gaza,

02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:20.960
or in the early stage of the war.

02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:22.960
He said, look, you know, this is not...

02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:28.000
You can think about Gaza as a test

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.440
of a two-state solution, it's not looking good.

02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:32.080
These were his words.

02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:34.440
So the next time around, you know,

02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:38.280
look, the Palestinian people should have their own state,

02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:40.760
but it can't be a state where, you know,

02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:44.000
40 billion resources goes in and is spent on weaponry

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.400
and missiles and rockets going into Israel.

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:52.400
And I do think a consortium of the Gulf States,

02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:54.280
you know, the Saudis and others,

02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:58.000
have to ultimately oversee the governance of this region.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.680
I think if that can happen, I think you can have peace,

02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:01.880
you can have prosperity.

02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:06.200
And, you know, I'm fundamentally an optimist.

02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:09.480
So coalition of governance.

02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:10.640
Governance matters, you know,

02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:13.240
going back to what we talked about before.

02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:16.920
And, you know, that kind of approach

02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:20.120
can give the people a chance to flourish.

02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:20.960
100%.

02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:23.880
I mean, look at what Dubai has accomplished

02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:27.480
with nomads in the desert, right?

02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:29.520
And that's become a major...

02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:31.400
It's a tourist destination.

02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:33.560
Gaza could have been a tourist destination.

02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:37.480
Take me through the saga of university presidents

02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:40.840
testifying on this topic,

02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:44.560
on the topic of protests on college campuses,

02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:47.400
protests that call for the genocide of Jewish people.

02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:50.160
And the university presidents,

02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:54.600
maybe you could describe it more precisely,

02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:59.600
but they fail to denounce the calls for genocide.

02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:02.920
So it begins on October 8th, probably.

02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:07.120
And, you know, you can do a compare and contrast

02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:11.200
with how Dartmouth managed the events of October 7th

02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:13.440
and the aftermath and how Harvard did.

02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:18.120
And on October 8th, or shortly thereafter,

02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:21.040
you know, the Dartmouth president who had been in her job

02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:23.280
for precisely the same number of months

02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:25.720
that the Harvard president had been in her job.

02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:28.760
The first thing she did was she had been in her office

02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:30.640
and the first thing she did is she got

02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:33.960
the most important professors of Middle East studies

02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:36.320
who were Arab and who were Jews,

02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:41.360
and they convened them and held, you know,

02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:44.640
an open session Q&A for students

02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:46.840
to talk about what's going on in the Middle East

02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:50.360
and began an opportunity for common understanding

02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:52.000
among the student body.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.920
And Dartmouth has been a relatively benign environment

02:03:55.920 --> 02:04:00.920
on this issue and students are able to do work

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:03.440
and there aren't disruptive protests with people

02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:06.600
with bullhorns walking into classrooms interfering with,

02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:09.240
you know, people pay today $82,000 a year,

02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:11.640
which itself is crazy to go to Harvard,

02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:14.320
but imagine your family borrows the money

02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:16.520
or you borrow the money as a student

02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:19.600
and your learning is disrupted by constant protests

02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:21.000
and the university does nothing.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.520
You know, when George Floyd died,

02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:27.600
you know, the Harvard president wrote a very strong letter

02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:29.680
denouncing what had taken place

02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:31.960
and, you know, calling this an important moment

02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:36.040
in American history and took it incredibly seriously.

02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:39.520
Her first letter about October 7th was not that,

02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:41.080
let's put it that way.

02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:43.720
And then her second letter was not that.

02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:46.520
And then ultimately, you know, she was sort of forced

02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:51.520
by the board or the pressure to make a more public statement,

02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:53.880
but it was clear that it was hard for her

02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:58.320
to come to an understanding of this terrorist act.

02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:00.600
And then the protests erupted on campus

02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:02.880
and they started out reasonably benign.

02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:06.080
And then the protesters got more and more aggressive

02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:08.600
in terms of violating university rules

02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:12.600
on things like bullying and the university did nothing.

02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:15.000
And that obviously for the Jewish students,

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.920
the Israeli students, the Israeli faculty, Jewish faculty,

02:05:18.920 --> 02:05:21.480
created an incredibly uncomfortable environment

02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:24.680
and the president seemed indifferent.

02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:26.920
And, you know, I went up to campus

02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:29.040
and I met with hundreds of students

02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:30.760
in small groups and larger groups.

02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:33.320
And they're like, Bill, why is the president doing nothing?

02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:35.760
Why is the administration doing nothing?

02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:37.160
And that was really the beginning.

02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:39.520
And that, you know, I reached out to the president,

02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:42.160
reached out to the board of Harvard.

02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:45.000
I said, look, this thing is headed in the wrong direction

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:46.880
and you need to fix it.

02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:49.720
And I have some ideas, love to share.

02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:54.520
And I got the heisman, as they say, you know,

02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:56.600
they just kept pushing off the opportunity

02:05:56.600 --> 02:06:01.600
for me to meet with the president and meet with the board.

02:06:02.480 --> 02:06:05.200
And a certain point in time I pushed, you know,

02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:08.360
I'm kind of a activist when you push me.

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:11.360
It reminded me of, you know, early days of activism

02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:14.760
where I couldn't get the CEO of Wendy's to return my call.

02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:19.320
I couldn't get the CEO of Harvard, you know, to take a meeting.

02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:21.560
And then finally I spoke to the chairman of the board,

02:06:21.560 --> 02:06:23.160
a woman by the name of Penny Pritzker,

02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:27.320
who I knew from on a business school board with her.

02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:29.480
And it was, as I described,

02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:31.240
one of the more disappointing conversations of my life.

02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:33.920
And it did not seem, she seemed a bit like,

02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:35.760
if you will, deer in the headlights.

02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:38.760
They couldn't do this, they couldn't do that.

02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:41.840
The law was preventing them from doing various things.

02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:44.480
And that led to my first letter to the university.

02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:47.600
And I sort of ended the letter, you know,

02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:49.240
sort of giving this president of Harvard

02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:50.160
a dare to be great speech.

02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:53.320
This is your opportunity, you know, you can fix this.

02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:57.560
This could be your legacy.

02:06:57.560 --> 02:07:00.720
And I sent it to the, I emailed it to the president

02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:03.880
and the board members whose email addresses I had.

02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:06.480
I posted it on Twitter.

02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:09.480
I got no response, no acknowledgement, nothing.

02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:12.400
And in fact, the open dialogue I had

02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:13.480
with a couple of people on the board

02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:16.000
basically got shut down after that.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.600
And that led to letter number two.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:22.200
And then, and then when the Congress,

02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:26.200
led by Lee Stefanik, announced an investigation

02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:28.840
of anti-Semitism on campus

02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:32.280
and concern about, you know, violations of law,

02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:35.520
the president was called to testify along with two other,

02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:37.640
you know, the president of MIT,

02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:40.280
you know, the president of University of Pennsylvania,

02:07:40.280 --> 02:07:43.360
who were having similar issues on campus.

02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:45.680
I reached out to the president of Harvard and said,

02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:48.400
one, the Israeli government had gotten in touch

02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:52.000
and offered the opportunity for me to see the Hamas,

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.880
if you will, GoPro film.

02:07:53.880 --> 02:07:55.840
And I said, you know, I'd love to show it at Harvard.

02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:57.720
And they thought that would be a great idea.

02:07:57.720 --> 02:08:00.440
And so I partnered with the head of Harvard Chabad,

02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:03.840
a guy named Rabbi Hershey.

02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:06.640
And we were putting the film up on campus.

02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:08.560
And I thought, you know, if the president were to see this,

02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:10.440
it would give her a lot of perspective on what happened

02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:13.160
and she should see it before her testimony.

02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:14.400
And so I reached out to her,

02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:16.880
or actually Rabbi Hershey did.

02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:20.440
And he was told she would be out of town

02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:23.040
and couldn't see it.

02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:24.800
And then I reached out to her again,

02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:30.000
said, look, I'll facilitate your attendance in the Congress.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.840
You know, come see the film, I'll fly you down.

02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:35.240
That was rejected. And then she testified.

02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:38.920
And I watched, you know, a good percentage,

02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:41.680
80% of the testimony of all three presidents.

02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:43.880
And it was an embarrassment to the country.

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:46.280
Embarrassment to the universities.

02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:47.520
You know, they were evasive.

02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:48.720
They didn't answer questions.

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:50.800
They were rude. They smirked.

02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:55.800
You know, they looked very disrespectful to our Congress.

02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:59.800
And then, of course, there was that several minutes

02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:01.160
where finally, at least Stefanik

02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:02.960
was not getting answers to her questions.

02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:06.680
And she said, you know, let me be, you know, kind of clear.

02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:10.800
What if protesters were calling for genocide for the Jews?

02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:14.240
Does that violate your rules on bullying and harassment?

02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:16.880
And the three of them basically gave the same answer.

02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:18.800
You know, it depends on the context.

02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:23.680
And not until they actually execute it on the genocide

02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:26.160
does the university have the right to intervene.

02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:28.000
And the thing that perhaps bothered me the most

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.920
was the incredible hypocrisy.

02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:33.000
You know, Harvard was, you know, each of these universities

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.600
are ranked by this entity called FIRE,

02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:38.760
which is a nonprofit that focuses on free speech on campus.

02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:42.120
And Harvard has been in the bottom quartile

02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:44.840
for the last five years and dropped to last

02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:47.360
before October 7th, out of like 250.

02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:50.360
I should mention briefly that I've interviewed on this podcast.

02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:52.720
The founder of FIRE and the current head of FIRE

02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:54.960
will discuss this at length,

02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:57.680
including running for the board of Harvard

02:09:57.680 --> 02:09:59.400
and the whole procedure of all that.

02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:03.600
It's quite a fascinating investigation of free speech.

02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:06.600
For people who care about free speech absolutism,

02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:08.600
that's a good episode to listen to

02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:11.440
because those folks kind of fight for this idea.

02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:15.120
It's a difficult idea actually to internalize

02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:17.760
what does free speech in college campuses look like.

02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:19.360
Harvard has become a place

02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:21.240
where free speech is not tolerated on campus,

02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:25.960
or at least free speech that's not part of the accepted dialogue.

02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:29.640
Or, you know, this whole notion of speech codes

02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:32.640
and microaggressions really emerged on the elite,

02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:36.600
you know, the Harvard Yale campuses of the world.

02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:40.360
And, you know, the president of Harvard's,

02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:43.840
then president of Harvard's explanation for why, you know,

02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:46.240
you could call for the genocide of the Jewish people on campus

02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:49.120
was Harvard's commitment to free expression.

02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:53.360
And, you know, one of the more hypocritical statements of all time.

02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:54.840
And you really can't have it both ways.

02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:56.920
Either Harvard has to be a place where it's a free speech.

02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:59.480
She basically said we're a free speech absolutist place,

02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:01.600
which is why we have to allow this.

02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:04.200
And Harvard could not be further from that.

02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:07.240
And so that was a big part of it.

02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:12.000
And I was in the barber chair, if you will, getting haircut.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.120
And I had a guy on my team send me the three-minute section.

02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:19.640
I said, cut that line of questioning.

02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:22.280
And I put out a little tweet on that.

02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:26.000
And it's called my greatest hits of posts.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.040
It's got something like 110 million views.

02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:31.560
And, you know, everyone looked at this and said,

02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:36.080
what is wrong with, you know, university campuses

02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:38.600
and their leadership and their governance?

02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:40.240
By the way, you know, in a way, this whole conversation

02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:41.920
has been about governance.

02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:44.440
Harvard has a disastrous governance structure,

02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:46.240
which is why we have the problem we have.

02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:50.240
And just to linger on the testimony,

02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:53.240
you mentioned, you know, smirks and this kind of stuff.

02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:55.720
And you mentioned, dare to be great.

02:11:55.720 --> 02:11:59.320
I myself am kind of a sucker for great leadership.

02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:02.840
And those moments, you mentioned Churchill or so on,

02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:04.880
even great speeches.

02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:08.920
People talk down on speeches like it's maybe just words,

02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:13.440
but I think speeches can define a culture

02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:18.120
and define a place, define a people they can inspire.

02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:21.400
And I think actually the testimony before Congress

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:26.400
could have been an opportunity to redefine what Harvard is,

02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:30.000
dare to be great for, dare to be a great leader.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.800
President Harvard had a huge opportunity

02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:33.480
because she went third, right?

02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:36.160
The first two gave the world's most disastrous answers

02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:37.640
to the question.

02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:39.720
And she literally just copied their answer,

02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:43.960
which is itself, you know, kind of ironic

02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:45.840
in light of ultimately what happened.

02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:50.840
It's tough because you can get busy as a president,

02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:52.200
as a leader and so on.

02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:54.240
There's these meetings and so you think Congress,

02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:57.160
maybe you're smirking at the ridiculousness of the meeting.

02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:02.160
You need to remember that many of these are opportunities

02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:05.040
to give a speech of a lifetime.

02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:07.640
Like that if there is principles

02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:12.440
which you want to see an institution become and embody

02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:14.480
in the next several decades,

02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:16.400
there's opportunities to do that.

02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:19.400
And you as a great leader also need to have a sense

02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:21.880
of when is the opportunity to do that.

02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:27.080
October 7th really woke up the world on all sides, honestly.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.880
Like there is serious issue going on here.

02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:34.960
And then the protests woke up the university

02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:37.640
to there's a serious issue going on here.

02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:40.920
It's an opportunity to speak on free speech

02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:43.080
and on genocide, both.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:45.640
Yes.

02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:50.280
Do you see the criticism that you are a billionaire donor

02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:54.400
and you sort of used your power and financial influence

02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:57.440
unfairly to affect the governing structure

02:13:57.440 --> 02:13:59.080
of Harvard in this case?

02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:00.480
First of all, I never threatened

02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:02.280
to use financial or other resources.

02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:05.680
The only thing I did here was I wrote public letters.

02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:08.360
I spoke privately to a couple members of the board.

02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:10.760
I spoke for 45 minutes to the chairman.

02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:12.600
None of those conversations were effective

02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:14.840
or went anywhere as far as I could tell.

02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:19.840
I think my public letters and then some of the posts I did.

02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:25.480
And that little three minute video excerpt had an impact.

02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:30.520
But it wasn't about, I mean, you can criticize me

02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:32.840
for being a billionaire, but that had,

02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:34.560
it was really the words.

02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:37.920
It's a bit like, again, going back to the corporate analogy,

02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:40.000
it's not the fact that you own 5% of the company

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.200
that causes people to vote in your favor.

02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:44.560
It's the fact that your ideas are right.

02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:47.440
And I think, I was disappointed

02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:48.680
after the congressional testimony,

02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:50.960
the board of Harvard said that they were 100% behind,

02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:54.640
unanimously 100% behind President Gay.

02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:56.960
And so clearly I was ineffective.

02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:01.240
And ultimately what took her down was other,

02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:03.600
I would say activists who identified issues

02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:05.800
with academic integrity.

02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:08.120
And then she lost the confidence of the faculty.

02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:11.280
And once that happens, it's hard to stay.

02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:14.120
And I wanted her to be fired basically

02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:17.680
or be forced to resign because of failures of leadership

02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:18.800
because that would have sent a message

02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:20.360
about the importance of leadership,

02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:24.200
failure to stop a emergence of anti-Semitism on campus.

02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:28.120
And there's some news today, the protests are getting worse.

02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:30.360
Is there some tension between free speech

02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:33.120
on college campuses and disciplining students

02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:34.760
for calls of genocide?

02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:36.880
Yes, there's certainly a tension.

02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:39.680
And I think, first of all,

02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:41.280
I think free speech is incredibly important

02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:42.120
and I'm on the side,

02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:44.240
I'm a lot closer to absolutism on free speech

02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:45.640
than otherwise.

02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:48.080
The issue I had was the hypocrisy, right?

02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:52.400
They were restricting other kinds of speech on campus,

02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:54.880
principally conservative speech, conservative views.

02:15:55.800 --> 02:15:59.000
So it wasn't a free speech absolutist campus.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.760
And the protests were actually quite threatening

02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:03.560
to students and there are limits

02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:05.760
to even absolutist free speech.

02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:10.760
And they begin where people feel intimidation, harassment

02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:15.040
and threat to bodily harm, et cetera,

02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:17.560
that kind of speech is generally,

02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:19.240
again, it's pretty technical,

02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:21.360
but as people feel that they're in imminent harm

02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:22.480
by virtue of the protest,

02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:25.160
that speech is at risk of not meeting the standards

02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:26.480
for free speech.

02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:29.000
But Harvard is a private corporation.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:30.720
And as a private corporation,

02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:32.400
they can put on what restrictions they want.

02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:34.440
And Harvard had introduced only a few months

02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:36.760
before bullying and harassment policies.

02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:39.800
And that's why Representative Stefanik focused on,

02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:40.760
it's not like she said,

02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:42.240
this calling for genocide against the Jews

02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:43.560
violated your free speech policies.

02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:46.080
She says, this calling for genocide against the Jews

02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:48.960
violate your policies on bullying and harassment.

02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:51.080
And I think everyone looked at this when they said,

02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:52.120
it depends on the context.

02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:53.440
And they said, look, if you replace Jews

02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:54.960
with some other ethnic group,

02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:58.040
students who've used the N word, for example,

02:16:58.040 --> 02:17:01.320
have been thrown off campus or suspended.

02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:06.320
Students who've hate speech directed at LGBTQ people

02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:09.400
has led to disciplinary action,

02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:13.400
but spitting on Jewish students

02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:18.240
or kind of roughing them up a bit seemed like,

02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:20.880
or calling for their elimination

02:17:20.880 --> 02:17:22.280
didn't seem to violate the policies.

02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:26.320
So it's, look, I think a university should be a place

02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:29.080
where you have broad views and open viewpoints

02:17:29.080 --> 02:17:30.280
and broad discussion,

02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:32.560
but it should also be a place

02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:35.000
where students don't feel threatened going to class,

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.200
where their learning is not interrupted,

02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:39.560
when final exams are not interrupted

02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:43.000
by people coming in and with loud protest.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:44.400
Students asked me when I went up there,

02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:45.720
what would you do if you were Harvard president?

02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:46.920
I said, and this was before I knew

02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:48.200
what was happening on the Dartmouth campus.

02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:50.360
I said, I would convene everyone together.

02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:51.240
This is Harvard.

02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:53.200
We have access to the best minds in the world.

02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:55.280
Let's have a better understanding of the history.

02:17:55.280 --> 02:17:56.760
Let's understand the backdrop.

02:17:56.760 --> 02:17:58.280
Let's focus on solutions.

02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:00.920
Let's bring Arab and Jewish and Israeli students together.

02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:03.760
Let's form groups to create communication.

02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:05.960
That's how you solve this kind of problem.

02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:07.960
And none of that stuff has been done.

02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:09.280
It's not that hard.

02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:12.800
Do you think this reveals a deeper problem

02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:18.560
in terms of ideology and the governance of Harvard

02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:21.880
in maybe the culture of Harvard?

02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:24.760
Yes, so on governance,

02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:26.520
the government structure is a disaster.

02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:27.560
So the way it works today

02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:29.480
is Harvard has two principal boards.

02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:31.120
There's the board of the corporation,

02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:33.160
the so-called Fellows of Harvard.

02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:34.800
It's a board of, I think,

02:18:34.800 --> 02:18:36.960
12 independent directors and the president.

02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:39.920
There's no shareholder vote.

02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:41.640
There's no proxy system.

02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:44.360
It's really a self-perpetuating board

02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:47.040
that effectively elects its own members.

02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:52.040
So once the balance tips politically one way or another,

02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:55.560
it can be kept that way forever.

02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:57.440
There's no kind of rebalancing system.

02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:00.400
If a US corporation goes off the rails, so to speak,

02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:01.520
the shareholders can get together

02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:02.680
and vote off the directors.

02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:04.840
There's no ability to vote off the directors.

02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:06.040
Then there's the board of overseers,

02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:09.000
which is, I think, 32 directors.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.160
And there a few years ago,

02:19:11.160 --> 02:19:13.120
if you could put together 600 signatures,

02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:14.240
you could run for that board

02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:15.800
and put up a bunch of candidates

02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:18.320
and about five or six get elected each year.

02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:20.760
And a group did exactly that.

02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:24.920
And it was an oil and gas kind of disinvestment group.

02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:25.760
They got the signatures.

02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:27.160
A couple of them got elected

02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:29.720
and Harvard then changed the rules.

02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:33.320
And they said, now we need 3,200 signatures.

02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:36.000
And by the way,

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.400
if there are these dissident directors on the board,

02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:41.280
we're only gonna allow, we're gonna cap them at five.

02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:43.840
So if three were elected in the oil and gas thing,

02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:46.040
now there are only two seats available.

02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:48.400
And then a group of former students,

02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:50.920
kind of younger alums, one of whom I knew,

02:19:50.920 --> 02:19:51.760
approached me and said,

02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:53.280
look, Bill, we should run for the board.

02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:55.440
And they decided it's pretty late,

02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:58.160
only a few weeks before the signatures were due

02:19:58.160 --> 02:19:59.600
and love your support.

02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:00.720
I took a look at their platform.

02:20:00.720 --> 02:20:01.560
I thought it looked great.

02:20:01.560 --> 02:20:03.280
I said, look, happy to support.

02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:06.760
And I posted about them, did a Zoom with them,

02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:08.640
and they got thousands of signatures.

02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:10.240
Collectively, the four got whatever,

02:20:10.240 --> 02:20:12.360
12,000 signatures or something like this.

02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:16.400
And they missed by about 10% the threshold.

02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:18.560
What did Harvard do in the middle of the election?

02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:23.360
They made it very, very difficult to sign up for a vote.

02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:25.040
And it just makes them look terrible.

02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:29.200
And they've got now thousands of alums upset that,

02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:30.720
and again, this wasn't an election.

02:20:30.720 --> 02:20:32.920
This was just to put the names on the slate.

02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:34.440
So the only candidates on the slate

02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:38.520
are the ones selected by the existing members.

02:20:38.520 --> 02:20:43.520
And so businesses fail because of governance failures.

02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:48.120
Universities fail because of governance failures.

02:20:48.120 --> 02:20:50.040
It's not really the president's fault

02:20:50.040 --> 02:20:51.880
because the job of the board

02:20:51.880 --> 02:20:54.200
is to hire and fire the president

02:20:54.200 --> 02:20:57.080
and help guide the institution academically and otherwise.

02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:58.000
So that's governance.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:01.520
An ideology, I was like, how can this be?

02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:04.000
October 7th, the event that woke me up

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:05.880
was 30 student organizations

02:21:05.880 --> 02:21:08.360
came out with a public letter on October 8th,

02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:10.320
literally the morning after this letter was created,

02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:14.800
and said, Israel is solely responsible

02:21:14.800 --> 02:21:16.580
for Hamas's violent acts.

02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:20.360
Again, Israel had not even mounted a defense at this point,

02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:22.240
and there were still terrorists running around

02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:23.800
in the southern part of Israel.

02:21:25.880 --> 02:21:28.960
And I'm like, Harvard students,

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:32.720
34 Harvard student organizations signed this letter,

02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:35.640
and I'm like, what is going on?

02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:36.760
WTF, right?

02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:41.040
And that's when I went up on campus,

02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:43.040
and I started talking to the faculty,

02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:44.440
and that's when I started hearing about,

02:21:44.440 --> 02:21:47.560
actually, Bill, it's this DEI ideology.

02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:49.040
I'm like, what?

02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:53.320
DEI, like diversity, equity, inclusion?

02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:55.800
Obviously, I'm familiar with these words,

02:21:56.120 --> 02:21:59.360
and I see this in the corporate context.

02:21:59.360 --> 02:22:00.600
And they say, yeah, and they started talking to me

02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:04.640
about this oppressor oppressed framework,

02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:08.160
which is effectively taught on campus,

02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:09.840
and represents the backdrop

02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:11.320
for many of the courses that are offered,

02:22:11.320 --> 02:22:14.880
and the various, some of the studies,

02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:16.480
and other degree offerings.

02:22:16.480 --> 02:22:19.800
I'm like, I had not even heard of this,

02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:22.400
and I'm a pretty aware person,

02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:23.840
but I was completely unaware.

02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:25.120
And basically, they're like, look,

02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:26.920
Israel is deemed an oppressor,

02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:30.160
and the Palestinians are deemed the oppressed,

02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:32.880
and you take the side of the oppressed,

02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:37.240
and any acts of the oppressed to dislodge the oppressor,

02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:40.320
regardless of how vile or barbaric, okay.

02:22:41.560 --> 02:22:44.520
I'm like, okay, this is a super dangerous ideology.

02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:48.320
And so, I wrote a questioning post about this,

02:22:48.320 --> 02:22:51.560
like, here's what I'm hearing, is this right?

02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:53.760
And then I had someone, a friend of mine sent me

02:22:54.760 --> 02:22:57.840
Christopher Rufo's book, America's Cultural Revolution,

02:22:57.840 --> 02:23:01.040
which is sort of a sociological study

02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:02.960
of the origins of the DEI movement

02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:04.960
and critical race theory.

02:23:04.960 --> 02:23:07.200
And I found it actually

02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:09.520
one of the more important books I've read,

02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:13.240
and also found it quite concerning.

02:23:13.240 --> 02:23:16.480
And really, it's sort of a ultimately DEI

02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:21.480
comes out of a kind of a Marxist socialist backdrop.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.040
Way to look at the world.

02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:26.040
And so, I think there are a lot of issues with it,

02:23:26.040 --> 02:23:27.960
but unfortunately, it's advancing,

02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:32.320
like, ultimately concluded racism,

02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:35.560
as opposed to fighting it, which is what I thought

02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:37.000
it was ultimately about.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.240
So, maybe you can speak to that book a little bit.

02:23:39.240 --> 02:23:43.560
So, there's a history that traces back across decades,

02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:47.840
and then that infiltrated college campuses.

02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:49.920
So, basically, what Rufo argues

02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:54.240
is that the Black Power movement of the 60s really failed.

02:23:54.240 --> 02:23:55.960
It was a very violent movement,

02:23:55.960 --> 02:23:59.280
and many of the protagonists ended up in jail.

02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:01.880
And out of that movement,

02:24:01.880 --> 02:24:04.680
a number of kind of thought leaders,

02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:09.240
this guy named Marcuse and others,

02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:12.160
built this framework, kind of an approach.

02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:14.160
So, look, if we're gonna be successful,

02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:16.520
can't be a violent movement, number one.

02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:18.240
And number two, we need to infiltrate,

02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:20.200
if you will, the universities,

02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:23.040
and we need to become part of the faculty,

02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:26.080
and we need to teach the students.

02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:29.120
And then once we take over the universities

02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:32.480
with this ideology, then we can go into government,

02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:34.240
and then we can go into corporations,

02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:35.600
and we can change the world.

02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:39.440
So, I thought important book, and the more I dug in,

02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:42.400
the more I felt there was credibility to this,

02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:45.720
not just the kind of sociological backdrop,

02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:47.960
but to what it meant on campus.

02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:50.600
And Harvard faculty were telling me

02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:53.640
that there really is no such thing

02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:54.880
as free speech on campus,

02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:58.520
and that there was a survey done a year or so ago,

02:24:58.520 --> 02:25:02.160
the Harvard faculty, and only 2% of the faculty admitted,

02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:03.800
even in an anonymous survey,

02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:07.000
admitted to having a conservative point of view.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.700
So, we have a campus that's 98% non-conservative,

02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:15.600
liberal progressive, that's adopted this DEI construct.

02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:20.240
And then I learned from a member of the search committee

02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:23.840
for the Harvard president that they were restricted

02:25:23.840 --> 02:25:25.440
in looking at candidates,

02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:28.440
only those who met the DEI offices criteria.

02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:30.920
And I shared this in one of my postings,

02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:32.720
and I was accused of being a racist.

02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:38.800
But, and that's someone who believes

02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:42.040
in that diversity is a very good thing for organizations,

02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:44.520
and that equity and fairness isn't really important,

02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:47.920
and having an inclusive culture is critical

02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:50.080
for a functioning of an organization.

02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:52.080
So, here I was, someone who was like,

02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:54.280
okay, DEI sounds good to me,

02:25:54.280 --> 02:25:59.280
at least in the small D, small E, I version of events,

02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:02.600
but this DEI ideology is really problematic.

02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:06.760
So, what's the way to fix this in the next few years?

02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:13.220
The infiltration of DEI with the uppercase version

02:26:13.220 --> 02:26:16.340
of universities and the things that have troubled you,

02:26:17.500 --> 02:26:20.060
the things you saw at Harvard and elsewhere.

02:26:20.060 --> 02:26:22.420
In the same way, this was an eye-opening event for me,

02:26:22.420 --> 02:26:24.900
it has been for a very broad range of other people.

02:26:24.900 --> 02:26:27.580
I've never gotten, I mentioned general growth,

02:26:27.580 --> 02:26:28.780
I got a lot of nice letters from people

02:26:28.780 --> 02:26:31.260
for making money on a stock that went up 100 times.

02:26:32.420 --> 02:26:37.420
But I literally get hundreds of emails, letters,

02:26:37.420 --> 02:26:39.900
texts, handwritten letters, type letters

02:26:39.900 --> 02:26:43.700
from people the ages of 25 to 85 saying,

02:26:43.700 --> 02:26:46.940
Bill, this is so important, thanks for speaking out on this.

02:26:46.940 --> 02:26:49.700
You were saying what so many of us believe,

02:26:49.700 --> 02:26:51.060
but have been afraid to say.

02:26:51.060 --> 02:26:54.940
What I described is almost a McCarthy-esque kind of movement

02:26:54.940 --> 02:26:58.340
and that if you challenge the DEI construct,

02:26:58.340 --> 02:26:59.620
people accuse you of being racist,

02:26:59.620 --> 02:27:01.860
it's happened to me already.

02:27:01.860 --> 02:27:05.660
I'm perhaps, I'm much less vulnerable

02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:07.820
than a university professor who can get

02:27:07.860 --> 02:27:10.620
shouted off campus, canceled.

02:27:10.620 --> 02:27:12.540
I'm sort of difficult to cancel,

02:27:13.700 --> 02:27:15.460
but that doesn't mean people aren't gonna try.

02:27:15.460 --> 02:27:20.380
And I've been the victim of a couple of interesting articles

02:27:20.380 --> 02:27:24.260
in the last few days or at least one in particular

02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:25.620
in the Washington Post,

02:27:25.620 --> 02:27:27.660
written by what I thought was a well-meaning reporter,

02:27:27.660 --> 02:27:31.500
but it's just clear that I've taken on some big parts

02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:34.940
of at least the progressive establishment, DEI.

02:27:34.940 --> 02:27:37.220
I'm also a believer that Biden

02:27:37.220 --> 02:27:38.820
should have stepped aside a long time ago

02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:40.180
and it's only getting worse.

02:27:41.540 --> 02:27:45.260
So I'm attacking the president, DEI,

02:27:46.220 --> 02:27:51.220
elite universities, and you make some enemies doing that.

02:27:51.500 --> 02:27:55.540
But I should say, I'm still at MIT and I love MIT

02:27:55.540 --> 02:27:59.300
and I believe in the power of great universities

02:28:00.180 --> 02:28:04.460
to explore ideas, to inspire young people to think,

02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:08.020
to be, to inspire young people to lead.

02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:12.700
Let me ask, okay, how can you explore how to think

02:28:12.700 --> 02:28:17.220
when you're only shared a certain point of view, right?

02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:19.660
How can you learn about leadership

02:28:19.660 --> 02:28:22.780
when the governance and leadership of the institution

02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:25.740
is broken and exposure to ideas,

02:28:25.740 --> 02:28:28.100
if you're limited in the ideas that you're supposed to?

02:28:28.100 --> 02:28:29.180
So I think universities at risk.

02:28:29.180 --> 02:28:31.420
I mean, the concerning thing, right,

02:28:31.420 --> 02:28:34.100
is if 34 student organizations that each have,

02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:36.620
I don't know, 30 members or maybe more, right,

02:28:36.620 --> 02:28:39.180
that's a thousand, that's a meaningful percentage

02:28:39.180 --> 02:28:42.860
of the campus, perhaps, that ultimately respond.

02:28:42.860 --> 02:28:46.020
Now, 10 or so of the 30 withdrew the statement

02:28:46.020 --> 02:28:50.340
once many of the members realized what they had written.

02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:52.380
So I don't think, it seems like the statement

02:28:52.380 --> 02:28:55.100
was signed by the leadership and not necessarily supported

02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:59.380
by all the various students that were members.

02:28:59.380 --> 02:29:03.620
But if the university teaches people these precepts,

02:29:03.620 --> 02:29:05.460
this is the next generation of leadership.

02:29:05.460 --> 02:29:07.140
Normally, if you think about,

02:29:07.140 --> 02:29:09.900
I wrote my college thesis on university admissions,

02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:13.140
the reason why controlling the gates

02:29:13.140 --> 02:29:16.060
of the Harvard institution,

02:29:16.060 --> 02:29:17.300
the admissions office is important,

02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:18.940
is that many of these people who graduate

02:29:18.940 --> 02:29:22.940
end up with the top jobs in government

02:29:22.940 --> 02:29:25.520
and ultimately become judges.

02:29:26.820 --> 02:29:29.500
They're permeate through society.

02:29:29.500 --> 02:29:31.380
And so it really matters what they learn.

02:29:31.380 --> 02:29:36.380
And if they're limited to one side of the political aisle

02:29:36.900 --> 02:29:40.860
and they're not open to a broad array of views,

02:29:40.860 --> 02:29:42.900
and this represents some of the most elite institutions

02:29:42.900 --> 02:29:45.380
in our country, I think it's very problematic

02:29:45.380 --> 02:29:47.220
for the country long-term.

02:29:47.220 --> 02:29:48.940
Yeah, I 100% agree.

02:29:48.940 --> 02:29:51.300
And I also felt like the leadership

02:29:52.980 --> 02:29:56.260
wasn't even part of the problem

02:29:56.260 --> 02:29:58.340
as much as they were almost out of touch,

02:29:58.340 --> 02:30:03.340
like unaware that this is an important moment,

02:30:04.340 --> 02:30:08.020
it's an important crisis, it's an important opportunity

02:30:08.020 --> 02:30:09.180
to step up as a leader

02:30:09.180 --> 02:30:11.300
and define the future of an institution.

02:30:11.300 --> 02:30:13.660
So I don't even know where the source of the problem is.

02:30:13.660 --> 02:30:17.540
It could be literally government structure

02:30:17.540 --> 02:30:18.380
as we've been talking about.

02:30:18.380 --> 02:30:19.220
Well, it's two things.

02:30:19.220 --> 02:30:20.520
I think it's governance structure.

02:30:20.520 --> 02:30:23.420
I also think universities are selecting,

02:30:23.420 --> 02:30:25.020
they're not selecting leaders.

02:30:25.020 --> 02:30:25.860
Yeah.

02:30:26.180 --> 02:30:28.860
You know, it's not clear to me

02:30:28.860 --> 02:30:33.860
that universities should necessarily be run by academics.

02:30:35.100 --> 02:30:35.940
Right?

02:30:35.940 --> 02:30:38.880
You know, the dean of a university,

02:30:40.220 --> 02:30:41.820
you know, the person who helps,

02:30:44.380 --> 02:30:46.860
sort of the business of the university, right?

02:30:46.860 --> 02:30:49.340
And then there's the academics of the university.

02:30:49.340 --> 02:30:53.220
And having a, I would argue having a business leader

02:30:53.220 --> 02:30:55.660
run these institutions.

02:30:55.660 --> 02:30:57.900
And then having a board that's involved,

02:30:57.900 --> 02:31:01.180
a board that has itself diverse viewpoints

02:31:01.180 --> 02:31:03.140
and by the way, permanently structured

02:31:03.140 --> 02:31:04.540
to have diverse viewpoints

02:31:05.940 --> 02:31:07.540
is a much better way to run a university

02:31:07.540 --> 02:31:10.580
than picking an academic that the faculty supports.

02:31:10.580 --> 02:31:12.220
Because, you know, one of the things I learned

02:31:12.220 --> 02:31:14.060
about how faculty get hired at universities,

02:31:14.060 --> 02:31:17.380
ultimately it's signed off by the board,

02:31:17.380 --> 02:31:20.380
but, you know, the new faculty are chosen

02:31:20.380 --> 02:31:22.340
by each of the various departments.

02:31:22.340 --> 02:31:25.340
And once the departments tip,

02:31:25.340 --> 02:31:26.860
there's sort of a tipping point politically

02:31:26.860 --> 02:31:29.540
where once they tip in one direction,

02:31:29.540 --> 02:31:33.300
the faculty recruit more people like themselves.

02:31:33.300 --> 02:31:36.700
And so the departments come more and more progressive,

02:31:36.700 --> 02:31:38.120
if you will, with the passage of time.

02:31:38.120 --> 02:31:40.780
And they only advance candidates that match their,

02:31:41.740 --> 02:31:43.020
that meet their political objectives.

02:31:43.020 --> 02:31:47.180
It's not a great way to build an institution

02:31:47.180 --> 02:31:48.580
which allows for-

02:31:48.580 --> 02:31:50.300
Small D, diversity.

02:31:50.300 --> 02:31:53.060
Allows for, yeah, diversity.

02:31:53.100 --> 02:31:56.860
And diversity, by the way, is not just race and gender.

02:31:56.860 --> 02:31:59.500
And that's also something I feel very strongly about.

02:32:00.380 --> 02:32:02.700
Well, luckily, engineering robotics

02:32:02.700 --> 02:32:04.860
is touched last by this, it is touched,

02:32:04.860 --> 02:32:09.860
but, you know, when I am at the computing building,

02:32:10.620 --> 02:32:14.360
STATA and the UN, politics doesn't infiltrate,

02:32:14.360 --> 02:32:17.500
or I haven't seen it infiltrate quite as deeply as elsewhere.

02:32:17.500 --> 02:32:19.900
It's in the biology department at Harvard,

02:32:19.900 --> 02:32:22.100
because the biology is controversial now.

02:32:23.100 --> 02:32:26.740
Because biology and gender, you know, there are faculty,

02:32:26.740 --> 02:32:28.020
there's a woman at Harvard

02:32:28.020 --> 02:32:31.340
who was literally canceled from the faculty as a member,

02:32:31.340 --> 02:32:32.980
I think she was at the med school.

02:32:34.040 --> 02:32:36.420
And she was, you know, she made the argument

02:32:36.420 --> 02:32:38.260
that there are basically, you know,

02:32:38.260 --> 02:32:40.780
two genders determined by biology,

02:32:40.780 --> 02:32:42.380
and she wasn't allowed to stay.

02:32:44.260 --> 02:32:46.340
That's another topic for another time.

02:32:46.340 --> 02:32:47.180
Another topic.

02:32:47.180 --> 02:32:49.020
You should do a show on that one.

02:32:49.020 --> 02:32:50.920
That'll be an interesting one.

02:32:50.920 --> 02:32:52.600
So as you said, technically,

02:32:52.600 --> 02:32:55.480
Claudine Gay, the president of Harvard,

02:32:55.480 --> 02:32:58.120
resigned over plagiarism,

02:32:58.120 --> 02:33:01.680
not over the thing that you were initially troubled by.

02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:03.560
It's hard to really know, right?

02:33:03.560 --> 02:33:05.160
It's not like a provable fact.

02:33:05.160 --> 02:33:06.440
I would say at a certain point in time,

02:33:06.440 --> 02:33:08.740
she lost the confidence of the faculty,

02:33:08.740 --> 02:33:10.400
and that was ultimately the catalyst.

02:33:10.400 --> 02:33:11.920
And whether that was,

02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:14.320
how much of that was the plagiarism issue,

02:33:14.320 --> 02:33:16.520
and how much of that was some of the things that preceded it,

02:33:16.520 --> 02:33:18.440
or was it all of these issues in their entirety?

02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:21.240
There's no way to do a calculus.

02:33:21.240 --> 02:33:23.520
Can you explain the nature of this plagiarism

02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:25.120
from what you remember?

02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:28.120
So Aaron Cerberium and Christopher Ruffo,

02:33:28.120 --> 02:33:29.240
one from the Free Beacon,

02:33:29.240 --> 02:33:32.600
and Chris surfaced some allegations on

02:33:32.600 --> 02:33:35.360
or identified some plagiarism issues

02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:38.320
that I would say the initial examples were,

02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:42.580
you know, use of the same words with proper attribution,

02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:45.280
some missing quote, you know, footnotes.

02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:49.360
And then over time, with, I guess, more digging,

02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:54.360
they released, I think ultimately something like 76 examples

02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:57.720
of what they call plagiarism

02:33:57.720 --> 02:34:01.480
in I think eight of 11 of her articles.

02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:03.880
And one of the other things that came forth here

02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:06.180
is as president of the university,

02:34:06.180 --> 02:34:08.560
she had sort of the thinnest transcript academically

02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:10.480
of any previous president,

02:34:10.480 --> 02:34:13.200
you know, very relatively small body of work.

02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:14.040
And then when you couple that

02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:16.680
with the amount of plagiarism that was pervasive,

02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:19.440
and then I guess some of the other examples that surfaced

02:34:19.440 --> 02:34:20.720
were not missing quotation marks

02:34:20.720 --> 02:34:23.480
where the authors of the work

02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:26.400
felt that their ideas had been stolen.

02:34:26.400 --> 02:34:29.300
And really plagiarism is academic fraud.

02:34:29.300 --> 02:34:31.040
There's their indicia,

02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:33.200
one indicia of plagiarism is a missing footnote.

02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:35.080
That could also be a clerical error.

02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:39.560
And so when a professor is accused of plagiarism,

02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:41.100
the university does sort of a deep dive.

02:34:41.100 --> 02:34:43.840
They have these administrative boards

02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:46.760
and it can take six months, nine months, a year

02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:50.760
to evaluate intent matters.

02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:53.680
Was this intentional theft of another person's idea,

02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:56.840
that's academic fraud, or was this sloppy, you know,

02:34:56.840 --> 02:34:59.720
you missed or just humanity, right?

02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:01.260
You miss a footnote here or there.

02:35:01.260 --> 02:35:04.600
And I think once it got to a place

02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:06.480
where people felt it was theft

02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:09.760
of someone else's intellectual property,

02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:11.980
that's when it became intolerable

02:35:11.980 --> 02:35:13.940
for her to stay as president of Harvard.

02:35:13.940 --> 02:35:15.540
So is there a spectrum for you

02:35:15.540 --> 02:35:18.340
between the different kinds of plagiarism,

02:35:18.340 --> 02:35:23.340
maybe plagiarizing words and plagiarizing ideas

02:35:24.500 --> 02:35:28.580
and plagiarizing novel ideas?

02:35:28.580 --> 02:35:31.220
Of course, the common understanding of plagiarism,

02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:34.220
if you look in the dictionary, it's about theft.

02:35:35.100 --> 02:35:37.780
Theft requires a intent.

02:35:38.780 --> 02:35:41.800
Did the person intentionally take someone else's ideas

02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:43.000
or words?

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Now, if you're writing a novel, right, words matter more,

02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:49.880
right, if you're taking Shakespeare

02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:52.160
and presenting it as your own words.

02:35:52.160 --> 02:35:55.960
If you're, you know, writing about ideas,

02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:57.440
you know, ideas matter, but you're not supposed

02:35:57.440 --> 02:35:58.600
to take someone else's words

02:35:58.600 --> 02:36:01.060
without properly acknowledging them,

02:36:01.060 --> 02:36:03.840
whether it's quotation marks or otherwise.

02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:08.180
But in the context of academics life's work before AI,

02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:13.400
everyone's gonna have missing quotation marks and footnotes.

02:36:14.100 --> 02:36:16.060
I remember writing my own thesis.

02:36:16.060 --> 02:36:19.060
You know, I would take the books you couldn't take

02:36:19.060 --> 02:36:21.940
out of Widener Library, so I'd have index cards

02:36:21.940 --> 02:36:23.740
and I'd write stuff on index cards

02:36:23.740 --> 02:36:25.820
and I'd put a little citation to make sure

02:36:25.820 --> 02:36:27.940
I remember to cite it properly.

02:36:27.940 --> 02:36:30.580
And you know, scrambling to do your thesis,

02:36:30.580 --> 02:36:34.060
get it in on time, what's the chances you forget

02:36:34.060 --> 02:36:36.780
at what point what are your words versus the author's words

02:36:36.780 --> 02:36:38.940
and you forget to put quotation marks.

02:36:38.940 --> 02:36:42.860
Just the humanity, you know, the human fallibility of it.

02:36:42.860 --> 02:36:45.820
So, you know, you don't get, it's not academic fraud

02:36:45.820 --> 02:36:49.060
to have human fallibility, but it's academic fraud

02:36:49.060 --> 02:36:50.780
if you take someone else's ideas

02:36:50.780 --> 02:36:53.560
that are an integral part of your work.

02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:56.580
Is there a part of you that regrets that,

02:36:56.580 --> 02:36:58.820
at least from the perception of it,

02:36:58.820 --> 02:37:01.700
the president of Harvard stepped on over plagiarism

02:37:01.700 --> 02:37:06.260
versus over refusing to say that the cause

02:37:06.260 --> 02:37:09.100
of genocide are wrong?

02:37:09.100 --> 02:37:12.060
Again, I think it would have sent a better message

02:37:13.460 --> 02:37:17.700
if a leader fails as a leader and that's the reason

02:37:17.700 --> 02:37:21.500
for their resignation or dismissal, then she gets,

02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:24.300
if you will, caught on a technical violation

02:37:24.300 --> 02:37:26.380
that had nothing to do with failed leadership

02:37:26.380 --> 02:37:31.380
because I don't know what lesson that teaches the board

02:37:31.660 --> 02:37:32.860
about selecting the next candidate.

02:37:32.860 --> 02:37:35.460
I mean, the future of Harvard, a lot of it's gonna depend

02:37:35.460 --> 02:37:37.980
on who they pick as the next leader.

02:37:38.900 --> 02:37:40.660
Here's an interesting anecdote

02:37:41.860 --> 02:37:44.600
that I think has not surfaced publicly.

02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:46.580
So a guy named Larry Bacow

02:37:46.580 --> 02:37:48.620
was the previous president of Harvard.

02:37:48.620 --> 02:37:51.380
Larry Bacow was on the search committee

02:37:51.380 --> 02:37:53.740
and they were looking for a new president.

02:37:53.740 --> 02:37:57.380
And what was strange was they picked an old white guy

02:37:58.300 --> 02:38:01.100
to be president of Harvard when there was, you know,

02:38:01.100 --> 02:38:03.080
a call for a more diverse president.

02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:07.920
And what I learned was Harvard actually ran a process,

02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:11.320
had a diverse new president of Harvard

02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:14.840
and in the due diligence on that candidate shortly

02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:17.360
before the announcement of the new president,

02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:18.680
they found out that the president,

02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:22.200
that presidential candidate had a plagiarism problem.

02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:23.920
And the search had gone on long enough,

02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:26.840
they couldn't restart a search to find another candidate.

02:38:26.840 --> 02:38:29.360
So they picked Larry Bacow off the board,

02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:32.120
off the search committee to be the next president of Harvard

02:38:32.120 --> 02:38:33.720
as kind of an interim solution.

02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:37.260
And then there was that much more pressure

02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:39.720
to have a more diverse candidate this time around

02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:40.960
because there was a big disappointment

02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:42.760
to the DEI office, if you will,

02:38:42.760 --> 02:38:44.960
and I would say to the community at large.

02:38:44.960 --> 02:38:45.920
Harvard, of all places,

02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:50.400
couldn't have a racially diverse president.

02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:51.960
It's not an important message.

02:38:53.560 --> 02:38:58.560
So the strange thing is that they didn't do due diligence

02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:00.740
on president gay

02:39:00.740 --> 02:39:03.380
and that it was a relatively quick process.

02:39:03.380 --> 02:39:05.460
So the whole thing I think is worthy

02:39:05.460 --> 02:39:08.380
of further exploration.

02:39:08.380 --> 02:39:10.860
So this goes deeper than just the president.

02:39:10.860 --> 02:39:11.700
Yes, for sure.

02:39:12.700 --> 02:39:15.220
When a company fails, most people blame the CEO.

02:39:16.100 --> 02:39:18.500
I generally blame the board, right?

02:39:18.500 --> 02:39:19.900
Because the board's job is to make sure

02:39:19.900 --> 02:39:21.100
the right person is running the company

02:39:21.100 --> 02:39:23.140
and if they're failing, help the person.

02:39:23.140 --> 02:39:25.820
If they can't help the person, make a change.

02:39:25.820 --> 02:39:27.260
That's not what's happened here.

02:39:27.260 --> 02:39:30.300
The board's hand was sort of forced from the outside

02:39:30.300 --> 02:39:31.460
whereas they should have made their own decision

02:39:31.460 --> 02:39:32.900
from the inside.

02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:34.580
Do you still love Harvard?

02:39:34.580 --> 02:39:35.620
Sure.

02:39:35.620 --> 02:39:39.500
It's a 400 odd year institution.

02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:43.940
It's enormously helpful to me in my life, I'm sure.

02:39:45.020 --> 02:39:46.740
My sister also went to Harvard

02:39:47.820 --> 02:39:52.500
and the experiences, learnings,

02:39:52.500 --> 02:39:54.940
friendships, relationships,

02:39:56.540 --> 02:39:58.820
I'm very happy with my life.

02:39:58.820 --> 02:40:00.260
Harvard was an important part of my life.

02:40:01.260 --> 02:40:03.340
I went there for both undergrad and business school.

02:40:03.340 --> 02:40:05.780
I learned a ton, met a lot of faculty,

02:40:05.780 --> 02:40:07.500
a lot from a number of my closest friends

02:40:07.500 --> 02:40:11.500
who I still really keep in touch with, I made then.

02:40:11.500 --> 02:40:16.500
So yeah, it's a great place, but it needs a reboot.

02:40:16.580 --> 02:40:18.620
Yeah, I still have hope.

02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:22.020
I think universities are really important institutions.

02:40:22.020 --> 02:40:24.420
When I went to Harvard, there were 1,600 people in my class.

02:40:24.420 --> 02:40:26.420
I think today's class is about the same size

02:40:26.420 --> 02:40:28.700
and their online education

02:40:28.700 --> 02:40:31.660
really has not sort of taken off, right?

02:40:31.660 --> 02:40:34.180
So I heard Peter Thiel speak at one point in time

02:40:34.180 --> 02:40:38.380
and he's like, what great institution do you know

02:40:38.380 --> 02:40:43.380
that's truly great that hasn't grown in 100 years, right?

02:40:44.620 --> 02:40:49.020
And the incentives in some sense of the alums are for,

02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:50.900
it's a bit like a club.

02:40:50.900 --> 02:40:53.100
If you're proud of the elitism of the club,

02:40:53.100 --> 02:40:54.820
you don't want that many new members,

02:40:54.820 --> 02:40:57.940
but the fact that the population has grown of the country

02:40:59.940 --> 02:41:03.100
significantly since certainly I was a student in 1984

02:41:04.020 --> 02:41:05.900
and the fact that Harvard recruits people

02:41:05.900 --> 02:41:07.420
from all over the world,

02:41:07.420 --> 02:41:09.700
it's really serving a smaller and smaller percentage

02:41:09.700 --> 02:41:11.420
of the population today.

02:41:11.420 --> 02:41:13.980
And some of our most talented and successful

02:41:15.260 --> 02:41:19.860
entrepreneurs anyway, it's a token of success

02:41:19.860 --> 02:41:22.820
that they didn't make it through their undergraduate years.

02:41:22.820 --> 02:41:23.980
They left as a freshman

02:41:24.020 --> 02:41:25.500
or they didn't attend at all.

02:41:25.500 --> 02:41:28.220
For entrepreneurs, yes, but it's still a place.

02:41:28.220 --> 02:41:30.500
Very important for research,

02:41:30.500 --> 02:41:32.460
very important for advancing ideas

02:41:33.700 --> 02:41:36.340
and yes, in shaping dialogue

02:41:36.340 --> 02:41:40.700
and the next generation of Supreme Court justices

02:41:40.700 --> 02:41:45.180
and members of government, politicians.

02:41:45.180 --> 02:41:46.660
So yes, it's critically important,

02:41:46.660 --> 02:41:51.660
but it's not doing the job it should be doing.

02:41:52.660 --> 02:41:55.900
Neri Oxman, somebody you mentioned several times

02:41:55.900 --> 02:41:56.740
throughout this podcast,

02:41:56.740 --> 02:42:00.220
somebody I had a wonderful conversation with,

02:42:00.220 --> 02:42:03.300
a friendship with, I've known, looked up to her,

02:42:03.300 --> 02:42:06.660
admired her, I've been a fan of hers for a long time,

02:42:06.660 --> 02:42:09.580
of her work and of her as a human being.

02:42:10.660 --> 02:42:12.540
Looks like you're a fan of hers as well.

02:42:12.540 --> 02:42:13.380
Yes.

02:42:14.220 --> 02:42:16.380
What do you love about Neri?

02:42:16.380 --> 02:42:18.020
What do you admire about her as a scientist,

02:42:18.020 --> 02:42:19.540
artist, human being?

02:42:19.540 --> 02:42:23.940
I think she's the most beautiful person I've ever met

02:42:23.940 --> 02:42:26.620
and I mean that from like the center of her soul.

02:42:28.140 --> 02:42:31.940
She's the most caring, warm, considerate,

02:42:32.860 --> 02:42:36.260
thoughtful person I've ever met

02:42:39.020 --> 02:42:42.020
and she couples those remarkable qualities

02:42:42.020 --> 02:42:45.420
with brilliance, incredible creativity,

02:42:45.460 --> 02:42:48.820
beauty, elegance, grace.

02:42:50.300 --> 02:42:51.820
Yeah, I'm talking about my wife,

02:42:52.820 --> 02:42:55.260
but I'm talking incredibly dispassionately.

02:42:57.020 --> 02:42:58.660
But I mean what I say.

02:42:58.660 --> 02:43:01.340
She's the most remarkable person I've ever met

02:43:01.340 --> 02:43:03.620
and I've met a lot of remarkable people

02:43:03.620 --> 02:43:06.260
and I'm incredibly fortunate to spend

02:43:06.260 --> 02:43:09.620
a very high percentage of my lifetime with her

02:43:09.620 --> 02:43:14.060
ever since I met her, you know, six years ago.

02:43:14.060 --> 02:43:15.620
So she's been a help to you

02:43:15.620 --> 02:43:17.660
through some of the rough moments you described?

02:43:17.660 --> 02:43:19.780
For sure, I mean I met her at the bottom,

02:43:20.820 --> 02:43:23.660
which is not a bad place to meet someone if it works out.

02:43:25.020 --> 02:43:27.780
Is there some degree of yin and yang

02:43:27.780 --> 02:43:29.380
with the two personalities you have?

02:43:29.380 --> 02:43:33.140
You have described yourself as emotional and so on,

02:43:33.140 --> 02:43:36.100
but it does seem the two of you have

02:43:36.100 --> 02:43:39.100
slightly different styles about how you approach the world.

02:43:39.100 --> 02:43:41.260
Well, interestingly, we have a lot alike.

02:43:41.260 --> 02:43:45.740
You know, we come from very similar places in the world.

02:43:45.740 --> 02:43:47.060
There are times where you feel like

02:43:47.060 --> 02:43:49.020
we've known each other for centuries.

02:43:49.020 --> 02:43:51.380
You know, I met her parents for the first time,

02:43:52.500 --> 02:43:55.820
you know, a long time ago, almost six years ago as well.

02:43:55.820 --> 02:43:59.780
And I knew her parents were from Eastern Europe originally.

02:43:59.780 --> 02:44:01.820
So I asked her father like what, you know,

02:44:01.820 --> 02:44:05.260
what city did her family come from originally?

02:44:05.260 --> 02:44:08.420
And I called my father and asked him,

02:44:08.420 --> 02:44:10.620
you know, dad, what's, you know, Grandpa Abraham,

02:44:11.420 --> 02:44:13.500
what's the name of the city?

02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:16.980
And then I put the two cities into Google Maps

02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:20.340
and they were 52 miles apart, which was pretty cool.

02:44:21.660 --> 02:44:24.860
Then of course, at some point we did genetic testing,

02:44:24.860 --> 02:44:27.700
make sure we weren't related, which we were not.

02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:31.420
But we share incredible commonality on values.

02:44:32.260 --> 02:44:35.100
We are attracted to the same kind of people.

02:44:35.100 --> 02:44:37.820
You know, she loves my friends, I love hers.

02:44:37.820 --> 02:44:40.420
We love doing the same kind of things.

02:44:41.380 --> 02:44:43.060
We're attracted to, you know,

02:44:43.060 --> 02:44:44.740
we like spending time the same ways.

02:44:46.460 --> 02:44:51.100
And she has, yeah, it's more emotion, more elegance.

02:44:52.580 --> 02:44:55.380
She doesn't like battles, but she's very strong.

02:44:57.180 --> 02:44:58.820
But she's more sensitive than I am.

02:44:58.820 --> 02:45:02.420
Yeah, you are constantly in multiple battles

02:45:02.420 --> 02:45:07.420
at the same time and there's often the media,

02:45:07.460 --> 02:45:11.260
social media is just fire everywhere.

02:45:11.260 --> 02:45:14.540
You know, that hasn't really been the case for a while.

02:45:14.540 --> 02:45:16.780
I've had relative peace for a long time

02:45:16.780 --> 02:45:19.300
because as I stopped being, as I haven't had to be

02:45:19.300 --> 02:45:22.460
the kind of activist I was earlier in my career,

02:45:22.460 --> 02:45:23.980
I think since October 7th, yes,

02:45:23.980 --> 02:45:25.780
I do feel like I've been in a war.

02:45:25.780 --> 02:45:30.780
Can you tell me the saga of the accusations against Nary?

02:45:32.220 --> 02:45:36.260
So I did not actually surface the plagiarism allegations

02:45:36.260 --> 02:45:39.180
against President Gay that surfaced by, you know,

02:45:39.180 --> 02:45:42.100
Aaron and maybe Christopher Ruffo as well,

02:45:42.100 --> 02:45:45.180
or maybe Chris helped promote what Aaron

02:45:45.180 --> 02:45:50.180
and some anonymous person identified.

02:45:50.300 --> 02:45:51.900
But I certainly, it was a point in time

02:45:51.900 --> 02:45:54.500
where the board had said we're 100% behind her

02:45:54.500 --> 02:45:58.060
and unanimously, and I really felt she had to go.

02:45:58.060 --> 02:45:59.700
So it didn't bother me at all

02:45:59.700 --> 02:46:02.380
that they had identified problems with her work.

02:46:02.380 --> 02:46:06.020
So I shared, I reposted those posts

02:46:06.020 --> 02:46:08.380
and then when the board, she ultimately resigned

02:46:08.380 --> 02:46:11.380
and she got a $900,000 a year professorship

02:46:11.380 --> 02:46:12.980
continuing at Harvard, I said, look,

02:46:12.980 --> 02:46:15.860
in light of her limited academic record

02:46:15.860 --> 02:46:19.580
and these plagiarism allegations, she had to go.

02:46:21.700 --> 02:46:22.940
I knew when I did so,

02:46:22.940 --> 02:46:26.100
I assumed I was actually a bit paranoid

02:46:26.100 --> 02:46:28.300
about that thesis I had written.

02:46:28.300 --> 02:46:29.820
I only had one academic work,

02:46:31.220 --> 02:46:32.780
but I hadn't checked it for plagiarism.

02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:35.540
And I thought, that's gonna happen.

02:46:35.540 --> 02:46:39.740
Actually, I did not have a copy on hand,

02:46:39.740 --> 02:46:44.220
so I got a copy of my thesis and I remember writing it.

02:46:44.220 --> 02:46:46.140
Harvard at the time was pretty,

02:46:46.140 --> 02:46:47.140
they kind of gave you a lecture

02:46:47.140 --> 02:46:49.060
about making sure you have all your footnotes

02:46:49.060 --> 02:46:50.620
in quotation marks.

02:46:50.620 --> 02:46:53.380
I learned later that apparently they had a copy

02:46:53.380 --> 02:46:55.940
of my thesis at the New York Public Library

02:46:55.940 --> 02:47:00.940
and a member of the media told me he was there online

02:47:00.940 --> 02:47:03.860
with a dozen other members of the media

02:47:03.860 --> 02:47:06.460
and I was all trying to get a copy of my thesis

02:47:06.460 --> 02:47:08.380
to run it through some AI.

02:47:08.380 --> 02:47:10.260
They had to first do optical character recognition

02:47:10.260 --> 02:47:13.660
to convert the paper document into digital.

02:47:14.700 --> 02:47:18.860
But fortunately, through a miracle, I didn't have an issue.

02:47:19.740 --> 02:47:21.540
I didn't think about Nary, of course,

02:47:21.540 --> 02:47:25.700
who has whatever, 130 academic works.

02:47:25.700 --> 02:47:28.740
And so we were just at the end of a vacation

02:47:28.740 --> 02:47:33.740
for Christmas break and I was early in the morning

02:47:34.020 --> 02:47:36.660
for vacation time and all of a sudden,

02:47:36.660 --> 02:47:38.500
I hear my phone ringing in the other room

02:47:38.500 --> 02:47:40.300
or vibrating in the other room multiple times.

02:47:40.300 --> 02:47:42.660
I'm like, I pick up the phone,

02:47:42.660 --> 02:47:45.500
it's our communication guy friend, McGill,

02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:47.980
and he's like, Bill, Business Insider,

02:47:47.980 --> 02:47:49.900
has apparently identified a number of instances

02:47:49.900 --> 02:47:52.340
of plagiarism in Nary's dissertation.

02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:53.300
Let me send you this email.

02:47:53.300 --> 02:47:58.140
He sent me the email and they had identified

02:47:58.140 --> 02:48:01.340
four paragraphs in her 330 page dissertation

02:48:01.340 --> 02:48:03.260
where she had cited the author,

02:48:03.260 --> 02:48:06.300
but she had used the vast majority of the words

02:48:06.300 --> 02:48:08.300
and that those paragraphs were from the author

02:48:08.300 --> 02:48:10.500
and she should have used quotation marks.

02:48:10.500 --> 02:48:11.460
And then there was one case

02:48:11.460 --> 02:48:15.740
where she paraphrased correctly an author,

02:48:15.740 --> 02:48:19.980
but did not footnote that it was from his work.

02:48:21.420 --> 02:48:23.300
And so we were presented with this

02:48:23.300 --> 02:48:25.060
and told they're gonna publish in a few hours

02:48:25.060 --> 02:48:26.500
and we're like, well, can we get to the next day?

02:48:26.500 --> 02:48:28.180
We're just about to head home.

02:48:28.180 --> 02:48:30.620
And they're like, no, we're publishing by noon.

02:48:30.620 --> 02:48:32.260
We need an answer by noon.

02:48:32.260 --> 02:48:35.900
And so we downloaded the copy of her thesis

02:48:35.900 --> 02:48:39.980
on like the slow internet and Nary checked it out

02:48:39.980 --> 02:48:42.660
and she said, you know what, looks like they're right.

02:48:42.660 --> 02:48:45.180
And I said, look, you should just admit your mistake.

02:48:45.180 --> 02:48:48.660
And she wrote a very simple, gracious,

02:48:48.660 --> 02:48:51.900
yes, I should have used quotation marks.

02:48:51.900 --> 02:48:54.900
And on the author I failed to cite,

02:48:54.900 --> 02:48:56.820
she pointed out that she cited them eight other times

02:48:56.820 --> 02:48:59.740
and wrote a several paragraph section of her thesis

02:48:59.740 --> 02:49:01.780
acknowledging, you know, his work.

02:49:02.820 --> 02:49:05.140
And none of these were like important parts of her thesis,

02:49:05.140 --> 02:49:06.220
but she acknowledged her mistake.

02:49:06.220 --> 02:49:08.420
And she said, you know, I apologize for my mistake.

02:49:08.420 --> 02:49:11.860
And I apologize to the author who I failed to cite.

02:49:11.860 --> 02:49:14.300
And I stand on the shoulders of, you know,

02:49:14.300 --> 02:49:17.700
all the people came before me and looking to advance work.

02:49:17.700 --> 02:49:19.580
We sort of thought it was over.

02:49:19.580 --> 02:49:20.420
We head home.

02:49:22.900 --> 02:49:23.820
In flight on the way home,

02:49:23.820 --> 02:49:25.740
although we didn't realize this till we got back

02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:27.980
the following day, Business Insider published

02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:31.980
another article and said Neri Oxman admits to plagiarism.

02:49:32.900 --> 02:49:35.420
Plagiarism of course is academic fraud.

02:49:35.420 --> 02:49:37.260
And this thing goes crazy viral.

02:49:37.260 --> 02:49:41.100
How Bill, the title is Bill Ackman's wife,

02:49:41.100 --> 02:49:44.020
celebrity academic Neri Oxman.

02:49:44.020 --> 02:49:48.700
And they use the term celebrity because there are limits

02:49:48.700 --> 02:49:51.740
to what a legitimate media can go after.

02:49:51.740 --> 02:49:54.140
But, you know, celebrities,

02:49:54.140 --> 02:49:56.700
there's a lot more leeway in the media and what they can say.

02:49:56.700 --> 02:49:58.420
So that's why they call her a celebrity.

02:49:58.420 --> 02:50:01.540
First time ever she'd been called a celebrity.

02:50:01.540 --> 02:50:06.540
And they basically, she's admitting to academic fraud.

02:50:07.700 --> 02:50:12.420
And then they said, and then the next day at 5.19 PM,

02:50:12.420 --> 02:50:14.660
I remember the timeline pretty well,

02:50:14.660 --> 02:50:17.500
an email was sent to Fran McGill saying,

02:50:19.620 --> 02:50:21.820
you know, we've identified, you know,

02:50:21.820 --> 02:50:25.580
two dozen other instances of plagiarism in her work,

02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:27.420
15 of which are Wikipedia entries

02:50:27.420 --> 02:50:29.420
where she copied definitions.

02:50:29.420 --> 02:50:33.980
And the others were mostly software or hardware manuals

02:50:33.980 --> 02:50:37.140
for various devices or software she used in her work.

02:50:37.140 --> 02:50:40.020
Most of which were in footnotes where she described a nozzle

02:50:40.020 --> 02:50:42.060
for a 3D printer or something like this.

02:50:43.100 --> 02:50:45.700
And they said, we're publishing, you know, tonight.

02:50:47.220 --> 02:50:50.460
The email they sent to us was 6,900 words.

02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:51.820
It was 12 pages.

02:50:51.820 --> 02:50:53.220
It was practically indecipherable.

02:50:53.220 --> 02:50:55.260
You couldn't even read it in an hour.

02:50:56.180 --> 02:50:57.180
And we didn't have some of the documents

02:50:57.180 --> 02:50:59.020
they were referring to.

02:50:59.020 --> 02:51:01.140
And I'm like, Nare, you know what I'm gonna do?

02:51:01.140 --> 02:51:03.660
I think it will be useful to provide context here.

02:51:05.300 --> 02:51:08.860
I'm gonna do a review of every MIT professor's dissertations,

02:51:08.860 --> 02:51:11.260
every published paper, AI has enabled this.

02:51:12.380 --> 02:51:15.380
And so that was, I put out a tweet basically saying that.

02:51:15.380 --> 02:51:17.140
And we're doing a test run now

02:51:17.140 --> 02:51:18.140
because we have to get it right.

02:51:18.140 --> 02:51:20.100
And I think it will be a useful exercise,

02:51:20.100 --> 02:51:21.860
provide some context, if you will.

02:51:22.860 --> 02:51:25.220
And then this thing goes crazy viral.

02:51:26.380 --> 02:51:30.580
And, you know, Nare is a pretty sensitive person,

02:51:30.580 --> 02:51:32.460
pretty emotional person.

02:51:32.460 --> 02:51:35.060
And someone who's a perfectionist

02:51:35.060 --> 02:51:36.740
and having everyone in the world thinking

02:51:36.740 --> 02:51:40.180
you committed academic fraud is a pretty damning thing.

02:51:40.180 --> 02:51:41.740
Now they did say they did a thorough review

02:51:41.740 --> 02:51:43.100
of all of her work.

02:51:43.100 --> 02:51:43.940
And this is what they found.

02:51:43.940 --> 02:51:46.260
I'm like, sweetheart, that's remarkable.

02:51:46.260 --> 02:51:49.420
I did 130 works, 73 of which were peer reviewed,

02:51:49.420 --> 02:51:50.260
blah, blah, blah.

02:51:50.260 --> 02:51:51.380
And she's published in Nature Science

02:51:51.380 --> 02:51:53.020
and all these different publications.

02:51:53.060 --> 02:51:56.140
That's actually, it's pretty good batting average.

02:51:56.140 --> 02:52:00.100
But, you know, they can't, this is wrong, right?

02:52:00.100 --> 02:52:01.980
This is not academic fraud, okay?

02:52:01.980 --> 02:52:03.260
These are inadvertent mistakes.

02:52:03.260 --> 02:52:04.500
And the Wikipedia entries,

02:52:04.500 --> 02:52:06.420
Nare actually used Wikipedia as a dictionary.

02:52:06.420 --> 02:52:08.420
This is the early days of Wikipedia.

02:52:08.420 --> 02:52:11.300
And they also referred to the MIT handbook,

02:52:11.300 --> 02:52:14.860
which has a whole section on plagiarism, academic handbook.

02:52:14.860 --> 02:52:17.900
And if you read it, which I ultimately did,

02:52:17.900 --> 02:52:20.260
they make clear a few things.

02:52:20.260 --> 02:52:23.580
Number one, there's plagiarism, academic fraud.

02:52:23.580 --> 02:52:26.220
And there's what they call inadvertent plagiarism,

02:52:26.220 --> 02:52:28.780
which is clerical errors where you make a mistake.

02:52:28.780 --> 02:52:30.540
And it depends on intent.

02:52:30.540 --> 02:52:33.500
And there's a link that you can go to,

02:52:33.500 --> 02:52:36.300
which is a section on if you get investigated at MIT,

02:52:36.300 --> 02:52:37.820
what happens, what's the procedure,

02:52:37.820 --> 02:52:40.100
what's the initial stage, what's the investigative stage,

02:52:40.100 --> 02:52:42.980
what's the procedure, if they identify it.

02:52:42.980 --> 02:52:46.780
And they make very clear that academic fraud is,

02:52:46.780 --> 02:52:49.020
and they list plagiarism, you know,

02:52:49.020 --> 02:52:51.300
research theft, a few other things,

02:52:51.300 --> 02:52:54.180
but it does not include honest errors.

02:52:54.180 --> 02:52:58.020
Honest errors are not plagiarism under MIT's own policies.

02:52:58.020 --> 02:53:00.700
And in the handbook, they also have a big section

02:53:00.700 --> 02:53:03.140
on what they call common knowledge.

02:53:03.140 --> 02:53:04.540
And common knowledge depends

02:53:04.540 --> 02:53:06.420
on who you're writing your thesis for.

02:53:07.660 --> 02:53:12.140
And so if it's a fact that is known by your audience,

02:53:12.140 --> 02:53:14.500
you're not required to quote or cite.

02:53:14.500 --> 02:53:16.660
And so all those Wikipedia entries were for things

02:53:16.660 --> 02:53:18.980
like sustainable design, computer aided design,

02:53:19.980 --> 02:53:22.460
she just took a definition from Wikipedia,

02:53:22.460 --> 02:53:24.540
common knowledge to her readers,

02:53:24.540 --> 02:53:28.100
no obligation under the handbook, totally exempt.

02:53:28.100 --> 02:53:32.420
On the, using the same words, she referred to like,

02:53:32.420 --> 02:53:33.860
whatever, some kind of 3D printer,

02:53:33.860 --> 02:53:36.100
she was the Stratasys 3D printer,

02:53:36.100 --> 02:53:38.380
and she quoted from the manual right away.

02:53:38.380 --> 02:53:40.140
Stratasys is a company you consulted for,

02:53:40.140 --> 02:53:42.540
they're very, you don't need to, that's not something,

02:53:42.540 --> 02:53:43.620
you're not stealing their ideas,

02:53:43.620 --> 02:53:46.220
you're describing a nozzle for a device

02:53:46.220 --> 02:53:48.060
you use in your work in a footnote.

02:53:48.100 --> 02:53:50.780
That's not a theft of idea, right?

02:53:52.220 --> 02:53:54.220
And so I'm like, this is crazy.

02:53:54.220 --> 02:53:56.820
And so this has got to stop.

02:53:56.820 --> 02:54:00.700
And so I reach out to the,

02:54:00.700 --> 02:54:02.460
a guy I knew was on the board of business insider,

02:54:02.460 --> 02:54:05.900
the chairman, and his name is gonna come public shortly.

02:54:05.900 --> 02:54:09.580
I committed to that time to keep his name confidential.

02:54:09.580 --> 02:54:11.700
It's now surfaced publicly in the press.

02:54:11.700 --> 02:54:13.620
Can I just pause real quick here?

02:54:13.620 --> 02:54:16.540
Just to, I don't know,

02:54:16.540 --> 02:54:17.980
there's a lot of things I wanna say,

02:54:18.900 --> 02:54:20.500
but you made it pretty clear,

02:54:20.500 --> 02:54:23.080
but just as a member of the community,

02:54:24.940 --> 02:54:27.100
there's also a common sense test.

02:54:27.100 --> 02:54:31.740
I think you're more precisely legal and looking at,

02:54:31.740 --> 02:54:34.100
but there's just a bullshit test,

02:54:34.100 --> 02:54:38.540
and nothing that Nary did is plagiarism

02:54:38.540 --> 02:54:41.300
in the bad meaning of the word.

02:54:41.300 --> 02:54:43.780
Plagiarism right now is becoming another ism,

02:54:43.780 --> 02:54:47.100
like racism or so on, using as an attack word.

02:54:47.180 --> 02:54:48.780
I don't care what the meaning of it is,

02:54:48.780 --> 02:54:52.300
but there's the bad academic fraud, like theft.

02:54:52.300 --> 02:54:54.020
Theft of an idea.

02:54:54.020 --> 02:54:56.740
And maybe you can say a lot of definitions

02:54:56.740 --> 02:54:57.580
and this kind of stuff,

02:54:57.580 --> 02:54:59.900
but then there's just a basic bullshit test

02:54:59.900 --> 02:55:02.740
where everyone knows this is a thief,

02:55:02.740 --> 02:55:05.300
and this is definitely not a thief.

02:55:05.300 --> 02:55:08.620
And there's nothing about anything that Nary did,

02:55:08.620 --> 02:55:12.460
anything in her thesis or in her life,

02:55:12.460 --> 02:55:16.380
everyone that knows her, she's a rock star, right?

02:55:16.380 --> 02:55:18.140
I just wanna make it clear,

02:55:18.140 --> 02:55:20.420
it really hurt me that the internet,

02:55:20.420 --> 02:55:22.700
whatever is happening, could go after,

02:55:22.700 --> 02:55:27.700
could go after a great scientist,

02:55:28.100 --> 02:55:29.420
because I love science,

02:55:29.420 --> 02:55:32.060
and I love celebrating great scientists.

02:55:33.020 --> 02:55:37.380
And it's just really messed up that whatever the machine,

02:55:37.380 --> 02:55:40.700
and we could talk about business insight or whatever,

02:55:40.700 --> 02:55:45.480
social media, mass hysteria, whatever is happening,

02:55:46.120 --> 02:55:48.640
we need the great scientists of the world,

02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:50.680
because the future depends on them.

02:55:50.680 --> 02:55:52.880
And so we need to celebrate them and protect them

02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:56.320
and let them flourish and let them do their thing

02:55:56.320 --> 02:56:00.280
and keep them out of this whatever shit storm

02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:03.040
that we're doing to get clips and advertisements

02:56:03.040 --> 02:56:05.880
and drama and all this kind of, we need to protect them.

02:56:05.880 --> 02:56:08.680
So I just wanna say, there's nobody I know,

02:56:08.680 --> 02:56:13.440
and I have a million friends that are scientists,

02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:15.520
world-class scientists, Nobel Prize winners,

02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:18.360
they all love Neri, they all respect Neri,

02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:20.120
she did zero wrong.

02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:23.000
And then the rest of the conversation we're gonna have

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.200
about how broken journalism is and so on,

02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:28.280
but I just wanna say that there's nothing

02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:31.800
that Neri did wrong, it's not a gray area or so on.

02:56:31.800 --> 02:56:35.960
I also personally don't love that Claudine Gay

02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:37.960
is a discussion about plagiarism,

02:56:37.960 --> 02:56:42.220
because it distracts from the fundamentals that is broken.

02:56:43.220 --> 02:56:46.060
It becomes some weird technical discussion.

02:56:46.900 --> 02:56:49.900
But in case of Neri, did nothing wrong,

02:56:49.900 --> 02:56:53.300
great scientist, great engineer at MIT and beyond,

02:56:53.300 --> 02:56:55.900
she's doing the cool thing now, so anyway.

02:56:55.900 --> 02:56:57.140
Could not have said it better myself.

02:56:57.140 --> 02:56:59.340
Now obviously I'm focused on the technical part.

02:56:59.340 --> 02:57:02.500
Right, because you wanna be precise here.

02:57:02.500 --> 02:57:04.500
Well, it's not even that, I mean, yes,

02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:06.900
I have said that we're gonna sue business insider,

02:57:06.900 --> 02:57:10.820
and in 35 years of my career of someone

02:57:10.820 --> 02:57:13.780
who is not every article has been a favorable one.

02:57:13.780 --> 02:57:16.100
Not every article has been an accurate one.

02:57:16.100 --> 02:57:18.720
I've never threatened to sue the media,

02:57:18.720 --> 02:57:23.700
and I've never sued the media, but this is so egregious.

02:57:23.700 --> 02:57:26.100
It's not just that she did nothing wrong,

02:57:26.100 --> 02:57:30.940
but the accuser of academic fraud, they did it knowing,

02:57:30.940 --> 02:57:33.420
they make reference to MIT's own handbook,

02:57:33.420 --> 02:57:35.320
so they had to read all the same stuff

02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:38.220
that I read in the handbook, they did that work.

02:57:39.140 --> 02:57:43.740
Then after I escalated this thing to the,

02:57:43.740 --> 02:57:46.380
Henry Blodgett, the chairman of Business Insider,

02:57:46.380 --> 02:57:49.140
to the CEO of Axel Springer,

02:57:49.140 --> 02:57:50.660
I even reached out to Henry Kravis

02:57:50.660 --> 02:57:51.540
at a certain point in time,

02:57:51.540 --> 02:57:52.700
one of the controlling shareholders

02:57:52.700 --> 02:57:54.180
of the company through KKR,

02:57:56.540 --> 02:57:59.940
laying out the factual errors in the article.

02:57:59.940 --> 02:58:02.060
Business Insider went public

02:58:02.060 --> 02:58:05.540
after they said Neri committed academic fraud and plagiarism

02:58:05.540 --> 02:58:07.740
and said, we didn't challenge any,

02:58:07.740 --> 02:58:11.660
the facts remain undisputed in the article.

02:58:11.660 --> 02:58:15.460
So it's basically, Neri committed plagiarism,

02:58:15.460 --> 02:58:16.700
that's story one.

02:58:16.700 --> 02:58:19.580
Neri admits to plagiarism, she admits to plagiarism.

02:58:19.580 --> 02:58:22.380
She admitted to making a few clerical errors.

02:58:22.380 --> 02:58:24.180
That's the only thing she admitted to,

02:58:24.180 --> 02:58:25.520
and she graciously apologized.

02:58:25.520 --> 02:58:27.620
So they said, Neri admits to plagiarism,

02:58:27.620 --> 02:58:30.180
apologizes for plagiarism, that's incredibly damning.

02:58:30.180 --> 02:58:32.540
And by the way, we're doing an investigation

02:58:32.540 --> 02:58:34.180
because we're concerned that there might have been

02:58:34.180 --> 02:58:36.780
an inappropriate process,

02:58:36.780 --> 02:58:39.660
but the facts of the story have not been disputed

02:58:39.660 --> 02:58:43.660
by Neri Oxman or Bill Ackman, and that was totally false.

02:58:43.660 --> 02:58:46.360
I had done it privately, I had done it publicly,

02:58:46.360 --> 02:58:48.300
on Twitter, on X.

02:58:48.300 --> 02:58:51.100
I laid out, I have a whole tech stream,

02:58:51.100 --> 02:58:53.260
a WhatsApp stream with the CEO of the company,

02:58:53.260 --> 02:58:56.000
and they double down, they double down again.

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.140
And so I don't sue people lightly.

02:58:59.480 --> 02:59:02.900
And you stay tuned.

02:59:02.900 --> 02:59:07.900
So you're, at least for now, moving forward with-

02:59:08.260 --> 02:59:10.180
It's a certainty we're moving forward.

02:59:11.100 --> 02:59:13.780
There's a step we can take prior to suing them,

02:59:14.700 --> 02:59:18.340
where we basically send them a letter

02:59:18.340 --> 02:59:20.620
demanding they make a series of corrections.

02:59:21.460 --> 02:59:24.460
That if they don't make those corrections,

02:59:24.460 --> 02:59:26.660
the next step is litigation.

02:59:26.660 --> 02:59:28.740
I hope we can avoid the next step.

02:59:28.740 --> 02:59:32.100
And I'm just making sure that when we present the demand

02:59:32.100 --> 02:59:35.820
to Business Insider and also to Axel Springer,

02:59:35.820 --> 02:59:40.660
that it's incredibly clear how they defamed her,

02:59:40.660 --> 02:59:42.460
the factual mistakes in her stories,

02:59:43.500 --> 02:59:45.180
and what they need to do to fix it.

02:59:45.180 --> 02:59:48.180
And if we can fix it there, we can move on from this episode

02:59:48.180 --> 02:59:50.540
and hopefully avoid litigation.

02:59:50.540 --> 02:59:51.460
So that's where we are.

02:59:51.460 --> 02:59:52.860
I don't know, you're smarter than me,

02:59:52.860 --> 02:59:54.820
there's technical stuff, there's legal stuff,

02:59:54.820 --> 02:59:56.100
there's journalistic stuff,

02:59:56.100 --> 02:59:59.980
but just fuck you, Business Insider, for doing this.

03:00:00.020 --> 03:00:03.540
I don't know much in this world,

03:00:03.540 --> 03:00:06.860
but journalists aren't supposed to do that.

03:00:06.860 --> 03:00:08.180
Now look, we're gonna surface

03:00:08.180 --> 03:00:10.420
all this stuff publicly ultimately.

03:00:11.340 --> 03:00:13.860
The email was not to nary saying

03:00:13.860 --> 03:00:15.300
there was plagiarism at work.

03:00:15.300 --> 03:00:17.940
The email came from a reporter named Catherine Long.

03:00:17.940 --> 03:00:21.300
The headline was, your wife committed plagiarism,

03:00:21.300 --> 03:00:24.540
shouldn't she be fired from MIT?

03:00:24.540 --> 03:00:26.020
Just like you caused Claudine Gay

03:00:26.020 --> 03:00:28.020
to be fired from Harvard.

03:00:28.020 --> 03:00:30.900
It was a political agenda.

03:00:30.900 --> 03:00:32.980
She doesn't like me, okay.

03:00:32.980 --> 03:00:35.020
And she was trying to hurt me

03:00:35.020 --> 03:00:37.220
and they couldn't find plagiarism in my thesis.

03:00:37.220 --> 03:00:42.140
And being the subject of short, being a short seller,

03:00:42.140 --> 03:00:44.980
the Herbalife battle went on for years.

03:00:44.980 --> 03:00:47.620
They tried to do everything to destroy my reputation.

03:00:47.620 --> 03:00:49.060
So they've already gone through my trash,

03:00:49.060 --> 03:00:50.860
they've already done all that work.

03:00:50.860 --> 03:00:53.980
So anything they could possibly find,

03:00:54.860 --> 03:00:59.540
I've always lived a very clean life, okay, thankfully.

03:00:59.540 --> 03:01:01.060
And if you're gonna be an activist short seller,

03:01:01.060 --> 03:01:02.980
you better, because they're gonna find out dirt

03:01:02.980 --> 03:01:05.020
on you if it exists.

03:01:05.020 --> 03:01:07.740
And so they're like, how can we really hurt Bill?

03:01:07.740 --> 03:01:10.340
By the way, Nary had left MIT years earlier.

03:01:10.340 --> 03:01:12.300
When the reporter found out she was no longer

03:01:12.300 --> 03:01:14.660
a member of the MIT faculty, they were enraged.

03:01:14.660 --> 03:01:15.980
They didn't believe us.

03:01:15.980 --> 03:01:18.060
They made us like, prove to us

03:01:18.060 --> 03:01:19.460
she's no longer on the MIT faculty

03:01:19.460 --> 03:01:20.740
because they wanted to get her fired.

03:01:20.740 --> 03:01:25.740
And by the way, malice is one of the important factors

03:01:26.100 --> 03:01:28.420
in determining whether defamation has taken place.

03:01:28.420 --> 03:01:33.420
And this was a malice driven, this was not about news.

03:01:33.420 --> 03:01:36.220
And the unfortunate thing about journalism

03:01:36.220 --> 03:01:38.500
is Business Insider made a fortune from this.

03:01:38.500 --> 03:01:41.700
This story was published and republished

03:01:41.700 --> 03:01:44.620
by thousands of media organizations around the world.

03:01:44.620 --> 03:01:46.500
It was the number one trending thing on Twitter

03:01:46.500 --> 03:01:47.900
for like two days.

03:01:48.900 --> 03:01:51.700
Every newspaper, it was on the front page

03:01:51.700 --> 03:01:53.260
of every Israeli newspaper,

03:01:54.460 --> 03:01:56.580
was on the front page of the Financial Times.

03:01:56.580 --> 03:01:59.860
Okay, so this, and she's building a business.

03:01:59.860 --> 03:02:03.900
And if you're CEO of a science company

03:02:03.900 --> 03:02:05.340
and you committed academic fraud,

03:02:05.340 --> 03:02:07.340
that's incredibly damaging.

03:02:07.340 --> 03:02:10.940
But I ultimately convinced her that this was good.

03:02:10.940 --> 03:02:13.780
I said, sweetheart, you're amazing.

03:02:13.780 --> 03:02:14.620
You're incredible.

03:02:14.620 --> 03:02:15.700
You're incredibly talented,

03:02:15.700 --> 03:02:17.780
but you're mostly known in the design world.

03:02:18.660 --> 03:02:20.660
Now everyone in the universe, okay,

03:02:20.660 --> 03:02:22.780
has heard of Neri Oxman, okay?

03:02:22.780 --> 03:02:24.660
We're gonna get this thing cleared up.

03:02:24.660 --> 03:02:27.620
You're gonna be doing an event in six months

03:02:27.620 --> 03:02:29.140
where you're gonna tell the world,

03:02:29.140 --> 03:02:30.140
you're gonna go out of stealth mode.

03:02:30.140 --> 03:02:31.780
You can tell the world about all the incredible things

03:02:31.780 --> 03:02:33.540
that you're building and you're designing

03:02:33.540 --> 03:02:35.460
and you're creating.

03:02:35.460 --> 03:02:37.940
And it's gonna be like the iPhone launch

03:02:37.940 --> 03:02:39.740
because everyone's gonna be paying attention

03:02:39.740 --> 03:02:42.380
and they're gonna wanna see your work.

03:02:42.380 --> 03:02:45.740
And that's how I try to cheer up, but I think it's true.

03:02:45.780 --> 03:02:49.860
It is true, and you're doing your job as a good partner

03:02:49.860 --> 03:02:52.180
seeing the silver lining of all of this.

03:02:52.180 --> 03:02:54.500
How is, just from observing her,

03:02:54.500 --> 03:02:59.500
how did she stay strong through all of this psychologically?

03:03:01.420 --> 03:03:04.660
Because at least I know she's pushing ahead with the work.

03:03:04.660 --> 03:03:06.140
Oh, she's full speed ahead in her work.

03:03:06.140 --> 03:03:07.140
She's built an amazing team.

03:03:07.140 --> 03:03:11.540
She's hired 30 scientists, roboticists,

03:03:11.540 --> 03:03:14.940
people who, biologists, plant specialists,

03:03:14.940 --> 03:03:19.940
material scientists, engineers, really incredible crew.

03:03:19.940 --> 03:03:22.220
She's built this 36,000 square foot lab in New York City

03:03:22.220 --> 03:03:23.380
that's one of a kind.

03:03:23.380 --> 03:03:25.180
It's still, they're working out of it.

03:03:25.180 --> 03:03:26.100
It's still under construction

03:03:26.100 --> 03:03:27.620
while they're working out of it.

03:03:28.780 --> 03:03:30.780
And so she's gonna do amazing things.

03:03:30.780 --> 03:03:34.860
But as I said, she's an extremely sensitive person.

03:03:34.860 --> 03:03:36.740
She's a perfectionist.

03:03:36.740 --> 03:03:39.740
Imagine thinking that the entire world thinks

03:03:39.740 --> 03:03:41.660
you've committed academic fraud.

03:03:41.660 --> 03:03:44.100
And so that was very hard for her.

03:03:44.100 --> 03:03:45.460
She's a very positive person,

03:03:45.460 --> 03:03:46.900
but I saw her in, I would say,

03:03:46.900 --> 03:03:51.300
her darkest emotional period, for sure.

03:03:52.220 --> 03:03:54.060
She's doing much better now.

03:03:54.060 --> 03:03:55.460
But you can kill someone.

03:03:56.300 --> 03:03:59.900
You can kill someone by destroying their reputation.

03:03:59.900 --> 03:04:01.540
People commit suicide.

03:04:01.540 --> 03:04:05.620
People go into these deep, dark depression.

03:04:05.620 --> 03:04:07.380
Well, my worry,

03:04:07.380 --> 03:04:09.900
primarily when I saw what Business Insider was doing,

03:04:09.900 --> 03:04:14.660
is that they might dim the light

03:04:18.060 --> 03:04:20.260
of a truly special scientist and creator.

03:04:20.260 --> 03:04:21.980
It's not gonna happen.

03:04:21.980 --> 03:04:26.980
But I also worry about others, like young nares,

03:04:27.700 --> 03:04:32.700
that this sends a signal to that might scare them.

03:04:32.740 --> 03:04:37.740
And journalism shouldn't scare aspiring young scientists.

03:04:38.180 --> 03:04:41.940
The problem is the defamation law in the US

03:04:41.940 --> 03:04:45.980
is so favorable to the publisher, to the media,

03:04:45.980 --> 03:04:50.220
and so unfavorable to the victim.

03:04:50.220 --> 03:04:51.900
And the incentives are all wrong.

03:04:52.980 --> 03:04:56.300
When you went from a paper version of journalism to digital,

03:04:56.300 --> 03:04:58.460
and you could track how many people click,

03:04:59.580 --> 03:05:04.340
and it's a medium that advertising drives the economics.

03:05:04.340 --> 03:05:06.860
And if you can show an advertiser more clicks,

03:05:06.860 --> 03:05:08.740
you can make more money, right?

03:05:08.740 --> 03:05:12.180
So a journalist is incentivized to write a story

03:05:12.180 --> 03:05:13.260
that will generate more clicks.

03:05:13.260 --> 03:05:15.500
How do you write a story that will generate more clicks?

03:05:15.500 --> 03:05:18.460
You get a billionaire guy, okay?

03:05:18.460 --> 03:05:20.460
And then you go after his wife,

03:05:20.460 --> 03:05:22.700
and you make a sensationalist story,

03:05:22.700 --> 03:05:25.860
and you give them no time to respond, right?

03:05:25.860 --> 03:05:27.980
Look at the timing here.

03:05:27.980 --> 03:05:31.620
On the first story, they gave us three hours.

03:05:31.620 --> 03:05:35.100
On the second one, the following day, 5.19 p.m.,

03:05:35.100 --> 03:05:37.780
the email comes in, not to Nary, not to her firm,

03:05:37.780 --> 03:05:39.700
but to my communications person,

03:05:39.700 --> 03:05:43.340
who tracks us down by 5.30, 10 minutes later.

03:05:43.340 --> 03:05:47.140
And they published their story 92 minutes after,

03:05:47.140 --> 03:05:47.980
and they sent us,

03:05:47.980 --> 03:05:50.740
we're gonna surface all these documents in our demand.

03:05:52.380 --> 03:05:54.020
Read the email they sent,

03:05:54.020 --> 03:05:55.620
whether you could even decipher it.

03:05:59.140 --> 03:06:02.860
And by the way, there's a reason why academic institutions,

03:06:02.900 --> 03:06:05.100
when a professor is accused of plagiarism,

03:06:05.100 --> 03:06:07.340
why they have these very careful processes

03:06:07.340 --> 03:06:08.540
with multiple stages,

03:06:08.540 --> 03:06:11.460
and they can take a year or more,

03:06:11.460 --> 03:06:12.940
because it depends on intent.

03:06:13.820 --> 03:06:17.220
Was this intentional, in order to be a crime,

03:06:17.220 --> 03:06:18.940
an academic crime,

03:06:18.940 --> 03:06:21.100
you gotta prove that they intentionally stole.

03:06:21.100 --> 03:06:22.340
Look, in some cases, it's obvious,

03:06:22.340 --> 03:06:24.180
in some cases, it's very subtle,

03:06:24.180 --> 03:06:26.140
and they take this stuff super seriously.

03:06:26.140 --> 03:06:29.540
But they basically accused Nary of academic crime,

03:06:29.540 --> 03:06:30.860
and then 92 minutes later,

03:06:30.860 --> 03:06:33.260
they said she committed an academic crime,

03:06:33.260 --> 03:06:34.620
and that should be a crime,

03:06:34.620 --> 03:06:37.700
and that should be punishable with litigation,

03:06:37.700 --> 03:06:39.940
and there should be a real cost.

03:06:39.940 --> 03:06:42.180
And we're gonna make sure there's a real cost,

03:06:42.180 --> 03:06:44.460
reputationally and otherwise, to Business Insider,

03:06:44.460 --> 03:06:45.860
and to Axel Springer,

03:06:45.860 --> 03:06:48.740
because ultimately, you gotta look to the controlling owner.

03:06:48.740 --> 03:06:50.580
They're responsible.

03:06:50.580 --> 03:06:52.540
I'll just say that you, in this regard,

03:06:52.540 --> 03:06:55.540
are inspiring to me for facing,

03:06:55.580 --> 03:07:00.580
for facing basically an institution

03:07:03.660 --> 03:07:08.300
that's whole purpose is to write articles.

03:07:08.300 --> 03:07:10.420
So you're like going into the fire.

03:07:10.420 --> 03:07:13.220
My kid's school, the epithet for the school,

03:07:13.220 --> 03:07:15.820
or the saying, is go forth unafraid.

03:07:15.820 --> 03:07:18.540
I think it's a good way to live.

03:07:18.540 --> 03:07:21.180
And again, words can't harm me.

03:07:21.460 --> 03:07:24.900
You know, the power of X,

03:07:24.900 --> 03:07:29.660
and we do owe Ilan enormous thanks for this,

03:07:29.660 --> 03:07:31.860
is now, so for example,

03:07:31.860 --> 03:07:33.180
The Washington Post wrote a story about me

03:07:33.180 --> 03:07:34.820
a couple days ago,

03:07:34.820 --> 03:07:38.820
and I didn't think the story was a fair story.

03:07:38.820 --> 03:07:41.500
So within a few hours of the story being written,

03:07:41.500 --> 03:07:44.100
I'm able to put out a response to the story

03:07:44.100 --> 03:07:46.340
and send it to 1,200,000 people,

03:07:46.340 --> 03:07:49.460
and it gets read and reread, I haven't checked,

03:07:49.460 --> 03:07:53.300
but probably five million people saw my response.

03:07:53.300 --> 03:07:54.740
Now, those are the people on X.

03:07:54.740 --> 03:07:55.980
It's not everyone in the world.

03:07:55.980 --> 03:07:59.500
There's a disconnection between the X world

03:07:59.500 --> 03:08:00.660
and the offline world.

03:08:01.820 --> 03:08:06.820
But reputation in my business is basically all you have.

03:08:06.820 --> 03:08:09.060
And as they say, you can take a lifetime

03:08:09.060 --> 03:08:10.660
to build a reputation and take five minutes

03:08:10.660 --> 03:08:11.500
to have it disappear,

03:08:11.500 --> 03:08:13.740
and the media plays a very important role,

03:08:13.740 --> 03:08:15.220
and they can destroy people.

03:08:16.140 --> 03:08:18.860
At least we now have some ability to fight back.

03:08:18.860 --> 03:08:21.220
We have a platform, we can surface our views.

03:08:21.220 --> 03:08:22.780
The typical old days,

03:08:22.780 --> 03:08:24.180
they write an incredibly damning article,

03:08:24.180 --> 03:08:25.660
and you point out factual errors,

03:08:25.660 --> 03:08:26.700
and then like two months later,

03:08:26.700 --> 03:08:28.660
they bury a little correction on page whatever.

03:08:28.660 --> 03:08:29.860
By then the person was fired,

03:08:29.860 --> 03:08:33.780
or their life was destroyed, or the reputation's damaged.

03:08:33.780 --> 03:08:36.020
You know, I was with Warren Buffett talking about media,

03:08:36.020 --> 03:08:38.940
and it's something he, a business he really loves.

03:08:38.940 --> 03:08:40.860
And he says, you know what, Bill?

03:08:40.860 --> 03:08:42.860
He said, a thief with a dagger.

03:08:42.860 --> 03:08:44.340
The only person who can cause you more harm

03:08:44.340 --> 03:08:47.380
than a thief with a dagger is a journalist with a pen.

03:08:47.380 --> 03:08:50.660
And those were very powerful words.

03:08:50.660 --> 03:08:54.180
So you think X, formerly known as Twitter,

03:08:54.180 --> 03:08:56.700
is a kind of neutralizing force to that,

03:08:56.700 --> 03:09:00.060
to the power of centralized journalistic institutions?

03:09:00.060 --> 03:09:00.980
100%.

03:09:00.980 --> 03:09:02.540
And I think it's a really important one,

03:09:02.540 --> 03:09:05.140
and it's really been eye-opening for me

03:09:05.140 --> 03:09:08.700
to see how stories get covered in mainstream media.

03:09:08.700 --> 03:09:09.980
And then you actually, you know,

03:09:09.980 --> 03:09:12.220
what I do on X is I follow people

03:09:12.220 --> 03:09:14.300
on multiple sides of an issue.

03:09:14.300 --> 03:09:17.380
And you can, or I post on a topic,

03:09:17.380 --> 03:09:18.900
and I get to hear the other side.

03:09:18.900 --> 03:09:21.140
You know, I read the replies.

03:09:21.140 --> 03:09:23.380
And, you know, the truth is something

03:09:23.380 --> 03:09:25.700
that people have had a lot of question about,

03:09:25.700 --> 03:09:29.540
particularly in the last, I would say, five years.

03:09:29.540 --> 03:09:31.620
You know, beginning with, you know,

03:09:31.620 --> 03:09:34.140
Trump's talking about fake news.

03:09:34.140 --> 03:09:36.940
And a lot of what Trump said about fake news is true.

03:09:36.940 --> 03:09:39.860
You know, the world, a big part of the world hated Trump

03:09:39.860 --> 03:09:42.860
and did everything they could to discredit him,

03:09:42.900 --> 03:09:43.780
destroy him.

03:09:44.860 --> 03:09:48.540
And, you know, he did a lot of things perhaps deserving

03:09:48.540 --> 03:09:52.460
of being discredited, used by a very imperfect,

03:09:52.460 --> 03:09:55.940
in some cases, harmful leader.

03:09:55.940 --> 03:09:58.780
But, you know, everything from pre-election, you know,

03:09:58.780 --> 03:10:03.660
the Hunter Biden laptop story in the New York Post

03:10:03.660 --> 03:10:08.660
that, you know, then Twitter, you know,

03:10:08.780 --> 03:10:12.100
made it difficult for people to share

03:10:12.100 --> 03:10:17.100
and to read, you know, COVID, you know,

03:10:17.780 --> 03:10:20.500
the jay batasharas of the world,

03:10:20.500 --> 03:10:23.380
questioning the government's response,

03:10:23.380 --> 03:10:27.740
questioning, you know, long-term lockdowns,

03:10:27.740 --> 03:10:29.860
questioning keeping kids out of school,

03:10:29.860 --> 03:10:32.380
questions about masks, about vaccines,

03:10:33.220 --> 03:10:35.260
which are still not definitively answered.

03:10:36.380 --> 03:10:39.940
No counterbalance to the power of the government

03:10:39.940 --> 03:10:42.820
when the government can shut down avenues for free speech

03:10:44.780 --> 03:10:47.220
and where the mainstream media has kind of towed the line

03:10:47.220 --> 03:10:49.620
in many extents to the government's action.

03:10:49.620 --> 03:10:53.380
So having a independently owned powerful platform

03:10:53.380 --> 03:10:58.260
is very important for truth, for free speech,

03:10:58.260 --> 03:10:59.620
for hearing the other side of the story,

03:10:59.620 --> 03:11:02.180
for counterbalancing the power of the government.

03:11:02.180 --> 03:11:06.940
Elon is getting, you know, a lot of pushback.

03:11:07.820 --> 03:11:09.860
You know, the SpaceX's and Tesla's of the world

03:11:10.780 --> 03:11:14.740
are experiencing a lot of government, you know,

03:11:14.740 --> 03:11:16.860
questions and investigations.

03:11:16.860 --> 03:11:18.420
And, you know, even the president of the United States

03:11:18.420 --> 03:11:21.140
came out and said, look, he needs to be investigated.

03:11:22.060 --> 03:11:23.580
You know, I'm getting my own version of that

03:11:23.580 --> 03:11:26.100
in terms of some negative media articles.

03:11:26.100 --> 03:11:27.940
I don't know what's next.

03:11:27.940 --> 03:11:30.460
But yeah, if you stick your neck out in today's world

03:11:30.460 --> 03:11:33.260
and you go against the establishment

03:11:33.260 --> 03:11:37.940
or at least the existing administration,

03:11:37.940 --> 03:11:40.820
you can find yourself in a very challenged place

03:11:40.820 --> 03:11:42.980
and that discourages people from sharing stuff.

03:11:42.980 --> 03:11:45.340
And that's why anonymous speech is important,

03:11:45.340 --> 03:11:46.940
some of what you find on Twitter.

03:11:46.940 --> 03:11:50.260
You mentioned Trump, I have to talk to you about politics.

03:11:50.260 --> 03:11:51.100
Sure.

03:11:51.100 --> 03:11:52.580
Amongst all the other battles,

03:11:52.580 --> 03:11:54.900
you've also been a part of that one.

03:11:54.900 --> 03:11:55.940
Maybe you can correct me on this,

03:11:55.940 --> 03:11:56.900
but you've been a big supporter

03:11:56.900 --> 03:11:59.340
of various democratic candidates over the years.

03:12:02.420 --> 03:12:06.740
But you did say a lot of nice things about Donald Trump

03:12:07.940 --> 03:12:10.100
in 2016, I believe.

03:12:10.100 --> 03:12:11.500
So I was interviewed by Andrew Sorkin

03:12:11.500 --> 03:12:13.340
a week after Trump won the election.

03:12:13.340 --> 03:12:14.180
Yes.

03:12:14.180 --> 03:12:15.460
And I made my case for why I thought

03:12:15.460 --> 03:12:16.460
he could be a good president.

03:12:16.460 --> 03:12:17.580
Yes.

03:12:17.580 --> 03:12:19.980
So what was the case back then?

03:12:19.980 --> 03:12:22.220
To which degree did that turn out to be true

03:12:22.220 --> 03:12:24.740
and to which degree did it not?

03:12:24.740 --> 03:12:26.180
To which degree was he a good president

03:12:26.180 --> 03:12:28.020
and to which degree was he not a good president?

03:12:28.020 --> 03:12:29.940
Look, I think what I said at the time

03:12:29.940 --> 03:12:34.580
was the United States is actually a huge business.

03:12:34.580 --> 03:12:36.420
And it reminds me a bit of the type

03:12:36.420 --> 03:12:38.260
of activist investments we've taken on over time,

03:12:38.260 --> 03:12:39.580
where this really, really great business

03:12:39.580 --> 03:12:41.180
has kind of lost its way.

03:12:41.180 --> 03:12:43.580
And with the right leadership, we can fix it.

03:12:43.580 --> 03:12:46.300
And if you think about the business of the United States,

03:12:46.300 --> 03:12:48.700
today, you've got $32 trillion with the debt,

03:12:48.700 --> 03:12:52.780
so it's over-leveraged or it's highly leveraged

03:12:52.780 --> 03:12:54.860
and the leverage is only increasing.

03:12:54.860 --> 03:12:57.580
We're losing money, i.e. revenues,

03:12:57.580 --> 03:12:59.740
aren't covering expenses.

03:12:59.740 --> 03:13:01.020
The cost of our debt is going up,

03:13:01.020 --> 03:13:02.060
as interest rates have gone up

03:13:02.060 --> 03:13:04.020
and the debt has to be rolled over.

03:13:04.020 --> 03:13:09.020
We have enormous administrative bloat in the country.

03:13:09.820 --> 03:13:12.540
The regulatory regime is incredibly complicated

03:13:12.540 --> 03:13:14.780
and burdensome and impeding growth.

03:13:16.100 --> 03:13:19.980
Our relations with our competitor nations

03:13:19.980 --> 03:13:23.580
and our friendly nations are far from ideal.

03:13:23.580 --> 03:13:25.860
And those conditions were present in 2020 as well.

03:13:25.860 --> 03:13:28.020
They're just, I would say, worse now.

03:13:28.020 --> 03:13:30.060
And I said, look, it's a great thing

03:13:30.060 --> 03:13:33.260
that we have a businessman as president.

03:13:33.260 --> 03:13:36.100
And in my lifetime, he's really the first businessman

03:13:36.100 --> 03:13:38.420
as opposed to, I mean, maybe Bush to some degree

03:13:38.420 --> 03:13:42.300
was a business person, but I thought, okay.

03:13:42.300 --> 03:13:45.060
I was one of the CEO to be CEO of America

03:13:45.060 --> 03:13:46.460
and now we have Trump.

03:13:46.460 --> 03:13:48.380
Look, he's got some personal qualities

03:13:48.380 --> 03:13:50.980
that seem less ideal,

03:13:50.980 --> 03:13:52.500
but he's gonna be president of the United States.

03:13:52.500 --> 03:13:53.780
He's gonna rise to the occasion.

03:13:53.780 --> 03:13:55.620
This is gonna be his legacy.

03:13:55.620 --> 03:13:58.420
And he knows how to make deals

03:13:58.420 --> 03:14:01.060
and he's gonna recruit some great people

03:14:01.060 --> 03:14:02.740
into his administration, I hoped.

03:14:03.940 --> 03:14:06.780
And growth can solve a lot of our problems.

03:14:06.780 --> 03:14:09.380
So if we can get rid of a bunch of regulations

03:14:09.380 --> 03:14:10.980
that are holding back the country,

03:14:10.980 --> 03:14:11.980
we can have a president.

03:14:11.980 --> 03:14:16.980
Obama was a, I would say, not a pro-business president.

03:14:16.980 --> 03:14:18.940
He did not love the business community.

03:14:18.940 --> 03:14:20.700
He did not love successful people.

03:14:21.660 --> 03:14:25.460
And having a president who just changed the tone

03:14:25.460 --> 03:14:28.020
on being a pro-business president,

03:14:28.020 --> 03:14:29.260
I thought would be good for the country.

03:14:29.260 --> 03:14:30.980
And that's basically what I said.

03:14:31.820 --> 03:14:33.940
And I would say Trump did a lot of good things.

03:14:34.940 --> 03:14:35.780
And a lot of people,

03:14:35.780 --> 03:14:38.340
you can get criticized for acknowledging that.

03:14:38.340 --> 03:14:41.500
But I think the country's economy

03:14:41.500 --> 03:14:43.100
accelerated dramatically.

03:14:43.100 --> 03:14:45.940
And that, by the way, the capitalist system

03:14:45.940 --> 03:14:48.700
helps the people at the bottom best

03:14:48.700 --> 03:14:49.780
when the system does well

03:14:49.780 --> 03:14:51.140
and when the economy does well.

03:14:51.140 --> 03:14:54.220
The black unemployment rate was the lowest in history

03:14:54.220 --> 03:14:55.220
when Trump was president.

03:14:55.220 --> 03:14:58.260
And that's true for other minority groups.

03:14:58.260 --> 03:15:00.420
So it was good for the economy

03:15:00.940 --> 03:15:05.180
and he recognized some of the challenges

03:15:05.180 --> 03:15:07.180
and issues and threats of China early.

03:15:08.340 --> 03:15:10.460
He kind of woke up NATO.

03:15:10.460 --> 03:15:12.300
Now, again, the way he did all of this stuff,

03:15:12.300 --> 03:15:13.260
you can object to.

03:15:14.300 --> 03:15:18.260
But NATO actually started spending more money on defense

03:15:18.260 --> 03:15:20.140
in the early part of Trump's presidency

03:15:20.140 --> 03:15:21.860
because of his threats,

03:15:21.860 --> 03:15:23.140
which turned out to be a good thing

03:15:23.140 --> 03:15:28.140
in light of ultimately the Russia-Ukraine war.

03:15:28.140 --> 03:15:30.380
And I think if you analyze Trump objectively

03:15:31.340 --> 03:15:34.100
based on policies, he did a lot of good for the country.

03:15:34.100 --> 03:15:38.220
I think what's bad is he did some harm as well.

03:15:40.820 --> 03:15:44.740
I do think civility disappeared in America

03:15:44.740 --> 03:15:46.060
with Trump as president.

03:15:46.060 --> 03:15:48.220
A lot of that's his personal style.

03:15:48.220 --> 03:15:49.620
And how important is civility?

03:15:49.620 --> 03:15:50.540
I do think it's important.

03:15:50.540 --> 03:15:55.540
I do think he was attacked very aggressively by the left,

03:15:55.820 --> 03:15:58.460
by the media that made him paranoid.

03:15:58.460 --> 03:15:59.900
It probably interfered with his ability

03:15:59.900 --> 03:16:01.500
to be successful.

03:16:01.500 --> 03:16:05.340
He had the Russian collusion investigation overhang.

03:16:06.220 --> 03:16:07.860
And when someone's attacked,

03:16:07.860 --> 03:16:09.060
they're not gonna be at their best,

03:16:09.060 --> 03:16:10.300
particularly if they're paranoid.

03:16:10.300 --> 03:16:12.260
I think there's some degree of that.

03:16:12.260 --> 03:16:16.860
But I'm giving kind of the best of defense to Trump.

03:16:16.860 --> 03:16:21.860
Just you look at how he managed his team, right?

03:16:22.780 --> 03:16:25.180
Very few people made it through the Trump administration

03:16:25.180 --> 03:16:27.420
without getting fired or quitting.

03:16:27.420 --> 03:16:29.420
And who would say they're the greatest person in the world

03:16:29.420 --> 03:16:32.020
when he hired them and they're a total disaster

03:16:32.020 --> 03:16:33.580
when he fired them?

03:16:33.580 --> 03:16:36.140
It's not an inspiring way to be a leader

03:16:36.140 --> 03:16:38.980
and to attract really talented people.

03:16:38.980 --> 03:16:42.300
I think the events surrounding the election,

03:16:43.980 --> 03:16:45.780
I think January 6th, he could have done a lot more

03:16:45.780 --> 03:16:47.900
to stop a riot.

03:16:47.900 --> 03:16:50.580
I don't consider it an insurrection,

03:16:50.580 --> 03:16:53.060
but a riot that takes place in our capital

03:16:53.060 --> 03:16:58.020
and where police officers are killed or die, commit suicide,

03:16:58.140 --> 03:17:01.260
for failure as they sought to do their job.

03:17:01.260 --> 03:17:02.980
He stepped in way too late to stop that.

03:17:02.980 --> 03:17:04.380
He could have stopped it early.

03:17:04.380 --> 03:17:07.140
Many of his words, I think, inspired people,

03:17:07.140 --> 03:17:10.660
some of whom with mal-intent to go in there and cause harm

03:17:10.660 --> 03:17:12.340
and literally to shut down the government.

03:17:12.340 --> 03:17:15.380
There were some evil people, unfortunately, there.

03:17:16.220 --> 03:17:18.340
So he's been a very imperfect president

03:17:18.340 --> 03:17:23.340
and also I think contributed to the extreme amount

03:17:23.460 --> 03:17:24.660
of divisiveness in our country.

03:17:24.660 --> 03:17:26.620
So I was ultimately disappointed

03:17:27.620 --> 03:17:29.980
by the note of optimism.

03:17:29.980 --> 03:17:33.740
And again, I always support the president.

03:17:33.740 --> 03:17:36.940
I trust the people ultimately to select our next leader.

03:17:36.940 --> 03:17:39.020
It's a bit like who wants to be a millionaire?

03:17:39.020 --> 03:17:42.220
When you go to the crowd and the crowd says a certain thing,

03:17:42.220 --> 03:17:43.620
you gotta trust the crowd.

03:17:44.660 --> 03:17:47.220
But usually in who wants to be a millionaire,

03:17:47.220 --> 03:17:48.620
it's a landslide in one direction.

03:17:48.620 --> 03:17:51.620
So you know which letter to pick.

03:17:51.620 --> 03:17:53.180
Here we had an incredibly close election,

03:17:53.180 --> 03:17:54.140
which itself is a problem.

03:17:54.380 --> 03:17:57.380
So my dream and what I've tried a little bit,

03:17:57.380 --> 03:17:59.660
played politics in the last little period,

03:17:59.660 --> 03:18:01.380
to support some alternatives to Trump

03:18:01.380 --> 03:18:02.540
so that we have a president.

03:18:02.540 --> 03:18:06.500
I use the example, imagine you woke up in the morning,

03:18:06.500 --> 03:18:07.780
it's election day, whatever it is,

03:18:07.780 --> 03:18:11.900
it's November 4th, whatever, 2024,

03:18:11.900 --> 03:18:13.460
and you still haven't figured out who to vote for

03:18:13.460 --> 03:18:15.780
because the candidates are so appealing

03:18:15.780 --> 03:18:18.460
that you don't know which lever to pull

03:18:18.460 --> 03:18:20.420
because it's a tough call.

03:18:20.420 --> 03:18:23.140
That's the choice we should be making as Americans.

03:18:23.140 --> 03:18:25.260
It shouldn't be, I'm a member of this party

03:18:25.260 --> 03:18:26.260
and I'm only gonna vote this way.

03:18:26.260 --> 03:18:27.740
I'm a member of that party, gonna vote the other way

03:18:27.740 --> 03:18:29.380
and I hate the other side.

03:18:29.380 --> 03:18:31.420
And that's where we've been, unfortunately, for too long.

03:18:31.420 --> 03:18:34.460
Or you might be torn because both candidates are not good.

03:18:35.340 --> 03:18:36.180
Yeah.

03:18:36.180 --> 03:18:39.180
So you wanna, I love a future where I'm torn

03:18:39.180 --> 03:18:42.220
because the choices are so amazing.

03:18:42.220 --> 03:18:44.660
The problem is the party system is so screwed up

03:18:44.660 --> 03:18:46.660
and the parties are self-interested

03:18:46.660 --> 03:18:50.620
and there's another governance problem, right?

03:18:50.620 --> 03:18:51.900
An incentive problem.

03:18:52.780 --> 03:18:54.940
Michael Porter, who was one of my professors

03:18:54.940 --> 03:18:57.740
at Harvard Business School, wrote a brilliant piece

03:18:57.740 --> 03:18:59.740
on the American political system

03:18:59.740 --> 03:19:01.700
and all the incentives and market dynamics

03:19:01.700 --> 03:19:04.580
and what he called a competitive analysis.

03:19:04.580 --> 03:19:05.980
And it's a must read.

03:19:05.980 --> 03:19:09.420
I should dig it up and send it around on X,

03:19:09.420 --> 03:19:13.060
but it explains how the parties and the incentives

03:19:13.060 --> 03:19:16.180
of these sort of self-sustaining entities

03:19:16.180 --> 03:19:19.580
that where the people involved are not incentivized

03:19:19.580 --> 03:19:20.980
to do what's best for the country.

03:19:21.020 --> 03:19:22.260
It's a problem.

03:19:22.260 --> 03:19:24.740
You've been a supporter of Dean Phillips

03:19:25.660 --> 03:19:28.860
for the 2024 US presidential race.

03:19:28.860 --> 03:19:31.100
What do you like about Dean?

03:19:31.100 --> 03:19:35.060
I think he's a honest, smart, motivated,

03:19:35.060 --> 03:19:38.660
capable, proven guy as a business leader.

03:19:38.660 --> 03:19:42.100
And I think in six, almost,

03:19:42.100 --> 03:19:44.140
in his three terms in Congress,

03:19:44.140 --> 03:19:46.580
he ran when Trump was elected,

03:19:46.580 --> 03:19:49.500
he said his kids cried, his daughters cried,

03:19:49.540 --> 03:19:51.860
inspired him to run for office,

03:19:51.860 --> 03:19:54.180
ran in a Republican district in Minnesota

03:19:54.180 --> 03:19:57.220
for the last 60 years, was elected in the landslide,

03:19:57.220 --> 03:19:59.060
has been reelected twice,

03:19:59.060 --> 03:20:00.820
moved up the ranks in the Congress,

03:20:03.180 --> 03:20:05.860
respected by his fellow members of Congress,

03:20:05.860 --> 03:20:09.020
advanced some important legislation during COVID,

03:20:10.380 --> 03:20:13.940
senior roles on various foreign policy committees,

03:20:13.940 --> 03:20:16.980
centrist, considered, I think,

03:20:16.980 --> 03:20:19.740
the second most bipartisan member of the Congress.

03:20:19.740 --> 03:20:21.660
I'd love to have a bipartisan president.

03:20:21.660 --> 03:20:23.820
That's the only way to kind of go forward.

03:20:23.820 --> 03:20:26.700
But we'd enormously benefit if we had a president

03:20:26.700 --> 03:20:30.140
that chose policies on the basis

03:20:30.140 --> 03:20:31.100
of what's best for the country

03:20:31.100 --> 03:20:32.900
as opposed to what his party wanted.

03:20:32.900 --> 03:20:36.420
What I like about him is he's financially independent.

03:20:36.420 --> 03:20:39.340
He's not a billionaire, but he doesn't need the job.

03:20:39.340 --> 03:20:40.820
The party hates him now

03:20:40.820 --> 03:20:43.220
because he challenged the king, right?

03:20:43.220 --> 03:20:46.260
And so, but he's willing to give up his political career

03:20:46.340 --> 03:20:47.620
just what he thought was best for the country,

03:20:47.620 --> 03:20:49.780
try to get other people to run who are of higher profile,

03:20:49.780 --> 03:20:52.100
had more name recognition, none would.

03:20:52.100 --> 03:20:54.380
No one wants to challenge Biden.

03:20:54.380 --> 03:20:55.580
You know, if they want to be,

03:20:55.580 --> 03:20:58.380
have a chance to stay in office or run in the future,

03:20:59.220 --> 03:21:01.060
but he's very principled.

03:21:01.060 --> 03:21:03.020
I think he would be a great president,

03:21:03.900 --> 03:21:07.820
but he needs, his shot is Michigan,

03:21:07.820 --> 03:21:10.740
but he needs to raise money in order to,

03:21:10.740 --> 03:21:12.180
he's only got a couple of weeks

03:21:12.180 --> 03:21:14.940
and he's got to be on TV there, that's expensive.

03:21:14.980 --> 03:21:16.660
So we'll see.

03:21:16.660 --> 03:21:18.100
So he has to increase name recognition,

03:21:18.100 --> 03:21:18.940
all that kind of stuff.

03:21:18.940 --> 03:21:20.900
Also, as you mentioned, he's young.

03:21:20.900 --> 03:21:23.020
Yeah, he's 55, but he's a young 55.

03:21:23.020 --> 03:21:24.140
You see him play hockey.

03:21:24.140 --> 03:21:26.100
Yeah, I mean, I guess 55, no matter what,

03:21:26.100 --> 03:21:27.500
is a pretty young age.

03:21:27.500 --> 03:21:29.820
I'm 57, I feel young.

03:21:29.820 --> 03:21:32.580
I can do more pull-ups today than I could as a kid.

03:21:32.580 --> 03:21:34.580
So that's a standard.

03:21:34.580 --> 03:21:36.500
You're at the top of your tennis game.

03:21:36.500 --> 03:21:38.300
I'm at the top of my tennis game, for sure.

03:21:38.300 --> 03:21:40.220
Maybe there's someone that would disagree with that.

03:21:40.220 --> 03:21:42.540
And by the way, the other thing to point out here is,

03:21:42.700 --> 03:21:45.260
I have been pointing this out as of others,

03:21:45.260 --> 03:21:47.180
Biden is, I think he's done.

03:21:47.180 --> 03:21:48.420
I mean, it's embarrassing.

03:21:48.420 --> 03:21:49.780
It's embarrassing for the country

03:21:49.780 --> 03:21:52.660
having him as a presidential candidate,

03:21:52.660 --> 03:21:54.580
let alone the president of the country.

03:21:54.580 --> 03:21:56.220
It's crazy.

03:21:56.220 --> 03:21:59.540
And it's just gonna get worse and worse.

03:21:59.540 --> 03:22:03.300
And he should, the worst of his legacy

03:22:03.300 --> 03:22:06.900
is his ego that prevents him from stepping aside.

03:22:06.900 --> 03:22:09.100
And that's it, it's his ego.

03:22:09.100 --> 03:22:12.700
And it is so wrong and so bad and so embarrassing.

03:22:14.420 --> 03:22:16.100
When you talk to people, I was in Europe,

03:22:16.100 --> 03:22:19.180
I was in London a few days ago,

03:22:19.180 --> 03:22:21.260
and people were like, Bill,

03:22:21.260 --> 03:22:22.940
how can this guy be a president?

03:22:22.940 --> 03:22:24.700
And it's a bit like, again,

03:22:24.700 --> 03:22:25.940
I go back to my business analogy,

03:22:25.940 --> 03:22:28.580
being a CEO is like a full contact sport.

03:22:28.580 --> 03:22:29.780
Being president of the United States

03:22:29.780 --> 03:22:34.060
is like some combination of wrestling, marathon running,

03:22:35.300 --> 03:22:36.500
try being a triathlete.

03:22:36.500 --> 03:22:39.900
I mean, you gotta be at the serious physical shape

03:22:39.900 --> 03:22:42.500
and at the top of your game to represent this country.

03:22:42.500 --> 03:22:44.500
And he is a far cry from that.

03:22:44.500 --> 03:22:47.340
And it's just getting worse and it's embarrassing.

03:22:47.340 --> 03:22:51.700
And he cannot be, and by the way, every day he waits,

03:22:51.700 --> 03:22:54.460
he's handing the election to Trump

03:22:54.460 --> 03:22:56.100
because it's harder and harder

03:22:56.100 --> 03:22:58.020
for an alternative candidate to surface.

03:22:58.020 --> 03:23:00.620
Now, Dean is the only candidate left

03:23:00.620 --> 03:23:03.220
on the democratic side that can still win delegates.

03:23:03.220 --> 03:23:05.060
He's on the ballot in 42 states.

03:23:06.060 --> 03:23:08.780
And the best way for Biden to step aside

03:23:08.780 --> 03:23:11.100
is for Dean to show well in Michigan.

03:23:11.100 --> 03:23:12.700
And just so that you think there is a path

03:23:12.700 --> 03:23:14.380
with the delegates and all that kind of stuff.

03:23:14.380 --> 03:23:15.220
100%.

03:23:15.220 --> 03:23:19.300
So what has to happen is New Hampshire,

03:23:19.300 --> 03:23:23.220
he went from zero to 20% of the vote

03:23:23.220 --> 03:23:25.900
and 10 weeks with no name recognition.

03:23:25.900 --> 03:23:27.260
I helped a little, but Elon helped.

03:23:27.260 --> 03:23:29.020
We did a spaces for him.

03:23:29.020 --> 03:23:31.260
We had 350,000 people on the spaces,

03:23:31.260 --> 03:23:34.020
some originally 40,000 live or something,

03:23:34.020 --> 03:23:36.260
and then the rest after.

03:23:36.260 --> 03:23:38.620
And then he was on the ground in New Hampshire.

03:23:38.620 --> 03:23:39.900
And New Hampshire is one of the states

03:23:39.900 --> 03:23:42.140
where you don't need to be registered to a party

03:23:42.140 --> 03:23:43.580
to vote for the candidate.

03:23:43.580 --> 03:23:46.100
So it's like Jumple and he got 20%.

03:23:46.100 --> 03:23:48.540
And that's with a lot of independents

03:23:48.540 --> 03:23:50.140
and Democrats voting for Haley.

03:23:52.140 --> 03:23:55.060
Haley, who I like and who I've supported,

03:23:56.140 --> 03:23:58.580
does not look like she's gonna make it.

03:23:58.580 --> 03:24:01.100
Trump is really kind of running the table.

03:24:01.140 --> 03:24:04.940
And so vote for Haley as an independent in Michigan,

03:24:04.940 --> 03:24:06.580
maybe throw away your vote.

03:24:06.580 --> 03:24:08.260
I think it increases the likelihood

03:24:08.260 --> 03:24:11.020
that Dean can get those independent votes.

03:24:11.020 --> 03:24:14.740
If he could theoretically, again, he needs money.

03:24:14.740 --> 03:24:16.100
He could beat Biden in Michigan.

03:24:16.100 --> 03:24:17.700
Biden's doing very poorly in Michigan.

03:24:17.700 --> 03:24:18.940
His polls are terrible.

03:24:18.940 --> 03:24:21.700
The Muslim community is not happy with him.

03:24:21.700 --> 03:24:25.660
And he really has spent no time there.

03:24:25.660 --> 03:24:28.060
And so if he's embarrassed in Michigan,

03:24:28.060 --> 03:24:29.620
it could be a catalyst for him withdrawing,

03:24:29.620 --> 03:24:30.860
then Dean will get funding.

03:24:31.620 --> 03:24:34.300
If he wins Michigan or shows well in Michigan,

03:24:34.300 --> 03:24:37.940
and people say he's viable, he's the only choice we have,

03:24:37.940 --> 03:24:39.860
he'll attract from the center,

03:24:39.860 --> 03:24:41.140
he'll attract from people,

03:24:41.140 --> 03:24:42.540
Republicans who won't vote for Trump,

03:24:42.540 --> 03:24:44.020
in which there are a big percentage,

03:24:44.020 --> 03:24:45.420
could be 60% or more,

03:24:45.420 --> 03:24:47.940
it could be 70% won't vote for Trump.

03:24:47.940 --> 03:24:49.940
And also from the Democrats.

03:24:49.940 --> 03:24:52.340
So I think he's a really interesting candidate,

03:24:52.340 --> 03:24:53.380
but we gotta get the word out.

03:24:53.380 --> 03:24:54.980
Yeah, I got a chance to chat with Dean.

03:24:54.980 --> 03:24:55.820
I really like him.

03:24:55.820 --> 03:24:56.660
I really like him.

03:24:56.660 --> 03:25:00.380
And I think the next president of the United States

03:25:00.380 --> 03:25:04.860
is gonna have to meet and speak regularly

03:25:04.860 --> 03:25:08.660
with Zelensky, Putin, and Yahoo with world leaders

03:25:08.660 --> 03:25:12.620
and have some of the most historic conversations,

03:25:12.620 --> 03:25:14.860
agreements, negotiations.

03:25:14.860 --> 03:25:17.540
And I just don't see Biden doing that.

03:25:17.540 --> 03:25:18.380
No.

03:25:18.380 --> 03:25:23.380
And not for any reason, but sadly age.

03:25:23.380 --> 03:25:25.660
Yeah, I mean, think about it this way.

03:25:25.660 --> 03:25:27.740
When Biden's present now,

03:25:27.780 --> 03:25:30.780
you saw his recent impromptu press conference,

03:25:30.780 --> 03:25:34.540
which he did after the special prosecutor report,

03:25:34.540 --> 03:25:37.620
basically saying the guy was way past his prime.

03:25:37.620 --> 03:25:40.100
And then he confused the president of Mexico

03:25:40.100 --> 03:25:42.100
and the president of Egypt.

03:25:42.100 --> 03:25:44.780
So they're very careful when they roll him out

03:25:44.780 --> 03:25:47.780
and he's scripted and he's always reading from a lectern.

03:25:47.780 --> 03:25:50.900
Imagine the care they have in exposing him.

03:25:50.900 --> 03:25:53.020
And when they expose him, it's terrible.

03:25:53.020 --> 03:25:54.900
Okay, imagine how bad it is for real.

03:25:55.860 --> 03:25:56.780
It's not good.

03:25:56.780 --> 03:25:58.900
No, bad, really bad for America.

03:25:58.900 --> 03:26:01.540
And I'm upset with him and upset with his family.

03:26:01.540 --> 03:26:03.260
I'm upset with his wife.

03:26:03.260 --> 03:26:05.980
This is the time where the people closest to you

03:26:05.980 --> 03:26:08.220
have to put their arms around you and say,

03:26:08.220 --> 03:26:13.220
dad, honey, you've done your thing.

03:26:13.900 --> 03:26:15.100
This is gonna be your legacy

03:26:15.100 --> 03:26:16.660
and it's not gonna be a good one.

03:26:16.660 --> 03:26:19.140
Great leaders should also know when to step down.

03:26:19.140 --> 03:26:21.340
Yeah, and one of the best tests of a leader

03:26:21.340 --> 03:26:23.500
is succession planning.

03:26:23.500 --> 03:26:26.340
This is a massive failure of succession planning.

03:26:26.340 --> 03:26:31.220
Outside of politics, let me look to the future.

03:26:31.220 --> 03:26:35.060
First, in terms of the financial world,

03:26:36.020 --> 03:26:38.180
what are you looking forward to

03:26:38.180 --> 03:26:40.020
in the next couple of years?

03:26:40.020 --> 03:26:41.540
You have a new fund.

03:26:41.540 --> 03:26:45.180
Like, what are you thinking about in terms of investment,

03:26:46.700 --> 03:26:49.700
your own and the entire economy

03:26:49.700 --> 03:26:52.860
and maybe even the economy of the world?

03:26:52.860 --> 03:26:54.980
Sure, so the SEC doesn't allow,

03:26:54.980 --> 03:26:58.660
doesn't like us to talk about new funds

03:26:58.660 --> 03:27:00.860
that we're launching that we filed with the SEC.

03:27:00.860 --> 03:27:01.980
Sure.

03:27:01.980 --> 03:27:04.780
But I would say I do, and by the way,

03:27:04.780 --> 03:27:06.460
if anyone's ever interested in a fund,

03:27:06.460 --> 03:27:07.980
they should always read the prospectus carefully,

03:27:07.980 --> 03:27:08.980
including the risk factors.

03:27:08.980 --> 03:27:10.700
That's very, very important.

03:27:10.700 --> 03:27:14.340
But I like the idea of democratizing access

03:27:14.340 --> 03:27:16.260
to good investors.

03:27:17.420 --> 03:27:19.780
And I think that's an interesting trend,

03:27:19.780 --> 03:27:21.620
so we wanna be part of that trend.

03:27:21.620 --> 03:27:24.260
In terms of financial markets,

03:27:24.260 --> 03:27:26.260
generally the economy,

03:27:26.260 --> 03:27:28.660
a lot is gonna depend upon the next leader of the country,

03:27:28.660 --> 03:27:31.180
so we're kind of right back there.

03:27:31.180 --> 03:27:32.260
The leadership of the United States

03:27:32.260 --> 03:27:33.300
is important for the US economy,

03:27:33.300 --> 03:27:34.540
it's important for the global economy,

03:27:34.540 --> 03:27:36.140
it's important for global peace.

03:27:37.420 --> 03:27:40.420
And we've gone through a really difficult period

03:27:40.420 --> 03:27:42.860
and it's time, we need a break.

03:27:42.860 --> 03:27:44.500
But look, I think the United States

03:27:44.500 --> 03:27:45.940
is an incredibly resilient country.

03:27:45.940 --> 03:27:48.420
We have some incredible moats among them.

03:27:48.420 --> 03:27:49.900
We have the Atlantic and the Pacific,

03:27:49.900 --> 03:27:53.540
and we have peaceful neighbors to the north and the south.

03:27:53.540 --> 03:27:55.740
We're an enormously rich country.

03:27:55.740 --> 03:27:58.140
Capitalism still works effectively here.

03:27:58.140 --> 03:28:00.060
I get optimistic about the world

03:28:00.060 --> 03:28:02.340
when I talk to my friends who are either venture capitalists

03:28:02.340 --> 03:28:05.500
or my hobby of backing these young entrepreneurs.

03:28:05.500 --> 03:28:07.660
I talk to a founder of a startup

03:28:07.660 --> 03:28:08.940
if you wanna get optimistic about the world,

03:28:08.940 --> 03:28:12.140
so I think technology is gonna save us.

03:28:12.140 --> 03:28:13.260
I think AI, of course,

03:28:13.260 --> 03:28:17.460
has its frightening Terminator-like scenarios,

03:28:17.460 --> 03:28:20.340
but I'm gonna take the opposite view

03:28:20.340 --> 03:28:22.980
that this is gonna be a huge enabler

03:28:22.980 --> 03:28:27.180
of productivity, scientific discovery, drug discovery,

03:28:27.180 --> 03:28:30.100
and it's gonna make us healthier, happier, and better.

03:28:30.980 --> 03:28:35.980
So I do think the internet revolution had a lot of good,

03:28:36.140 --> 03:28:37.020
obviously some bad.

03:28:37.020 --> 03:28:38.860
I think the AI revolution is gonna be similar,

03:28:38.860 --> 03:28:42.180
but we're at this other really interesting juncture

03:28:42.180 --> 03:28:45.420
in the world with technology,

03:28:45.420 --> 03:28:48.220
and we're gonna have to use it for our good.

03:28:48.220 --> 03:28:50.180
On the media front, I'm happy about X,

03:28:50.180 --> 03:28:53.340
and I think Elon's gonna be successful here.

03:28:53.340 --> 03:28:54.860
I think advertisers will realize

03:28:54.860 --> 03:28:56.020
it's a really good platform.

03:28:56.020 --> 03:28:58.660
The best way to reach me,

03:28:58.660 --> 03:29:00.100
if you wanna sell something to me,

03:29:00.100 --> 03:29:04.140
I suppose I've actually bought stuff on some ads in X.

03:29:04.140 --> 03:29:04.980
I don't remember the last time

03:29:04.980 --> 03:29:07.780
I responded to direct response advertising.

03:29:07.780 --> 03:29:11.340
In terms of my business, I have an incredible team.

03:29:11.340 --> 03:29:12.420
It's tiny.

03:29:12.420 --> 03:29:13.980
We're one of the smallest firms

03:29:13.980 --> 03:29:15.980
relative to the assets we manage.

03:29:15.980 --> 03:29:20.980
It's a bit like the Navy SEALs, not the US Army.

03:29:22.660 --> 03:29:24.860
We have only 40 people at Persian Square,

03:29:24.860 --> 03:29:26.500
so it's a tight team.

03:29:26.500 --> 03:29:28.100
I think we'll do great things.

03:29:28.100 --> 03:29:29.740
I think we're early on.

03:29:29.740 --> 03:29:31.540
My ambitions investment-wise,

03:29:31.540 --> 03:29:35.140
I've always said I'd like to have a record

03:29:35.140 --> 03:29:36.620
as good as Warren Buffett's.

03:29:36.620 --> 03:29:38.620
The problem is each year he adds on another year.

03:29:38.620 --> 03:29:40.180
He's now in his 93rd year,

03:29:40.180 --> 03:29:44.140
so I've got 36 more years to just get where he is,

03:29:44.140 --> 03:29:46.500
and I think he's gonna add a lot more years.

03:29:46.500 --> 03:29:49.860
I'm excited about seeing what Neri's gonna produce.

03:29:49.860 --> 03:29:51.740
She's building an incredible company.

03:29:51.740 --> 03:29:53.620
They're trying to solve a lot of problems

03:29:53.620 --> 03:29:57.300
with respect to products and buildings

03:29:57.300 --> 03:29:58.900
and their impact on the environment.

03:29:58.900 --> 03:30:01.540
Her vision is how do we design products

03:30:01.540 --> 03:30:03.980
that by virtue of the product's existence,

03:30:03.980 --> 03:30:05.260
the world is a better place?

03:30:05.260 --> 03:30:10.060
Today, her world is a world where

03:30:10.060 --> 03:30:12.420
the existence of the new car

03:30:12.420 --> 03:30:13.980
actually is better for the environment

03:30:13.980 --> 03:30:15.500
than if the new car hadn't existed,

03:30:15.500 --> 03:30:17.860
and think about that in every product scale.

03:30:17.860 --> 03:30:18.820
That's what she's working on.

03:30:18.820 --> 03:30:20.380
I don't wanna give away too much,

03:30:20.380 --> 03:30:22.820
but you're gonna see some early examples

03:30:22.820 --> 03:30:24.260
of what she's working on.

03:30:24.260 --> 03:30:26.500
So again, I get excited about the future,

03:30:28.060 --> 03:30:31.420
and crises are sort of a terrible thing to waste,

03:30:31.420 --> 03:30:32.740
and we've had a number of these here.

03:30:32.740 --> 03:30:35.020
I think this disaster in the Middle East,

03:30:35.020 --> 03:30:37.900
my prediction is the next few months,

03:30:38.940 --> 03:30:40.740
this war will largely be over

03:30:40.740 --> 03:30:42.780
in terms of getting rid of Hamas.

03:30:42.780 --> 03:30:47.780
I think I can envision a world in which Saudi Arabia,

03:30:47.900 --> 03:30:49.900
some of the other Gulf states come together,

03:30:49.900 --> 03:30:54.540
take over the governance and reconstruction of Gaza.

03:30:54.540 --> 03:30:56.700
Security guarantees are put in place.

03:30:56.700 --> 03:30:59.540
The Abraham Accords continue to grow.

03:30:59.540 --> 03:31:01.020
A deal is made.

03:31:01.020 --> 03:31:02.620
Terrorists are ostracized.

03:31:03.700 --> 03:31:08.700
That this October 7th experience on the Harvard, Penn,

03:31:09.140 --> 03:31:12.460
MIT, Columbia, unfortunately other campuses,

03:31:12.460 --> 03:31:15.660
is a wake-up call for universities generally.

03:31:17.220 --> 03:31:19.860
People see the problems with DEI,

03:31:19.860 --> 03:31:22.900
but understand the importance of diversity and inclusion,

03:31:22.900 --> 03:31:24.300
but not as a political movement,

03:31:24.300 --> 03:31:28.740
but as a way that we return to a meritocratic world

03:31:28.740 --> 03:31:30.220
where someone's background is relevant

03:31:30.220 --> 03:31:33.620
in understanding their contribution.

03:31:33.620 --> 03:31:36.140
But it's not, we don't have race quotas

03:31:36.140 --> 03:31:38.900
and things that were made illegal years ago,

03:31:38.900 --> 03:31:42.340
actually being implemented in organizations on campus.

03:31:43.340 --> 03:31:45.020
We can go through a corrective phase,

03:31:45.020 --> 03:31:47.620
and I'm an optimist, and I hope we get there.

03:31:47.620 --> 03:31:51.260
So you have hope for the entirety of it, even for Harvard.

03:31:51.260 --> 03:31:53.900
I have hope even for Harvard.

03:31:53.900 --> 03:31:56.540
It's generally hard to break 400-year-old things.

03:31:56.540 --> 03:31:58.140
Well, I share your hope,

03:31:58.140 --> 03:32:02.540
and you are a fascinating mind, a brilliant mind,

03:32:02.540 --> 03:32:06.500
persistent, as you like to say, and fearless.

03:32:06.500 --> 03:32:08.740
The fearless part is truly inspiring,

03:32:08.740 --> 03:32:10.980
and this was an incredible conversation.

03:32:10.980 --> 03:32:11.820
Thank you.

03:32:11.820 --> 03:32:12.940
Thank you for talking today, Bill.

03:32:12.940 --> 03:32:14.500
Thank you, Lex.

03:32:14.500 --> 03:32:17.100
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Bill Ackman.

03:32:17.100 --> 03:32:18.260

03:32:20.940 --> 03:32:22.940
And now, let me leave you with some words

03:32:22.940 --> 03:32:24.860
from Jonathan Swift.

03:32:25.740 --> 03:32:29.100
A wise person should have money in their head,

03:32:29.100 --> 03:32:30.860
but not in their heart.

03:32:32.220 --> 03:32:35.180
Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.

03:32:40.980 --> 03:32:41.820
Thank you.
