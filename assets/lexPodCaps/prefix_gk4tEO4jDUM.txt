The following is a conversation with Joe Rogan, his second time on this podcast.

00:06.200 --> 00:11.880
He has inspired me for many years with his conversations to be a better and kinder person

00:11.880 --> 00:15.880
and has now been doing so as a friend.

00:15.880 --> 00:22.040
There's no one I would rather talk to on this 300th episode of this podcast on the Fourth

00:22.040 --> 00:28.600
of July, both the anniversary of this country's declaration of independence and the anniversary

00:28.600 --> 00:34.600
of my immigrating here to the United States, a silly kid who couldn't speak English and

00:34.600 --> 00:40.960
could never imagine that he would be so damn lucky as to live the life I've lived and

00:40.960 --> 00:46.680
to feel the love I've felt from the amazing people along the way.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.880
From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.440
I love you all.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.000
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.120
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:58.120 --> 01:02.600
And now, dear friends, here's Joe Rogan.

01:02.600 --> 01:07.440
Charles Bukowski said something in a poem called Style about art.

01:07.440 --> 01:13.000
He defined art saying, style is the answer to everything, a fresh way to approach a dull

01:13.000 --> 01:14.540
or dangerous thing.

01:14.540 --> 01:19.520
To do a dull thing with style is preferable to doing a dangerous thing without it.

01:19.520 --> 01:22.440
To do a dangerous thing with style is what I call art.

01:22.440 --> 01:24.760
What do you think he meant by that?

01:24.760 --> 01:26.200
Do you agree with this?

01:26.240 --> 01:29.000
A dangerous thing with style is art.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
He said bullfighting can be art, boxing can be art, loving can be art.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.360
Have you ever made love and it was art?

01:35.360 --> 01:37.320
No, okay, I'm not asking.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.400
Every time, bro.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.200
Opening a can of sardines can be art.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.240
I think there's something to that.

01:44.240 --> 01:50.520
Yeah, I think I call the way people live life art, like I wrote a foreword to my friend

01:50.520 --> 01:55.920
Cameron Haynes' book, which is right now the number one selling audio book in the world.

01:56.680 --> 02:02.680
And one of the things that I said was that he practices an art that very few people appreciate

02:02.680 --> 02:10.160
and it's the art of the maximized life and that the discipline that he displays in his

02:10.160 --> 02:17.000
life and through his practices and all the things that he does, it's so difficult to

02:17.000 --> 02:23.320
live the way he lives that for someone like me who understands it and knows what he's

02:23.360 --> 02:30.000
doing and appreciates it and appreciates how insanely difficult it is to have a full

02:30.000 --> 02:34.480
time job and run ultra marathons, get up at four o'clock in the morning, run a full

02:34.480 --> 02:36.000
marathon before work.

02:36.520 --> 02:42.960
Like that's the kind of shit that he does when he's training for these 240 mile runs,

02:42.960 --> 02:53.200
all at the same time being like a father, a husband, having this full time job, also

02:53.200 --> 02:55.760
being the best bow hunter on earth, lifting weights.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.400
It's like, how does a person do this?

02:58.400 --> 03:00.480
So in a way discipline is art too.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.080
Yes, discipline is art.

03:02.240 --> 03:06.560
Yeah, I think it is because it's beautiful for me to see when I see someone who's really

03:06.560 --> 03:11.880
truly disciplined, who like a David Goggin, someone who just like truly maximizes the

03:11.880 --> 03:16.440
grind. I feel like there's an art to that and there's an art to kindness.

03:16.760 --> 03:19.160
Like there's people that are really kind and really sweet.

03:19.160 --> 03:20.560
And when I'm around them, it's beautiful.

03:20.560 --> 03:21.880
It's like there's an art to them.

03:21.960 --> 03:22.680
No matter what.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.520
Yeah, they still they got, you know, the world can throw a bunch of shit at you.

03:26.520 --> 03:29.520
But through all that, some people are just great at it.

03:29.560 --> 03:32.920
Yeah. And it's a thing that you learn how to do.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.720
And it's pleasing for other people to see.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.200
And that, I think, is where the art is.

03:38.640 --> 03:44.400
Well, I think Bukowski also said, and I'm just a Bukowski quote generator today.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.560
I love him. I love him very much, too.

03:47.640 --> 03:51.000
He's a dark and troubled and fascinating and a weird person like Hunter S.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.240
Thompson. He said what matters most is how you walk through the fire, I think.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.840
So there's a bit of the Ken Haynes in that, too.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.400
David Goggins in that, too.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.200
What do you think he meant by that?

04:03.840 --> 04:05.520
Well, how you walk through the fire.

04:05.520 --> 04:09.280
I mean, you can walk through the fire complaining along the way, or you can walk

04:09.280 --> 04:17.200
through the fire and create an example for everyone else so that the trials and

04:17.240 --> 04:21.320
tribulations of their own life seem trivial because they're comparing themselves

04:21.320 --> 04:26.240
to the way you handle things or the way you handle things with grace and dignity

04:26.240 --> 04:32.320
and discipline can show other people that they can handle their own life this way.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.520
And there's beauty in that.

04:34.560 --> 04:39.360
There really is. And there's so much inspiration to be gathered from other

04:39.360 --> 04:44.680
people if you're a charitable person, if you're charitable and compassionate and

04:45.320 --> 04:49.880
you can look at people, even people that I don't like.

04:49.960 --> 04:56.800
I try to look at the best aspects of how they live their life and recognize those

04:56.800 --> 04:59.720
aspects, admire them, give them credit for it.

05:00.200 --> 05:04.760
There's something that we can all get out of watching the way other people live

05:04.760 --> 05:05.400
their lives.

05:05.560 --> 05:10.000
So I got a chance to see you walk through the fire a little bit privately and

05:10.000 --> 05:13.720
publicly this year in January.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.120
I got to ask you about that.

05:15.720 --> 05:20.000
So there's like generic conversations about sort of cancel culture and all those

05:20.000 --> 05:23.560
kinds of things. But as a human being, this to me is fascinating.

05:24.160 --> 05:29.200
Sort of there's the N-word highlight video, there's the criticism of the

05:29.200 --> 05:33.040
different guests, whatever the side is on the COVID pandemic.

05:33.840 --> 05:42.160
And you, I mean, there's a mass amount of attack on you outside of being a public

05:42.160 --> 05:47.560
persona, outside of being a comedian, podcast, you're also a human being.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.120
So how did you survive that?

05:51.280 --> 05:54.200
How did you sort of walk through that fire?

05:54.200 --> 05:55.920
Because you seem to do it with grace.

05:58.320 --> 05:59.240
I used mushrooms.

06:01.440 --> 06:02.480
That was one way I did it.

06:02.480 --> 06:03.200
Yeah, yeah.

06:03.240 --> 06:03.720
Really?

06:04.080 --> 06:06.720
What's your, as Andrew Huberman would say, what was your protocol?

06:06.960 --> 06:11.840
I took, it was probably less than a gram every day.

06:12.000 --> 06:12.400
Every day.

06:12.680 --> 06:13.160
Yeah.

06:14.000 --> 06:25.160
And I did a lot of like really hard working out, but also, I mean, there's a

06:25.160 --> 06:28.440
great benefit to going through anything difficult.

06:28.840 --> 06:34.960
And if you're aware, like in advance and while enduring, like anything that's

06:34.960 --> 06:40.120
going to happen, that's very difficult and troubling, the great benefit

06:40.120 --> 06:45.040
is it gives you an opportunity to grow, gives you an opportunity to express

06:45.040 --> 06:49.720
yourself under pressure, to show your character, to show who you truly are.

06:50.280 --> 06:55.840
And it gives you an opportunity to see how you handle a very difficult situation.

06:56.320 --> 07:03.960
It also was fascinating as a person that's involved in media, right?

07:03.960 --> 07:09.200
Because what we're doing right now is media, even though, you know, it seems

07:09.320 --> 07:12.280
like podcasts seem like we're just having a conversation, right?

07:12.600 --> 07:18.920
And they are in a sense, it's kind of the purest form of media because what

07:18.920 --> 07:25.080
you're doing is you're, you're, you're doing it without any fanfare.

07:25.120 --> 07:30.280
You're doing it without any, there's no executives looming over your head or

07:30.280 --> 07:34.720
network or big meetings about ratings or any of that stuff, but it is media.

07:34.960 --> 07:39.640
But what I got to see is the wiring under the machine of how the rest of

07:39.640 --> 07:45.480
media would try to take me out and, you know, like when CNN would be just be

07:45.480 --> 07:50.080
playing things over and over and back and forth, it was wild to watch.

07:50.440 --> 07:57.680
What was also wild to watch was people's responses because I gained two million

07:57.680 --> 08:02.200
subscribers during that time, like the podcast never got bigger.

08:02.560 --> 08:06.720
It just kept, kept growing and it had never been bigger than it had been

08:06.720 --> 08:08.280
like at the end of all of it.

08:09.080 --> 08:09.920
It just made it bigger.

08:10.560 --> 08:16.480
And, you know, ultimately when, if you've fucked up in the past or made

08:16.480 --> 08:21.400
mistakes or done something wrong, that gives you an opportunity to discuss

08:21.400 --> 08:26.800
those things and to say, to apologize if you feel the need to apologize and

08:26.840 --> 08:28.840
also to just address it.

08:29.200 --> 08:33.480
And so people under that kind of pressure, they get it, it's an opportunity

08:33.480 --> 08:37.640
for them to understand how you think about things, honestly, how you actually

08:37.920 --> 08:41.640
honestly think about things and there's no more honesty that you get out of a

08:41.640 --> 08:45.960
person then when that person is under extreme duress, you know, so I think in

08:45.960 --> 08:50.120
that sense, I mean, it's horrible to say that it's a benefit, that it's a good

08:50.120 --> 08:52.400
thing that it happened, but it was a benefit.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.440
Can you see how it can break a person?

08:55.120 --> 08:59.600
I've gotten the chance to experience small, small attacks here and there,

09:00.160 --> 09:01.640
ones that get to the core of things.

09:01.640 --> 09:07.280
Like even just talking to, uh, about Russia and Ukraine, uh, to Stephen

09:07.280 --> 09:11.920
Cock and Oliver stones, looking at different perspectives, you gain a

09:11.920 --> 09:17.080
relative, for me feeling like a sizable number of people who really don't like

09:17.120 --> 09:25.040
you and say things about you that are, um, that may be cut deep for a reason.

09:25.040 --> 09:28.240
I don't understand why it's just my own psychology.

09:28.560 --> 09:32.080
Well, it's also because you can't defend yourself because they're saying it and

09:32.080 --> 09:37.400
you're not there and you, you don't have any opportunity for a rebuttal.

09:37.400 --> 09:40.920
And if you do have a rebuttal, you're doing it publicly and you're opening

09:40.920 --> 09:43.120
it up to the whole world to chime in.

09:43.160 --> 09:48.480
And there's a general tendency that people have towards negativity when

09:48.480 --> 09:52.960
they're interacting with strangers online, especially about controversial subjects.

09:53.240 --> 09:57.520
And even if it's only 10% of the people, it's one out of 10, that's a lot.

09:57.800 --> 10:00.400
That's a lot of negativity when you're dealing with thousands

10:00.400 --> 10:01.720
and thousands of tweets.

10:02.040 --> 10:02.280
Yeah.

10:02.280 --> 10:07.280
And I think maybe I'm just a very self-critical person, but I hear their

10:07.280 --> 10:12.480
words and I probably somewhere deep inside, see the truth and the criticism

10:12.520 --> 10:14.280
in some aspect of the criticism.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.280
And that's why it hurts.

10:15.920 --> 10:22.680
Well, it's, but it's an one aspect of you, you know, but when you're reading

10:22.680 --> 10:30.440
it, it's so it's boiled down to this one thing as if that one thing defines you

10:30.440 --> 10:34.680
totally, like if you've made a mistake, if you've said something that you

10:34.680 --> 10:39.360
shouldn't have said, or if you said something and you know, maybe you should

10:39.360 --> 10:44.760
have considered it more carefully giving the gravity of the situation, you know,

10:44.760 --> 10:47.080
that that's just a part of being a person.

10:47.120 --> 10:50.840
And it's also part of being a person where you're communicating with things

10:50.840 --> 10:56.200
publicly in real time, thinking out loud, which is what we do, you know, it's

10:56.200 --> 10:58.280
complex and most people don't do it.

10:58.440 --> 11:04.040
And you're going to have these, you're going to have genuine hot takes where

11:04.040 --> 11:08.400
people just see what you said and go, why did he say that?

11:08.400 --> 11:09.120
Fuck him.

11:09.400 --> 11:12.600
You know, he doesn't know anything about, he doesn't live in Ukraine.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.080
He doesn't, you know, it's like there's, there's people that are going to have

11:15.080 --> 11:17.000
takes on that in that way.

11:17.640 --> 11:22.320
And then there's also going to be these disingenuous people who just use any kind

11:22.320 --> 11:26.560
of controversial topic or subject as an opportunity for them to get clicks or views.

11:26.600 --> 11:30.480
But that the number of those people can be quite large, quite large.

11:30.840 --> 11:35.040
And so going back to, do you think it can destroy a person?

11:35.040 --> 11:38.840
Cause I kind of worry about this and you're in many ways, but in this way, an

11:38.840 --> 11:44.160
inspiration that it didn't seem to have destroyed you, but I kept doing shows.

11:44.480 --> 11:45.720
I kept doing standup.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.640
I ignored everything.

11:47.720 --> 11:48.880
I didn't read any of it.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.720
It's so it is possible to just a hundred percent.

11:52.040 --> 11:52.480
Yes.

11:53.280 --> 11:53.600
Yeah.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.040
I ignored it all.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.640
But you have like, I knew it was there.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.200
Like your family didn't bring it up.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.320
My family was very aware of it.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.240
My wife was aware of it.

12:01.240 --> 12:02.120
What was the conversation?

12:02.120 --> 12:05.720
Like if, if your wife is aware of it, is there like a rule?

12:05.760 --> 12:07.480
Don't pretend it's not happening.

12:07.520 --> 12:08.600
No, just like, well,

12:08.600 --> 12:11.160
I don't, I tell her, don't ever read past the green beans.

12:12.520 --> 12:15.720
I don't ever let her like read negative articles to me.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.360
You know, I don't want them.

12:17.480 --> 12:18.560
I don't care.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.000
I go, that's a person's opinion.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.080
You take a person's opinion, you write it down.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.720
It doesn't give it any more relevance.

12:23.720 --> 12:27.200
Like that person, you know, could have had that opinion in silence.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.480
They could have had it with some friends at dinner.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.560
They don't like me, whatever.

12:30.680 --> 12:31.360
I don't want to read it.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.160
I don't want to absorb it.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.320
I don't even know them, especially if I'm not there.

12:34.560 --> 12:41.400
And especially if it's some biased and it's, it's not an objective opinion of me.

12:41.680 --> 12:45.880
It's this, you know, they have a narrative and they want to stick to that

12:45.880 --> 12:48.840
narrative and they want to write an article and they piece it all together,

12:48.840 --> 12:50.000
make you a piece of shit.

12:50.600 --> 12:51.640
And that's their prerogative.

12:51.680 --> 12:54.880
They're completely allowed to do that, but I know I shouldn't absorb that.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
I shouldn't take that in.

12:56.480 --> 13:00.160
You're not supposed to be taking in the opinion of the world.

13:00.880 --> 13:04.080
You're supposed to be taking in the opinion of small groups of people that

13:04.080 --> 13:09.360
you encounter so that you get an understanding of how you make them feel.

13:09.760 --> 13:15.560
And then maybe you say to yourself, maybe I come across too rude, or maybe I come

13:15.560 --> 13:21.360
across too insensitive, or maybe, maybe I could do better in this way or that way.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.480
That's how we sort of shape our personalities.

13:23.480 --> 13:26.080
And it's how we, we develop our social skills.

13:26.440 --> 13:31.360
But when the people don't know you and they have this like distorted

13:31.360 --> 13:35.440
narrative of you and, you know, there's fucking millions of people.

13:35.680 --> 13:36.760
There's so many people.

13:36.920 --> 13:41.040
You can't be saying, I mean, millions of people that are like communicating

13:41.040 --> 13:45.880
about something like during the height of the, you know, the attempt to cancel

13:45.880 --> 13:49.920
me or whatever that is, I don't know how many people were involved in that.

13:50.200 --> 13:54.520
People take this kind of stuff seriously, but the problem is the false narratives

13:54.520 --> 13:58.480
take hold and then you have meetings, you have groups, you have bills on top of

13:58.480 --> 14:03.240
each other and there's this outrage and then it reaches you at some point and

14:03.720 --> 14:05.480
it can just have these destructive effects.

14:05.560 --> 14:06.000
It does.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.040
Can, but it also sometimes doesn't.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.640
And in my case, it didn't, didn't work.

14:14.360 --> 14:15.960
What lessons did you draw from that?

14:16.280 --> 14:18.000
Mushrooms, exercise.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.560
Mushrooms and exercise, exercise is critical.

14:20.680 --> 14:23.440
So I don't think the mushrooms by themselves would have worked, but that's

14:23.440 --> 14:28.440
the thing that I use for everything is the brutal exercise, like my exercise

14:28.440 --> 14:32.760
routines are horrible and because of that, everything else is easier.

14:33.120 --> 14:36.960
I create my own bullshit and my own bullshit is so much harder.

14:37.480 --> 14:38.640
And it's not just that.

14:38.640 --> 14:43.320
It's also sauna and cold plunge and these torture sessions.

14:43.360 --> 14:48.360
They in enduring those, when you endure those, it makes enduring

14:48.400 --> 14:50.040
other things much easier.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.840
And it's also an understanding of what's happening.

14:53.160 --> 14:57.760
Like you have to know like media, you have to understand like what

14:58.200 --> 15:05.560
the hot take, you know, YouTube, social media, podcast, ecosphere is doing.

15:05.680 --> 15:09.520
Like if they're talking about, you know, Lex Fridman said this, and we

15:09.520 --> 15:14.120
have to comment on that and you know, Lex gets canceled and all capital

15:14.120 --> 15:15.360
letters on a YouTube clip.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.640
And if you, you watch that, you're fucking crazy.

15:17.640 --> 15:18.120
What are you doing?

15:18.120 --> 15:19.880
Absorbing all this negativity?

15:19.880 --> 15:20.640
It's not good for you.

15:20.840 --> 15:25.680
You are you, you know, you, and you know, generally if you've made a mistake

15:26.040 --> 15:29.840
generally, if people are upset with you, you post this awesome video on your

15:29.840 --> 15:35.840
Instagram of a woman who was being interviewed in 19, late 1920s, maybe.

15:35.840 --> 15:36.360
Yes.

15:36.360 --> 15:36.680
Yeah.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.280
And she's, she's close to a hundred years old.

15:40.840 --> 15:44.080
So she's lived through the civil war through world war one.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.600
She was at the time living through the early days of the great depression.

15:48.520 --> 15:53.080
So I was just looking back, you know, what have we as a human civilization

15:53.080 --> 15:55.600
in recent times survived, especially in the United States?

15:56.240 --> 15:59.880
You're talking about the two world wars in the 20th century, the great

15:59.880 --> 16:04.800
depression, the Spanish food, the pandemic at the beginning of the 20th century.

16:05.040 --> 16:05.400
Yeah.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.440
Uh, what do we do in the United States?

16:07.440 --> 16:08.440
Uh, nine 11.

16:09.320 --> 16:14.040
If you think of what are the traumatic events that shook our world, it's nine

16:14.040 --> 16:17.600
11, it made us rethink our place in the world.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.640
Um, the pandemic

16:20.880 --> 16:22.040
pandemic is a huge one.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.800
Is it the bigger ones?

16:23.800 --> 16:28.600
Cause it also accelerated and exacerbated our anxiety, which people have a certain

16:28.600 --> 16:33.400
level of anxiety already, especially sedentary people, they have a very high

16:33.400 --> 16:37.720
level of anxiety already because I don't think they're, they're giving their body

16:37.720 --> 16:39.920
what it, what it needs.

16:40.480 --> 16:43.600
I don't think they're, you know, your, your body has certain requirements

16:43.920 --> 16:45.000
in terms of movement.

16:45.080 --> 16:48.520
And when you deny your body, those requirements, I think there's like a

16:48.520 --> 16:52.040
general level of anxiety that exists in almost everyone.

16:52.280 --> 16:55.120
And then you have people obviously that have mental health issues.

16:55.560 --> 16:58.680
And that also exacerbates the anxiety.

16:58.760 --> 17:03.280
The lockdown exacerbated the anxiety, losing loved ones to the

17:03.280 --> 17:05.600
pandemic, exacerbated anxiety.

17:05.600 --> 17:11.720
And then there was the, the division, the, the different schools of thought, the

17:11.720 --> 17:15.960
people that were never going to get vaccinated, no matter what, I ain't trusting

17:15.960 --> 17:16.080
it.

17:16.240 --> 17:19.680
People that thought there was microchips in there, people that thought that, you

17:19.720 --> 17:25.120
know, Fauci's the demon and there's, there was a lot, and there's also like

17:25.160 --> 17:26.800
political leanings.

17:27.040 --> 17:30.320
The right-wing people tended to not want to be vaccinated.

17:30.600 --> 17:34.840
Whereas the left-wing people for whatever reason, all of a sudden are trusting

17:34.840 --> 17:38.280
pharmaceutical companies like explicitly.

17:38.640 --> 17:39.240
It was weird.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.440
It's a, it was a weird time.

17:41.760 --> 17:47.600
And I think over time as it's going to, as it gets analyzed and we, we break it

17:47.600 --> 17:51.280
down, it's going to be one of the weirder moments for shaping human culture.

17:51.440 --> 17:59.440
And unfortunately for throwing gasoline on this already burning fire of, you

17:59.440 --> 18:07.440
know, of conflict between the various factions of, of, of thought in this

18:07.440 --> 18:13.080
country, it's just a, it's already a weird time, you know, post Trump, like the

18:13.080 --> 18:19.640
Trump era is also going to be one of the weirder times when, when people look back

18:19.640 --> 18:24.480
historically about the division in this country, he's such a polarizing figure

18:24.840 --> 18:32.000
that so many people felt like they could abandon their own ethics and morals and

18:32.000 --> 18:40.640
principles just to attack him and anybody who supports him because he is an

18:40.640 --> 18:43.280
existential threat to democracy itself.

18:43.320 --> 18:46.720
But don't you think it's not a cause, but maybe like a symptom?

18:46.720 --> 18:48.840
Like it's going to get, you said it got real weird.

18:49.160 --> 18:50.960
Maybe it's going to get weirder.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.240
Yeah, I think it's going to get weirder.

18:52.640 --> 18:53.600
He's going to run again.

18:53.840 --> 18:54.760
You think he's going to get weird?

18:54.760 --> 18:56.680
Well, he's running against a dead man.

18:57.080 --> 19:00.560
You know, I mean, Biden shakes hands with people that aren't even there

19:00.560 --> 19:03.120
when he gets off stage, I think he's seeing ghosts.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.160
You see him on Jimmy Kimmel the other day?

19:05.240 --> 19:05.440
No.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.040
Well, he was just rambling.

19:07.280 --> 19:12.920
I mean, he's if he was anyone else, if he was a Republican, if that was

19:12.920 --> 19:18.520
Donald Trump doing that, every fucking talk show would be screaming for him

19:18.520 --> 19:19.440
to be off the air.

19:19.680 --> 19:23.200
And by the way, I'm not a Trump supporter in any way, shape or form.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.880
I've had the opportunity to have him on my show more than once.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.360
I've said no every time.

19:27.560 --> 19:28.280
I don't want to help him.

19:28.680 --> 19:29.720
I'm not interested in helping.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.480
The, the, the night is still young.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.840
We'll see if I have him on the night.

19:33.840 --> 19:34.320
It's still young.

19:34.360 --> 19:34.520
Yeah.

19:34.520 --> 19:35.160
I think I'll have him on.

19:35.160 --> 19:36.120
I think you'll have him on.

19:36.160 --> 19:36.560
Really?

19:36.680 --> 19:37.440
Why do you think that?

19:37.840 --> 19:43.480
Cause you'll have Putin on and you're competitive as fuck.

19:43.520 --> 19:53.000
No, I think ultimately, um, I mean, you had, you've had a lot of people

19:53.000 --> 19:56.200
that I think you might, you may otherwise be skeptical.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.560
Would I have a good conversation?

19:57.720 --> 19:58.920
Which I think is your metric.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.000
You don't care about politics.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.640
So can I have a good conversation?

20:01.920 --> 20:06.120
And I think you had, uh, like people, people like Kanye on, for example,

20:06.120 --> 20:07.600
and you had a great conversation with them.

20:07.840 --> 20:13.080
I think you, I think, uh, Kanye is an artist, like, but Kanye doing

20:13.080 --> 20:16.840
well or not doing well doesn't change the course of our country.

20:18.200 --> 20:18.360
Yeah.

20:18.360 --> 20:23.720
But you don't, do you really bear the responsibility of the course of

20:23.720 --> 20:25.520
our country based on a conversation?

20:25.840 --> 20:33.640
I think you can revitalize and rehabilitate someone's image in a

20:33.640 --> 20:36.360
way that is pretty shocking.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.960
Look at the way people look at Alex Jones now, cause Alex Jones has

20:39.960 --> 20:41.360
been on my podcast a few times.

20:41.680 --> 20:41.960
Yeah.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.640
How do they, which direction?

20:43.720 --> 20:47.080
The people that have watched those podcasts think he's hilarious.

20:47.480 --> 20:51.960
And they think that he definitely fucked up with that whole Sandy Hook thing.

20:52.480 --> 20:56.040
Um, but he's right more than he's wrong.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.880
And he's not an evil guy.

20:59.160 --> 21:02.840
He's just a guy who's had some psychotic breaks in his life.

21:03.080 --> 21:05.920
He's had some genuine mental health issues that he's addressed.

21:06.240 --> 21:10.680
He's had some serious bouts of alcoholism, some serious bouts of, you

21:10.680 --> 21:15.040
know, substance abuse, and they've contributed to some very poor thinking.

21:15.440 --> 21:19.520
But if you know the guy, if you get to know him, like I have, I've

21:19.520 --> 21:20.840
known him for more than 20 years.

21:21.160 --> 21:26.520
And if you know him on podcasts, you realize like, he is genuinely trying

21:26.520 --> 21:32.120
to unearth some things that are genuinely disturbing for most people.

21:32.320 --> 21:37.120
Like, this is a guy that was telling me about Epstein's, uh, island.

21:38.040 --> 21:42.160
Fucking decade ago, at least he was telling me about, I was like, what?

21:42.600 --> 21:48.760
You're telling me there's a place where they bring elites to compromise them

21:48.760 --> 21:50.720
with underage girls and they filmed them.

21:50.760 --> 21:51.240
Really?

21:51.280 --> 21:51.760
Like what?

21:52.080 --> 21:53.040
Cut the fuck out of here.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.920
Like, no, president Clinton's been there.

21:55.000 --> 21:55.800
Everyone's been there.

21:55.840 --> 21:56.400
Like, what?

21:56.680 --> 21:57.760
It sounds like nonsense.

21:58.040 --> 22:02.280
And not only is it true, but people keep getting fucking murdered for it.

22:02.280 --> 22:05.280
Did you see that latest Clinton advisor that got murdered about it?

22:05.560 --> 22:05.880
Yep.

22:06.240 --> 22:06.520
Yeah.

22:06.720 --> 22:11.680
Hung with an extension cord, shot himself in the chest, 30 miles from his house.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.320
And they're calling it a suicide.

22:13.360 --> 22:16.800
And now even Elon Musk is asking, where's the clientele list?

22:17.080 --> 22:17.360
Yeah.

22:17.520 --> 22:20.640
We should, we should probably see who's been to that island.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.600
Yeah, we should probably see who's been to that island.

22:23.280 --> 22:27.520
And there's probably more of those kind of things out there that

22:27.520 --> 22:34.040
haven't been exposed yet, but sort of, uh, to push back in you, you, you had

22:34.040 --> 22:35.800
those conversations with Alex Jones.

22:35.800 --> 22:39.680
Wouldn't you be able to have the same kind of conversation with Donald Trump?

22:39.680 --> 22:40.160
That's the problem.

22:40.160 --> 22:40.680
Reveal.

22:40.720 --> 22:42.040
No, it's not the problem.

22:42.080 --> 22:44.600
You revealed that Alex Jones is a human being.

22:44.880 --> 22:45.680
He's fucked up.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.240
He has demons in his head.

22:47.440 --> 22:52.960
He's obviously chaotic all over the place, but there's some, uh, wisdom to

22:52.960 --> 22:54.440
the perspective he takes on the world.

22:54.440 --> 22:59.880
Even though he is often full of shit, he is able to predict certain things

22:59.880 --> 23:02.240
that very few people are willing to bring up.

23:02.480 --> 23:03.840
So isn't Trump the same way?

23:04.080 --> 23:09.800
Fucked up person, egomaniac, uh, whatever personality things you can talk about.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.280
Isn't it's worthwhile to lay it out?

23:12.360 --> 23:17.120
Like who's going to, if you listen to interviews of Trump, who has

23:17.120 --> 23:19.240
the balls to call him out on his bullshit?

23:19.280 --> 23:23.440
Chris Wall stood, uh, no, calling out somebody on their bullshit is easy

23:23.440 --> 23:24.960
when you're just being adversarial.

23:24.960 --> 23:30.080
But as a person who is genuinely empathetically trying to understand,

23:30.240 --> 23:31.800
yeah, I think you're really good at that.

23:31.800 --> 23:32.920
Like you pulled them in.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.320
I don't know if he would genuinely be there.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.080
You know what I'm saying?

23:37.240 --> 23:40.440
Like, I think he would be putting on a performance and that's, you know,

23:40.440 --> 23:42.760
I think he can break through that in like 30 minutes.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.080
I'd need more time than that.

23:44.760 --> 23:46.160
And he doesn't do any drugs.

23:46.480 --> 23:50.200
That's the thing about Alex, you can get Alex high, get him drunk, and he'll

23:50.200 --> 23:54.120
start talking about interdimensional child molesters, you know, and then

23:54.120 --> 23:56.080
you, you get the real Alex.

23:56.200 --> 24:00.920
Or maybe, maybe you have somebody else on as well to introduce chaos, like Alex.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.520
No, no, no, no.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.040
I would have to be just me and him.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.080
I would have to, that would be a focused thing.

24:07.120 --> 24:12.440
I would have to like really take time with, with Trump, but also I'm not,

24:12.480 --> 24:19.600
um, well versed enough politically to know all of the corruption that's been

24:19.600 --> 24:25.360
alleged and to understand what the, the whole Russia gate stuff, what, what's

24:25.360 --> 24:32.320
real, like how much of it, it's clear that there is more than one organization

24:32.320 --> 24:36.640
that's involved in communicating with Russia before the 2016 elections.

24:36.640 --> 24:39.840
It was, it's pretty clear that the Clinton administration was involved.

24:40.800 --> 24:44.360
It's pretty clear that the Trump administration had some communication

24:44.360 --> 24:45.880
with some people in Russia.

24:45.920 --> 24:50.880
It's pretty clear that Hunter Biden had some very suspicious dealings in Ukraine.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.840
And there's a lot going on there, man.

24:53.840 --> 24:57.160
And it's, it's hard for anybody to parse.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.360
It's really hard for anybody.

24:59.720 --> 25:05.600
And especially to have an objective assessment of exactly what's going on.

25:05.800 --> 25:09.640
And then to be able to do that and broadcast it publicly, that's quite

25:09.640 --> 25:13.840
a project and I think if you really want to do that correctly, it's something

25:13.840 --> 25:18.520
that I would have to research for a long time and to really, really, and

25:18.520 --> 25:19.480
I don't have that kind of time.

25:19.600 --> 25:23.760
Not, not for maybe for certain, for certain people that you're really curious

25:23.760 --> 25:26.040
about, like you have that kind of time for Bob Lazar.

25:26.160 --> 25:29.440
Yes, yes, but maybe not for Donald Trump.

25:29.600 --> 25:35.280
No, that's different because Bob Lazar, what, what, you know, what he's talking

25:35.280 --> 25:39.120
about, like I wanted to know with the Bob Lazar thing, I wanted to know, first of

25:39.120 --> 25:42.120
all, I want to be around him and see if I could smell bullshit.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.080
Did you like, okay.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.040
No, I didn't, man.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.280
That was what's weird about it.

25:46.560 --> 25:50.600
Not only did I not smell bullshit, I went over all of his interviews.

25:50.680 --> 25:55.440
I went out, he hasn't done a lot, but he's done enough and he's done them over

25:55.440 --> 26:02.440
the course of 30 plus years and it's alarming how consistent his story is,

26:02.920 --> 26:05.760
which is really weird when you think about, you're talking about back

26:05.800 --> 26:11.440
engineering alien crafts and working on a, you know, a top secret government test

26:11.440 --> 26:15.600
site that's carved into the side of a mountain and to camouflage it from

26:15.600 --> 26:22.680
satellites, it's a, it's such a wacky story, but the guy really did work at Los

26:22.680 --> 26:23.640
Alamos labs.

26:23.720 --> 26:25.520
He really is a propulsion's expert.

26:25.760 --> 26:27.560
He really is a scientist.

26:27.960 --> 26:31.720
Um, did he really work on back engineering UFOs?

26:31.720 --> 26:35.360
I don't know, but the way he described their motion is exactly

26:35.360 --> 26:39.920
like what's been observed by, uh, some of these pilots that have these

26:39.920 --> 26:41.240
videos that they've captured.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.160
And I just love that.

26:42.160 --> 26:46.200
Like NASA, I've been hearing from a bunch of folks who they're legitimately

26:46.760 --> 26:52.640
like funding research and there's people really taking the seriously of, um,

26:52.920 --> 26:57.880
UFO sightings, investigating them, like adding more and more sensors to collect

26:57.880 --> 27:01.000
data from just observing higher and higher definitions.

27:01.360 --> 27:02.760
It's, it's cool to finally see that.

27:02.760 --> 27:06.280
He was one of the early people, whether he's full of shit or not, that kind of

27:06.880 --> 27:11.400
forced people to start taking this kind of these topics seriously.

27:11.600 --> 27:16.000
Or at least force people to have conversations about them and maybe

27:16.200 --> 27:20.480
attempt to debunk them because it seems so preposterous, but then get sucked

27:20.480 --> 27:25.520
down the rabbit hole and start going, Hmm, maybe we'll fucking it's the thing

27:25.520 --> 27:28.080
is like the Fermi paradox, like where are they?

27:28.080 --> 27:28.400
Right.

27:28.960 --> 27:34.080
And when you take into account just the sheer raw numbers, the vast majority of

27:34.080 --> 27:40.680
people objectively assume that there is life out there, the vast majority.

27:40.880 --> 27:45.080
Well, if, if you really take into account what we understand about the universe

27:45.080 --> 27:49.000
itself, what we understand about the concept of, of infinity and the way Neil

27:49.000 --> 27:56.240
deGrasse Tyson has explained it to me is that not only are there life forms out

27:56.240 --> 27:58.520
there, but there's you, you are out there.

27:58.520 --> 28:03.880
Infinity is so large that Lex Fridman exists and doesn't just exist, but

28:03.880 --> 28:09.640
exists an infinite number of times, like the amount of interactions that cells

28:09.640 --> 28:15.640
and molecules, the same exact interactions that have happened here on earth have

28:15.640 --> 28:21.920
happened in the exact same order, an infinite number of times in the cosmos.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.600
Well, first of all, it's not certain that that's true.

28:24.600 --> 28:25.680
It's possible.

28:25.920 --> 28:32.360
Like Sean Carroll, you know, uh, especially with quantum mechanics, based on certain

28:32.360 --> 28:35.280
interpretation of quantum mechanics, that's, that's very possible.

28:35.360 --> 28:39.480
But the question is, can you access those universes?

28:39.760 --> 28:40.120
Right.

28:40.120 --> 28:45.400
And so the more, the more sort of specific practical question is this local

28:45.400 --> 28:50.800
pocket of the universe, our galaxy or neighboring galaxies, are there aliens

28:50.800 --> 28:52.320
there, what did they look like?

28:52.480 --> 28:55.400
Are they, so you can have this panspermia idea.

28:55.400 --> 29:03.920
Where a much larger, like, uh, like daddy civilization, uh, like, uh, rolled

29:03.920 --> 29:09.040
by and just planted a few aliens at a similar time, like Prometheus, yes.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.920
Uh, a different, you know, throughout the galaxy, and those are the ones

29:12.920 --> 29:14.040
we might be interacting with.

29:14.040 --> 29:19.320
They're all kind of dumb as we are relatively, you know, maybe, um, a

29:19.320 --> 29:22.840
few million years apart, and then those are the ones we're interacting with.

29:23.600 --> 29:26.520
And then we'll have a chance to actually connect with them and communicate with

29:26.520 --> 29:32.520
them, or it could be like much more wide open and you have these gigantic aliens

29:32.520 --> 29:34.960
civilizations that are expanding very, very quickly.

29:35.200 --> 29:38.240
And the interesting thing is when you look up at the sky and you see the

29:38.240 --> 29:42.440
stars, that's light from those stars.

29:43.360 --> 29:47.200
We might not be seeing the alien civilizations until they're already here.

29:47.640 --> 29:50.840
Meaning, like you start expanding.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.880
Once you get really good at expanding, you're going to be expanding very

29:53.880 --> 29:54.920
close to the speed of light.

29:55.360 --> 29:59.080
So right now we don't see much in the, in the sky, but there could be one night,

29:59.080 --> 30:03.160
one day we wake up and it's just like everywhere and they're here.

30:03.240 --> 30:03.640
Right.

30:03.840 --> 30:04.000
Right.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.800
Because the amount of time the light takes to reach us.

30:06.160 --> 30:06.480
Yeah.

30:06.480 --> 30:12.000
Uh, and then the, the thing that I've been really fascinated by is these.

30:12.680 --> 30:17.720
Alternative forms of transportation that they're discussing, like the, the

30:17.760 --> 30:24.680
ability to harness wormholes and the ability to, to do things that, uh, uh, a

30:24.680 --> 30:26.600
type three civilization is capable of.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.880
I had Michio Kaku on my podcast recently.

30:29.000 --> 30:29.760
Fantastic.

30:29.760 --> 30:30.480
Love that guy.

30:30.880 --> 30:35.960
He's so, he's so good at taking extremely complex.

30:36.800 --> 30:42.440
Concepts and boiling them down for digestion and, and, you know, and saying

30:42.440 --> 30:45.560
them in a way that other people can appreciate and not being hesitant about

30:46.040 --> 30:50.880
wild, crazy shit that's out there, but grounded in what's actually possible.

30:51.080 --> 30:51.280
Yeah.

30:51.280 --> 30:54.120
He's all in on this UFO phenomenon now.

30:54.120 --> 30:57.760
He's now he's like, now the burden of proof is to people for people to come up

30:57.760 --> 31:01.680
with some sort of a conventional explanation for these things.

31:02.120 --> 31:06.680
He goes, because these things are defying all the concepts of physics that, that

31:06.680 --> 31:11.040
we're, we currently know in terms of what our capabilities are and, and propulsion

31:11.080 --> 31:16.160
systems and, and so many other things that, you know, what we know about what

31:16.160 --> 31:20.720
current science is capable of reproducing as far as what we know, the problem is

31:20.720 --> 31:28.040
like, uh, these, um, military projects that are top secret, like how much money

31:28.040 --> 31:28.640
do they have?

31:28.640 --> 31:33.880
They have a lot of money, like, but is it possible, and maybe you could speak to

31:33.880 --> 31:39.680
this, is it possible that there could be some propulsion systems that have been

31:39.680 --> 31:45.720
developed and implemented that are far beyond just the simple burning of rocket

31:45.720 --> 31:50.800
fuel, pushing the fire out the back, which forces the rocket at extreme speeds

31:50.800 --> 31:57.080
forward that's something that does harness gravity, something that can distort

31:57.080 --> 32:03.160
space and time and can make travel from one point to another, uh, like

32:03.520 --> 32:04.960
preposterously fast.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.680
Well, not only is it possible, I think.

32:08.520 --> 32:12.400
It's likely that that kind of stuff would be kept a secret.

32:12.440 --> 32:12.800
Yeah.

32:12.840 --> 32:18.760
It's just everything you see about these, um, about the way either if it's

32:18.760 --> 32:22.920
contractors like Lockheed Martin, or if it's DOD, the, the, the actual

32:22.920 --> 32:26.080
departments of defense, they operate in complete secrecy.

32:26.080 --> 32:31.080
Just even looking at the, the history of the stealth fighter, just even stealth

32:31.080 --> 32:36.800
technology was kept a secret for a very, very long time and not until you're ready

32:36.920 --> 32:43.160
to use it and need to use it, does it become public and not officially public.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.680
It just is being detected out in the wild.

32:46.080 --> 32:50.160
So there's going to be a process where you're secretly testing it and that

32:50.160 --> 32:54.160
might creep up, which is maybe what we're seeing, and then it's waiting for the

32:54.160 --> 32:59.160
next big war, the next big reason to use the thing.

33:00.080 --> 33:02.840
And then, so yeah, there's, there's definitely technologies in that.

33:03.160 --> 33:04.960
There might not be propulsion technologies.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.800
There could be AI surveillance technologies.

33:07.800 --> 33:12.240
That could be different kinds of, uh, stealth drones.

33:12.720 --> 33:19.440
There could be, uh, it could be also in cyberspace, like cyber war weapons, all

33:19.440 --> 33:21.720
that kind of stuff that they're obviously going to be kept secret.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.760
I'm, I'm very skeptical lately.

33:25.120 --> 33:28.480
And the reason why I'm skeptical is the government keeps talking about it.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.720
The Pentagon keeps talking about it.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.240
NASA keeps talking about it.

33:32.480 --> 33:33.920
In which direction are you skeptical?

33:34.120 --> 33:36.040
I'm skeptical that it's, they're aliens.

33:36.320 --> 33:40.720
I think most likely it's a smoke screen and most likely these are some sort of

33:40.720 --> 33:45.280
like incredibly advanced drones that they've developed that they want

33:45.280 --> 33:46.840
to pretend don't exist.

33:47.280 --> 33:49.280
That seems the more likely scenario.

33:49.280 --> 33:53.800
Cause otherwise my take is like, what's the benefit of them discussing these

33:53.800 --> 33:57.400
things, like what's the benefit of them discussing these things openly?

33:57.600 --> 34:03.520
These are, you know, what, what, the way they described it off world crafts, not

34:03.520 --> 34:08.600
made from this earth, like why, why would they, why would they tell us that?

34:08.880 --> 34:16.000
I mean, unless there's an imminent danger of us being invaded and they want to

34:16.000 --> 34:19.640
prepare people so they don't freak out as much, you know, like maybe freak

34:19.640 --> 34:24.760
them out a little bit, say that publicly, the New York Times article, the Pentagon

34:25.080 --> 34:26.760
discussing it, all these different things.

34:26.760 --> 34:27.560
Test the waters.

34:28.080 --> 34:28.320
Yeah.

34:28.720 --> 34:35.640
Well, let, let people know that this is a thing or my take is like that.

34:35.640 --> 34:36.840
I don't think they do that.

34:36.880 --> 34:38.080
I don't think they tell us.

34:38.560 --> 34:41.840
I think they, I think, I think the government has a lot of

34:41.840 --> 34:43.680
contempt for the, for the citizens.

34:44.120 --> 34:44.760
I really do.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.960
I think they have contempt for our intelligence.

34:47.200 --> 34:49.400
They have contempt for our need to know things.

34:49.560 --> 34:52.880
And I also think they think that they are running us.

34:53.080 --> 34:56.240
It's not, we're all in this together and the government works for the

34:56.240 --> 34:58.680
people and the government is of the people.

34:58.680 --> 34:59.800
I don't think they think that way.

34:59.920 --> 35:00.160
Yeah.

35:00.160 --> 35:03.440
They, the, the basic idea is you can't trust the populace, the

35:03.440 --> 35:05.920
government itself because we're a bunch of idiots.

35:07.040 --> 35:07.920
I think that's accurate.

35:08.800 --> 35:12.280
Well, they're not wrong, but they're also, they're also idiots.

35:12.320 --> 35:13.320
Power hungry idiots.

35:13.360 --> 35:13.640
Yeah.

35:13.640 --> 35:16.680
I don't think they're, I don't think everyone's an idiot, but I think there

35:16.680 --> 35:20.600
are enough idiots that it becomes a real problem if you're completely honest

35:20.600 --> 35:25.960
about everything you do and, you know, you don't want to let everybody weigh

35:25.960 --> 35:30.000
in about things that are incredibly complex and that most people are ignorant of.

35:30.280 --> 35:34.840
And on top of that, there's this machine of intelligence that I've recently been

35:34.840 --> 35:37.280
reading a lot about the KGB, about the FSB.

35:37.320 --> 35:40.800
So I've several things sparked my curiosity.

35:40.800 --> 35:45.200
So one, I'm traveling to Ukraine and to Moscow and because of that, I started to

35:45.200 --> 35:50.080
sort of ask practical questions of myself, just travel and all those kinds of things.

35:50.360 --> 35:52.240
So I started reading a lot about the KGB.

35:52.320 --> 35:54.000
Jack Barsky has a book on this.

35:54.040 --> 35:58.800
I talked to him and you start to realize, you probably looked into some of this,

35:58.800 --> 36:04.840
but you just start to realize the scale of surveillance manipulation.

36:05.280 --> 36:09.880
Now, a lot of them also talk about the incompetence of those organizations.

36:09.880 --> 36:16.680
The usual bureaucracy creeps in, but the point is it seems like there's no line

36:16.680 --> 36:22.320
they're not willing to cross for the purpose of gathering intelligence, for

36:22.360 --> 36:25.240
the purpose of controlling people in order to gather intelligence.

36:25.600 --> 36:33.480
Now this is MI6, FSB, there's not much information about the FSB or the GRU,

36:33.480 --> 36:39.520
but the KGB, so we're always like 20 years behind or more on the actual information.

36:39.960 --> 36:45.520
And so I started to wonder, so I have not officially been contacted

36:45.520 --> 36:51.680
by any intelligence agency, but I started to wonder, well, is there

36:51.680 --> 36:58.880
somebody I know that's doing that undercover CIA or undercover FSB,

36:58.880 --> 36:59.880
undercover anything?

37:00.320 --> 37:01.000
You probably do.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.120
Have you asked yourself this question?

37:03.400 --> 37:04.440
Yeah, for sure.

37:04.600 --> 37:04.840
Yeah.

37:04.840 --> 37:06.280
People that have been on my podcast.

37:06.760 --> 37:07.600
Yeah, for sure.

37:07.640 --> 37:10.320
Do you think there was actual, I guess that may have been?

37:10.440 --> 37:11.160
A hundred percent.

37:11.400 --> 37:11.880
Oh man.

37:11.920 --> 37:12.800
I would imagine.

37:12.920 --> 37:13.520
Would you know?

37:14.720 --> 37:15.760
I have suspicions.

37:15.800 --> 37:16.400
Do you care?

37:16.840 --> 37:17.280
Is this?

37:17.480 --> 37:22.800
I mean, it depends on what they're attempting to do, right?

37:22.840 --> 37:27.080
Like if I felt like there was some deception involved and they were trying

37:27.080 --> 37:32.120
to use the podcast to manipulate a narrative in a deceptive way to

37:32.120 --> 37:33.560
trick people into things.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.000
Yeah, I would care.

37:35.240 --> 37:37.920
But this is exactly what those are the kinds of things they do.

37:37.920 --> 37:39.400
They do plant narratives.

37:39.440 --> 37:39.920
Yeah.

37:40.920 --> 37:45.200
I mean, I would imagine if you have the number one podcast in the world,

37:45.360 --> 37:47.600
that people would want to infiltrate that.

37:48.280 --> 37:52.520
Yeah, there's probably meetings in all major intelligence agencies about,

37:52.520 --> 37:54.120
okay, what are the large platforms?

37:55.040 --> 37:58.200
How do we spread the message?

37:58.240 --> 37:58.480
Yeah.

37:58.720 --> 38:02.320
Well, I mean, that's the thing that really emerged when we're talking

38:02.320 --> 38:08.080
about during my cancellation, that there's a clear, there's no objective

38:08.120 --> 38:10.680
analysis of this in mainstream media.

38:10.920 --> 38:14.120
There's clear narratives that they're trying to push forward.

38:14.200 --> 38:20.680
Whether it's to promote certain ideas or to diminish the power and

38:20.680 --> 38:28.160
reach of people who are mavericks or people who aren't connected to

38:28.160 --> 38:30.120
a system that you can't compromise.

38:30.240 --> 38:31.640
That's where it gets dangerous, right?

38:31.880 --> 38:35.120
Where it gets dangerous is when someone has the largest reach,

38:35.440 --> 38:41.680
but is also completely detached and clearly is independent.

38:42.000 --> 38:48.160
Clearly is independent in the sense of independent thinking

38:49.040 --> 38:50.760
has on whoever he wants.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.960
But your mind can still be manipulated.

38:53.120 --> 38:53.880
I guess I can.

38:54.080 --> 38:56.360
I mean, I guess everybody can be manipulated a certain way.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.760
I manipulate my own mind, I'm sure too, but I also spend a lot of

38:59.760 --> 39:01.360
time thinking about what I think.

39:01.920 --> 39:05.680
You know, I don't just accept things like, like the UFO thing.

39:05.960 --> 39:10.720
Like I was all in for a while and now I'm like, man, something

39:10.720 --> 39:14.680
smells fishy and then I'm thinking like, why?

39:14.760 --> 39:16.440
Here's my problem with the UFO thing.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.880
I want it to be real so bad.

39:19.320 --> 39:20.560
That's my problem with it.

39:20.560 --> 39:21.760
I'm such a sucker.

39:22.600 --> 39:25.240
I want it to be real so bad, you know?

39:25.320 --> 39:29.400
And that's, that's a problem for me because I'm aware of it.

39:29.600 --> 39:34.360
And so then I stop and think about like, what is, what, what is my desire

39:35.440 --> 39:39.360
for a UFO truth to be exposed?

39:39.360 --> 39:40.400
Well, it's cause it's fun.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.760
You know, that's what it is.

39:42.800 --> 39:45.120
So I have a desire to, for it to be real.

39:45.160 --> 39:49.520
And I mean, I've talked to, I talked to a bunch of folks about this.

39:49.920 --> 39:56.680
So those with connection with DOD and they do draw lines between people that

39:56.680 --> 39:58.400
are full of shit and people who are not.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.240
There's a lot of people in the public sphere that they say are full of shit.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.200
Yeah, for sure.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.600
And then you have to kind of tell the difference.

40:06.760 --> 40:06.960
Yeah.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.680
CNN watch them talk.

40:08.760 --> 40:15.640
Well, I mean, on the UFO topic, there's certain, certain individuals that are

40:15.640 --> 40:17.640
like, okay, they're just like using this.

40:18.080 --> 40:21.920
Um, in fact, like people who are not full of shit are often very quiet,

40:22.720 --> 40:25.880
which is why, you know, even Bob Lazar is an interesting story because he was

40:25.880 --> 40:27.600
trying to be quiet for the longest time.

40:28.480 --> 40:31.680
Well, he was worried about his own life, according to Bob, and that's

40:31.680 --> 40:33.080
why he went public with it.

40:33.120 --> 40:37.320
And initially the first videos he did with George Knapp, they hit his identity.

40:37.480 --> 40:37.800
Yeah.

40:38.400 --> 40:38.760
Yeah.

40:38.960 --> 40:42.600
And then he felt like that wasn't enough and he really needed to expose his own

40:42.600 --> 40:48.720
identity just to protect his life, which is a great story, you know?

40:48.720 --> 40:51.000
So you gotta go, well, that seems so juicy.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
I want to buy into it.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.400
And that's where I get nervous.

40:53.440 --> 40:55.240
You don't know, you don't know who to trust in this world.

40:55.280 --> 40:55.960
Exactly.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.520
How, how do you figure that out?

40:57.960 --> 40:59.520
How do you figure out who to trust in your life?

40:59.840 --> 41:00.560
You're Joe Rogan.

41:00.560 --> 41:06.200
A lot of people want to be close to you CIA agents, FSB agents, uh, people that

41:06.360 --> 41:08.240
I'm friends with a former CIA agent.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.880
Mike Baker has been on my podcast a bunch of times, allegedly former

41:11.920 --> 41:13.080
former thing about that.

41:13.080 --> 41:14.200
He's air quotes former.

41:14.240 --> 41:14.520
Yeah.

41:14.560 --> 41:14.800
Yeah.

41:14.800 --> 41:15.960
I don't believe he's former.

41:15.960 --> 41:17.640
It's probably, I'm sure he has some connection to him.

41:17.960 --> 41:23.520
I also believe he's a good guy, but I gain a lot of very intelligent and

41:23.520 --> 41:26.280
well-informed insights from him as to how things work.

41:26.360 --> 41:31.680
And, you know, I think, uh, yeah, I'm sure he doesn't tell me

41:31.680 --> 41:35.720
everything about everything, but he's told me enough where I, I, I

41:35.720 --> 41:41.000
think I can understand things better from talking to him about how the

41:41.000 --> 41:46.120
way, you know, the elves work under the machine.

41:46.360 --> 41:47.640
What, what about friends?

41:47.800 --> 41:48.960
How do you know if you can trust?

41:49.200 --> 41:50.640
Well, most of my friends are old friends.

41:51.360 --> 41:51.840
Time.

41:51.920 --> 41:53.080
So time is the thing.

41:53.520 --> 41:56.000
Like, uh, just going through shit together.

41:56.080 --> 41:56.400
Yeah.

41:56.400 --> 42:01.080
And see how much people that, you know, first of all, comics, like

42:01.520 --> 42:02.520
you can trust comics.

42:02.560 --> 42:03.160
Yeah.

42:03.640 --> 42:04.760
We're pretty trustworthy.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.600
The good ones, the really good ones.

42:06.960 --> 42:08.280
There's not that many of us.

42:08.960 --> 42:14.160
If there's a thousand professional comics on earth, I'd be stunned.

42:14.760 --> 42:15.440
I'd be stunned.

42:15.440 --> 42:19.560
I don't even think there's a thousand, like real professionals who you get

42:19.560 --> 42:24.360
booked all the time, headline weekends at clubs and theaters and arenas.

42:25.200 --> 42:26.520
And then there's levels to that.

42:26.520 --> 42:26.880
Right?

42:26.880 --> 42:31.080
There's like the guys who are middle acts who kind of like barely

42:31.120 --> 42:33.960
scrape by and then like, how many headliners are there?

42:34.160 --> 42:37.280
How many like really funny headliners that I would say, you know, if you Lex,

42:37.280 --> 42:40.680
you tell me you're going to be in Cincinnati, Hey, this person's playing

42:40.680 --> 42:42.000
at this club, should I go see them?

42:42.520 --> 42:47.400
I'm like, you know, like how many people would I give the recommendation to?

42:47.960 --> 42:50.600
And then how many people sell out theaters?

42:51.080 --> 42:53.040
How many people sell out arenas?

42:53.080 --> 42:54.800
How many, there's not that fucking many.

42:55.040 --> 43:00.160
So those people, like at the, uh, the levels of comedy where you do, you

43:00.160 --> 43:03.960
know, you've been doing standup for 20 years, you, there's a certain amount

43:03.960 --> 43:07.800
of honesty and a certain amount of understanding of each other that we all have.

43:07.880 --> 43:11.480
Oh, so that, that process of becoming a great comic is like humbling in

43:11.480 --> 43:13.160
the way like Jiu-Jitsu is humbling.

43:13.160 --> 43:13.960
Very similar.

43:14.160 --> 43:18.760
Like there's, you've taken, you've eaten so much shit that, that, that somehow,

43:18.800 --> 43:22.720
even if you're insane, if you're, even if you're chaotic, even in the way,

43:23.040 --> 43:26.400
even if you're full of shit, you lie a lot, all those kinds of things

43:26.760 --> 43:28.680
underneath it, there's a good human.

43:29.040 --> 43:32.760
It could be surface bullshitter, but on important things, you're trustworthy.

43:33.640 --> 43:34.360
Hopefully.

43:34.640 --> 43:37.080
I mean, if you're not, then people shy away from you.

43:37.080 --> 43:40.160
And there are people like that too, that are really successful, but that

43:40.160 --> 43:42.240
are, that are what I call islands.

43:42.840 --> 43:44.600
Um, I've talked to other comics about that.

43:44.600 --> 43:47.440
Like you don't want to be an island because there's these people that aren't

43:47.440 --> 43:50.920
attached to the rest of the community and they're doing well on their own.

43:51.320 --> 43:54.640
And usually they have like one opening act they bring with them on the road.

43:54.680 --> 43:58.720
They've worked with forever and they don't have comedy friends.

43:59.280 --> 44:03.360
And they're, those people are miserable because they can't relate.

44:03.520 --> 44:05.720
Sometimes fame in itself is isolating.

44:06.120 --> 44:08.680
So you have to actually do a lot of work and make sure you don't.

44:09.000 --> 44:13.280
It doesn't isolate you because if you become successful, people start

44:13.280 --> 44:17.160
wanting stuff from you and then sometimes you want to push them away because of

44:17.160 --> 44:19.440
that, as opposed to, uh, connect with them.

44:19.800 --> 44:19.960
Yeah.

44:19.960 --> 44:21.880
I don't enjoy it when people want things from me.

44:22.760 --> 44:23.440
It's not fun.

44:23.440 --> 44:24.240
You just ignore it.

44:24.480 --> 44:26.240
Yeah, it's fucking too heavy.

44:26.600 --> 44:31.440
They want too much and it's, it's too much of a disproportionate relationship.

44:32.080 --> 44:36.800
You know, it's too unbalanced because, uh, there are people where you could

44:36.800 --> 44:41.160
tell that they're working towards something, they're working towards an

44:41.160 --> 44:46.040
angle and they want to be close to you because you'll, you will benefit them.

44:46.400 --> 44:50.080
And then there's other people that are just, there's not that many of us.

44:50.080 --> 44:51.800
And so we all want to hang out together.

44:52.040 --> 44:55.280
Like when I, one of the podcasts I love the most is this podcast

44:55.280 --> 44:57.240
I do called protect our parks.

44:57.600 --> 45:00.960
It's a thing I do with Ari Shafir, Shane Gillis and Mark.

45:01.080 --> 45:01.560
That's great.

45:01.840 --> 45:06.600
It's so fun because we just get obliterated and we talk so much shit.

45:06.960 --> 45:09.800
Like there's conversations after that podcast where I go, Hey, man, we

45:09.800 --> 45:14.440
got to cut that part out because like Shane will go too far, go too crazy,

45:14.640 --> 45:17.480
but we're just making each other laugh and it's just fun.

45:17.840 --> 45:21.640
And it's like that kind of camaraderie between real comics is very

45:21.640 --> 45:22.440
precious to me.

45:22.480 --> 45:25.920
My favorite part of that is like the non sequitur stuff from Mark Norman.

45:26.440 --> 45:29.560
And you guys get so trashed that you don't even understand what the hell

45:29.560 --> 45:33.080
he's talking about, but it's funny to the listener because he's still on point.

45:33.080 --> 45:37.360
That guy's a sharp, he's got that Mitch Hedberg quality.

45:37.360 --> 45:38.040
Yes.

45:38.400 --> 45:41.280
Well, he's such a, such a dedicated comic.

45:41.280 --> 45:43.120
You know, he loves comedy so much.

45:43.480 --> 45:44.760
That's one of the things I love about him.

45:44.760 --> 45:45.760
He's like comedy.

45:46.080 --> 45:47.080
He gets excited.

45:47.480 --> 45:50.080
He loves it as does Shane and as does Ari.

45:50.120 --> 45:50.600
Yeah.

45:50.680 --> 45:51.760
You know, they really love it.

45:51.800 --> 45:56.160
And it's, um, that's so, so there's that, like I have friends in that way.

45:56.160 --> 45:59.760
And I have martial arts friends who are some of the, uh, also the

45:59.760 --> 46:03.160
thing about being humbled, how things like Jiu-Jitsu will humble you.

46:03.560 --> 46:10.800
Martial arts friends are, they're also, they know, they know who's been through

46:10.800 --> 46:15.880
it, you know, they know who's, who really has gone through the gauntlet and emerged

46:15.880 --> 46:18.160
on the other end, uh, a better person.

46:18.400 --> 46:18.720
Yeah.

46:19.040 --> 46:20.280
You said there's very few of us.

46:20.840 --> 46:22.240
Let's have the goat discussion.

46:22.240 --> 46:25.880
You're not going to pick anybody, but who are the greats of comedy?

46:25.880 --> 46:28.920
Who's, who's the, who's the, who's the greatest comic of all time?

46:29.320 --> 46:31.840
I don't think there is a greatest comic of all time.

46:32.480 --> 46:33.600
It's like Norm MacDonald.

46:34.360 --> 46:36.560
Norm MacDonald was one of the greats for sure.

46:36.880 --> 46:40.280
Well, by the way, actually on that topic, what, what do you think about his, I

46:40.280 --> 46:44.240
think as a person who was fascinated by the fear of death and death, I think it

46:44.240 --> 46:49.520
was a truly genius thing to release a special after you're dead.

46:50.520 --> 46:51.400
I don't know how that worked.

46:51.400 --> 46:52.640
I haven't seen the special of you.

46:52.680 --> 46:53.040
It's not.

46:53.040 --> 46:59.520
Yeah, it's, it's, um, it's called, I think, nothing special, which sounds

46:59.520 --> 47:05.120
like something normal to say, and it's basically him in front of, I mean, I, I

47:05.120 --> 47:10.000
imagine he wouldn't want to have wanted it edited that way because it's made to

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
look nicer than I think he probably would have preferred it, uh, but it's him

47:14.000 --> 47:19.440
in front of the screen, like in a zoom call doing jokes.

47:19.760 --> 47:21.400
Without lap cold.

47:21.600 --> 47:22.040
Really?

47:22.080 --> 47:22.520
Yeah.

47:22.720 --> 47:30.720
And somehow given his like dry, dark humor, it works because it's almost

47:30.720 --> 47:35.920
making fun of itself, almost making fun of that hole that we were stuck, stuck

47:35.960 --> 47:41.640
alone inside and because he's still acting as if he's in front of the audience

47:42.080 --> 47:45.360
and is almost making fun of the fact that this is what we're forced to do.

47:45.600 --> 47:46.640
I mean, it's quite genius.

47:46.640 --> 47:48.680
It's really well, and the jokes are really good.

47:49.120 --> 47:52.040
But it also makes you realize how important laughter is from the

47:52.040 --> 47:53.720
audience, the energy from the audience.

47:54.320 --> 47:58.120
Because, uh, but there's also an intimacy because it's just you and him

47:58.720 --> 47:59.840
because you're listening into it.

48:00.120 --> 48:01.440
You know, there's no audience.

48:01.720 --> 48:02.640
So that's, I don't know.

48:02.640 --> 48:04.640
It's, I think it's quite genius.

48:04.640 --> 48:08.680
And he is, of course there's, there's certain comics that are like, not

48:08.680 --> 48:16.200
only are they funny, but they're truly unique in like they're, they're, they're

48:16.520 --> 48:20.160
not in terms of, um, friendship and all that kind of stuff, but in terms of

48:20.160 --> 48:21.680
comedy, they're an Island.

48:21.920 --> 48:22.280
Yeah.

48:22.320 --> 48:25.960
It's like they, you know, Mitch Hedberg probably is that, of course, a lot of

48:25.960 --> 48:30.280
people then start to imitate them and so on, but Steven Wright, Steven Wright.

48:30.720 --> 48:34.920
I mean, there's like people who are like, you know, Dave Chappelle, who's like

48:35.000 --> 48:38.800
probably one of the greats, but he's just like raw funny.

48:38.880 --> 48:39.240
Yeah.

48:39.400 --> 48:40.600
I don't know if he's an Island.

48:41.040 --> 48:41.960
He's just raw.

48:42.040 --> 48:42.520
Oh yeah.

48:42.520 --> 48:43.240
I know what you're saying.

48:43.240 --> 48:45.360
An outlier, a unique individual.

48:45.360 --> 48:45.560
Yeah.

48:45.600 --> 48:46.440
He's just great.

48:47.240 --> 48:50.520
Um, Norm was definitely unique in his greatness.

48:50.520 --> 48:54.560
Like, like there's only one norm, you know, who's got a very specific style.

48:54.600 --> 48:58.560
Is there a reason you guys weren't, it doesn't seem like he was, you guys were close.

48:59.040 --> 48:59.880
I mean, I loved him.

49:00.080 --> 49:00.640
It was great.

49:00.680 --> 49:02.240
I always enjoyed talking to him.

49:02.960 --> 49:05.680
Um, we just didn't work together that often.

49:05.680 --> 49:07.200
We weren't around each other that often.

49:07.280 --> 49:11.080
That's all it was, but it wasn't like, uh, it was, I loved him though.

49:11.680 --> 49:12.520
He was great guy.

49:12.520 --> 49:13.840
I had a funny story about it.

49:13.880 --> 49:19.560
Norm, uh, twice just randomly, I was on airplanes next to him seated, seated

49:19.560 --> 49:21.280
right next to him, just totally random.

49:21.960 --> 49:26.320
And, uh, one time we're on this, uh, airplane and we're having this talk

49:26.560 --> 49:28.640
and I was like, yeah, quit smoking.

49:28.640 --> 49:32.920
Uh, I was smoking a lot and I just had terrible, terrible smoke.

49:32.920 --> 49:33.880
It's terrible for you.

49:34.560 --> 49:35.920
And we have this great conversation.

49:35.920 --> 49:41.440
We get off the plane and he sprints towards a store and buy cigarettes

49:41.680 --> 49:46.280
like in the airport and is lighting it on the way out the door.

49:46.720 --> 49:48.400
And I go, I thought you quit smoking those.

49:48.400 --> 49:49.280
Yeah, I did.

49:49.280 --> 49:52.240
But all that talking about smoking made me want to smoke again.

49:55.640 --> 49:58.440
Before he's getting through the door, the airport, he's lighting it up.

49:58.440 --> 49:59.280
I can't wait.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.760
He can't wait to get that cigarette in him.

50:02.760 --> 50:08.440
It was, he was just so crazy and impulsive and love to gamble.

50:08.480 --> 50:09.480
He loved gambling.

50:09.960 --> 50:12.240
And in that way, he embodied the joke.

50:12.440 --> 50:17.880
Like you can't even tell the certain people just like live in a non-sequitur

50:19.200 --> 50:21.640
ridiculous, absurd, funny way.

50:21.720 --> 50:22.760
Yeah, that was him.

50:23.200 --> 50:24.440
I mean, nonstop.

50:24.520 --> 50:27.280
It was just, there was nothing artificial about Norm.

50:27.680 --> 50:29.560
You know, that, that was who he was.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.880
His brilliance was his essence.

50:33.240 --> 50:37.120
That was who he was, you know, but it's in terms of like the greats,

50:38.120 --> 50:40.320
the godfather of it all is Lenny Bruce.

50:40.720 --> 50:45.720
I mean, I have a bunch of Lenny Bruce concert posters at my house and photos

50:45.720 --> 50:49.440
that I have framed and Whitney Cummings actually gave me this brilliant photo of

50:49.440 --> 50:54.080
him when he got arrested for one of the times when he got arrested for saying

50:54.080 --> 51:00.480
obscene jokes, he was the most important figure in the early days of comedy

51:00.480 --> 51:05.360
because he essentially gave birth to the modern art form of standup comedy.

51:05.720 --> 51:09.560
Before that, it was a bunch of guys that were like hosting shows and they would

51:09.560 --> 51:14.080
tell jokes, they would just like, you know, you know, two guys walking to a

51:14.080 --> 51:15.560
bar, that kind of stuff.

51:15.920 --> 51:21.120
And he would talk about social issues.

51:21.440 --> 51:23.160
You know, he would talk about life.

51:23.160 --> 51:24.600
He would talk about language.

51:24.600 --> 51:26.720
He would talk about laws.

51:27.360 --> 51:33.440
And it was just, he was the very first guy who did modern standup.

51:33.840 --> 51:40.240
And what's fascinating is if you go and you try to watch it, if you try to watch

51:40.240 --> 51:45.600
Lenny Bruce today, it doesn't work because society has evolved.

51:45.680 --> 51:50.520
Like in many ways, art is a window, especially like pop culture art or

51:50.520 --> 51:59.800
modern, you know, at the time, culture art, art that discusses culture is a

51:59.800 --> 52:01.680
window into that time period.

52:01.680 --> 52:03.120
It's a little bit of a time machine.

52:03.400 --> 52:06.960
So you get to like, you have to pull yourself, like, what was it like to be

52:06.960 --> 52:10.440
in 1963, like, what was he in 1963?

52:10.440 --> 52:12.880
What was this like to hear him say this?

52:13.480 --> 52:19.840
And the, the civilization that existed in 1963, although it looked pretty

52:19.840 --> 52:23.200
similar, they're all driving cars and they're all wearing suits and they're

52:23.200 --> 52:26.440
all, it seems normal, that's a, it's a different world.

52:27.040 --> 52:32.960
And the things that he was saying that are so taboo are so normal today that

52:32.960 --> 52:36.520
they're not shocking and it's not, not that good.

52:36.560 --> 52:37.440
It's not that funny.

52:37.480 --> 52:37.720
Yeah.

52:37.720 --> 52:42.360
You have to do the same kind of stuff for, um, like there's a DH Lawrence is

52:42.360 --> 52:44.800
a book called lady shadow is lover.

52:45.600 --> 52:48.880
And I know it sounds ridiculous, but it was one of the early books, I believe

52:48.880 --> 52:55.040
at the, uh, over a century ago, that was very controversial for its sexual content.

52:55.040 --> 52:58.920
It's sort of one of the great books because it dared to actually talk about

52:59.280 --> 53:04.800
a woman cheating on her husband and like, and do so in the highest form.

53:04.800 --> 53:08.680
And the same thing with Gulag Archipelago talking about, talking about some of

53:08.680 --> 53:11.440
the darkest aspects of human history, right?

53:11.440 --> 53:14.920
When all of that stuff is forbidden, when it's banned.

53:15.080 --> 53:19.560
Cause now it's like not, you know, yes, we all know this history, but when in

53:19.560 --> 53:23.280
the middle of it, when you're risking your own life, when you're risking your

53:23.320 --> 53:27.960
book being banned or burned or, uh, you being in prison, that's what it matters.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.040
Like taking that risk.

53:29.360 --> 53:29.840
Yeah.

53:29.840 --> 53:32.480
And no one took that risk more than Lenny Bruce.

53:32.520 --> 53:34.800
Lenny Bruce is arrested many, many times.

53:35.000 --> 53:39.240
And, uh, ultimately he wound up costing him his life.

53:39.240 --> 53:43.880
I mean, he died on the bathroom floor, shooting heroin and trying to cope with

53:43.880 --> 53:45.680
all the lawsuits that he was going through.

53:45.720 --> 53:49.560
I mean, this guy was constantly being arrested and constantly going through

53:49.560 --> 53:52.760
lawsuits and then his comedy deteriorated horribly.

53:53.120 --> 53:56.720
There's some footage of him, uh, towards the end of his career where he's

53:56.720 --> 53:59.920
essentially would go on stage with legal papers and read from the legal

53:59.920 --> 54:02.200
papers about his case from then.

54:02.200 --> 54:04.120
It's Richard Pryor from him.

54:04.160 --> 54:05.800
Then the next great is Richard Pryor.

54:05.800 --> 54:10.040
And he had the most profound impact on me when I was a kid, when I was 15

54:10.040 --> 54:14.080
years old, my parents took me to see live at the sunset strip, which is

54:14.160 --> 54:15.560
Richard Pryor's concert film.

54:15.920 --> 54:22.480
And I remember very distinctly being in that audience and laughing.

54:22.640 --> 54:25.960
And looking around at all the people in the audience who were like

54:25.960 --> 54:31.880
falling out of their chairs, just dying, laughing, just swaying back and forth.

54:32.360 --> 54:33.680
And I was laughing hard too.

54:33.680 --> 54:36.920
And I was like, my God, this guy's doing this just by talking.

54:37.360 --> 54:40.040
And I thought of all the great movies that I'd seen that I loved that

54:40.040 --> 54:41.640
were hilarious comedy movies.

54:42.240 --> 54:45.280
And I was like, nothing that I've ever seen is as funny as this.

54:45.560 --> 54:47.080
And all he's doing is talking.

54:47.640 --> 54:53.400
And that planted a seed in my head for my love of stand-up comedy and my

54:53.400 --> 54:55.200
curiosity about the art form.

54:55.200 --> 54:59.600
And that's what got me interested in, you know, watching it on television and then

54:59.600 --> 55:03.560
ultimately going to open mic nights and, and then eventually doing it.

55:04.200 --> 55:07.720
I've actually been going to open mics a lot recently, just listening

55:08.040 --> 55:10.840
for psychological examinations of people.

55:11.240 --> 55:16.560
No, I, I, it's actually really inspiring to me, uh, to see people that, you know,

55:16.560 --> 55:22.880
some are funny, some are not so funny, unapologetically trying, putting it all

55:22.880 --> 55:26.400
out there night after night, like eating shit.

55:26.760 --> 55:27.080
Yeah.

55:27.160 --> 55:31.200
My favorite is when, you know, you're talking about like five people in the

55:31.200 --> 55:39.280
audience and the jokes are just not landing and they still, I don't know.

55:39.400 --> 55:44.600
It feels like even just empathetically, there's few things as difficult as that.

55:44.880 --> 55:45.520
It's hard.

55:46.360 --> 55:50.360
I still remember those days, many comics will say this, and I think

55:50.360 --> 55:54.520
Dane Cook was the first person I heard say it publicly that if he ever had to

55:54.520 --> 55:57.560
go back and do it again, like from scratch, doesn't think he could do it.

55:57.840 --> 56:03.520
Doesn't think he could endure the struggle of open mic to, you know,

56:03.880 --> 56:09.480
ultimately to success and the numbers of people that try it and fail versus

56:09.480 --> 56:12.480
try and succeed are off the charts.

56:13.040 --> 56:17.520
I don't know if there's any other art form that has such a low rate of success.

56:18.480 --> 56:20.360
Cause it's psychological, it's torture.

56:20.400 --> 56:21.040
It is torture.

56:21.040 --> 56:22.720
And it's also not something you can learn.

56:23.640 --> 56:24.600
Like, here's the thing.

56:24.600 --> 56:28.920
Like if you, uh, you play guitar, you can learn to play guitar.

56:29.520 --> 56:30.720
Somebody can teach you the chords.

56:30.760 --> 56:33.960
And if you do it and you could, you could do, uh, all along the

56:33.960 --> 56:35.480
watch tower, you could play it.

56:36.640 --> 56:39.120
You can't teach someone how to do comedy.

56:39.560 --> 56:40.960
You think it's your funny or not?

56:41.000 --> 56:44.600
Or can you, can you still figure it out?

56:44.760 --> 56:45.680
Like, can you still learn?

56:45.680 --> 56:46.360
You can figure it out.

56:46.640 --> 56:47.000
Yeah.

56:47.840 --> 56:48.840
Can you start on fun?

56:48.920 --> 56:51.520
Can you start being unfunny and become funny?

56:51.560 --> 56:53.000
Yes, it's possible.

56:53.240 --> 56:54.440
It's not easy though.

56:54.800 --> 56:56.280
You're going to have to eat a lot of shit.

56:56.480 --> 56:58.200
You're going to have to eat a lot of shit and you're going to have to

56:58.200 --> 56:59.920
examine why you're not funny.

57:00.320 --> 57:05.320
And you're going to have to spend a lot of time with uncomfortable thoughts and

57:05.320 --> 57:08.400
try to figure out what it is, like what's missing.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.240
Like, you know, could you edit your stuff and make it better?

57:12.520 --> 57:15.160
It, uh, maybe you need to do drugs.

57:15.200 --> 57:19.040
Maybe you need to get involved in psychedelic drugs and rethink the

57:19.040 --> 57:21.280
way you interface with reality itself.

57:21.640 --> 57:23.480
Maybe you need your heartbroken.

57:23.760 --> 57:25.320
Maybe you need to be in love.

57:25.400 --> 57:27.600
Maybe it's a lot of maybes there.

57:27.640 --> 57:31.440
Like maybe you just need more life experience, but you know, when I started

57:31.440 --> 57:33.480
comedy, I was 21 and I was a moron.

57:33.480 --> 57:35.320
I had no information.

57:35.800 --> 57:39.680
You know, I could do impressions of people and I could talk about sex.

57:40.080 --> 57:43.080
Those are the things that I was interested in back then.

57:43.400 --> 57:45.880
I don't, I mean, if I was talking philosophically, I didn't have a,

57:46.280 --> 57:47.320
I didn't have a philosophy.

57:47.360 --> 57:50.320
I don't have a unique perspective on life.

57:50.320 --> 57:51.520
I hadn't experienced much.

57:52.120 --> 57:56.120
So every time you bomb, it forces you to introspect, to ask questions

57:56.120 --> 57:58.880
of yourself, and then that's how you actually develop a philosophy.

57:59.240 --> 57:59.640
Yeah.

57:59.720 --> 58:00.840
Or what you actually believe.

58:00.880 --> 58:02.920
You learn through doing.

58:03.240 --> 58:05.520
And I think you could say that about podcasting too.

58:06.040 --> 58:10.000
You know, I'm certainly way better at having conversations than I ever was

58:10.000 --> 58:13.400
when I first started doing comedy or excuse me, when I first started doing

58:13.400 --> 58:16.840
podcasts, you learn stick with a kid because one day you'll be able to

58:16.840 --> 58:22.440
interview Donald Trump, you'd be mad enough to handle that conversation.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.120
Um, how hard is it to do?

58:25.120 --> 58:28.560
Cause I've been really curious that, uh, it's been on my bucket list

58:28.600 --> 58:29.440
because I'm terrified.

58:29.600 --> 58:31.160
I want to do everything I'm terrified of.

58:32.120 --> 58:32.480
No.

58:32.560 --> 58:37.040
Well, but I do want to do like one five, five minute, like open mic.

58:37.320 --> 58:38.640
Why don't you do kill Tony?

58:38.840 --> 58:40.200
How hard is it to do five minutes?

58:40.200 --> 58:41.600
Would you say it's hard?

58:42.400 --> 58:46.240
Well, it depends on, you know, how long you've been thinking about doing comedy.

58:46.600 --> 58:50.760
It depends on how you look at things and also depends on your style of comedy.

58:50.760 --> 58:54.320
Like the most difficult style of comedy is like, I think, uh, like Steven

58:54.320 --> 58:57.400
Wright style is probably the most difficult style of comedy, complete

58:57.400 --> 59:01.960
non sequiturs, one subject doesn't lead into the next, there's no flow to it.

59:02.160 --> 59:04.800
It's just, I noticed this, I noticed that.

59:05.120 --> 59:09.760
And then there's this and then there's that and that that's hard to memorize.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.720
And it's really hard to piece together, uh, an hour of non sequiturs.

59:14.880 --> 59:17.280
But it's easier because you can rely on the joke.

59:17.320 --> 59:19.640
It, it sits more with the joke.

59:20.800 --> 59:24.680
Like whether you're funny or not is on the, on, on the actual material versus

59:24.680 --> 59:28.240
like the timing and the, the energy, the dance with the audience, right?

59:28.680 --> 59:32.640
Cause like, if you don't have the raw jokes, like Steven Wright does, or Mitch

59:32.640 --> 59:37.200
Hedberg, um, then you have to, it's all about the delivery.

59:37.320 --> 59:37.840
Yeah.

59:37.840 --> 59:40.720
And yeah, that they either kill or they bomb.

59:41.920 --> 59:42.760
Is it random?

59:42.840 --> 59:44.440
Like, whether they kill or bomb?

59:44.480 --> 59:44.880
Yeah.

59:45.320 --> 59:49.640
Well, I mean, you're essentially a different person every day of your life.

59:49.760 --> 59:53.600
You know, you're similar, but you're more tired.

59:54.080 --> 59:55.120
You're more rested.

59:55.520 --> 59:56.680
You're exhausted.

59:56.960 --> 59:57.960
You're refreshed.

59:58.280 --> 01:00:01.120
You have vitamins and food nourishment in your system.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.840
You just get your heart broken.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.120
You haven't slept in days.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.200
You're a different person all the time.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:12.480
And you go onto that stage, uh, you know, you're in the neighborhood

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.880
of who Lex Fridman is here in the Lex Fridman neighborhood.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.400
Which Lex Fridman am I going to get?

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:17.800
Yeah.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.440
You know, energy levels.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.800
Yeah, it depends.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:21.520
It all depends.

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:25.640
But oh, the other thing with kill Tony is it's videotaped.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:28.200
It's so you eating shit.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.440
It's on there forever.

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:29.920
Forever.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:33.760
The world can see it, but it's one of the most important shows in comedy.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:38.680
It's the most important show in comedy because first of all, it establishes

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:44.800
standup in a sense that like for the open micers, for the people that are

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.520
starting it out, it establishes that the most important thing is to be funny.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.520
Like this is what the art form is all about.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.240
And there's a lot of insecurity attached to that and a lot of fears.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:58.760
And so to alleviate some of those insecurities and fears, people will

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:04.480
decide that the message is more important and they'll pretend that, you

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:11.240
know, like you have to have, like, uh, you have to have, you have to be

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:17.680
socially aware that you have to promote things that are positive in your

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.640
comedy, which is bullshit.

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.520
There are the people that say that they're all bad.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.880
They're all bad at comedy.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.840
And that's where the insecurity is.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.240
It's like, they can't just kill.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.760
So they have to pretend that they're supposed to be socially aware and that

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.840
being socially aware is an important part into society.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.080
Like, let me explain something really clearly.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:40.920
It's not a fucking person on earth who's ever changed their life because of a joke.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.000
That's not what they're there for.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.120
They're there for jokes.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:48.880
The people that say that they say that socially important comedy is the

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:50.440
only comedy that's necessary.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.840
The only comedy that you have to do that is just because they suck.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.040
Yeah, that is it.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:59.000
It's like the cop out is that they can't do the real comedy.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.040
They can't crush.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.960
It's not like someone goes from being, you know, take a, like Shane Gillis, one

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.800
of the best comics up and coming right now.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.320
He's fucking fantastic.

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.760
I can't recommend enough seeing that guy live.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.520
I work with him in Irvine and I hadn't seen like his whole set.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.800
I was crying.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.200
I mean, he's so good.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.400
I heard he's a racist.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.680
So I haven't listened to any of his material.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.800
No, he's so good.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:28.880
And his comedy is just all just trying to be as funny as possible.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.720
There's not a chance in hell that guy's just going to go woke and he's just

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:38.080
going to start promoting some sort of, you know, socially conscious agenda.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.600
That's, you know, facetious and just a bunch of nonsense that he's trying to

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.800
elevate his own personal brand and virtue signal.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.760
That's not going to happen.

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:53.200
The thing about Kill Tony is in that because you only have one minute and

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.600
because it's live and because you don't want Tony shitting on you, everybody else

01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:00.720
shitting on everybody's just gearing up to try to be as funny as possible.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:07.680
And no one cares if you are gay or straight or Asian or black or trans or

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.800
non-binary, nobody gives a fuck.

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.200
Are you funny?

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.000
If you're funny, you're in and everybody loves you.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.800
You could be 80, you could be 20.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.400
Nobody gives a shit.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:21.400
You could be a woman or a man or ambiguous.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.920
Nobody fucking cares.

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:23.880
Are you funny?

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:28.800
And that's the most important thing for a community of comedy to really promote

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.800
comedy, just funny, just be funny.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:37.280
And so in that sense, Kill Tony is a real cornerstone of comedy.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.000
It's a reminder of what comedy is supposed to be.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:39.280
Yeah.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:45.640
That said, even the funniest stuff has underneath it some wisdom that comes out

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.880
of it, but that's not the primary goal of it.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:48.200
Yeah.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.240
I mean, it might be inspiring and fun.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.960
Oh, Tim Dillon's a great example of that.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:52.240
Yeah.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:57.280
He's got some amazing insights in his comedy, but it's still, it's all about

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.160
fucking comedy.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.440
It's all about the funny.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.600
Yeah, it's all of the funny.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.360
He's got, he's the best at doing that, especially in a podcast form, but weaving

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:11.760
like really important points in with hilarious, you know, obviously just, you

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.760
know, just jokes.

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:21.640
Let me ask you, speaking of Tim Dillon, a chaotic fucked up individual, can we go

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.920
to your childhood real quick?

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.240
A brief stroll.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:31.040
So your mom and dad split up when you were five from a, from a younging

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:35.560
perspective, if you look at your subconscious, what impact do you think

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:40.400
that had on you in forming who you are as a man, as a human being?

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:45.000
Well, at the time I thought that my father was like a hero.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:46.880
You know, he was my dad.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.280
I think every kid thinks like that about his dad.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.400
His dad is like, your dad's your protector.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.560
Your dad is like the coolest guy in the world.

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:55.520
That's what you like.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:56.520
Yeah.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:59.560
Everybody wants to be like their dad, especially if your dad is like an

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.640
imposing figure.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:04.880
I remember one time me and my cousin got in a fight over nothing.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:10.000
It was like over, uh, who's tougher, King Kong or Godzilla over nothing.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.320
That's an important, but yeah, he said actual fight, actual.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.560
Oh, I punched him in the face.

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.000
And, um, uh, this is when you were like five.

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:19.440
Yeah.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:19.840
Yeah.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.760
And so which side were you on?

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:22.360
Uh, King Kong.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:22.800
Okay.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:23.960
I was wrong.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.920
Godzilla looks like way bigger.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:26.360
Yeah.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:30.080
Godzilla is 500 feet tall and he shoots fire out of his mouth.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:30.720
Yeah.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:31.320
Yeah.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:31.920
Are you sure?

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.920
I mean, there's, there's an argument to be made.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.080
It's not all about size, right?

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.720
No, there's no argument to be made 500 feet tall.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.920
Versus 50 feet tall.

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.840
One's a gigantic dinosaur.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:46.480
One is a stupid monkey who gets shot down by a plane.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:49.680
You don't think you can kill Godzilla back.

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.600
No, you can't kill, kill Godzilla with a plane.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.040
Like that shit wouldn't work in Godzilla killed King Kong.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:02.120
Um, King Kong and the new movies kept growing.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.040
It's getting bigger and bigger.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:03.160
Yeah.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.760
Got to the point where he's as big as Godzilla.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.840
It just feels like King Kong is stronger.

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:08.960
Stop.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.440
Backtake, backtake, immediate backtake.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.080
You don't think there's a backtake.

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:19.640
There's a different, if he's the same size, human weapons and two

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.360
animals going at it of a different size.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:25.000
You don't think there's in the jungle, a smaller animal could take on a bigger

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:30.600
animal, like a monkey versus a, let's see, a lion monkey versus a bear.

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:31.640
What?

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.560
Who wins a monkey versus not a monkey, not a monkey.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.800
What's the strongest, um, ape, uh, no, but gorilla seat.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:39.200
Okay.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.600
Gorilla can't do backtakes.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:44.360
I'm thinking of like a smaller, you know what I'm saying?

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:45.920
Cause in Jiu-Jitsu, you see this all the time.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.120
Do you remember that scene in Talladega Nights?

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:52.320
Do you know Talladega Nights where the little boy's talking to his grandpa?

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.520
I'll be all over you like a spider monkey.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:55.800
Exactly.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.400
Spider monkey.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.040
I was thinking, all right, there's some animals.

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.200
Like, here's a better example, a Wolverine.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.720
Wolverines chase wolves and bears off of their kills.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:06.760
And they're not very big at all.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.560
They're just so ferocious.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.160
And they're so durable.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.000
Like, it's very hard to kill a Wolverine.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:12.680
Yeah.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:18.320
And there's videos of like cats, like not actual cats, like domestic cats or, uh,

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:21.880
or domestic dogs starting shit with much larger animals.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:22.360
Yeah.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.920
And if they're ferocious enough.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.280
Well, pit bulls are a great example of that.

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:30.760
Pit bulls are small, like real game bred pit bulls are like 35, 45 pounds

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.720
and they'll kill much larger dogs.

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:36.320
Anyway, you were on, on King Kong's side.

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:36.600
Yeah.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:37.720
So shit out of your cousin.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:41.640
I remember he said to me, uh, like I thought it was in like real trouble.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:45.560
Cause I remember my cousin's mom was yelling at me and it was like, you

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.120
monster, all this crazy shit.

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:53.080
So, um, my dad got me alone and he said, tell me what happened.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:59.800
And I told him, you know, we got in a fight, we were arguing or King Kong

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:04.240
and Godzilla, and, uh, I punched him in the face and he goes, did you cry?

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.040
I go, no, he goes, good.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:06.840
Don't ever cry.

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:11.320
And I remember that like, Whoa.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:12.320
Okay.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.880
And I remember thinking, all right, I'm just going to start punching people.

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:19.720
Because like, obviously my dad thinks it's a good idea.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:25.560
If I go running around punching people, as long as I don't cry, like it, I

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:31.240
remember certain things about, you know, and also like, this is it again, like

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:37.520
we're talking about watching Lenny Bruce in getting a timeline of what the world

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:42.800
was like back then, this was a different world, you know, in 1970, this would

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:48.200
been 1972, it's a different world back then, man, like a really different world.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.320
It's some of that.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:53.160
So Carl Jung talked about the shadow.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:59.000
It's the unconscious where you have dark stuff and oftentimes you use it to

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.120
project their stuff that you're very self-critical about yourself, but

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:07.080
because it's in your unconscious, you use it to project onto others.

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:09.080
You see it as flaws in others.

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:13.760
And that's a good way to like, whatever, um, because, uh, I quote, like

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:18.160
everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:22.960
So that's, that's a nice way to investigate yourself, like

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.160
something that pisses you off.

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:28.600
You start asking questions of your mind and that's how you bring it to the surface.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:33.960
But anyway, from that, those are formative years from that time.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:36.720
Is there still stuff in your unconscious you think you haven't examined?

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.560
Some dark shit.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:39.560
I don't think so.

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:45.880
I don't, I'm not aware if it is, cause I've looked, you know, like if someone

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:50.520
gets, you know, someone says, uh, you know, I, I left something over your house.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.320
Like, where'd you leave it?

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:51.800
I don't know.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.120
Like, all right, I'll go look.

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:53.640
Yeah.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.720
I get a, get a real thorough look, but I'm pretty sure, pretty sure it's not there.

01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:58.160
Yeah.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:58.600
Yeah.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.000
I don't know.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:09:59.920
I think I've looked.

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:05.600
I mean, um, it certainly had an, I think the positive effect also was compounded

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:11.320
by the fact that when my mother married, my stepdad, who's a great guy, who was

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:14.680
a hippie, very different, we moved around a lot.

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:19.640
And so the bad thing about that was I didn't really develop long-term friends.

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.760
The good thing about that was that I was forced to develop my

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:27.520
own opinions about things instead of adopting an opinion of the neighborhood

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:32.760
and the group about anything, I was forced to form my own thoughts and

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.280
opinions about almost everything.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.240
And so it made me much more of an independent thinker.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:45.320
So that on top of the fact that, you know, losing, you know, my quote unquote

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:50.920
hero very early on, and then having to form my own opinions about things, it

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:57.160
left me with a very, uh, very independent streak, you know, in terms of, and, and

01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.440
if I hadn't done the things that I got interested in martial arts and then, and

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:05.400
then comedy, if I hadn't gotten interested in those things, I would have

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:10.720
been fucked because I was just too independent for normal jobs.

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:12.840
I was too independent for school.

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.880
I just didn't want to listen to people.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.560
I was too feral.

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.760
I just didn't want to, didn't want to sit still.

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:23.760
I, if I was with the wrong parents, especially today, I most

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.040
certainly would have been medicated.

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:27.400
Yeah.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.920
There's so many possible trajectories.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:32.200
You can imagine where you would have not been the person you are today.

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:32.760
Oh yeah.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:38.240
This is probably one of the best you're living this, you know, the, this

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.560
particular storyline you're living through is, was one of the better ones.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.760
This timeline is as good as it gets for someone like me.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:50.720
Is there advice you can give to people, to young, to young kids that are living

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:55.520
through a shitty situation of any sort of tough life, find a thing you like.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.120
Try to find a thing that you really enjoy.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.640
Try to find a thing that you're passionate about, like an activity.

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.000
Yes.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.640
For me early on, it was drawing.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.080
It was illustrations.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.280
It was a comic books.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.840
I wanted to be a comic book illustrator.

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:13.840
And then it went from a comic book drawing and illustrations to martial arts.

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:18.320
So, but it was just another thing that I was very, very passionate about.

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:25.240
And that was my vehicle out of my dilemma.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:31.400
That was my vehicle out of my, my own anxiety and trauma and my own issues

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:38.000
and insecurities and find something, find a thing that you genuinely enjoy.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.760
Because getting good at things you genuinely enjoy is extremely

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:47.600
beneficial for young people because it lets you know that.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.440
Like everybody thinks they're a loser.

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:53.360
Every young person thinks they're a loser, at least a young person

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.520
in the situation I was at.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.000
Like, I didn't know I wasn't a loser until I started winning,

01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.800
until I started doing martial arts.

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:04.440
Martial arts taught me that like I could get better at stuff, that it wasn't,

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.600
I wasn't really a loser.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:11.120
I just was someone who was like in a fucked up situation, but you could channel

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:15.440
all that energy that you have as a young person into something and get better at

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:15.520
it.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.160
And then all of a sudden people admired me.

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:18.600
I was like, this is crazy.

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:24.720
So I went from being someone who was incredibly insecure and basically a

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:28.840
failure to someone who was really successful at this one thing that was

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:31.320
very dangerous, that other people were scared of.

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:38.840
And that gave me immense confidence and also a real understanding of the direct

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.240
correlation between hard work and success.

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:47.320
And a kind of understanding that you're not a loser, that there is some diamond

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:47.840
in the rough.

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:48.080
Yeah.

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:51.200
And also an understanding that you can't listen to people because even my parents

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.640
didn't want me to do martial arts.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.120
They didn't want me to fight.

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:55.560
They didn't want me to just stand up.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:02.160
There's like, you have to understand like who you are and then in the face of

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:10.880
other people's either criticism or, you know, lack of faith in your ability to

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:14.720
succeed, you push through and there's great benefit in that.

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.520
And then you realize that you can kind of apply that to other things in life.

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.240
You can apply that to critics.

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:22.840
You can apply that to social media commentators.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.560
You can apply that to a lot of things.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:25.760
Okay.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:29.800
What about young people in their fifties?

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.320
Can you give advice to like, imagine you're sitting, you're sitting back

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:38.840
probably still here in Texas in your nineties, looking back, what advice would

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:40.840
that guy give to you today?

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:48.800
Or like people, you know, people that have done some shit in their fifties, you've

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.120
gone through a hell of a life.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:53.720
There's potentially some incentive to settle down.

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.880
You got a great family to relax.

01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:02.680
Um, but maybe there's some incentive to still do epic shit, still be David Goggins

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.480
running in the middle of the desert, screaming shit into a camera.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:08.320
If you're David Goggins, you have to be David Goggins.

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:13.560
I don't think there's a path for that guy that exists at this stage of his

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.040
life, other than that.

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.200
Do you think he'll be 70 and still screaming?

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.200
Yes.

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:18.600
Okay.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:21.520
A hundred percent, a hundred percent.

01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:26.320
If, if David and I are alive, we're both 70.

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:29.200
He's going to call me up and say, stay hard motherfucker.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Guaranteed guaranteed.

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.760
So lean into whatever the fuck you are at this point.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:38.200
Well, if you're enjoying it, but if you're not enjoying it, rethink

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.480
your life, try to figure out why you're, why you're not enjoying it.

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.560
You still think it's possible to shift things in your fifties?

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:45.000
Yeah.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.960
If you're alive, you can get better.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:48.280
No matter what.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:48.760
Yeah.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.200
No matter what, if you're alive, you can shift things.

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.840
I mean, if you're 90 years old and you know, you have a month to live, you

01:15:54.840 --> 01:16:00.080
can apologize for the things you think you did wrong and maybe sort of reconcile

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:03.960
and shape relationships that you have with the people that around you better so

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.440
that they, they feel differently about you after you're gone.

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:07.400
Yeah.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:11.240
I always love people in their seventies who are like, like getting back into

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:12.400
dating or something like that.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:12.920
Yeah.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.680
I was watching a video about a woman who's in her sixties.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:16.840
It just started powerlifting.

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:17.880
Nice.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:18.680
Yeah.

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:19.640
And same with jujitsu.

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:24.800
You see people get into jujitsu, a white belt, a white belt that's like 70.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:25.040
Yeah.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:25.480
Yeah.

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:25.960
Yeah.

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:26.760
Yeah.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:34.400
There's a lot of, if you're alive, you can get better at stuff and I don't

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:41.000
think people are happy if they don't have puzzles and complex tasks and things

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.680
that are interesting to them, whether it's an art project or whether it's a

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:48.920
learning something completely new, like standup comedy, like doing things that

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:57.480
are difficult is it's as much of a nourishment of the mind as food is a

01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:58.720
nourishment of the body.

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:06.280
I think you need things that, that are puzzling to you where you have to find

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:12.240
your own human potential in the difficulty of the task and, and work

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:17.000
your way through things, at least for me, for me, I mean, I can only speak for me

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.920
because I'm the only, I'm the only life that I've ever lived that I'm aware of.

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:25.880
And in my life that has been a 100% constant.

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.760
I, I am a very happy person and I have never had a moment where I'm

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.160
not doing difficult shit.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:31.960
Yeah.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:32.600
Ever.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:37.120
Uh, what matters most is how well you walk through the fires.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.280
You just keep starting fires for yourself to walk through.

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.840
Well, they don't necessarily have to be fires, right?

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.440
Because fires are like kind of out of control.

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:50.360
Luke warm, uh, tasks, the surfaces, tasks, give yourself something, an

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:55.680
arduous, difficult task where you're challenged, challenged.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.480
Mentally and challenged physically.

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:00.960
One of the great things about being challenged physically is it's also mental.

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:04.120
The people that don't understand that have never really been challenged

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:07.520
physically, people that think that physical challenges are just like,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.720
just physical, it's just brute grunt work.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.040
It's not, it's a emotional intelligence.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:21.320
It's understanding your desire to quit and, you know, conquering your inner bitch.

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:24.320
All that stuff is, it's mental.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.120
It's playing out inside your head.

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.920
And there's a mental strength that you acquire from that, that you can apply

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:36.240
to intellectual pursuits and the, the people that don't think that, or the

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:38.480
people that haven't attempted them.

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:46.120
And there's an arrogance to people that only pursue intellectual exercises, only

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.720
pursue intellectual things and don't pursue anything physical, that the

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:54.000
physical stuff is based, it's grunt work, it's primal, it's not necessary.

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:55.920
I don't think that's accurate.

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:59.200
I don't think that there look, I mean, obviously there's people like Stephen

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:03.280
Hawking's who have no opportunity to do anything physical, right?

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:07.600
His physical dilemma is keeping us or was keeping his heart beating.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:13.360
But for most people, I think you can really benefit from physical struggle

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:16.040
and you benefit from it in a mental way.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.560
And I think that is overlooked.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:24.560
That's unfortunately overlooked by academics and intellectuals who they

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:27.680
make excuses for why they're fat and lazy or scrawny.

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:32.840
Well, they don't need to be, it's not even about the fat or all of that.

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:36.680
It's like, literally there's something about the physical challenge that's

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:39.520
really good for you, especially if you're academic, especially if you

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:43.120
do intellectual types though, there's this great roboticist at MIT, Russ

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:47.320
Tedrick, he runs barefoot to and from MIT every day.

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:48.240
I love it.

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:52.680
Like seven, seven to 10 miles each way barefoot barefoot.

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:56.000
Well, he's, uh, he studies legged locomotion, legged robots.

01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.440
So for him, it's also interesting how the human body moves.

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.720
He sees the beauty in all of, in all movement.

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:06.880
What do his feet look like, you know, calloused destroyed, right?

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.160
No, just calloused.

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:08.840
They're nice.

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:14.000
They're, they, they form a nice, it's not like I gave him a foot massage, but, but

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.320
I mean, they, they look, uh, and I don't have a foot fetish, so I don't, uh, I'm

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:22.160
not able to correctly invest, um, evaluate another man's feet.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:25.480
I apologize for this, but they, uh, they don't look fucked up.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.400
Does he run on concrete?

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:28.120
Yeah.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.560
He runs all surfaces.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
And he does everything completely barefoot.

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.440
Uh, the, the running part at work.

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:38.240
Oh, so one of the things he has to do is fit into society, which means

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.120
he has to change clothes and appear normal.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:40.720
Right.

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.400
So does he wear like a zero shoes?

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.800
You know, those type shoes?

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:49.640
No, because that's like very hippie, wokey type of thing.

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:54.040
No, like he doesn't, he's barefoot when he's running and then he wears

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:56.720
like normal looking stuff, like dress shoes.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:59.080
How did he work his way up to running barefoot?

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:05.680
Uh, so he was significantly overweight and his advisor, uh, this, this, this

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:11.880
other, uh, famous person at MIT who was a roboticist took his own life and that

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.960
made him, uh, that made Russ face his own mortality.

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:19.880
I think, I mean, the, you start to ask big questions about your wellbeing,

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:22.360
like, holy shit, that's where I can end at any moment.

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:27.160
And so he started taking his sort of physical wellbeing seriously.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:32.040
But as a result of that, not that he, that he'd become like shredded, but

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:40.040
he's also discovered the intellectual value, uh, the humbling value of physical

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.880
exercise, he's not preachy about it all.

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:46.400
I don't think, I actually rarely hear him advise it to anyone.

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:51.240
He just does it as a, as a, almost like meditation or something like that.

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:54.560
It's, it's definitely a form of meditation and you can attest to that, right?

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.800
You do quite a bit of running.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:02.800
There's a thing about a, you kind of almost like a mantra gets

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.480
formed and you get into it.

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:08.800
No, it's great here in the Austin heat, a hundred degree weather that tests you.

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:10.360
You know what I love to do outside?

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:11.560
Pull sleds.

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:13.000
That's my thing.

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:16.080
I love to pull sleds outside in the heat.

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:17.640
Yeah, today.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:18.160
Yeah.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.120
Yeah, I love it.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:22.160
Uh, so you're also, your wife is incredible.

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.120
You're in a relationship.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:25.840
What, uh, and you're married, you have a great family.

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:30.320
What advice would you give, uh, to me and tell others like me who are dumb

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:33.880
fucks and, and I have not found a, well, you're a great guy.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.360
So this definitely doesn't necessarily apply to you, but be someone who someone

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.360
would want to be in a relationship with.

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:44.280
There's a lot of people out there that want a great partner.

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:48.040
They want someone in a relationship, but why would someone want to

01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:49.080
be in a relationship with you?

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:51.240
You know, maybe you, you bicker a lot.

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.640
Maybe you're jealous.

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:55.280
Maybe you, uh, maybe you lie.

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:59.400
Maybe you, you know, maybe you're cruel.

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:02.480
Maybe you're, you don't have a sense of humor.

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:04.880
Maybe you're, you know, you're not kind.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:11.000
Like what is, what is it about you that people would not enjoy being around

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.080
or the people avoid fix that.

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:15.800
Well, this, this applies to me as well.

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:17.800
Like you said something with campaigns.

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:22.240
One of the things you admire is the, the discipline takes to sort of juggle

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.040
so many things and just successfully.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.800
I'm not sure I'm very good at that.

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:30.000
So juggling all this hard work and then also a relationship, also

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.440
a relationship, also family, all because of priorities.

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:35.240
I mean, that requires having your shit together.

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:35.840
It does.

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:39.000
It's a different thing, but it's also, you got to find the right person.

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.120
There's a lot of people who sell for, they settle for sexy.

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:46.040
They settle for hot for settle for the wrong person.

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:48.000
Like you can get hot and nice.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.320
They're out there, but don't get hot and mean.

01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:53.160
Hot means not fun.

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.120
Then you get Amber hurt.

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:54.760
Yeah.

01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.560
You know, and then you get hot dry.

01:23:56.560 --> 01:23:56.960
Yeah.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:57.400
Yeah.

01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:57.840
Yeah.

01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:01.440
You can be deceived by perfect symmetry.

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:04.600
So you don't think it's a good idea to record your partner?

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.520
I think you should record all conversations.

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:08.200
The CIA is doing it.

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.560
No matter what, I assume that every conversation I have is recorded

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:12.680
because I'm pretty sure it is.

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.440
Even when we had dinner with Alex Jones, he was recording.

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:16.840
Yeah.

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:17.800
I still remember that.

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:19.760
Oh, I didn't know.

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:20.720
They'll know that was recording.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:24.720
He might, you know, it'd be funny if he is the CIA.

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:31.200
He could be, could be, but that's my advice about relationships is be somebody.

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:38.200
And then also like find someone who you can grow with, right?

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:42.920
You don't want to be with someone who doesn't share your, uh, your value.

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:45.640
Someone, you don't want to be with someone who makes excuses.

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:49.560
You don't want to be with someone who's lazy or who's spiteful.

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.800
You want to be with someone who's like genuinely kind.

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.400
That's one of the things that I really love about my wife.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.440
And she's very smart and she works hard.

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.520
She's like, she's a dedicated, disciplined person.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.400
But she's also really nice.

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.360
That's one of the things I liked the most about her.

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:05.720
She's so nice.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.120
She's always smiling.

01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.800
And that energy is great.

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:11.040
Yeah.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.080
I mean, you've seen us together.

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:12.400
Yeah.

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.440
You've hung around with us.

01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:14.080
She's fun.

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:14.920
Yeah.

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:15.720
She's a lot of fun.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:16.240
Yeah.

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:18.560
She makes you just feel great to be alive.

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:19.960
It's good to have people like that around you.

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.000
She's happy.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.360
She's a happy person.

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:23.440
She's happy to be around.

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:27.560
That's the kind of people that you could have in your life as friends and as

01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:31.840
co-workers and as lovers and wives and husbands, you can find those people.

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:32.720
They're real.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:35.120
And when you find those people, your life is better.

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:40.520
Like to have a good tribe is very important to have a good tribe of people.

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:44.040
You know, and I think if there's anything that I'm very, very fortunate about,

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.480
it's the people that I'm around.

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.720
I have very good friends and one of which is you.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:56.880
It's so valuable to have quality people around you because it makes you want to

01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.560
do better because you admire the hard work that these people put in, like

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:07.560
Mike Kam Haines or Goggins or many of my friends and people that are generous

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:12.960
and people that are curious and people that are honest, they inspire you to do

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:15.720
the same and it's extremely valuable.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.560
It's one of the most, most valuable things is to surround yourself with

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:25.240
positive, healthy, friendly, generous people.

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.880
That's why I cut out Tim Dillon for my life.

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:28.800
I broke up with him.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:29.760
He's not married.

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:30.840
No, it's over.

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:32.200
It's none of those things.

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:40.120
The Texas nonstop, the nonstop conspiracy theories, the nonstop mocking of, of my

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:45.400
Eastern European origins is just not healthy for me.

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:51.480
Um, plus he's physically abusive and towering figure, both emotion, physically.

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:53.360
No, I love him.

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:53.720
Okay.

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:58.920
If he worked out, he would be a house, a brick house, a large frame, you know?

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:03.160
So if I interview Putin, what should I ask him?

01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:04.160
How's the cancer?

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:05.840
How's it doing buddy?

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.920
That's question number one in Russian.

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.120
Do you think he has cancer?

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.320
I don't think so.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.200
The narrative is terrifying, right?

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.640
Dictator of the largest nuclear arsenal in the world who also has cancer and

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.640
he just invaded a sovereign country.

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:25.160
That's a terrifying narrative because that's what we're all afraid of.

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:29.720
Someone who has nothing to lose, who just decides to let loose a nuke.

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:35.560
Well, I do think maybe it's projecting, but if I had cancer or if you think about

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:39.600
leaders that have cancer, you're facing your own mortality, I would think you'd

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:45.480
be more focused on his legacy and the dropping nuclear bomb is not good for

01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:46.040
legacy.

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:49.960
I, I, I do believe he wants to be remembered as a great leader, as a lot of

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:52.400
leaders do, as a lot of even dictators do.

01:27:52.600 --> 01:28:01.000
And I think he wants to figure out a way to pull out a win so he can say that

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:07.160
whatever this thing was, whatever this invasion was, was good for Russia, was

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:08.080
good for the nation.

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:11.160
He ultimately made it a greater nation than it was before.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:15.200
And perhaps he could justify an escalation of war to be that.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:15.920
Hmm.

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:21.360
But I don't, um, and it's just the cancer thing concerns me so much because it's

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:26.640
been so often part of this propaganda that's been told about Putin that he's

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:27.080
sick.

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:31.840
I don't know why that it's always people kind of wonder that a lot about,

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:35.440
especially dictators, but you had that even like with Hillary Clinton and

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:39.880
obviously with Biden, that narrative is stickier.

01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:44.760
So for some people, that narrative is transparent and obvious, but the degree

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:48.280
of it is a question with Biden as it is with, with, with everyone.

01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:50.760
Like what's, you know, how healthy is this leader?

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:54.400
That's a question people always, they were doing that about Trump too.

01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:01.080
Um, the thing about Putin though is like his, uh, appearance is altered where he

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.440
looks very bloated.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:07.120
His body doesn't look much bigger, but his face looks like puffy and swollen.

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:15.040
I had a friend, uh, who had a sarcoidosis and they prescribed prednisone, which is

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:16.240
a type of a steroid.

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:20.320
And one of the things that would happen when he was on it is he would, his face

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.440
would get really big.

01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:28.360
It was like, he would blow up like a swell up and maintain a lot of water and

01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:32.920
inflammation and, uh, that's what it looks like when I'm looking at food.

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:36.520
So actually, like, if you're sitting with him, one question is about health.

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:40.160
That's, has, has, has, has Biden been asked that kind of question?

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.480
No, like without mockery.

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:46.200
Without any of that Fox news, like the mainstream media treats him with kid

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:48.600
gloves in a way that I've never seen.

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:53.760
I mean, it's, it's so obvious there's something horribly wrong with

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.240
his cognitive function.

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.160
Well, I had to push back.

01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.000
I don't know if it's horribly wrong.

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:00.280
You don't think it's hardly wrong.

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:04.680
I think it's no, I think there's uncertainty to which degree is wrong.

01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:09.240
I would love to, there to be a serious like conversation about with him.

01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:14.720
In fact, I actually have to now look because of course Fox news will mock his

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:18.600
like decree declining mental health.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.640
And then I would love like sort of an objective discussion.

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:23.640
Are you aware of this?

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:26.880
Are you, uh, like, what are you putting in place?

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.040
Are you yourself?

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:34.400
Cause if I was a person with a declining mental abilities, like you have to start,

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:37.320
um, you have to start thinking about that kind of stuff.

01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:40.040
Like who is around you, who are the advisors?

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:43.360
What if you start, stop being able to see the world clearly?

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:43.840
Yeah.

01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:46.000
I would be transparent about that kind of stuff.

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:50.200
Well, you would be, but you're also would never be a politician because

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:51.240
you're too fucking honest.

01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:55.520
Well, yeah, but actually from a conversation perspective, it would be nice

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:59.400
if that kind of discussion was that it would be, but all jokes aside with

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:03.920
Putin, um, I would ask questions about

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:09.240
democracy versus what they have.

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:14.080
I mean, without, without any disparaging descriptions of what is

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:18.360
going on over in Russia, it's clearly not a democracy.

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:26.160
Um, it's they, I mean, the way he has it set up, the elections are a joke.

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:27.080
He's

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.200
so he would push back.

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:29.880
That's not clearly not a democracy.

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:31.040
He is still very popular.

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:34.480
So majority of people are huge supporters of Putin inside Russia.

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:38.680
The, he would, the, the people that push back against that would say that

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:42.800
that's because any serious opposition is pushed out of the country.

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:43.400
Yeah.

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:45.200
So like his competition murdered.

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:45.920
Yeah.

01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.560
But yes, that's a really, really good question.

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.480
The value of dictatorships.

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:56.240
One of the things about the United States that's fascinating to me is that every

01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:00.040
four years, unless it's a, it's four to eight years, right.

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:04.720
Someone does two terms, but every four years there's an opportunity for someone

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:09.360
to be new and completely inexperienced at the most difficult job in the world.

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:11.960
Which is ridiculous.

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:17.480
So the interesting thing is it actually makes sense after eight years.

01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:19.040
You've gained the wisdom.

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.640
You would actually be a pretty good leader to keep going.

01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:21.960
Yeah.

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:25.840
But there is some problem where you, the power gets started getting to your head.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:26.360
Yeah.

01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:31.680
And so like from Putin's perspective, I think he genuinely wants the best for Russia.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.720
I don't think he's lost his mind in terms of like, it's all about greed and so on.

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:38.120
Same as Stalin.

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:42.840
I think Stalin until the end of his days, wanted the best for the Soviet Union.

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:47.320
So it's not like you become, I, Hitler, I think lost his mind during the war, like

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.400
where it was like, he wasn't seen clearly at all.

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:55.280
What Putin believes is that he is actually the best person to bring out the best.

01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:57.000
For his country.

01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:03.520
Now the problem is maybe refreshing the leader is in fact, in the long term, the

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:07.240
best thing versus every leader believes they know what's best for the country.

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:08.960
Point is to keep refreshing it.

01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:11.920
Well, and that's the case for democracy.

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:17.200
That's the case for the system we have that creates a natural, maybe

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.440
emergent balance of power.

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:23.840
I think it makes it evident that there is no clear cut real right way to do it.

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:29.960
And that if you had the perfect person in having them for 12, 20 years would be

01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:35.680
amazing if you had a perfect benevolent leader who clearly only cared about the

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:40.520
people was doing their best and striving hard and got great satisfaction in

01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:46.080
knowing that he is a dedicated civil servant that only wants to lead the

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:51.040
country in a way that's going to benefit the most people in the most profound way.

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:56.160
Um, but we have a dirty political system.

01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:59.920
It's completely corrupted by money, completely corrupted by influence.

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:05.680
Um, the fact that, you know, the lobbyists, I mean, there's an

01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:07.840
area outside of Washington, DC.

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:11.000
It's one of the richest areas in the country and it's where the lobbyists live.

01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.120
There's so much money involved in being a lobbyist.

01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:19.480
There's so much money involved in special interest groups and how much of an

01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:25.160
impact they have on who gets elected and what decisions get made once that

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:26.040
person gets elected.

01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:27.320
We know this, right?

01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:29.240
We know it's not for the people, by the people.

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:30.560
It's just not what it is.

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:33.600
I mean, this country is an experiment in self-government.

01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:39.480
And if we could do it all over again, I would say the most important thing is to

01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:45.760
have laws in place to keep money out of politics and to make it a heinous crime

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:54.840
for someone to influence laws and, and policy based entirely on the amount of

01:34:54.840 --> 01:35:03.320
profit it could generate for a party or for a company that is investing in a

01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:07.960
candidate that's fucking incredibly dangerous and it's corrupt and that

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.320
corruption has been accepted.

01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:13.360
We've just accepted that it's this corruption exists, you know?

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:14.840
Last question.

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:18.320
If Putin asks to see this watch, what do I tell him?

01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:21.720
Well, would you give it, what should I, should I let him see it?

01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:23.680
Cause we know what happens with the Superbowl ring.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.680
I think a Superbowl ring is unique.

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:31.160
He could buy a watch like that pretty easy, you know, but this particular

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.280
isn't that a power move?

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:33.600
Yeah.

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:36.720
But this is the watch you gave me as a story.

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:37.360
Yes.

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:38.760
I'll probably share it with him.

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:40.760
The story.

01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.960
And then maybe you go look and I see this watch.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:43.320
Yeah.

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:45.280
And then he puts it on and says, thank you.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:45.920
Do you say no?

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:47.800
Uh, you go like this.

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:48.680
Yeah, there it is, bro.

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:51.880
Bro, so many words.

01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:54.240
I'm going to have to find translations, buddy, bro.

01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:56.640
Um, I guess bro's brother.

01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.760
I mean, if he takes your watch, I'll buy you another one.

01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:01.200
If Putin steals it, keep them going.

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:04.560
I just, I'll just give you the same exact watch.

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:06.600
Well, first of all, thank you for this.

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:09.880
I really wanted to talk to you.

01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:16.680
Cause, um, in, in a couple of days of leaving to Ukraine and Russia, and I hope

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:21.240
I'll be back in one piece and drink whiskey with you once again.

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.440
And yeah, I hope so too.

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:24.360
I'm nervous about you going over there.

01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:29.440
You know, I know journalists have been killed now, but they don't know Jiu-Jitsu.

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:33.520
No, I think it'll be, it'll be okay.

01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:36.160
And I think there's certain things you do in life that just kind of your

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:38.480
heart pulls towards that so much.

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:39.680
What's your objective over there?

01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:43.480
I'm not somebody who thinks about objectives clearly.

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.600
It's just something about me says, uh, I need to go there.

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:53.800
Uh, but the, to put in loose words is to, um, to try to understand

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.240
what that world is now.

01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:59.600
So I remember what it was years ago when I was there.

01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:05.480
I know my family, I know the generations of family that was there on that land

01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:12.040
in Ukraine and in Russia and the soul of the people, um, the love that's there,

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:13.400
the beauty of the culture.

01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:18.280
And I want to see what it is today and what this war has created, uh, both

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:21.920
the anger and the love and the people and just hear them out and just talk to them.

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:25.920
No recordings, none of that, maybe a little here and there, but mostly

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:28.400
just for me and to see, I don't know.

01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:33.480
This sometimes it's just, it, something pulls you, uh, to, to a place.

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:39.920
And I also, because I'm able to speak Russian and some Ukrainian, I do want

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:44.840
to try to have these, a couple of the political leaders involved, talk to them.

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:46.800
And I have all the right connections.

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:51.080
Everybody has said, yes, of course, you don't know the likelihood it finally

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:54.240
happens, but I want to at least have that possibility there.

01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:57.240
Sometimes you have to go to a place to really understand it.

01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:58.280
You can't just read about it.

01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:00.200
You can't just talk to the people that are living there.

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:02.000
You have to be there.

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:04.080
And I've never been in a war zone.

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:14.280
I've never been in a land that's been, uh, damaged and, um, wiped by the

01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:19.360
weapons of war, and I just want to feel that because so much of that land is, I

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:24.560
remember, you know, I remember when everything was flourishing, um, yes,

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:28.840
corruption, all those kinds of things, but people were there and the culture

01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:30.360
was flourishing and people were happy.

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.040
There was lots of struggle, but they were happy.

01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:34.520
And now people are extremely angry.

01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:36.600
There's hate in the air on all sides.

01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:38.200
I want to, I want to see that.

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:39.360
I want to understand.

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.680
Sometimes it just pulls you and you have to go.

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:45.680
So it doesn't make any sense perhaps, but you just got to do it.

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:49.200
What's the timeline of when I'm how long?

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:50.600
Not one way.

01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:52.440
I don't really plan.

01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:53.360
Wow.

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:54.160
Yeah.

01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:57.520
So I'm hoping, hoping back in, in a month.

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:07.000
Um, but also not, uh, just to clarify, I'm not somebody who seeks risk and, um,

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:10.640
like you're somebody who seems to be terrified of bears and sharks.

01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:14.520
So you don't like, so why go swim out?

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:15.320
Why go surfing?

01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:16.720
Why go swim out in the ocean?

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:19.960
So I'm somebody that's the same probably with sharks too.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.320
I'm not taking unnecessary risk, but certain things that just mean a

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:25.560
lot to you, you take the risk.

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:32.280
And so a little bit of risk willing to take to, to, uh, to discover

01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:36.480
something about myself, honestly, it's probably what it all boils down to.

01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:40.720
Try to understand myself because so much of my me is from that place.

01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:45.840
Well, this is the beautiful thing about America is it's like stitches

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.400
together all these different cultures.

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:48.760
Everybody came from somewhere else.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:49.400
Yeah.

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:54.560
And you try to understand in order for me to be a good American, I need to

01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:58.480
understand who I was, where I came from.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:05.520
And that's, um, nothing reveals the spirit of a people better than war.

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.960
It's like, there's something about this conflict.

01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:12.720
That's really, uh, cuts all the bullshit.

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:14.600
This is who we are.

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.240
This is who we are as a people.

01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:18.440
So I want to, I want to see it.

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:19.280
I want to understand.

01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:23.280
And I, like I said, when I come back, drink some whiskey with you.

01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:24.200
All right.

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:25.520
Well, I hope that happens.

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:26.720
I really do.

01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:29.920
And I hope you're safe over there and I hope you come back with whatever

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:33.160
insight you're, you're trying to achieve.

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:35.320
Thank you for doing this conversation.

01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:40.520
Everything you you've done for me, for the support, for the love and everybody

01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:42.960
around you, thank you for everything you're doing for everybody around you,

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:46.920
for, for giving, for giving, for giving back, but for just giving

01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:48.120
and being kind to everybody.

01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:49.040
I love you, brother.

01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:49.880
I love you too.

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:50.360
Thank you.

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:53.600

And now let me leave you with one of Joe's and one of my favorite

01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:03.320
quotes from Miyamoto Musashi.

01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:08.360
Once you know the way broadly, you'll see it in everything.

01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:12.120
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
