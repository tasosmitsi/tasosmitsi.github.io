00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
It is the most important right that Americans have.

00:04.240 --> 00:07.560
It's not a coincidence or an accident

00:07.560 --> 00:12.200
that it's named in the First Amendment to the Constitution.

00:13.160 --> 00:15.400
Without it, no democratic society

00:15.400 --> 00:17.300
can be democratic for long.

00:18.320 --> 00:20.960
And I'm an absolutist.

00:20.960 --> 00:23.920
That is, I believe that, for example,

00:23.920 --> 00:28.080
people say to me, but what about hate speech?

00:28.120 --> 00:31.320
Well, hate speech is much more important than love speech.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.640
And the reason is, I'm much more interested

00:33.640 --> 00:37.160
in knowing whom I should not turn my back on

00:37.160 --> 00:40.880
than I am interested in figuring out who loves me.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.020
The following is a conversation with Harvey Silverglate,

00:46.020 --> 00:49.120
a legendary free speech advocate, co-founder of FIRE,

00:49.120 --> 00:51.720
the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression,

00:51.720 --> 00:53.800
and the author of several books

00:53.800 --> 00:56.480
on the freedom of speech and criminal justice,

00:56.480 --> 00:58.960
including The Shadow University,

00:58.960 --> 01:01.540
The Betrayal of Liberty on America's Campuses.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.040
Harvey is running to be on the Harvard Board

01:05.040 --> 01:08.360
of Overseers this year with a write-in campaign.

01:08.360 --> 01:12.200
So you have to spell his name correctly, Silverglate,

01:12.200 --> 01:14.560
promising to advocate for free speech

01:14.560 --> 01:17.040
and to push for reducing the size

01:17.040 --> 01:19.560
of Harvard's administration bureaucracy.

01:19.560 --> 01:23.960
Election is over this Tuesday, May 16th at 5 p.m. Eastern.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.560
To vote, you have to be Harvard alumni.

01:26.560 --> 01:29.520
So if you happen to be one, please vote online.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.440
It's a good way to support freedom of speech

01:31.440 --> 01:33.200
on Harvard campus.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.920
Instructions how to do so are in the description.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.920
As a side note, please allow me to say

01:38.920 --> 01:42.320
that since there are several controversial conversations

01:42.320 --> 01:44.960
coming up, I tried to make sure that this podcast

01:44.960 --> 01:47.400
is a platform for free discourse

01:47.400 --> 01:50.040
where ideas are not censored but explored,

01:50.040 --> 01:52.040
and if necessary, challenged

01:52.040 --> 01:54.640
in a thoughtful and pathetic way.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.080
It's by having such difficult conversations,

01:57.080 --> 02:00.400
not by avoiding them, that we can begin to heal divides

02:00.400 --> 02:02.240
and to shed lights on the dark parts

02:02.240 --> 02:05.400
of human history and human nature.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.400
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.440
To support it, please check out our sponsors

02:09.440 --> 02:10.840
in the description.

02:10.840 --> 02:14.760
And now, dear friends, here's Harvey Silverglate.

02:15.620 --> 02:18.740
You co-founded the Foundation for Individual Rights

02:18.740 --> 02:21.680
and Expression, also known as FIRE,

02:21.720 --> 02:23.480
a legendary organization that fights

02:23.480 --> 02:25.520
for the freedom of speech for all Americans

02:25.520 --> 02:29.740
in our courtrooms, on our campuses, and in our culture.

02:29.740 --> 02:31.600
So let's start with a big question.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.680
What is freedom of speech?

02:33.680 --> 02:38.040
First of all, the organization, when I co-founded it,

02:38.040 --> 02:42.840
in 1999, was called the Foundation

02:42.840 --> 02:45.080
for Individual Rights in Education.

02:46.200 --> 02:51.200
It focused on free speech issues on college campuses

02:51.200 --> 02:55.160
and academia, and only earlier this year

02:55.160 --> 02:59.560
did we decide to expand our reach beyond the campuses,

02:59.560 --> 03:03.640
which is why the name, although the acronym FIRE remains,

03:03.640 --> 03:06.240
it's now the Foundation for Individual Rights

03:06.240 --> 03:07.720
and Expression.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.200
The E used to be education.

03:09.200 --> 03:12.240
The E used to be education, it's now expression.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.920
And we basically do a lot of the cases the ACLU used to do.

03:15.920 --> 03:20.920
The ACLU now more is a progressive organization

03:20.920 --> 03:23.680
rather than a civil liberties organization.

03:23.680 --> 03:28.680
And we've taken the role of dealing with free speech

03:29.160 --> 03:33.940
in the society generally, and now this is a particularly,

03:35.320 --> 03:37.800
in Europe, prone to censorship.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.360
Everybody thinks they're right and that people

03:41.360 --> 03:43.500
who disagree with them should not be able

03:43.500 --> 03:45.240
to voice their views.

03:45.240 --> 03:46.960
It's a very difficult period right now,

03:46.960 --> 03:49.060
both on campus and off campus.

03:50.020 --> 03:54.340
It's about as intolerant an era as I can remember.

03:54.340 --> 03:56.300
I'm gonna be 81, May 10th.

03:56.300 --> 03:59.700
I was born on Mother's Day, 1942.

03:59.700 --> 04:02.140
And I can't remember it being this bad.

04:02.140 --> 04:04.540
I was born during the McCarthy era.

04:06.540 --> 04:07.380
So that says a lot.

04:07.380 --> 04:10.940
And it sort of reminds me of that.

04:10.940 --> 04:14.500
Well, let's start with that, almost a philosophical question,

04:14.500 --> 04:16.540
a legal question, a human question.

04:16.540 --> 04:19.460
What is this freedom that you care so much about,

04:19.460 --> 04:21.900
that you fought for so much, freedom of speech?

04:21.900 --> 04:26.140
It is the most important right that Americans have.

04:26.140 --> 04:30.380
It's not a coincidence or an accident that it's named

04:30.380 --> 04:34.100
in the First Amendment to the Constitution.

04:35.060 --> 04:37.320
Without it, no democratic society

04:37.320 --> 04:39.200
can be democratic for long.

04:40.220 --> 04:42.860
And I'm an absolutist.

04:42.860 --> 04:45.820
That is, I believe that, for example,

04:45.820 --> 04:49.980
people say to me, but what about hate speech?

04:49.980 --> 04:53.180
Well, hate speech is much more important than love speech.

04:53.180 --> 04:55.500
And the reason is, I'm much more interested

04:55.500 --> 04:59.020
in knowing whom I should not turn my back on

04:59.020 --> 05:02.980
than I am interested in figuring out who loves me

05:02.980 --> 05:03.980
or who likes me.

05:04.980 --> 05:08.780
So hate speech is the most important, in my view.

05:08.780 --> 05:12.380
And yet it's banned in, for example, schools.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.620
It's unbelievable.

05:14.940 --> 05:19.180
Kids are not schooled into understanding

05:19.180 --> 05:23.300
the glory of the First Amendment when schools say to them

05:23.300 --> 05:24.820
they shouldn't say things that are gonna

05:24.820 --> 05:26.180
make somebody feel bad.

05:28.300 --> 05:32.780
I mean, the purpose of speech is to express honest views

05:32.780 --> 05:33.740
that people have.

05:33.740 --> 05:37.580
And so I believe hate speech is as important

05:37.580 --> 05:41.660
as love speech, and my view is more important.

05:41.660 --> 05:43.220
So it should be brought to the surface

05:43.220 --> 05:45.580
rather than operate in the shadows.

05:45.580 --> 05:48.420
Absolutely, absolutely.

05:48.420 --> 05:50.620
What is the connection between freedom of speech

05:50.620 --> 05:52.340
and freedom of thought?

05:52.340 --> 05:57.340
Well, in a free society, thoughts start in the brain

05:58.420 --> 06:00.460
and then they come out the mouth.

06:01.380 --> 06:04.460
So there are different ends of the same spectrum.

06:04.460 --> 06:08.340
So to you, the censorship of speech eventually leads

06:08.340 --> 06:09.900
to a censorship of thought.

06:09.900 --> 06:12.820
Of course, censorship of the mode by which

06:12.820 --> 06:15.140
other people know what you're thinking.

06:15.140 --> 06:17.180
So there's some aspect of our society

06:17.180 --> 06:20.100
that is that thinking is done collectively

06:20.100 --> 06:21.980
and without being able to speak to each other,

06:21.980 --> 06:24.220
we cannot do this kind of collective thinking.

06:24.220 --> 06:26.820
And out of speech, the theory is that ultimately

06:26.820 --> 06:28.940
out of speech comes truth.

06:28.940 --> 06:33.140
That isn't necessarily so, but I do think that

06:33.140 --> 06:36.380
when there's free speech, better decisions are made

06:36.380 --> 06:39.140
because people put their views on the table

06:39.140 --> 06:42.300
in a frank, accurate way.

06:42.300 --> 06:47.300
And then those views mix together and clash.

06:47.660 --> 06:52.660
And out of that, usually comes the better decision.

06:54.580 --> 06:58.820
Not always, but usually, or more often than not.

06:58.820 --> 07:03.300
But if somebody is not allowed to sit at the table

07:03.300 --> 07:06.940
of decision-making, then the decision-making process

07:06.940 --> 07:11.940
is poorer, less robust, less diverse,

07:13.220 --> 07:15.620
and ultimately less successful.

07:15.620 --> 07:20.460
So can you elaborate on the idea of free speech absolutism?

07:20.460 --> 07:25.260
So hate speech can be quite painful

07:25.260 --> 07:27.500
to quite a large number of people.

07:27.500 --> 07:28.700
Does this worry you?

07:28.700 --> 07:29.860
Yep.

07:29.860 --> 07:34.460
Living in a free society requires that you expose yourself

07:34.460 --> 07:38.180
to some discomfort, you call it pain.

07:38.180 --> 07:41.740
It's maybe emotional pain, it's not physical pain,

07:43.860 --> 07:48.860
but it's the price we pay for living in a free society.

07:48.860 --> 07:53.620
Every so often, we're insulted, we're emotionally hurt.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.220
Think of the alternative.

07:56.220 --> 07:58.460
All the alternatives are worse.

07:58.460 --> 08:01.740
Nobody ever promised us a rose garden.

08:01.740 --> 08:05.020
We're lucky to be in a country that has the First Amendment.

08:05.020 --> 08:09.780
It's also the most diverse country in the world

08:09.780 --> 08:11.140
because of immigration.

08:13.780 --> 08:17.860
My grandparents, my father's side came over from Russia,

08:17.860 --> 08:20.660
my mother's side came over from Poland.

08:20.660 --> 08:24.180
I'm very happy that my grandparents came in from Russia.

08:24.180 --> 08:26.340
I would not want to be in Russia today.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.780
I'd probably be sharing a cell

08:28.780 --> 08:30.580
with a Wall Street Journal reporter.

08:32.300 --> 08:37.220
So I'm thankful that they came in.

08:37.220 --> 08:39.180
And this is a great country.

08:39.180 --> 08:42.140
It's got troubles right now, but our country doesn't.

08:42.140 --> 08:47.140
And we've had, after we had a civil war, we had segregation,

08:47.460 --> 08:52.460
we had the decimation of the Indians, we're not perfect,

08:52.540 --> 08:54.620
but it's the best place in the world

08:54.620 --> 08:57.220
for somebody who values liberty.

08:57.260 --> 09:01.300
So you don't think that hate speech can empower large groups

09:02.340 --> 09:07.140
that eventually lead to physical action,

09:07.140 --> 09:08.420
to physical harm to others?

09:08.420 --> 09:09.260
No, I don't.

09:09.260 --> 09:13.500
I think that we have developed a culture

09:13.500 --> 09:16.940
in which it's understood that if you don't like

09:16.940 --> 09:21.940
what you hear, you talk back, you write something.

09:21.940 --> 09:26.940
And we don't punch each other, we insult each other.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.020
Is insulting great?

09:30.020 --> 09:32.740
Well, I don't know, it's okay.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.820
I used to, as a kid in Brooklyn, where I was born,

09:35.820 --> 09:38.540
I was born and raised in Bensonhurst,

09:38.540 --> 09:41.180
we used to say, sticks and stones can break my bones,

09:41.180 --> 09:43.140
but names can never harm me.

09:43.140 --> 09:44.860
And it's absolutely true.

09:44.860 --> 09:49.340
What was true when I was five is true when I'm almost 81.

09:49.340 --> 09:52.540
So I've lived a long time, I've seen it all,

09:52.540 --> 09:56.460
and I'm talking from experience as well as theory.

09:56.460 --> 09:58.500
It's what happens when you reach your 80s.

10:00.580 --> 10:02.900
I read that you had this line that you cannot be

10:02.900 --> 10:04.980
protected from being called an asshole.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.700
Correct, especially if you're an asshole.

10:09.020 --> 10:12.220
Well that's, but you don't have to be an asshole

10:12.220 --> 10:13.060
to be called an asshole.

10:13.060 --> 10:13.900
That's correct.

10:13.900 --> 10:16.380
And I think the internet has taught me that.

10:16.380 --> 10:20.220
Well the internet has posed a particular challenge

10:20.220 --> 10:22.820
to free speech absolutists because of some of the stuff

10:22.820 --> 10:24.780
that's on there is God awful.

10:25.940 --> 10:28.740
But I have no different rule for freedom of speech

10:28.740 --> 10:33.140
on the internet than I have in newspapers or in lectures

10:33.140 --> 10:37.700
or in classrooms or conversations among people.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.020
What do you think about the tension

10:40.020 --> 10:42.860
between freedom of speech and freedom of reach,

10:42.860 --> 10:45.540
as is kind of sometimes termed?

10:45.540 --> 10:48.060
So the internet really challenges that aspect.

10:48.060 --> 10:52.340
It allows speech to become viral and spread very quickly

10:52.340 --> 10:53.580
to a very large number of people.

10:53.580 --> 10:56.580
Well you know, we've had revolutions

10:56.580 --> 11:01.580
in the modalities of communication.

11:02.340 --> 11:05.620
After all, newspapers were the first challenge.

11:08.500 --> 11:12.860
Radio and television posed a new challenge.

11:13.820 --> 11:18.820
The FCC tried, but ultimately gave up the attempt

11:19.140 --> 11:24.140
to control obscenity, for example.

11:26.900 --> 11:29.460
And the Supreme Court has been pretty close.

11:29.460 --> 11:31.300
The one thing that liberal

11:31.300 --> 11:33.380
and conservative Supreme Courts,

11:33.380 --> 11:34.940
right now we're in a conservative era

11:34.940 --> 11:37.740
due to Trump nominations.

11:38.700 --> 11:43.620
During much of my life, the Warren Court,

11:43.620 --> 11:48.620
it was William O. Douglas, Brennan, the Liberal Court.

11:49.780 --> 11:52.340
One thing they agree on is free speech.

11:52.340 --> 11:54.420
They don't agree on much else,

11:54.420 --> 11:56.060
but they do agree on free speech.

11:56.060 --> 12:00.140
And I think the reason is that they recognize

12:00.140 --> 12:04.300
that well, my group is in the ascendance today,

12:04.300 --> 12:05.740
but it may not be tomorrow,

12:05.740 --> 12:09.380
and I want to have objective, clear rules

12:09.380 --> 12:11.140
so that when I'm in the minority,

12:11.140 --> 12:12.980
I'm able to voice my opinion.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.620
And so it's one of the few things

12:16.620 --> 12:20.500
that both sides of the political spectrum agree on.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.900
The only people who don't are the people way over

12:23.900 --> 12:25.740
on the right that I call the fascists,

12:25.740 --> 12:28.260
and the people way over on the left,

12:28.260 --> 12:29.540
who are the communists.

12:30.420 --> 12:33.100
But with respect to most people

12:33.100 --> 12:35.060
on the political spectrum,

12:35.100 --> 12:38.540
Republicans, Democrats, socialists, libertarians,

12:41.980 --> 12:44.100
they agree on the primacy of free speech

12:44.100 --> 12:48.580
because it protects them when protection is needed.

12:48.580 --> 12:50.620
So to you, even on the internet,

12:51.700 --> 12:54.220
free speech absolutism should rule.

12:54.220 --> 12:57.180
Yes, nobody's gonna die.

12:57.180 --> 13:00.700
Remember, death threats are not protected.

13:01.860 --> 13:03.860
Nobody's gonna die,

13:03.940 --> 13:06.060
so people are gonna be a little bit insulted.

13:06.060 --> 13:09.220
That's the price you pay for living in a free society,

13:09.220 --> 13:12.140
and it's a small price, in my view.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.020
Some people don't have as tough a hide as others.

13:16.020 --> 13:17.700
Well, then develop it.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.100
I don't mean to sound cruel,

13:22.980 --> 13:25.260
but you're living in a free society.

13:25.260 --> 13:26.780
Develop a tough hide.

13:27.820 --> 13:30.700
So that's the cost of living in a free society.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.620
Yep, there's a cost.

13:32.660 --> 13:35.580
The thing is, it can really hurt at scale

13:35.580 --> 13:37.260
to be cyberbullied,

13:37.260 --> 13:39.420
to be attacked for the ideas you express,

13:39.420 --> 13:41.260
or maybe ideas you didn't express,

13:41.260 --> 13:45.220
but that somebody decided to lie about you

13:45.220 --> 13:48.260
and use that to attack you.

13:48.260 --> 13:49.660
Well, first of all,

13:51.860 --> 13:54.580
there are some exceptions to the first amendment.

13:54.580 --> 13:56.940
Libel and slander is an exception.

13:57.900 --> 14:00.900
Direct threats are an exception.

14:00.900 --> 14:04.460
You know, if you say such and such, I will murder you.

14:04.460 --> 14:06.420
That is not lawful.

14:06.420 --> 14:11.420
If you say to somebody, if you say about somebody,

14:11.420 --> 14:14.020
oh, you know, you beat your wife.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.060
That is not lawful, if in fact the person knows

14:17.060 --> 14:18.860
you don't beat your wife.

14:18.860 --> 14:20.580
There are some limits.

14:20.580 --> 14:24.260
Defamation is one, direct threats are another.

14:24.700 --> 14:26.980
So it's not absolute, this is not,

14:26.980 --> 14:29.460
the first amendment is not absolute,

14:29.460 --> 14:33.020
but it's more absolute than it is in any other society

14:33.020 --> 14:35.300
and it's pretty near absolute.

14:37.780 --> 14:39.620
For example, fraud.

14:39.620 --> 14:42.940
If you sell somebody a car and you say,

14:42.940 --> 14:44.540
oh, this is in great running shape

14:44.540 --> 14:46.180
and in fact it's an old jalopy

14:46.180 --> 14:48.940
and it's not gonna make it more than 10 miles,

14:48.940 --> 14:50.140
that's fraud.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.820
That's not free speech.

14:51.860 --> 14:55.540
So free speech is not absolute, there are these limits,

14:55.540 --> 14:59.500
but they're very narrow specific categories of limits.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.860
But there's gray area here because while legally

15:02.860 --> 15:05.500
you're not allowed to defame a person,

15:05.500 --> 15:07.460
in the court of public opinion,

15:07.460 --> 15:11.100
especially with the aid of anonymity on the internet,

15:11.100 --> 15:14.460
the rumors can spread at scale.

15:14.460 --> 15:16.500
Thousands, hundreds of thousands of people

15:16.500 --> 15:18.900
can make up things about you.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.980
You have to defend yourself.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.220
Using more speech.

15:22.220 --> 15:24.220
We're through freedom of speech,

15:24.220 --> 15:25.980
we're big boys and girls.

15:26.900 --> 15:28.380
You have to defend yourself.

15:30.060 --> 15:32.780
In some societies, if you say something,

15:34.300 --> 15:37.100
right now if you say something nasty about Putin,

15:37.100 --> 15:38.700
you'll end up in the gulag.

15:39.700 --> 15:42.980
If you say something nasty about Biden,

15:42.980 --> 15:44.420
you end up in the New York Times.

15:44.420 --> 15:45.740
Where would you rather be?

15:45.940 --> 15:48.580
Well, let's talk about the thing you've done

15:48.580 --> 15:49.900
for over 20 years,

15:50.940 --> 15:52.340
which is fight for the freedom of speech

15:52.340 --> 15:54.100
on college campuses.

15:54.100 --> 15:57.220
So why is freedom of speech important on college campuses?

15:57.220 --> 15:59.740
Well, it's important everywhere in the society,

15:59.740 --> 16:03.340
but it's most important on college campuses, why?

16:03.340 --> 16:07.060
Because that's where we educate our young citizens.

16:08.060 --> 16:12.020
And if you are educated under a notion

16:12.220 --> 16:17.220
that some dean can call you on the carpet,

16:17.740 --> 16:20.780
because you say something which is considered racist

16:20.780 --> 16:24.180
or you can say something which is considered

16:25.380 --> 16:29.180
dangerous to social cohesion,

16:30.820 --> 16:33.180
then it's not a liberal arts college.

16:33.180 --> 16:38.180
Now, the theory that I used in the early 2000s,

16:38.580 --> 16:43.580
the theory that I used in the shadow university.

16:44.540 --> 16:46.780
A book you've written, the shadow university.

16:46.780 --> 16:48.020
1998.

16:48.020 --> 16:49.860
1998.

16:49.860 --> 16:51.780
You were ahead of a lot of these things, by the way.

16:51.780 --> 16:54.700
I'm afraid that as a pessimist,

16:54.700 --> 16:57.300
I always saw the bad side of things.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.620
Betrayal of Liberty on America's campuses,

16:59.620 --> 17:02.300
the shadow university, a book you co-authored

17:02.300 --> 17:03.220
with Alan Charles.

17:03.220 --> 17:05.460
Yes, with one of my Princeton classmates,

17:05.500 --> 17:08.700
Alan Charles Coors, who's now an emeritus professor

17:08.700 --> 17:11.780
of enlightenment history at the University of Pennsylvania.

17:12.660 --> 17:14.300
I only taught for one semester,

17:14.300 --> 17:16.340
and I can go into that later,

17:16.340 --> 17:20.060
the reason that I did not continue to teach in colleges.

17:21.220 --> 17:22.700
It was Harvard Law School.

17:22.700 --> 17:25.220
I taught a course in the mid 1980s.

17:26.780 --> 17:29.660
But in any event, the college campuses

17:29.660 --> 17:34.260
are one of the most important for free speech,

17:34.260 --> 17:36.860
because it's where people get education.

17:36.860 --> 17:39.420
And if you don't really get a good education,

17:39.420 --> 17:42.620
if certain points of view are not allowed to be expressed,

17:42.620 --> 17:46.820
because education comes from the clash of ideas,

17:46.820 --> 17:48.300
and you then have to decide,

17:48.300 --> 17:52.460
this is how you become a thinking adult.

17:52.460 --> 17:56.140
You have to decide which ideas make more sense to you,

17:56.140 --> 17:57.780
which ones you're gonna follow.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.380
The college experience is transformative.

18:02.380 --> 18:05.500
And if there is censorship on campuses,

18:05.500 --> 18:10.500
it's highly destructive of the educational enterprise,

18:10.980 --> 18:14.460
and ultimately to the entire society.

18:14.460 --> 18:19.460
We have in the sciences, we have a scientific method.

18:21.140 --> 18:24.580
Scientific method is you try experiments,

18:24.580 --> 18:26.420
and you see which ones work,

18:26.420 --> 18:27.980
and then you develop theories

18:27.980 --> 18:30.540
based upon the results of experiments.

18:30.740 --> 18:32.020
Well, this is not much different

18:32.020 --> 18:34.340
from every other aspect of life.

18:34.340 --> 18:37.980
You have to entertain different views on different subjects.

18:37.980 --> 18:40.180
You hear all the views, and you make a decision

18:40.180 --> 18:42.940
as to which one's accurate and which one's not.

18:42.940 --> 18:47.740
So the scientific method I apply to non-science,

18:47.740 --> 18:52.740
to history, to journalism, to all of these things.

18:53.460 --> 18:56.420
So that scientific method includes ideas,

18:56.420 --> 18:57.540
hateful ideas also.

18:57.540 --> 19:00.220
Correct, if you don't allow hateful ideas.

19:01.180 --> 19:04.660
When scientists do experiments, nobody says to them,

19:04.660 --> 19:07.380
oh, you know, don't do that experiment,

19:07.380 --> 19:08.780
because it would be very bad

19:08.780 --> 19:12.300
if that turns out to be accurate, that outcome.

19:12.300 --> 19:13.700
That's not the way it works.

19:15.420 --> 19:20.140
Every point of view is thrown into the marketplace,

19:20.140 --> 19:25.100
whether it's science or whether it's non-science.

19:25.100 --> 19:28.180
And that includes the kind of ideas

19:28.220 --> 19:30.420
and the kind of discourse that might actually

19:30.420 --> 19:33.300
lead to an increase in hate on campuses.

19:33.300 --> 19:37.780
The First Amendment prohibits speech,

19:37.780 --> 19:42.780
which is liable to produce imminent, imminent violence.

19:43.820 --> 19:48.820
So for example, the exception is yelling falsely,

19:51.620 --> 19:54.740
falsely yelling fire in a crowded movie theater.

19:54.740 --> 19:56.420
A lot of people misstate it.

19:56.420 --> 19:59.460
They say, well, the exception is yelling fire

19:59.460 --> 20:00.300
in a movie theater.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.180
If there's really a fire,

20:01.180 --> 20:03.820
you're performing a real important function

20:03.820 --> 20:05.500
by yelling fire.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.740
But it's falsely yelling fire.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.180
You could start a riot, people would be crushed

20:10.180 --> 20:11.700
trying to get out.

20:11.700 --> 20:16.180
So that's one of the exceptions of the First Amendment

20:16.180 --> 20:18.020
as the Supreme Court has defined it.

20:20.060 --> 20:21.900
There are very few exceptions.

20:23.020 --> 20:25.060
And defamation is an exception.

20:25.780 --> 20:28.900
I'm not a fan of that exception, frankly.

20:28.900 --> 20:32.900
But if you say something about somebody

20:32.900 --> 20:37.380
that has serious implications in their life,

20:37.380 --> 20:39.540
in their ability to earn a living,

20:39.540 --> 20:42.420
if you say, accuse somebody of being a pedophile,

20:42.420 --> 20:45.820
when it's not true, that person can sue you.

20:47.220 --> 20:50.100
My own view is I think that's an unfortunate exception,

20:50.100 --> 20:52.380
but I'm the Supreme Court.

20:52.900 --> 20:57.900
I think that a friend of mine was Nat Hentoff.

21:00.740 --> 21:02.940
Nat Hentoff, who wrote for decades

21:02.940 --> 21:04.860
for The Village Voice in New York.

21:06.780 --> 21:08.460
He was a friend of mine.

21:08.460 --> 21:11.100
He was a free speech absolutist.

21:11.100 --> 21:13.740
And he wrote a fabulous book called

21:13.740 --> 21:16.140
Free Speech for Me, But Not for Thee.

21:18.020 --> 21:21.900
And he was an absolutist, and I'm with Nat Hentoff.

21:21.940 --> 21:23.580
Even on the defamation aspect, I mean,

21:23.580 --> 21:27.260
I agree with you in some sense, just practically speaking.

21:27.260 --> 21:32.260
It seems like that the best way in the public sphere

21:33.740 --> 21:37.260
to defend against defamation is with more speech.

21:37.260 --> 21:38.140
Correct.

21:38.140 --> 21:42.260
And through authenticity, through authentic communication

21:43.620 --> 21:45.380
of the truth, as you see it.

21:45.380 --> 21:48.140
Yeah, you know, at times, the Boston Globe

21:48.140 --> 21:50.860
has said something about me that hasn't been accurate.

21:50.860 --> 21:54.020
They have variably published my letter to the editor.

21:54.900 --> 21:59.020
I'm also not bashful about getting in touch

21:59.020 --> 21:59.860
with the reporter.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.140
They, at the end of every column,

22:01.140 --> 22:03.420
they give the reporter's email address.

22:05.500 --> 22:09.180
And I know people say that I have more access

22:09.180 --> 22:10.940
to the media than most people,

22:12.380 --> 22:15.900
but all that means is I get the fame more than most people.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.300
Can we also comment on,

22:18.340 --> 22:21.180
from the individual consumer of speech,

22:22.180 --> 22:27.180
there's a kind of sense that freedom of speech means

22:27.220 --> 22:30.140
you should be forced to read all of it.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.900
Freedom of speech versus freedom of reach.

22:32.900 --> 22:35.100
We as consumers of speech,

22:35.100 --> 22:37.380
do we have the right to select what we read?

22:37.380 --> 22:38.380
We do.

22:38.380 --> 22:41.740
And nobody can force us to sit in a room

22:41.740 --> 22:43.340
and listen to a radio program

22:43.340 --> 22:45.060
that we don't wanna listen to.

22:45.060 --> 22:46.900
Nobody can force us to read a book

22:46.940 --> 22:48.140
that we don't wanna read.

22:49.780 --> 22:52.260
The whole notion of freedom of speech means

22:52.260 --> 22:57.020
that people have autonomy on their choices.

22:57.020 --> 23:00.460
In order to form a complete mind and complete human being,

23:00.460 --> 23:04.540
there's a kind of tension of that autonomy

23:04.540 --> 23:08.300
versus consuming as many varied perspectives as possible,

23:08.300 --> 23:11.580
which is underlying the ethic of free speech.

23:11.580 --> 23:14.340
So on college campuses,

23:14.340 --> 23:17.500
it seems like a good way to develop the mind

23:17.500 --> 23:19.300
is to get as many perspectives as possible,

23:19.300 --> 23:22.100
even if you don't really want to.

23:22.100 --> 23:25.300
Well, that is the theory.

23:25.300 --> 23:30.180
Academic freedom is supposed to be

23:30.180 --> 23:32.300
the highest degree of free speech.

23:33.740 --> 23:35.980
You should be able to entertain

23:35.980 --> 23:40.380
all kinds of hateful, threatening ideas.

23:40.380 --> 23:43.940
And the way I put it is there's something wrong

23:44.540 --> 23:48.380
when you can say something with complete abandon

23:48.380 --> 23:51.180
without any fear in Harvard Square,

23:51.180 --> 23:52.780
whereas on the other side of the fence,

23:52.780 --> 23:54.540
you can't say it in Harvard Yard.

23:54.540 --> 23:55.940
It should be the opposite.

23:56.860 --> 24:00.500
And what happens is universities,

24:01.500 --> 24:02.780
from the best to the worst,

24:02.780 --> 24:05.700
from the most famous to the least well-known,

24:05.700 --> 24:08.500
have been taken over by administrators.

24:09.420 --> 24:13.540
Administrators do not really subsume academic values.

24:14.100 --> 24:16.060
They know nothing about the Constitution.

24:16.060 --> 24:17.460
They know nothing about free speech.

24:17.460 --> 24:19.780
They know nothing about academic freedom.

24:19.780 --> 24:22.140
They feel that their job is to keep order.

24:23.460 --> 24:27.100
And so they develop speech codes,

24:27.100 --> 24:29.820
kangaroo courts to enforce the speech codes.

24:31.340 --> 24:33.220
And these are very dire developments.

24:33.220 --> 24:36.220
I wrote about them in the shadow university in 98

24:37.820 --> 24:42.420
and tried to deal with them in 1999 when I started fire,

24:42.860 --> 24:47.860
and I would fire.

24:48.140 --> 24:49.740
The reason I'm running currently

24:49.740 --> 24:52.020
for the Harvard Board of Overseers is

24:52.020 --> 24:55.820
what I'd like to do is convince the Harvard Corporation,

24:55.820 --> 24:58.420
so-called President and Fellows of Harvard College,

24:58.420 --> 25:00.940
the chief governing board of the university

25:00.940 --> 25:01.980
with the real power.

25:03.260 --> 25:06.020
The Board of Overseers is a secondary body,

25:06.020 --> 25:07.460
but quite influential,

25:07.460 --> 25:10.460
to fire 95% of the administrators.

25:10.460 --> 25:12.900
It would have a salutary effect

25:12.900 --> 25:15.260
on the academics of the university.

25:15.260 --> 25:16.660
It would have a salutary effect

25:16.660 --> 25:18.940
on free speech and academic freedom.

25:18.940 --> 25:21.540
It would cut tuitions by about 40%.

25:23.060 --> 25:25.860
And it would create a whole different atmosphere

25:25.860 --> 25:26.700
on the campus.

25:26.700 --> 25:30.100
And the same could be said of MIT or any other place.

25:31.740 --> 25:36.660
I think administrators are a very, very, very important

25:37.500 --> 25:42.500
a very bad influence on American higher education.

25:44.220 --> 25:46.980
Can you sort of elaborate the intuition

25:46.980 --> 25:51.420
why this thing that you call administrative bloat

25:51.420 --> 25:53.220
is such a bad thing for a university?

25:53.220 --> 25:58.220
Well, first of all, just in terms of the cost of maintaining,

25:58.740 --> 26:01.740
there are more administrators in American higher education

26:01.740 --> 26:04.180
than there are faculty members.

26:04.180 --> 26:06.260
The cost is enormous.

26:06.260 --> 26:11.260
Number two, they are inimical to the teaching enterprise

26:13.620 --> 26:17.660
and they feel that their job is to control things,

26:17.660 --> 26:19.740
to make sure there are no problems

26:19.740 --> 26:21.420
and nobody's feelings are hurt.

26:23.620 --> 26:28.620
Being called before a dean because you said something

26:29.860 --> 26:32.980
that insulted somebody is something that shouldn't happen

26:32.980 --> 26:34.900
in American higher education, yet it happens

26:34.900 --> 26:36.460
because you have these administrators

26:36.460 --> 26:39.700
who think it's their job to protect people

26:39.700 --> 26:40.740
from being insulted.

26:40.740 --> 26:44.580
You insult a black student, you insult a woman.

26:45.540 --> 26:46.900
There's a disciplinary hearing.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.100
Well, there shouldn't be.

26:50.380 --> 26:54.780
Black people are accustomed to being insulted.

26:54.780 --> 26:57.580
Jews are accustomed to being insulted.

26:57.580 --> 26:59.860
Women are accustomed to being insulted.

26:59.860 --> 27:03.900
And it's very good to know who doesn't like you.

27:03.900 --> 27:08.380
It's useful, it's essential information

27:08.380 --> 27:09.940
to know who doesn't like you.

27:09.940 --> 27:12.060
If everybody is forced to say I love you

27:12.060 --> 27:13.740
and nobody can say I hate you,

27:13.740 --> 27:16.700
you get a false view of what life is all about.

27:16.700 --> 27:17.940
Outside of the university.

27:17.940 --> 27:18.980
Outside of the university.

27:18.980 --> 27:21.540
I mean, you do graduate eventually.

27:23.980 --> 27:26.180
And that's ultimately the mission of the university

27:26.180 --> 27:29.060
is to prepare you to make you into a great human being,

27:29.060 --> 27:30.620
into a great leader that can take on

27:30.620 --> 27:31.540
the problems of the world.

27:31.540 --> 27:32.380
Correct.

27:32.380 --> 27:36.500
And you don't do it by treating you like a little flower.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.060
About what role does the university

27:38.060 --> 27:40.060
have to protect students?

27:40.060 --> 27:44.420
To women, African Americans, anybody, Jews,

27:44.420 --> 27:47.420
anybody who can be a victim of hate speech.

27:47.420 --> 27:50.660
They protect you from physical assault.

27:50.660 --> 27:53.140
If somebody physically assaults you,

27:53.140 --> 27:56.260
then they get punished.

27:56.260 --> 28:00.580
But they shouldn't protect you against insult

28:00.580 --> 28:03.220
because that is a violation of academic freedom,

28:03.220 --> 28:05.780
the freedom of the insulter to insult you.

28:05.780 --> 28:08.940
And also, as I said, it's very useful

28:08.940 --> 28:10.620
to know who doesn't like you.

28:10.620 --> 28:13.340
It's useful for the so-called victim.

28:13.340 --> 28:17.500
I think it's to say I wanna know who doesn't like me.

28:17.500 --> 28:20.940
It's as important to me as knowing who likes me.

28:20.940 --> 28:25.380
But do you also believe in this open space of discourse

28:25.380 --> 28:28.140
that the insulter will eventually lose?

28:28.140 --> 28:29.260
I think that's true.

28:29.300 --> 28:32.020
I think that the insulter eventually

28:32.020 --> 28:33.820
will wear out his or her welcome.

28:35.060 --> 28:36.060
I do.

28:36.060 --> 28:38.420
But I like to know who the insulters are.

28:39.820 --> 28:41.340
Because it gives you a deeper understanding

28:41.340 --> 28:42.180
of human nature.

28:42.180 --> 28:44.620
Yeah, and usually, by the way,

28:44.620 --> 28:46.820
my experience has been that the insulters

28:46.820 --> 28:48.340
have generally not been as smart

28:48.340 --> 28:50.500
as the people they've insulted.

28:50.500 --> 28:53.260
And that's probably one of the reasons they insult them

28:53.260 --> 28:56.020
because they feel inferior.

28:56.020 --> 28:59.660
I mean, I'm not trying to be a psychoanalyst here,

28:59.660 --> 29:02.180
but a lot of the people who are the haters

29:02.180 --> 29:06.620
are pretty low down on the intellectual scale.

29:06.620 --> 29:11.620
Anyway, 95% of administration, you would fire,

29:11.900 --> 29:16.540
you're calling to fire 95% of the administration.

29:16.540 --> 29:17.660
People should know.

29:17.660 --> 29:22.420
I think people that don't really think about the structure,

29:22.420 --> 29:24.220
the way the universities work,

29:24.260 --> 29:28.660
are not familiar, I think, with the fact that administration,

29:28.660 --> 29:31.460
there's a huge bloat of administration.

29:31.460 --> 29:33.500
When you think about what makes a great university,

29:33.500 --> 29:35.420
it's about the students, it's about the faculty,

29:35.420 --> 29:37.020
it's about the people that do research,

29:37.020 --> 29:38.620
if it's a research university.

29:39.500 --> 29:42.300
They don't think about the bureaucracy of meetings

29:42.300 --> 29:46.180
and committees and rules and paperwork and all that,

29:46.180 --> 29:47.780
and all the people that are involved

29:47.780 --> 29:49.380
with pushing that kind of paper.

29:49.380 --> 29:51.100
And there's a huge cost to that,

29:51.100 --> 29:55.140
but it also slows down and suppresses

29:55.140 --> 29:58.780
the beautiful variety that makes a university great,

29:58.780 --> 30:02.620
which is the teaching, the student life, the protest,

30:02.620 --> 30:07.620
the clubs, all the fun that you can have at a university,

30:07.780 --> 30:09.580
all the very kind of exploration,

30:09.580 --> 30:11.540
which you can't really do once you graduate.

30:11.540 --> 30:12.620
Correct.

30:12.620 --> 30:14.740
The university is a place to really explore

30:15.620 --> 30:16.700
in every single way.

30:17.820 --> 30:20.500
So let me just talk about this important thing,

30:20.900 --> 30:24.260
because I'm very fortunate to have contacted you,

30:24.260 --> 30:27.620
almost by accident, in a very important moment in your life.

30:27.620 --> 30:32.620
You're running for the Harvard Board of Overseers.

30:32.820 --> 30:36.580
What is this board, how much power does it have,

30:36.580 --> 30:38.380
and what would you do if elected?

30:38.380 --> 30:41.780
Okay, first of all, I have a prediction

30:41.780 --> 30:43.700
that in about five years they're gonna probably

30:43.700 --> 30:46.460
change the name because Overseers reminds people

30:46.460 --> 30:50.340
of the slavery era, and we're in such a politically

30:51.180 --> 30:53.380
correct era now, that the English language

30:53.380 --> 30:57.140
is being restricted, corrupted, is the way I put it,

30:57.140 --> 31:01.140
because certain words are forbidden.

31:01.140 --> 31:03.340
We have some problems in this country,

31:03.340 --> 31:07.340
and I think part of the problem is the educational system

31:07.340 --> 31:09.700
has lost the sense of what academic freedom

31:09.700 --> 31:11.940
and free speech are all about,

31:11.940 --> 31:16.940
and I think it's essential that the educational system

31:17.060 --> 31:21.740
begin to take more seriously what free speech

31:21.740 --> 31:24.220
and academic freedom really are.

31:24.220 --> 31:27.140
That's why I'm running for the Harvard Board of Overseers.

31:27.140 --> 31:32.140
So let me just linger on the role of the administration

31:32.420 --> 31:34.540
in protecting free speech.

31:34.540 --> 31:37.020
So what often happens, I think you've written about this,

31:37.020 --> 31:40.140
is there's going to be a few, maybe a small number

31:40.140 --> 31:43.100
of hypersensitive students and faculty that protest.

31:43.100 --> 31:47.260
So how does Harvard administration resist

31:47.260 --> 31:50.940
the influence of those hypersensitive protestors

31:50.940 --> 31:55.660
in protecting speech and protecting even hate speech?

31:55.660 --> 32:00.140
Harvard has done fairly well under the presidency

32:00.140 --> 32:01.780
of Lawrence Bacow.

32:02.740 --> 32:05.780
I have had a couple of meetings with Bacow.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.260
I like Bacow.

32:09.260 --> 32:14.260
I have donated to Harvard a print of my late wife,

32:14.820 --> 32:17.380
took a picture of Bob Dylan and Allen Ginsberg

32:17.380 --> 32:21.580
when the Rolling Thunder Review got to Harvard Square,

32:21.580 --> 32:24.780
and it's sort of an iconic photograph.

32:24.780 --> 32:27.940
She called it the music lesson because it's got Dylan

32:27.940 --> 32:30.940
teaching Ginsberg how to play the guitar,

32:30.940 --> 32:33.940
and I donated one of those to Harvard.

32:33.940 --> 32:35.980
It's hanging in Bacow's office.

32:36.820 --> 32:40.660
He, the new president, Claudine Gay,

32:40.660 --> 32:43.460
is not known for respecting academic freedom

32:43.460 --> 32:45.180
and free speech.

32:45.180 --> 32:46.900
People have said to me, well, give her a chance.

32:46.900 --> 32:49.100
Well, I'm willing to give her a chance,

32:49.100 --> 32:53.020
but she does have a record, and she's a bureaucrat.

32:53.900 --> 32:55.740
I don't think she believes in free speech

32:55.740 --> 32:57.260
and academic freedom.

32:57.260 --> 32:59.700
I think she's a progressive, not a liberal.

33:00.980 --> 33:05.500
I'm not happy with the appointment

33:05.500 --> 33:10.180
of Claudine Gay, and it has made more essential

33:10.180 --> 33:13.300
my attempt to get on the Board of Overseers.

33:13.300 --> 33:15.780
So let's talk about the Board of Overseers,

33:15.780 --> 33:19.580
and your run for it, the specifics, actually.

33:19.580 --> 33:24.580
It would be nice because I think you're a writing candidate,

33:25.700 --> 33:28.740
and the election is over on May 16th.

33:29.660 --> 33:30.620
Yes.

33:30.620 --> 33:32.300
And I think there are specifics.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.140
I'll probably give them in the intro.

33:34.220 --> 33:35.300
I'll give links to people,

33:35.300 --> 33:37.460
but the specifics are complicated.

33:37.460 --> 33:42.460
Let me just mention that you have to be Harvard alumni,

33:42.660 --> 33:45.020
so you have graduated from Harvard.

33:45.020 --> 33:47.260
You have to, in order to run and in order to vote.

33:47.260 --> 33:48.300
In order to vote.

33:48.300 --> 33:50.940
And the process, I imagine, is not trivial,

33:50.940 --> 33:55.940
but this is done online, and if you're an alumni,

33:56.580 --> 33:57.860
you should have received an email

33:57.860 --> 33:59.660
from a particular email address,

33:59.660 --> 34:03.460
harvard.mgelectionservicescourt.com,

34:03.500 --> 34:07.740
and presumably there's a way to get some validation number

34:07.740 --> 34:09.980
from that email, and then you go online,

34:09.980 --> 34:12.220
you enter that validation number, and you vote.

34:12.220 --> 34:17.220
And to vote for Harvey, you have to enter his name correctly,

34:18.260 --> 34:21.380
Harvey Silverglate, and spell it correctly.

34:21.380 --> 34:22.460
Great.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.780
Obviously, I'm imagining this,

34:24.780 --> 34:26.820
because I'm MIT, not Harvard,

34:26.820 --> 34:29.780
so I'm imagining the process is not trivial.

34:29.780 --> 34:30.940
You have to click on things,

34:30.940 --> 34:34.980
you have to sort of follow instructions

34:34.980 --> 34:37.740
that are not trivial.

34:37.740 --> 34:40.300
And I'll also provide an email,

34:40.300 --> 34:42.780
if the process is painful, it doesn't work for you,

34:42.780 --> 34:43.900
that you can email.

34:43.900 --> 34:45.580
Email Harvard and complain.

34:45.580 --> 34:48.300
IT help at harvard.edu and so on.

34:48.300 --> 34:49.660
I'll provide all the links.

34:49.660 --> 34:51.740
But is there something else you can say

34:51.740 --> 34:55.460
about the voting process, what you're running on?

34:55.460 --> 34:57.140
This is my second run.

34:57.260 --> 34:58.500
Mm-hmm.

34:58.500 --> 35:01.620
The first time I got enough signatures

35:01.620 --> 35:03.220
to get on the ballot,

35:03.220 --> 35:08.020
then the Harvard Alumni Association

35:08.020 --> 35:13.020
sent out a letter to all living Harvard alums

35:14.580 --> 35:16.940
recommending that they vote

35:16.940 --> 35:20.660
for the officially nominated candidates

35:20.660 --> 35:24.780
that excluded two petition candidates of whom I was one.

35:25.740 --> 35:30.740
And I wrote to the Alumni Association and I said,

35:31.620 --> 35:35.740
you have now sent out the curriculum VTIs

35:35.740 --> 35:37.580
and the policy positions

35:37.580 --> 35:40.940
of all the officially nominated candidates.

35:40.940 --> 35:44.300
There are two petition candidates on the ballot.

35:44.300 --> 35:49.300
I would like to be able to send out my positions

35:50.380 --> 35:52.580
to the voters.

35:52.660 --> 35:54.660
They wrote me back saying,

35:54.660 --> 35:59.380
our policy is to only send out the policy positions

35:59.380 --> 36:02.580
and the platforms of officially nominated candidates.

36:02.580 --> 36:04.580
Can you believe that?

36:04.580 --> 36:07.740
Well, this is a liberal arts college, right?

36:09.540 --> 36:12.460
Where from the clash of ideas, truth emerges.

36:12.460 --> 36:13.500
Well, really?

36:14.580 --> 36:18.940
This is what I call Harvard's not so subtle means

36:18.940 --> 36:21.860
of candidate suppression, not voter suppression,

36:21.860 --> 36:23.300
candidate suppression.

36:24.380 --> 36:28.820
And everybody can vote, but not everybody can run.

36:31.420 --> 36:35.140
It'll becomes a liberal arts college

36:35.140 --> 36:38.060
where the clash of ideas will produce the truth.

36:38.060 --> 36:41.820
What about the clash of ideas on the Board of Overseers?

36:41.820 --> 36:43.580
The Board of Overseers is important.

36:43.580 --> 36:46.580
It doesn't have the same power and authority

36:46.580 --> 36:48.060
as the Harvard Corporation,

36:48.060 --> 36:51.700
the so-called president and fellows of Harvard College,

36:52.540 --> 36:56.460
but it's very influential and very important.

36:56.460 --> 36:59.380
And it would be a great perch for me to try

36:59.380 --> 37:03.220
to exert influence for the university to get back

37:03.220 --> 37:05.100
to where it was before it was taken over

37:05.100 --> 37:06.380
by the administrators.

37:06.380 --> 37:09.860
Well, I'm pretty sure that most of Harvard alumni

37:09.860 --> 37:12.060
and most of the students currently going to Harvard,

37:12.060 --> 37:15.220
most of the faculty at Harvard probably stand behind

37:15.220 --> 37:18.220
the ideas and the ideals that you stand behind.

37:18.700 --> 37:21.540
The people that love Harvard and what it stands for.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.820
See, the alumni were educated in an era

37:23.820 --> 37:27.860
when these concepts were taken more seriously

37:27.860 --> 37:32.460
and before the administrators took over.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.460
So I do think if I get my message out,

37:34.460 --> 37:36.020
I'm gonna win the seat.

37:36.020 --> 37:39.900
And if I win a seat, I will have a great perch

37:39.900 --> 37:44.300
for trying to convince the real power that beat,

37:44.300 --> 37:46.460
which is the Harvard Corporation,

37:46.460 --> 37:48.820
to do the things that I'm suggesting.

37:48.820 --> 37:51.260
Get rid of 95% of the administrators,

37:51.260 --> 37:55.540
get rid of the speech codes, reduce tuition by 40%.

37:55.540 --> 37:58.500
All of these salutary benefits.

37:59.620 --> 38:02.500
Can you imagine if Harvard became the most affordable

38:02.500 --> 38:03.940
college in the United States?

38:05.180 --> 38:07.500
Well, the affordability is another aspect,

38:07.500 --> 38:12.020
but I think before that, just the freedom of expression,

38:12.020 --> 38:14.100
freedom of speech, freedom of thought.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.740
America's greatest universities, I think,

38:16.740 --> 38:18.980
is something that everybody would agree on.

38:18.980 --> 38:23.980
It would have a tremendous effect on the whole country.

38:26.300 --> 38:29.780
And is there something to say about the details

38:29.780 --> 38:33.780
of how difficult it is for alumni to vote?

38:33.780 --> 38:38.780
Well, you could vote online or you can vote by paper ballot.

38:39.180 --> 38:40.980
You could request a paper ballot.

38:41.980 --> 38:44.940
And all I could say is that the hard part

38:44.940 --> 38:46.300
is getting the message out.

38:47.380 --> 38:49.340
My name doesn't appear on the ballot

38:49.340 --> 38:52.100
because I couldn't get enough signatures.

38:52.100 --> 38:55.260
Well, Harvey, Harvey Silverglat.

38:55.260 --> 38:58.340
S-I-L-V-E-R-G-L-A-T.

38:58.340 --> 39:01.980
You know, when my grandparents arrived from Russia,

39:03.380 --> 39:08.340
the name in Russian was something like Zilberglat.

39:08.340 --> 39:12.060
And the immigration officer had several choices.

39:12.060 --> 39:14.300
He could have said Silvergate.

39:14.300 --> 39:18.180
Gate is a real, Silver and gate are real English words.

39:18.180 --> 39:21.980
He could have said Silverglade, G-L-A-D-E.

39:21.980 --> 39:23.340
Those are real English words.

39:23.340 --> 39:25.420
That's how my name is often misspelled,

39:25.420 --> 39:28.180
either Silvergate or Silverglade.

39:28.180 --> 39:31.580
Silverglade is a nonsense syllable.

39:31.580 --> 39:34.860
And why the immigration officer chose

39:34.860 --> 39:39.460
to transliterate Zilberglad as Silverglade,

39:39.460 --> 39:41.260
I'll never understand.

39:41.260 --> 39:45.860
And it is the cause of endless mistakes in my name.

39:45.860 --> 39:49.740
Well, the fundamental absurdity of life

39:49.740 --> 39:51.620
is also the source of its beauty.

39:51.620 --> 39:52.460
Yes.

39:52.460 --> 39:55.060
Anyway, we shall spell it out

39:55.060 --> 40:00.140
and we shall yell loud and wide

40:00.140 --> 40:02.780
that everybody who has ever graduated from Harvard

40:02.780 --> 40:05.460
should vote for you if they believe in the ideals

40:05.460 --> 40:06.940
of the great American universities,

40:06.940 --> 40:08.380
which I think most people do.

40:10.580 --> 40:14.460
Let me also ask about diversity inclusion

40:14.460 --> 40:15.580
and equity programs.

40:15.580 --> 40:20.140
You've had a few harsh words to say about those.

40:20.140 --> 40:21.620
You know, the idea of diversity,

40:21.620 --> 40:23.820
I think is a beautiful idea.

40:23.820 --> 40:25.660
You said that Harvard's idea of diversity

40:25.660 --> 40:28.860
is for everyone to look different and think alike.

40:28.860 --> 40:29.700
Correct.

40:29.700 --> 40:30.520
Can you elaborate?

40:30.520 --> 40:32.060
And be comfortable.

40:32.820 --> 40:33.660
Yeah.

40:33.660 --> 40:35.740
First of all, it is impossible

40:35.740 --> 40:38.260
if liberal arts education is taken seriously,

40:38.260 --> 40:41.620
it's impossible for students to feel comfortable.

40:41.620 --> 40:42.780
Why?

40:42.780 --> 40:44.620
Because one of the roles of colleges

40:44.620 --> 40:47.980
to challenge all the beliefs that they grew up with,

40:47.980 --> 40:51.660
which mostly are the beliefs inculcated by parents

40:51.660 --> 40:53.580
and by elementary school teachers.

40:54.500 --> 40:59.500
And the idea is to be able to challenge those thoughts,

41:00.060 --> 41:01.620
those ideas.

41:02.140 --> 41:04.780
And if you don't have free speech and academic freedom,

41:04.780 --> 41:08.980
those views get reified, they do not get challenged.

41:09.860 --> 41:14.860
So it violates the fundamental role

41:15.220 --> 41:17.780
of higher educational institutions

41:17.780 --> 41:19.860
to have any restrictions at all.

41:20.940 --> 41:22.380
That's number one.

41:23.700 --> 41:27.100
Number two, as I think I said earlier,

41:27.100 --> 41:29.580
if people, students are not allowed

41:29.580 --> 41:31.460
to be frank with one another,

41:32.300 --> 41:33.940
they don't really learn about one another.

41:38.340 --> 41:42.060
I've given a lot of lectures in which I have said,

41:42.060 --> 41:45.900
and I think students now understand it,

41:46.980 --> 41:48.420
I'm much more interested in hearing

41:48.420 --> 41:51.380
from the people who hate me than the people who love me.

41:51.380 --> 41:54.420
I'm much more interested in knowing who disagrees with me

41:54.420 --> 41:55.940
than people who agree with me.

41:56.940 --> 42:01.260
That's how I learn, and that's how they learn.

42:02.100 --> 42:03.740
The clash of ideas,

42:03.740 --> 42:06.020
which is the theory behind the First Amendment.

42:07.420 --> 42:09.300
That truth will somehow emerge,

42:09.300 --> 42:12.260
or if not truth, at least a better truth,

42:12.260 --> 42:15.820
a truer truth, a more useful truth,

42:15.820 --> 42:19.380
if ideas are allowed to clash.

42:19.380 --> 42:21.100
Especially in the structure of a university

42:21.100 --> 42:24.180
where at least I would say there's some set of rules,

42:24.180 --> 42:25.900
some set of civility.

42:25.900 --> 42:29.300
I think I would rather read Mein Kampf

42:29.340 --> 42:31.460
to understand people that hate.

42:31.460 --> 42:34.860
There is also a quality to disagreement

42:34.860 --> 42:36.180
that we should strive for,

42:36.180 --> 42:38.100
and I think a university is a place

42:38.100 --> 42:41.740
where when disagreement and even hate is allowed,

42:41.740 --> 42:44.940
it's done in a high effort way.

42:44.940 --> 42:48.900
Somebody asked me once about what books I would,

42:48.900 --> 42:53.020
what I have as required reading in literature courses,

42:53.020 --> 42:56.940
and I listed Mein Kampf, and they were horrified.

42:56.940 --> 42:58.980
I said, well, it's one of the most important books

42:59.460 --> 43:00.220
of the 20th century.

43:01.940 --> 43:03.380
Six million Jews died,

43:03.380 --> 43:06.020
an enormous number of other people died,

43:06.020 --> 43:08.420
because one guy wrote a book called Mein Kampf

43:08.420 --> 43:10.460
and took it seriously.

43:10.460 --> 43:12.420
It's one of the most important books ever written.

43:12.420 --> 43:16.740
How can an educated person not have at least

43:16.740 --> 43:19.500
breezed through Mein Kampf?

43:20.940 --> 43:22.220
It's not a great read, though.

43:22.220 --> 43:23.460
It's not a great read.

43:23.460 --> 43:27.500
He was not a great writer, but you do get a sense

43:27.580 --> 43:30.500
for the sociopath that was Adolf Hitler.

43:30.500 --> 43:33.940
Yes, because he really acted on the words that he wrote.

43:33.940 --> 43:35.220
Yeah.

43:35.220 --> 43:38.460
And it was there, and if people took that work seriously.

43:38.460 --> 43:39.300
Correct.

43:39.300 --> 43:40.780
They would have understood.

43:40.780 --> 43:43.340
It's one of the most important books of the 20th century,

43:43.340 --> 43:46.980
and it's politically incorrect to read it.

43:46.980 --> 43:48.700
It's crazy.

43:48.700 --> 43:51.660
But can you speak to the

43:54.140 --> 43:57.460
the efforts to increase diversity in universities

43:58.460 --> 44:00.900
which I think is embodied in this D.I.E. effort

44:00.900 --> 44:04.180
of diversity, inclusion, and equity programs.

44:04.180 --> 44:06.100
Where do they go right?

44:06.100 --> 44:07.460
Where do they go wrong?

44:07.460 --> 44:09.460
Okay, let me tell you, first of all,

44:09.460 --> 44:11.460
this may surprise a lot of people.

44:12.660 --> 44:15.300
I am opposed to affirmative action,

44:17.700 --> 44:21.660
and I think that what it does

44:21.660 --> 44:26.660
is it labels people by their race,

44:27.020 --> 44:31.020
by their religion, and by their national origin.

44:31.020 --> 44:33.740
Precisely what we don't want people to do

44:33.740 --> 44:37.580
is be pigeonholed in those categories.

44:37.580 --> 44:41.540
The reason that affirmative action has become

44:41.540 --> 44:46.180
the way that universities decide on who gets admitted

44:46.180 --> 44:48.180
is because historically,

44:48.180 --> 44:51.900
people in what's called marginalized groups,

44:51.900 --> 44:55.660
blacks, gays, Hispanics,

44:56.580 --> 45:00.500
have been discriminated against in the admissions process.

45:01.660 --> 45:05.580
Now, what I have suggested

45:05.580 --> 45:07.700
is that instead of affirmative action,

45:07.700 --> 45:10.380
and by the way, here's a prediction.

45:10.380 --> 45:13.180
The Supreme Court is going to abolish affirmative action.

45:13.180 --> 45:15.500
There's a case pending, it's a Harvard case.

45:18.900 --> 45:20.700
There are two cases joined together,

45:20.700 --> 45:23.940
one of a public university and one of a private university.

45:23.980 --> 45:25.740
The private university is Harvard.

45:27.420 --> 45:30.300
I predict that the Supreme Court will vote six to three

45:30.300 --> 45:31.900
to abolish affirmative action.

45:33.220 --> 45:35.740
It is, on its face,

45:35.740 --> 45:39.380
it is a violation of equal protection of the law.

45:39.380 --> 45:44.380
Some groups are favored because of race or ethnicity.

45:44.860 --> 45:49.220
It is a classic violation of equal protection clause.

45:49.220 --> 45:53.180
When affirmative action was approved,

45:53.220 --> 45:56.900
the deciding vote was Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.

45:56.900 --> 46:00.540
She wrote a very famous opinion in which she said,

46:01.780 --> 46:04.980
I hesitate to vote to keep up,

46:04.980 --> 46:07.860
to affirm the notion of affirmative action

46:07.860 --> 46:11.300
because it's such an obvious violation of equal protection.

46:11.300 --> 46:14.260
But we have an urgent problem in the society.

46:14.260 --> 46:19.260
We are not educating our members of racial and ethnic

46:20.140 --> 46:25.140
minorities, and we have to try to get them into our colleges.

46:26.580 --> 46:30.180
So I think it should be approved for 25 years,

46:31.820 --> 46:36.820
and in 25 years it should have performed its role.

46:39.620 --> 46:41.220
Well, it hasn't.

46:41.220 --> 46:44.100
And the 25 years is coming up.

46:44.100 --> 46:47.340
I think it's three or four years left.

46:47.380 --> 46:49.260
The Supreme Court is going to abolish it.

46:49.260 --> 46:50.820
You can take my word for that

46:51.740 --> 46:54.740
because it is such an obvious violation of equal protection.

46:56.420 --> 46:59.460
Why did affirmative action come into play?

46:59.460 --> 47:03.860
Because the secondary and elementary schools are so bad.

47:03.860 --> 47:07.540
Public secondary and elementary schools are so bad.

47:07.540 --> 47:08.660
Why are they so bad?

47:08.660 --> 47:13.020
Partly because of the control that the teachers union has.

47:13.020 --> 47:16.060
Randy Weingarten runs the public school system

47:16.060 --> 47:17.100
in the United States.

47:18.180 --> 47:23.180
And what I have suggested is that the effort should be to,

47:26.300 --> 47:29.860
this is an emergency, it's a national emergency,

47:29.860 --> 47:34.860
to improve the quality of elementary

47:35.980 --> 47:37.620
and secondary education.

47:38.500 --> 47:41.980
And one way to do it is to hire teachers

47:41.980 --> 47:43.700
who are fabulous teachers

47:43.700 --> 47:46.340
rather than necessarily members of the union.

47:47.420 --> 47:52.420
I have come to oppose public workers unions.

47:54.260 --> 47:59.260
I am a very strong supporter of unions in the private sector.

48:00.580 --> 48:03.940
Why do I think there's such a difference between unions

48:03.940 --> 48:06.860
in the public sector and the private sector?

48:06.860 --> 48:11.100
In the private sector, management is arguing,

48:11.100 --> 48:13.380
bargaining with its own money

48:13.380 --> 48:15.100
and with the money of shareholders.

48:15.980 --> 48:19.580
In the public sector, there's only one side.

48:19.580 --> 48:21.300
There is the teacher's union,

48:21.300 --> 48:22.580
and then there's a school committee

48:22.580 --> 48:26.260
that is dealing with the taxpayers' money, not their own.

48:26.260 --> 48:31.260
And so it's a very skewed power balance.

48:31.980 --> 48:36.660
So as supportive as I am of private sector unions,

48:36.660 --> 48:40.380
I am in opposition of public sector unions.

48:40.420 --> 48:42.380
They're very destructive.

48:42.380 --> 48:46.060
And I think without the teacher's union,

48:46.060 --> 48:50.100
teachers who are really skilled will be able to get jobs.

48:50.100 --> 48:53.100
They would not have to worry about the seniority of teachers

48:53.100 --> 48:57.900
who long since have given up really creative teaching,

48:58.980 --> 49:02.260
and we have to improve the public educational system.

49:03.300 --> 49:06.820
I had, my late wife and I

49:07.780 --> 49:11.500
had a classmate of, we have a son who's now 44

49:11.500 --> 49:13.660
who went to the public schools in Cambridge.

49:15.060 --> 49:19.340
He has a friend, first name Eugene,

49:19.340 --> 49:21.460
who was a black kid from Roxbury,

49:21.460 --> 49:24.620
whose mother understood that the schools in Roxbury

49:24.620 --> 49:27.220
were terrible, the schools in Cambridge were pretty good.

49:28.340 --> 49:33.340
He lived in our house Monday to Friday,

49:33.620 --> 49:36.540
and he went to school with Isaac in the middle of the year.

49:37.100 --> 49:38.860
He was a very good teacher.

49:38.860 --> 49:42.460
He had a very good relationship with Isaac

49:42.460 --> 49:44.060
in the Cambridge public schools.

49:45.420 --> 49:48.300
Elsa and I would show up to school committee meetings

49:48.300 --> 49:51.980
when there was bargaining between the teachers union

49:51.980 --> 49:53.380
and the school committee.

49:55.740 --> 49:58.620
The teachers union objected to our being there.

49:59.820 --> 50:01.780
We argued, we're taxpayers.

50:01.780 --> 50:04.180
We have a kid in the school,

50:05.140 --> 50:07.420
we have a real interest.

50:07.420 --> 50:12.420
And the school committee walked out of the bargaining session.

50:13.580 --> 50:16.220
The city council then reconsidered its vote

50:16.220 --> 50:21.220
and they voted that citizens, taxpayers,

50:21.660 --> 50:23.460
parents of kids in the school,

50:23.460 --> 50:28.460
could not show up to these negotiation sessions.

50:28.620 --> 50:31.980
I thought that was absolutely outrageous.

50:31.980 --> 50:33.660
But I understood why,

50:33.660 --> 50:37.100
because these contracts are crazy.

50:37.100 --> 50:41.740
No sane municipality should enter

50:41.740 --> 50:43.340
into some of these contracts.

50:45.780 --> 50:50.180
So I have become an opponent

50:50.180 --> 50:52.940
of the National Teachers Association,

50:52.940 --> 50:56.780
the Cambridge Teachers Association.

50:56.780 --> 51:01.180
I don't think there should be unions for public employees

51:01.220 --> 51:04.420
because there's no real bargaining going on.

51:04.420 --> 51:07.620
And I think that the public school system

51:07.620 --> 51:08.980
will never be improved

51:08.980 --> 51:13.460
as long as the teachers are unionized.

51:13.460 --> 51:16.300
So that, to you, is at the core of the problem

51:16.300 --> 51:21.300
that results in the kind of inequality of opportunity

51:21.820 --> 51:23.820
that affirmative action is designed to solve.

51:23.820 --> 51:26.900
Correct, if the educational system

51:26.900 --> 51:30.540
in the elementary and high school levels is improved,

51:30.540 --> 51:32.660
we wouldn't need affirmative action.

51:32.660 --> 51:35.500
These kids would get good educations.

51:35.500 --> 51:39.780
So from all backgrounds, poor kids in the United States

51:39.780 --> 51:44.780
will get good education if public unions are abolished.

51:45.260 --> 51:46.100
Correct.

51:47.140 --> 51:47.980
But do you more?

51:47.980 --> 51:49.500
And incidentally, the postal service

51:49.500 --> 51:51.060
would probably work better too.

51:52.980 --> 51:54.700
That's a whole other conversation.

51:54.700 --> 51:56.740
But do you, at the core of the problem

51:56.780 --> 52:00.940
of the inequality in universities

52:00.940 --> 52:03.900
that diversity, inclusion, and equity programs

52:03.900 --> 52:07.140
are trying to solve is the public education system

52:07.140 --> 52:08.700
of secondary education?

52:08.700 --> 52:10.900
Yes, correct, elementary and secondary.

52:10.900 --> 52:12.900
Elementary and secondary education.

52:12.900 --> 52:16.660
Well then, is there use, what is the benefit,

52:16.660 --> 52:20.740
what is the drawback of DIE,

52:20.740 --> 52:22.700
diversity, inclusion, and equity programs

52:22.700 --> 52:24.300
at universities like Harvard?

52:24.340 --> 52:27.300
It's an affirmative action, basically.

52:27.300 --> 52:31.180
And what it does is it allows the system

52:31.180 --> 52:35.220
of elementary and secondary education to be bad

52:35.220 --> 52:38.340
because they could say, oh, we get our kids into Harvard.

52:38.340 --> 52:40.180
Yes, but you haven't educated them.

52:41.260 --> 52:43.820
And it covers up the wound.

52:45.060 --> 52:47.300
And I think we will never improve

52:47.300 --> 52:49.340
as long as we're able to cover up the wound.

52:49.340 --> 52:51.980
And as I said, affirmative action is gonna be abolished

52:51.980 --> 52:53.780
by the Supreme Court.

52:53.820 --> 52:56.420
It's a clear violation of equal protection

52:56.420 --> 52:59.780
is what Sanctuary of O'Connor understood

52:59.780 --> 53:04.580
but ignored intentionally, but as an experiment.

53:05.900 --> 53:08.180
And I believe it's gonna be abolished

53:08.180 --> 53:13.180
and that's gonna force the elementary and high schools

53:13.420 --> 53:15.300
to get serious.

53:15.300 --> 53:17.340
Do you see the same issues that you discuss now

53:17.340 --> 53:19.940
at Harvard, at MIT?

53:19.940 --> 53:21.980
We're here in Boston, so I have to talk about

53:21.980 --> 53:23.660
the great universities here in Boston.

53:24.500 --> 53:25.980
You've written about MIT.

53:25.980 --> 53:29.780
It's a university I love, I'm a research scientist there.

53:29.780 --> 53:31.460
Do you see the same kind of issues there?

53:31.460 --> 53:32.540
Yes, I do.

53:32.540 --> 53:34.780
Do you remember, can you explain the case

53:34.780 --> 53:38.380
of Dorian Abbott Lecture that was canceled at MIT?

53:38.380 --> 53:42.540
Yeah, well, you know, this is not the only,

53:42.540 --> 53:45.060
it's not the only incident.

53:45.060 --> 53:47.460
There have been incidents all around the country

53:48.860 --> 53:52.180
of academics, professors who have views

53:52.180 --> 53:56.460
that don't comport with the, as the great Lillian Hellman,

53:56.460 --> 53:58.340
another friend of my late wife,

54:01.540 --> 54:04.100
she said she refused to cut her garments

54:04.100 --> 54:06.540
in order to fit the fashions of the day.

54:07.380 --> 54:10.500
Dorian Abbott didn't cut his suit

54:10.500 --> 54:12.060
to fit the fashions of the day,

54:12.060 --> 54:14.380
didn't his intellectual suit.

54:14.380 --> 54:17.580
And so he was, this has happened at Princeton,

54:17.580 --> 54:21.140
this has happened at Harvard, this has happened at MIT.

54:21.140 --> 54:24.020
The great universities in the country

54:24.020 --> 54:26.900
have decided that the clash of ideas

54:26.900 --> 54:28.300
is not such a good idea

54:28.300 --> 54:31.620
because some people's feelings will be hurt.

54:31.620 --> 54:36.140
Well, this is, there was quite a revolt against it.

54:36.140 --> 54:40.580
Fire sounded the alarm.

54:40.580 --> 54:43.580
And then in the end, the universities were,

54:43.580 --> 54:45.580
I believe Abbott was invited to come back.

54:45.580 --> 54:47.300
I think he turned him down.

54:48.300 --> 54:51.540
He shouldn't have turned him down, but he did.

54:53.380 --> 54:58.180
And when the light is cast upon these situations,

54:58.180 --> 54:59.540
the universities back down

54:59.540 --> 55:01.100
because they're so embarrassed.

55:02.260 --> 55:04.780
And the newspapers, because newspapers depend

55:04.780 --> 55:08.140
on the First Amendment in order to exist,

55:08.140 --> 55:10.340
newspapers tend to give pretty good publicity

55:10.340 --> 55:11.820
to these cases of censorship.

55:11.820 --> 55:13.620
So they grill the universities.

55:13.620 --> 55:14.460
Yes.

55:14.460 --> 55:16.300
So they really emphasize,

55:16.300 --> 55:18.060
they catalyze the embarrassment.

55:18.060 --> 55:18.900
Yes.

55:18.900 --> 55:19.860
So is that one of the ways,

55:19.860 --> 55:21.620
is that the best way to fight all of this?

55:21.620 --> 55:24.860
Yes, sunshine is the best disinfectant.

55:24.860 --> 55:27.620
You've written about MIT's connection to Jeffrey Epstein.

55:27.620 --> 55:28.460
Yes.

55:28.460 --> 55:31.180
He was well connected at MIT and at Harvard.

55:32.260 --> 55:34.780
What do you, what lessons do you draw

55:34.780 --> 55:37.340
about human nature, about universities,

55:37.340 --> 55:39.460
about all of this from this saga?

55:39.460 --> 55:40.500
Let me say this.

55:41.580 --> 55:44.260
I believe that universities,

55:44.300 --> 55:48.100
if somebody wants to, for example, donate to a university

55:48.100 --> 55:51.300
and donates on the requirement

55:51.300 --> 55:53.980
that the building be named after them.

55:53.980 --> 55:57.060
If the university is taking the donations

55:57.060 --> 56:00.780
and the person is funding a building

56:00.780 --> 56:03.100
and wants the building named after them,

56:03.100 --> 56:06.340
the building should be named after him, him or them.

56:06.340 --> 56:09.260
Harvard is facing this now with the Sackler building

56:09.260 --> 56:12.260
because Sackler, the Sacklers have become now

56:12.380 --> 56:14.900
persona non grata because of their role

56:14.900 --> 56:17.260
in producing the opioids that caused

56:17.260 --> 56:21.940
the huge scandalous opioid addiction.

56:21.940 --> 56:25.300
There are people who want to remove the name the Sackler

56:25.300 --> 56:27.340
from the Sackler Art Museum at Harvard.

56:28.220 --> 56:30.940
Larry Bacow, the president of Harvard,

56:30.940 --> 56:35.620
to his credit has refused to do that.

56:37.260 --> 56:42.140
And if it reminds people that the money was earned

56:42.980 --> 56:45.700
through selling opioids, that's good.

56:45.700 --> 56:47.380
That's good that people understand

56:47.380 --> 56:49.220
that that's where the Sacklers got their money.

56:49.220 --> 56:51.180
They should be reminded.

56:51.180 --> 56:56.180
In my undergraduate alma mater, Princeton,

56:57.180 --> 57:00.780
there's a movement to remove the name Woodrow Wilson

57:00.780 --> 57:02.900
because Woodrow Wilson was president of Princeton

57:02.900 --> 57:04.820
before he became governor of New Jersey,

57:04.820 --> 57:07.060
before he became president of the United States.

57:07.060 --> 57:08.700
How he got to be governor of New Jersey

57:08.700 --> 57:11.980
was he was so insufferable that the trustees of Princeton

57:12.820 --> 57:15.300
got him the nomination to run for governor of New Jersey.

57:15.300 --> 57:17.620
They had said, we got to get this guy out of here.

57:19.380 --> 57:23.180
And not because he was anti-black and anti-Semitic

57:23.180 --> 57:24.660
as the trustees were as well,

57:24.660 --> 57:27.020
but because he just was insufferable.

57:27.020 --> 57:30.940
He drove the faculty crazy and they got him out.

57:32.460 --> 57:37.020
And so Princeton was thinking of changing the name.

57:37.020 --> 57:39.380
I wrote a letter to President Eisgruber,

57:39.740 --> 57:43.940
saying this is part of the university's history.

57:43.940 --> 57:48.860
You don't want to rewrite history falsely?

57:48.860 --> 57:51.620
Woodrow Wilson was the president of this institution.

57:51.620 --> 57:53.540
He was one of your predecessors.

57:53.540 --> 57:55.060
He never answered me either.

57:56.140 --> 57:59.900
I think these people, they know they have no answer.

57:59.900 --> 58:03.740
The reason I didn't get a response from President Eisgruber

58:03.740 --> 58:05.940
is the same as the reason I didn't get a response

58:05.940 --> 58:08.500
from the headmaster of Milton Academy.

58:08.540 --> 58:12.460
They understand that what they're doing is violative

58:12.460 --> 58:16.380
of the fundamental precepts of academic institutions.

58:16.380 --> 58:19.580
They're ashamed that they feel they have no choice

58:19.580 --> 58:22.540
because they feel that they would be criticized

58:22.540 --> 58:26.340
for racism, homophobia, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

58:26.340 --> 58:28.260
Criticized by how many people?

58:28.260 --> 58:30.900
Well, they feel that they would be criticized

58:30.900 --> 58:33.820
by students and parents and donors.

58:33.820 --> 58:34.900
I disagree with that.

58:34.900 --> 58:37.260
I actually think there are more people out there

58:37.300 --> 58:40.060
that agree with me than agree with them.

58:40.060 --> 58:41.500
Yeah, by a large margin.

58:41.500 --> 58:44.860
By a large margin, in what I call the real world,

58:44.860 --> 58:47.420
which is the world outside the campus.

58:47.420 --> 58:50.740
But academics are afraid they'd be criticized.

58:50.740 --> 58:52.220
They're incredibly thin-skinned.

58:52.220 --> 58:54.900
When I say academics, I mean academic administrators.

58:54.900 --> 58:57.420
They're very thin-skinned, politically correct,

58:57.420 --> 58:58.820
holier than thou.

59:00.100 --> 59:03.420
As I said, I would fire 95% of them

59:03.420 --> 59:07.700
and I would be more careful in who I elected

59:07.700 --> 59:09.860
to lead these institutions.

59:09.860 --> 59:14.020
I said Pauline Gay is probably gonna be a disaster at Harvard.

59:14.020 --> 59:16.500
So it takes guts, it takes courage

59:16.500 --> 59:19.700
to be in the administration

59:19.700 --> 59:22.460
when the task of protecting the freedom of speech is there

59:22.460 --> 59:27.460
and also, which in part requires you to admit

59:28.540 --> 59:31.300
and to uphold the mistakes you have done in the past.

59:31.300 --> 59:32.140
Correct.

59:32.140 --> 59:33.180
Not to hide them.

59:34.020 --> 59:37.020
And that to you, I mean, Jeffrey Epstein,

59:37.020 --> 59:40.020
for Harvard and for MIT is a very recent mistake.

59:40.020 --> 59:42.860
Well, there's a debate whether it's a mistake.

59:42.860 --> 59:44.540
They took money from him.

59:44.540 --> 59:45.540
Yes. Okay.

59:46.420 --> 59:48.860
Is it a mistake to take money from bad people?

59:50.300 --> 59:54.100
Do you have to do a morals test of a potential donor?

59:55.220 --> 59:56.540
I don't think so.

59:58.220 --> 59:59.580
It's complicated because-

59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.860
If there are no conditions attached to it,

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.900
I think it's emotionally complicated.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:06.940
I don't think that it is rationally complicated.

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.420
It's emotionally complicated.

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:13.620
It's particularly complicated if they want naming rights.

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:19.300
Yes, you know, the Jeffrey Epstein Biological Laboratory.

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:23.900
That would be a problem for most universities.

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:29.140
I don't think that naming rights have to be given

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:31.900
to somebody that you don't think is worthy

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:32.740
of having their name.

01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:34.740
I think the university has the right to say,

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.380
no, we'll take your money,

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:39.020
but we will not name the building after you.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.060
I think they have a right to do that.

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:44.740
There's some degree in which you whitewash the name, though.

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:49.060
If you, not with naming rights, but-

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:50.060
You take the money?

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:52.660
If you take the money, it allows the person

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:57.380
in public discourse to say that they're collaborating,

01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.620
they're working together with Harvard and with MIT.

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:02.220
I have a problem with universities

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:06.340
making morals tests of the donors.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:09.780
Because not every donor is as bad as Epstein,

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:13.380
but some of the donors made their money in industry

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:18.380
by being rapacious, by paying low wages,

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:21.420
by exploiting people.

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:25.540
You can make the case that accepting money

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.020
from the Department of Defense, from DARPA,

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:29.860
from the United States organizations

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:32.740
that contributed to waging war

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:34.820
and killing hundreds of thousands of civilians

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.100
over the past few decades.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:37.140
Correct.

01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:39.900
Folks like the 10-year professor Noam Chomsky

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:42.420
will make the case that that is far more evil

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:45.500
than accepting money from Jeffrey Epstein.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:46.340
Yes.

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:51.460
Still, Jeffrey Epstein is a known pedophile.

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:52.300
Yes.

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:57.500
So that's why I say I would not give him naming rights.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.460
I think the university has the autonomy

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.940
to not give naming rights.

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:05.020
But I think that giving morals tests to donors

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:08.020
is a Pandora's box.

01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:09.620
What do you think about the aftermath

01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:11.220
of the Jeffrey Epstein saga?

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:15.060
It feels like, I'm not familiar with Harvard's response,

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:20.060
but MIT's response seemed to fire a few scapegoats

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:23.500
and it didn't seem like a genuine response

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:29.300
to the evils that human beings are capable of,

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:33.100
sort of like rising to the surface,

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:35.380
the description in a fully transparent way

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:38.100
of all the interactions that happened with Jeffrey Epstein

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.780
and what that means, yeah,

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:44.140
what that means about the role of money in universities,

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:46.580
what that means about just human beings in power.

01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:50.900
Money is essential to run a university.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.380
One of the reasons it's essential

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:56.340
is because the university is artificially,

01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:00.500
artificially requires huge amounts of money,

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:03.180
and that's probably because of the administrative army

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:07.220
that they support.

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:10.100
And they would be less dependent

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:12.100
on the Jeffrey Epstein's of the world

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.300
if they didn't have,

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:17.900
so it's sort of all part of the same circle.

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:19.900
But there's a tension here.

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.820
You're saying we shouldn't be putting a morals test

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.100
on money, but actually if you make,

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:28.460
if you expand the amount of money needed

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:29.620
to run the university,

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:31.900
you're going to make less and less,

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:33.700
more and more unethical decisions

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:34.540
in terms of accepting money.

01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:37.020
Correct, and since then, I am flexible enough

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:39.100
to say that I don't think I would name a building

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.700
after somebody who is truly evil.

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:44.620
I think the university has the right

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:48.900
to limit the naming rights for a donor.

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:53.940
If I was an absolutist, I would not even say that.

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:55.380
I'm not an absolutist.

01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:00.060
I have my limits, and that's one of them.

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:03.740
The Jeffrey Epstein Biological Laboratory,

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.020
it's a little bit much.

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:09.140
It feels like there should be a requirement on,

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:10.940
there should be moral requirements

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:13.540
on who to accept money from,

01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:15.500
but the question is, the concern you have

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:19.900
is about who gets to decide, and what's the alternative?

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:22.380
Correct, I think there is no alternative.

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:25.700
I think that turning down donation

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:30.420
because you don't approve of the conduct of the donor

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:32.020
is a Pandora's box.

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.860
But I'm just sickened by the fact

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:40.660
that an evil human being was allowed to walk

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:42.780
in the halls of a university I love.

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:46.100
So what do we do with that?

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:49.020
Well, are you telling me that none of the students are evil?

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.060
Are you telling me none of the faculty members are evil?

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:53.900
Are you telling me none of the administrators are evil?

01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:58.500
But that doesn't, sure, sure.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:02.420
So scapegoating, saying that Jeffrey Epstein is evil

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:05.780
can help us forget, can aid us in forgetting

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:07.740
that there is other evil in the world,

01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:11.580
and some of it might be roaming still,

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.540
the halls of MIT and Harvard.

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:15.820
Hey, listen, I won't tell you the name,

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:19.140
but I represented somebody in the MIT administration

01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:23.460
a few years ago who was charged with sexual

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:26.220
improprieties against students.

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.340
And as a lawyer, I represented that person.

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:34.060
People say to me, how could you represent,

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.580
some of the people I represent are bad people.

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:38.380
See, how can you represent them?

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.900
I said, well, if I was a cardiologist

01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.860
and this person had a heart attack on the street

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:47.660
and I didn't deliver CPR, I would have my license taken away.

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:50.860
I'm a lawyer, the only difference between my obligation

01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:53.700
and the doctor's obligation is the Constitution

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.820
gives people the right to assistance of counsel.

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:57.940
They don't have, the Constitution says nothing

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:00.420
about the assistance of cardiologists.

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:04.580
I have a very high duty to represent unpopular people.

01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:09.100
Well, I think I apply the same test to the college donors.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.620
The university should not have a morals test

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:15.380
whose money to take.

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:21.020
I do draw a line about naming rights of buildings.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:26.780
And as I say, that's an inconsistency with my absolutism,

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:30.580
but I just, emotionally, I just can't deal with having,

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:33.420
as I said, the Jeffrey Epstein Biological Laboratory.

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:36.220
Well, for me, emotionally, there's nothing

01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:38.460
that sickens me more in the university

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:39.900
than the abuse of power.

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:42.660
Right, and there's an awful lot of people

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.540
who abuse power at the university.

01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:47.940
And especially when it comes to abuse power over students.

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:51.460
So sexual harassment, so in the realm of sexual

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:54.700
abuse of power, and all kinds of other.

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:58.420
Well, it is a crime to use one's power position

01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:00.700
in order to take sexual advantage of a student.

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:01.620
It's a crime.

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:03.340
Yeah.

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:05.020
This is not a close question.

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:08.540
Yeah, but there's a legal crime,

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:12.020
and there's a deeply ethical crime,

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:15.100
and there's an emotional response that I have.

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:19.300
You are a good lawyer, and perhaps a good man,

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:23.420
to want to defend some folks who are evil in this world.

01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:26.140
I don't think I have that emotional fortitude.

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:27.980
Well, then you shouldn't be a criminal defense lawyer

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.300
or a cardiologist.

01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:31.340
I think you're right.

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:36.300
I'm still deeply sickened by Jeffrey Epstein

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:39.300
and the faculty, the administration,

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.980
that still might be in these great American universities

01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:45.300
that are abusing their power in small ways and big ways.

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.940
But that's human nature.

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:48.540
You get a little bit of power,

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:51.140
and you're a bad man or a bad woman,

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:52.460
and you take advantage of it.

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:53.300
Yep.

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:54.860
We see that in the smallest of ways,

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.260
and in the biggest of ways.

01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:01.460
And institutions and regimes all across the world.

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:07.140
Boy, Harvey, it's a complicated situation.

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.820
Well, it's a complicated world,

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:11.300
and it's complicated to be a human being,

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:12.900
and this is nothing new.

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:16.060
And we should talk about it without restriction.

01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:19.420
All right, just to linger on liberal arts.

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:22.820
In 2014, and probably still today,

01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:25.540
you wrote that liberals are killing the liberal arts.

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:26.380
Yes.

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:27.540
So can you explain?

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:30.220
Yes, the problem with, I'm a political liberal.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:35.380
The problem with the political left

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:39.380
is that it has divided

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:43.780
between what's called progressives and liberals.

01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:47.140
Liberals are people of the left

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:50.060
who believe in the First Amendment,

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:54.060
an absolute First Amendment, and in due process of law.

01:08:55.060 --> 01:09:00.060
And the problem with what progressives now,

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.900
in the pursuit of equality,

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.900
what they view as equality,

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:10.020
they're willing to bend those rules.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:13.300
And this movement actually started in Brandeis.

01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:18.900
The critical, it's the critical race theory.

01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:23.940
It started, Herbert Marcuse was a professor at Brandeis,

01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:26.540
and he came up with this theory.

01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:30.380
The theory was this, this is right out of Warwell.

01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:33.900
In order to create true equality in a society

01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:35.540
where you have some downtrodden

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.980
and some who are the uber-mention,

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:43.300
in order to create real equality,

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:48.100
you have to reduce the rights of the upper classes

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:53.100
and artificially increase the rights of the lower classes.

01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:58.620
And that will produce out of unequal treatment,

01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:06.220
true equality will be attained.

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:07.740
This is nonsense.

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:13.380
The idea of discrimination,

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:16.900
producing true equality is nonsense.

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:21.740
My view is, as I've said earlier in our discussion,

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:26.740
that the way to increase the opportunities

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:33.500
for the lower classes is to give them real educations.

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:38.340
And until we do that, it's not gonna happen.

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:39.660
And in order to do that,

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:44.660
we have to overcome the problem of the teachers unions

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:48.900
at the elementary and secondary school levels.

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:52.340
And until we're willing to do that honestly

01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:55.580
and improve those schools,

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:58.780
we're gonna have a problem of large number

01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:02.340
of uneducated people who need a boost

01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:05.900
because we haven't given them proper educations.

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:06.740
What do you think about some

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.700
of the more controversial faculty in the world?

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:11.980
So an example, somebody I've spoken with many times

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:14.220
on mic and offline is Jordan Peterson.

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:16.260
I'm not sure if you're familiar with his work,

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:18.860
but he is an outspoken critic of,

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:20.820
or proponent of free speech on campus

01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:22.980
and he's been attacked quite a bit.

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.500
He's a controversial figure.

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:27.020
What's the role of the university

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:29.220
to protect the Jordan Petersons of the world?

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:32.020
I think the university has an absolute,

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.820
absolute, not relative, not worried that,

01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:39.460
absolute obligation to protect the academic freedom

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:43.260
of even the most controversial faculty members.

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:48.180
And you can imagine, out on a university campus,

01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:50.940
you have more people who are outliers

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:53.380
than you do in the general population.

01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.820
That's the hope at least.

01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:59.340
Hopefully, yeah.

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:03.260
And those outliers have to be protected.

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.500
They can't be pressured, they can't be fired,

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:11.540
they can't be disabled from spewing their views,

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:13.020
whether they're considered racist,

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:15.020
whether they're considered to be,

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:19.460
you know, promote an idea of human society

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.260
that's considered obnoxious.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:23.900
It doesn't matter.

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:28.060
If you can't have freedom of thought

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:31.300
on the college campuses, where can you?

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:34.140
You know, then we're lost as a society, we're lost.

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:37.540
And as an educational institution,

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:40.100
educational institutions no longer will educate,

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:42.100
they will indoctrinate.

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:44.180
That we have to avoid at all costs.

01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:46.620
And we should also remember that the outlier

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:49.900
might also be the only bearer of truth.

01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:53.420
So, in Nazi Germany speaking against the fascism,

01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:56.660
fascist regime, in communist Soviet Union

01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:00.420
speaking against communism, they might hold the key

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:03.660
to solving the ailments of that society.

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:04.940
Absolutely.

01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:07.060
And some of the most important discoveries

01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:08.340
in science, for example,

01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:13.740
were mocked at the beginning.

01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:16.700
We think of poor Charlie Darwin.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:21.700
Charlie, I see he is on nickname levels with you.

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:24.260
Well, because we're talking about these big topics

01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:26.460
of sexism, racism, and hate.

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:28.380
We should not forget about the smaller topics

01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:30.300
which might even have the much bigger impact,

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.700
which is what you're speaking to,

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:37.700
which is outlier ideas in science.

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:43.100
So, basically welcoming controversial ideas in science.

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:44.900
And by controversial, I mean,

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:48.780
just stuff that most of the community doesn't agree on,

01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:50.820
it doesn't actually harm anyone at all.

01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:53.100
But even then, there's always pressure.

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:54.740
One of the things I'm really concerned about

01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:58.180
is how little power young faculty have.

01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:01.100
That there's a kind of hierarchy, seniority,

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:05.500
that universities have, empowered by the administration.

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.980
Where young faculty that come in,

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.900
they're kind of...

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.780
Pre tenure.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:16.100
Yeah, there's a process in chasing tenure

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:18.700
where you're kind of supposed to behave.

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:21.900
And there's an incentive to kind of fit in

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.740
and to not be an outcast.

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:25.380
And that's a really huge problem

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:30.380
because oftentimes the youth is when the craziest,

01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:32.740
the biggest ideas, the revolutionary ideas come.

01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:37.500
And if you're forced to behave and fit in and not speak out,

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.780
then even in the realm of science,

01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:41.380
the innovation is stifled.

01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:45.980
Well, now you trigger my, having to tell you this story.

01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:48.540
That you're triggered, this is good.

01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:52.700
In the mid-1980s, I decided to take a four-month sabbatical

01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:53.980
from my law practice.

01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:55.300
Yes.

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:58.220
Professor James Vorenberg, who was at the time

01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:01.420
Dean of the Harvard Law School, heard about it.

01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:05.540
Heard about it from his wife, Elizabeth Betty Vorenberg,

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:06.780
whom I was very friendly with

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:08.980
because we were both on the ACLU,

01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:11.660
the ACLU of Massachusetts Board at the time.

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:17.700
And so Betty told Jim that Harvey was taking a sabbatical.

01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:22.420
Jim called Harvey and asked Harvey

01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:23.980
if he would like to teach a course

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:25.740
at the Harvard Law School

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:30.740
because there was nobody who had teaching criminal law

01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:32.980
from the perspective of somebody

01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:35.940
who actually was in court, litigated.

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:37.260
It was all theoretical.

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.620
I said, sure, I'll do it.

01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:43.380
So I taught a semester at Harvard Law School.

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:46.500
The student evaluations were fabulous.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:47.340
Why?

01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:48.260
Because it was really interesting.

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:51.300
They were hearing a lawyer who was talking about real cases.

01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:54.020
I actually brought in a few of my clients

01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.980
in some of the classes.

01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:58.700
And so Jim called me and said,

01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:01.300
Harvey, the students love this course.

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.620
I'd like to offer you a tenure-track position

01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:05.460
at the law school.

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:06.740
I'd like to give up your law practice.

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:08.540
I turned him down.

01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:11.260
He said, did you just say no?

01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:13.580
I said, yes, I said no.

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:14.580
He said, how come?

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:18.460
He says, nobody in my administration

01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:20.820
has ever turned down a tenure-track offer

01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:22.580
at Harvard Law School.

01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:27.100
I said, because I could see that I'm not a good fit,

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:32.100
that the administrators overrun the place,

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:35.020
that faculty members, especially untenured,

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:37.260
who are afraid to say things

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:40.580
that might not help them in the tenure quest.

01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:45.260
It's not a good fit for me.

01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:47.900
You saw this in the mid-1980s already.

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:50.500
Yes, 1985.

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.900
And I went back to my law practice.

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:58.900
I did not want to get into this meat grinder that I saw.

01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:04.100
Actually, I started to see before the turn of the century

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:07.140
because I co-authored the Shadow University in 98

01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:11.460
and then co-founded FIRE in 99.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:14.820
I'm an early student of this phenomenon.

01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:17.860
What are some other aspects of the book,

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:21.540
The Shadow University, that we may have not covered?

01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:23.460
Well, let me tell you a story.

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:25.340
I believe I tell it in The Shadow University

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:26.660
because it was part of.

01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:28.500
I'm loving these stories, Harry.

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.660
The stories are fabulous.

01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:32.100
Let me tell you a story of,

01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:37.660
I did a tour of the country, visiting campuses.

01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:42.460
I visited a college called Hamline University.

01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:45.100
I believe it was in Indiana or Illinois,

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:47.180
somewhere in the Midwest.

01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:50.500
And I attended a freshman orientation.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.780
Now listen to this.

01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.580
This was a freshman orientation.

01:17:55.580 --> 01:18:00.220
The administrators, the deans and the deanettes

01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:02.860
and the deputy assistant deans and deanettes,

01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:06.540
the third deputy assistant deans and deanettes,

01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:10.340
lined the students up according to their skin hues.

01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:11.420
Oh, boy.

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:16.180
The blonde, blue-eyed white folks were at one end.

01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:18.180
The darkest African-Americans

01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:26.020
whose bloodlines had not yet been mixed

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:29.940
with any of the whites on the other end.

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:33.220
And the exercise was you had to tell

01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:37.420
how your race affected your success in life

01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:38.780
up until that point.

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:44.860
I thought it was the most demeaning thing

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:47.340
that I could imagine.

01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:48.660
Demeaning.

01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:50.260
I thought to myself,

01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:53.060
they could do the same about sexual orientation.

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:55.060
They could do the same about religion.

01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:57.060
They could do the same about national origin.

01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:59.980
It would be demeaning no matter what.

01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:03.300
And the students actually

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:08.260
verbalized how their race

01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:10.540
had either been a plus or a minus.

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:11.380
They did it.

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:12.620
They did.

01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:14.340
And I thought it was so demeaning,

01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:18.660
it just confirmed all of my distaste

01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:22.340
for this kind of approach.

01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:24.180
Let me ask you from the interviewer seat.

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:28.420
So I get to do this podcast

01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:32.540
and I often have to think about giving a large platform

01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:37.220
and having a conversation with very controversial figures.

01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:41.780
And the level of controversy has been slowly increasing.

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:46.780
What's the role of this medium to you?

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:50.340
This medium of speech between two people

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:52.180
and me speaking with a controversial figure,

01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:54.220
me or some other interviewer.

01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:56.500
What's the role of giving platform

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.940
to controversial figures?

01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:02.580
Say members of the KKK or dictators,

01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:05.860
people who are seen as evil.

01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:09.660
Well, we want to face the world with reality.

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:13.620
And the reality is that there are some unpleasantness,

01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:16.180
unpleasantnesses in the world.

01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:18.100
Running from genocide

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:20.620
right through to ordinary discrimination

01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:23.660
to offensiveness.

01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:26.900
It's the real world as we know it exists.

01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:28.420
Are we afraid to say it?

01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:31.980
Do we want to make people think that we live in a world

01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:34.060
where those words are not used,

01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:36.580
where those animosities don't exist?

01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:39.220
The answer is no.

01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:40.380
But you can whitewash,

01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.020
you can normalize the use of those words

01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:45.860
and you can whitewash the acceptability of certain leaders.

01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:49.060
So for example, interviewing Hitler in 1938,

01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:52.100
1935, 1936, 1937, 38,

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:54.100
those are all different dynamics there.

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:57.060
But you can normalize this person

01:20:57.060 --> 01:21:00.460
and in so doing create enormous harm.

01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:02.460
Well, see, I don't see it as normalizing.

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:04.660
I see it as exposing.

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:07.780
If more people had taken mankind seriously,

01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:11.820
Franklin Roosevelt would have acted much sooner.

01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:15.580
He only got us into the war,

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.740
asked Congress to get us into the war

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:20.860
when the Japanese made the mistake of attacking Pearl Harbor.

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:25.900
But there were some people in the State Department,

01:21:25.900 --> 01:21:27.700
there were some people in the administration

01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:31.260
who were trying to get Roosevelt

01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:33.980
to see what Hitler was really like

01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:36.100
and he was blind to it.

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:37.780
This was one of the greatest presidents

01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:39.620
the United States ever had.

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:44.620
He was blind to it until the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.

01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:50.140
So I think that words, unpleasant ideas,

01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:51.860
as expressed by Rhodes,

01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:56.860
are essential for communicating fact and truth and reality.

01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:02.980
And that's why I think that we should not whitewash language.

01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:04.780
We should not whitewash the fact

01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:08.340
that Jeffrey Epstein was pretty close to MIT.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.180
And Harvard.

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:10.020
And Harvard.

01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:10.980
And Harvard.

01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:17.340
And reality actually means something.

01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:18.980
Yeah, but from the role of the interviewer,

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:21.620
that's something I have to think a lot about.

01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:24.500
Whether interviewing Hitler, you said exposing.

01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:29.820
I think it's hard to know what Hitler's like in a room,

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:32.100
but it's also hard to know,

01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.420
I've never met Jeffrey Epstein,

01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:36.740
it's hard to know what Jeffrey Epstein's like in a room,

01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:39.620
but I imagine to some degree they're charismatic figures.

01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:43.020
So exposing them in the interview setting

01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:44.940
is not an easy task.

01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:49.300
Well, interviewing is not an easy job.

01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:50.140
Yeah.

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:54.500
It's not a good idea to have an interviewer be an idiot.

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.460
I know exactly what you're saying

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:03.380
and I know why you're looking at me directly as you say it.

01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:04.860
I appreciate that, Harvey.

01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:08.620
All right, let me ask about your friend,

01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:12.380
your colleague, Alan Dershowitz.

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:14.260
And I'll also ask about your review

01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:15.500
of his most recent book.

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:17.420
But before then, it'd be interesting

01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:21.660
to ask what you think of him as a human being, as a lawyer.

01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:24.100
He's quite an interesting case.

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:25.860
He's represented some of the most controversial

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:26.700
figures in history.

01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:27.860
Including Jeffrey Epstein.

01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:30.180
Including Jeffrey Epstein, Mike Tyson,

01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:34.340
Julian Assange, Jim Baker, and Jeffrey Epstein,

01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:36.380
and even Donald Trump.

01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:38.140
So he's an interesting figure.

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:39.500
What do you think about that?

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:40.340
Klaus von Buelow.

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:42.460
What do you think?

01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:44.660
What do you think about him as a human being,

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.660
as a lawyer, what he represents

01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:48.900
in terms of values and ideals?

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:51.220
Well, he's a criminal defense lawyer.

01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:53.780
And the job of a criminal defense lawyer

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:56.380
is to represent, accuse criminals.

01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:01.100
He is a lifelong Democrat.

01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:03.060
He didn't represent Trump

01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:05.220
because he agrees with him politically.

01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:06.740
Voted for Hillary, I believe you wrote.

01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:08.820
He voted for Hillary, yes.

01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:10.620
That's what he says, and I absolutely believe it.

01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:12.820
He's a liberal Democrat.

01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:17.980
But he's a criminal defense lawyer as well as a professor.

01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:22.980
And I've represented some very nasty people in my career.

01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:28.060
I wouldn't go out for coffee with them,

01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:31.540
but they have constitutional rights to representation.

01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:33.860
And you take that very seriously.

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:36.660
Yes, you notice something that people don't understand,

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:38.900
about Dershowitz.

01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:41.580
He was asked by Trump to represent him

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:43.980
in the second impeachment as well.

01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:45.820
He turned him down.

01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.580
Why do you think he turned him down?

01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:49.580
So people should know he represented Trump

01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:50.540
in the first impeachment trial.

01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:52.980
He represented him only in the first.

01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:55.380
And he was successful in when Trump was impeached

01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:57.780
the second time, he asked Allen to represent him.

01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:01.500
Allen has had a lifelong policy

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:05.460
of only representing somebody once, never twice.

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:06.860
Why?

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:09.700
Because he never wanted to be house counsel to the mafia.

01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:15.620
And so he, early on, had this position.

01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:18.060
He only represented somebody once.

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:22.220
The mafia wants a lawyer who's an in-house counsel

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:24.460
who represents them in all their cases.

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.100
So that's the reason.

01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:28.860
And now Allen never publicly explained

01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:29.900
that I know it's a fact,

01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:31.580
because I've known from the day

01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:34.020
that we met at Harvard Law School, 1964.

01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:36.100
He was a first-year professor.

01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:37.620
I was a first-year student.

01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:40.460
We both had Brooklyn accidents, and we hit it off.

01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:43.500
We've been close friends ever since.

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:45.820
So there's some kind of unethical line that's crossed

01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:49.300
when you continuously represent a client.

01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:52.660
Yeah, he thought it was not so much an ethical line.

01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:55.260
You have a right to represent mafia people.

01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:56.900
But he didn't want to be house counsel.

01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:59.140
He didn't want to be, you know,

01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:00.980
have them ask him for advice

01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:03.260
in advance of what they were doing.

01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:06.100
He was willing to represent somebody once,

01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:07.740
no matter how awful.

01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:11.220
Klaus von Buelow was accused of killing his wife.

01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:12.980
These are pretty nasty people.

01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:19.740
But he didn't want to be house counsel to any of them.

01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:24.100
So you wrote a review of Allen Dershowitz's new book

01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:25.420
on Donald Trump.

01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:27.300
The title of that book is Get Trump,

01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:29.580
The Threat to Civil Liberties Due Process

01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:32.300
and Our Constitutional Rule of Law.

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:35.220
Can you summarize this book and your review of it?

01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:36.820
Yes, by the way, I co-authored it

01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:39.740
with my research assistant who's sitting right here.

01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:40.580
Emily.

01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:41.420
Yes.

01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:47.420
And I thought that the book was another example

01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:51.860
of the fact that everybody is entitled to a defense

01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:56.140
and that Allen's being involved with Trump

01:26:56.140 --> 01:26:57.380
was purely professional.

01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:58.580
It was not political.

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.140
It was not philosophical.

01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:05.980
And I thought that the fact that he was being criticized,

01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:10.220
he was being shunned because of his connection to Trump,

01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:13.820
I found very interesting that this is a guy

01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:15.460
who represented such,

01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:22.660
I call them distasteful figures as Klaus von Buelow,

01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:27.300
as Mike Tyson,

01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:32.340
as O.J. Simpson, as Sheldon Siegel.

01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:39.580
And when he was considered to be a skillful lawyer,

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:41.940
made his reputation,

01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:45.140
and then he represents Donald Trump,

01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:47.460
who to my knowledge never killed anybody,

01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:52.420
and he's suddenly shunned.

01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:56.140
I thought the hypocrisy of it, the political preening

01:27:56.980 --> 01:28:00.740
was very distasteful to me.

01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:04.300
And it was not only because he was my friend.

01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:07.100
If he wasn't my friend, I think I'd have the same view.

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:13.700
The holier-than-thou nonsense, the hypocrisy of it.

01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:18.180
They wouldn't talk to him on Malthus Vien now.

01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:19.660
Allen and I are different.

01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:21.140
I'm not so sensitive.

01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:25.140
If someone doesn't want to talk to me, no problem,

01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:26.620
no problem at all.

01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:31.940
But Allen is, considering how controversial

01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:33.420
his life has been.

01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:34.500
He's somewhat sensitive.

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:37.780
He's somewhat sensitive, and I've kept telling Allen,

01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:40.340
Allen, don't let it get to you.

01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:42.300
I can relate, I can definitely relate.

01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:44.140
Taking on some controversial conversations

01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:45.380
still wear my heart on my sleeve.

01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:47.260
It hurts, all of it hurts.

01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:49.020
But maybe the pain makes you a better

01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:52.060
student of human nature.

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:53.460
Maybe that's the case for him.

01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:57.420
Nevertheless, the book makes a complicated

01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:59.180
and I think an interesting point.

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:02.500
He opens the book with,

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:04.900
now that Donald Trump has announced his candidacy

01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:06.980
for re-election as president,

01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:09.860
the unremitting efforts by his political opponents

01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:13.340
to, quote, get him, to stop him from running

01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:15.380
at any cost will only increase.

01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:18.220
These efforts may pose the most significant threat

01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:20.540
to civil liberties since McCarthyism.

01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:21.580
So is he right?

01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:23.220
He's absolutely right.

01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:26.820
Because these attempted, for example,

01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:29.540
the prosecution, the one prosecution

01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:32.020
that has been brought now is Alvin Bragg

01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:33.980
in the Manhattan.

01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:35.900
I have looked at that and I don't believe

01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:38.020
that Trump has committed a crime.

01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:41.700
And yet, Bragg was pressured to bring that.

01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:43.620
People in his office were threatening to quit

01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:45.020
if he didn't indict.

01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:47.500
Wholly improper, wholly unethical.

01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:50.620
And he's gonna lose the case.

01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:52.180
Has Trump committed crimes?

01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:53.060
Yes.

01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:54.700
Mostly they're tax crimes.

01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:00.140
He has cheated on taxes his whole career

01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:01.980
as far as I could tell.

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:06.900
He could easily be indicted for state and federal taxes.

01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:09.540
But they're not as sexy.

01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:13.980
And I think that he's become a target

01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:20.380
by ambitious politicians, ambitious prosecutors.

01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:24.500
He has gotten some sympathy, which he doesn't deserve.

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:28.260
And a lot of it is, pardon the phrase,

01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:30.180
political correctness.

01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:33.860
The better people are not supposed to be Trumpers.

01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:39.020
I had an interesting experience about Trump.

01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:41.380
I had two interesting experiences.

01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:44.060
The more recent one was I was in the house

01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:49.060
of Lawrence Summers, the former president of Harvard,

01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:52.460
who was driven out by political correctness, by the way.

01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:54.780
He insulted women biologists.

01:30:56.820 --> 01:31:01.260
I was in his house when he was still president of Harvard

01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:07.580
when the Trump-Hillary Clinton contest took place.

01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:11.900
And I was with Elsa.

01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:18.100
We were invited to Summers' house in Brookline.

01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:23.780
And it looked like Hillary was gonna win.

01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:26.820
And the Harvard faculty members, they were all celebrating.

01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:29.460
They were all figuring out what their cabinet positions

01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:31.900
were gonna be, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:34.860
And then about 11.30 at night, all of a sudden,

01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:37.980
it was announced that in terms of electoral votes,

01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:41.100
Trump had just eeked out a victory,

01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:43.380
that Hillary beat him in the popular vote,

01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:48.060
but he had won the electoral college.

01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:50.900
There was immediate depression.

01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:56.460
Meaning it was like quiet over the room.

01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:59.740
The room became absolutely stone silent.

01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:05.460
And they were all disappointed.

01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:07.460
Well, that was a memorable moment.

01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:11.060
And it told me that they were a little bit

01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:16.060
too overconfident and they were savoring

01:32:16.820 --> 01:32:20.100
being part of a presidential administration.

01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:22.860
Ambition had been thwarted.

01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:27.540
I'm not a great fan of preening ambition.

01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:30.340
I think it blinds people to realities.

01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:32.540
And the resulting arrogance from such ambition.

01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:34.500
And the arrogance, yes.

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:36.820
It's one of the reasons I didn't accept

01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:40.180
Jim Vorenberg's offer to be part of the academic community.

01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:41.540
I mean, I represent professors.

01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:42.860
I have friends who are professors.

01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:43.860
I represent students.

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:45.620
I have friends who are students.

01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:50.460
And I have a great regard for universities

01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:51.860
and higher education.

01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:55.620
But I was not about to become part of a culture.

01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:57.820
I thought that it was not good for me

01:32:57.820 --> 01:33:00.660
and not good for the institution either.

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:02.900
That can, a culture that can breed arrogance.

01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:03.740
Yes.

01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:04.740
Self-importance.

01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.180
Yep.

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:09.380
And I, in a sense, the election of Donald Trump

01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:11.460
was a big FU to such.

01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:12.300
Correct.

01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:17.460
Which is why I think he managed to pull it off.

01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:20.860
To jump topics a little bit.

01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:23.940
What do you think about something you've written about?

01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.460
What do you think about the mass surveillance programs

01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:30.100
by the NSA and also probably by other organizations,

01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:32.380
CIA, FBI, and others?

01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:36.540
And broadly, what do you think about

01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:40.020
the importance of privacy for the American citizen?

01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:45.020
Okay, I believe that the FBI should be abolished

01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:50.580
because I believe that its culture was so corrupted

01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:55.580
by its first director, John Edgar Hoover, J. Edgar Hoover,

01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:02.620
that it is impossible to reform the FBI

01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:05.380
to make its agents honest,

01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:09.700
to force them to obey the Constitution,

01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:13.420
the first, fourth, and fifth amendments especially.

01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:19.140
And it's a culture that cannot be changed.

01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:22.460
Hoover established the culture

01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:26.660
and no FBI director since has been able to change it.

01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:32.740
If you go online, I did on YouTube a video

01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:35.740
for the ACLU of Massachusetts.

01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:37.060
It was when I was on the board.

01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:39.060
It was probably when I was president of the board.

01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:41.220
I was president of the board for two years.

01:34:41.220 --> 01:34:44.340
I was on the board for 20 years.

01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:48.700
And I did a video about advising people

01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:51.940
to never, ever, ever talk to an FBI agent

01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:54.500
when they come knocking on your door.

01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:57.500
Can you briefly explain the intuition?

01:34:57.500 --> 01:34:58.340
Yes.

01:34:58.340 --> 01:34:59.460
Why not to talk to an FBI agent?

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:01.340
They have a system.

01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:03.940
When they come in and interview you,

01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:06.220
two agents show up, never one.

01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:09.580
One asks the question, the other one takes notes.

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:11.860
The note-taking agent takes notes

01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:13.260
and it goes back to the office

01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:17.940
and types up a report called a Form 302,

01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:22.940
which is the official record of what was asked and answered.

01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:30.140
So when I have a client interviewed by the FBI,

01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:35.140
I show up and I always agree on the fact

01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:38.460
that I almost always agree to the interview.

01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:43.660
But I bring a tape recorder and I say,

01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:45.100
all right, I'm gonna tape this.

01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:47.500
And they say, well, by regulation,

01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:50.020
we're not allowed to do the interview of his tape.

01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:53.900
The record is the 302.

01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:55.620
The agent is taking notes.

01:35:55.620 --> 01:35:58.900
I say, well, I have a policy too.

01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:01.860
My policy is to never allow a client to be interviewed

01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:03.100
unless it's recorded.

01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:05.580
So it's unfortunate,

01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:07.420
but we're gonna have to end this meeting

01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:09.220
and the agents get up and leave.

01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:15.220
And I've never seen a Form 302

01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:17.580
that I consider to be accurate.

01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:22.580
The agents write down what they wish you had said

01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:24.620
rather than what you said.

01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:28.740
It is a wholly corrupt organization

01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:31.620
that has not gotten any better since Hoover died.

01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:35.580
And fundamentally, the corruption is in the culture

01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:40.580
that is resisting the Constitution of the United States

01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:42.380
the first and fourth and fifth.

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:46.060
Correct, it's not financial corruption.

01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:49.540
It is corruption of the mission.

01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:53.420
And I think it should be abolished.

01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:56.700
And if we need a federal investigative agency,

01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:59.060
should be a new name, a new culture,

01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:02.460
wholly new members, a new director.

01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:07.460
And it's impossible to reform the FBI.

01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:11.180
Can you elaborate on what exactly is broken about the FBI?

01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:16.180
Is it the famous saying from Stalin's KGB head,

01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:20.700
Barry, show me the man and I'll show you the crime?

01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:21.540
Right.

01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:23.100
Is it that kind of process of-

01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:24.260
It's that kind of process.

01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:25.580
They decide who's guilty

01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:27.660
and then they go about concocting a case

01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:31.740
against the person who they want to get.

01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:34.420
So the goal is not to find the truth or-

01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:37.780
It's to solve the case and close it

01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:40.300
and enhance their reputations.

01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:43.860
But to show that an innocent man is guilty

01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:46.980
is also solving the case from their perspective.

01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:52.860
So to falsely convict or falsely imprison an innocent man

01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:55.540
is also solving the case.

01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:57.020
Well, it closes the case

01:37:57.020 --> 01:37:59.820
if they falsely imprison an innocent man.

01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:02.380
They're interested in closing cases.

01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:03.420
So that's the FBI,

01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:07.180
but broadly speaking about the surveillance aspect of this,

01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:11.020
what are your views on the right

01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:13.820
that an American citizen has to privacy?

01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:18.260
Well, wiretapping and electronic surveillance

01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:20.260
are very, very intrusive.

01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:25.180
And I think that the circumstance

01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:28.860
that these tools are used should be narrowed.

01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:33.020
For example, they're used in a lot of drug cases.

01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:36.740
Since I don't think drugs should be illegal in any event,

01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:40.380
I certainly think that it's a terrible violation of privacy

01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:45.380
to use wiretapping in a drug case.

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:49.220
I could see it in cases of murder,

01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:55.100
possibly in cases of serious extortion,

01:38:56.140 --> 01:39:00.420
but on other kinds of crimes where they wiretapped,

01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:01.780
especially drug cases,

01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:04.220
I believe drugs should all be legalized anyway.

01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:10.780
I think the price we pay as a society is not worth it.

01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:17.260
On the Wikipedia page for nothing to hide, you're cited.

01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:18.820
In fact, your book that you gave me today,

01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:21.380
Three Felonies a Day, is cited.

01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:22.780
So nothing to hide argument.

01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:26.620
That's an argument that if you're a well-behaved citizen,

01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:28.620
you have nothing to hide,

01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:30.980
and therefore your privacy can be violated.

01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:34.460
Well, the problem is that under the federal criminal code,

01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:37.980
particularly the federal criminal code,

01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:43.940
it is very easy to be charged with a crime.

01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:44.780
Now, why?

01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:48.060
Under the Constitution,

01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:50.100
the federal government does not have

01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:53.300
plenary criminal jurisdiction.

01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:54.500
That's up to the state.

01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:59.980
How is it that the feds indict

01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:02.260
in so many areas of American life?

01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:06.900
It's because the Supreme Court has allowed the following

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:11.060
absolutely insane situation to prevail.

01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:13.460
Anything can be made a federal crime

01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:17.220
if in the course of the commission of the crime,

01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:23.660
the means of interstate communication or travel are used.

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:27.900
That means that if you commit a crime,

01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:30.980
which ordinarily would be a state crime,

01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:34.940
and you use the telephone or you send a letter,

01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:37.260
it suddenly becomes federal.

01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:40.380
That means that the limitation that the founding fathers

01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:44.100
who wrote the Constitution intended

01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:48.100
to keep the feds out of daily life

01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:51.820
and to give that jurisdiction to the state

01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:54.420
has been completely thwarted.

01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:58.420
Because I can't think of a case

01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:01.340
where somebody doesn't use the telephone

01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:04.540
in the course of the commission of the crime.

01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:06.260
The feds doesn't use the telephone

01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:09.980
in the course of planning,

01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:13.180
discussing something that's arguably criminal.

01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:18.220
And so this limited authority, the federal government,

01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:25.540
to bring charges in criminal cases is illusory.

01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:28.420
The feds can indict a ham sandwich.

01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:31.220
So basically everybody's guilty.

01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:36.220
And if the feds wanna bring you in, they can.

01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:37.700
They can find a way.

01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:42.700
And that allows them to terrorize people who are dissidents.

01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:43.900
Yeah.

01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:47.540
What is broken, what works

01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:49.500
about the American criminal justice system

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:51.180
from your perspective?

01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:52.180
The jury system.

01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:53.020
The jury system?

01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:53.860
Yes.

01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:54.900
You like the jury system.

01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:57.340
Everyday citizens representing.

01:41:57.340 --> 01:42:01.500
12 ordinary people have to agree unanimously

01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:04.140
in order to convict.

01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:07.940
What do you think about the highest court in the land,

01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:08.860
the Supreme Court?

01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:10.180
What works and what is broken

01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:12.300
about the Supreme Court as an institution?

01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:13.940
What are its strengths and weaknesses?

01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:18.940
Well, the Supreme Court is unfortunately fairly political.

01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:26.500
And the current Supreme Court is overruling precedence

01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:30.380
which it's really improper.

01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:34.460
I mean, precedence should not be overruled so easily.

01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:40.780
It's about to overrule the affirmative action.

01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:42.900
Now I'm opposed to affirmative action.

01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:46.420
I think I made that clear earlier in our discussion.

01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:49.060
But still it's a precedent

01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:52.980
and it should be given some respect.

01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:57.980
But in order to propagate a more conservative agenda,

01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:06.420
the court is treating precedent

01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:09.260
as if it doesn't have any role.

01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:11.700
And that's a huge mistake.

01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:16.500
Some of the congressmen on the democratic side

01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:19.020
are looking to enlarge the court

01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:22.500
in order to basically do what Franklin Roosevelt

01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:23.980
was not able to do.

01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:30.860
And that has changed the court's philosophy.

01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:34.340
But I think that's very short-sighted

01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:38.460
because this is a long game.

01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:40.900
This is a republic we have here.

01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:45.100
And anyone who tries to, for example,

01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:47.340
enlarge the court from nine to 12

01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:51.900
in order to get more liberals on the court,

01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:55.660
then some other administration will try to enlarge it

01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:59.020
from 12 to 15 to get more liberals on the court.

01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:03.820
You'd have a constant fiddling

01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:06.300
with a very important institution.

01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:08.420
So the law should have more lasting power

01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:11.420
than the bickering, the political bickering of the day.

01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:12.340
Correct.

01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:17.340
Let me ask you, you've lived one heck of a life

01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:20.340
and fought a lot of battles

01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:23.700
and continue to do so with the Harvard Board of Overseers.

01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:25.900
So first of all, thank you for that.

01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:30.260
But we're all human, we're all mortal.

01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:31.660
Do you ponder your death?

01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:32.940
Do you ponder your mortality?

01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:33.940
Are you afraid of it?

01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:34.900
Well, let me say this.

01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:37.300
My father died at 48.

01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:38.660
He died because he smoked.

01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:40.260
He died at 48 because he smoked

01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:42.540
four packs of camels a day.

01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:45.260
He got a massive heart attack at 43.

01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:48.980
He continued to smoke despite that.

01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:49.820
He died at 48.

01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:52.540
So I did not expect to live this long

01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:53.820
because I thought it was genetic.

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:55.540
It turns out it was cigarettes.

01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:57.620
So here I am.

01:44:57.620 --> 01:45:00.620
I'm going to be 81 on May 10th.

01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:02.620
I was born on May 10th, 1942.

01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:05.180
It was just Mother's Day coincidentally.

01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:09.740
And I realized I'm not going to live forever.

01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:14.740
I also take pride in the fact that I have demonstrated

01:45:15.060 --> 01:45:17.580
that a lawyer does not have to go to the law firm

01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:19.700
in order to manage to make it.

01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:22.220
You can make your own, write your own,

01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:24.220
what's the word, write your own ticket.

01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:26.580
I've done that.

01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:32.020
I agree that I've had an elite education.

01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:34.900
I went to Princeton and Harvard Law School.

01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:36.700
But I don't think you have to necessarily

01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:40.020
go to elite institutions in order to really make it.

01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:41.220
You need to work hard.

01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:44.220
But you shouldn't put yourself in a place

01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:47.140
where you're not going to feel comfortable

01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:48.980
and what's the word, empowered.

01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:53.020
Like I refuse to take Javorenberg's invitation

01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:57.540
for a tail-tracking position at Harvard Law School.

01:46:02.740 --> 01:46:06.900
I'll tell you one other story that illustrates this.

01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:10.220
I was originally pre-med.

01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:12.500
Freshman, it was about four years at Princeton

01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:14.140
I was in the pre-med program.

01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:14.980
Why?

01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:20.460
Because my parents wanted me to marry

01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:22.620
the daughter of our family physician.

01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:28.940
And the idea was, I was going to go to medical school.

01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:31.300
I was going to go into medical practice with him

01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:32.980
in Hackensack, New Jersey.

01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:37.140
We had moved from Brooklyn at the time.

01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:39.340
Long story why we had to move from Brooklyn.

01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:42.220
It had to do with my father's having a problem

01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:44.860
with the furrier's union and having his life threatened.

01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:48.220
And we moved to Maywood, New Jersey

01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:51.500
because he got a job in a fur shop in Passaic, New Jersey.

01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:55.940
And a family physician, they had three daughters.

01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:58.380
The oldest of whom was my age.

01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:00.100
She went to Hackensack High School.

01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:03.100
I went to Bogota High School.

01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:05.380
They're both in North Burden County.

01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:11.180
And the idea was that she and I were going to marry.

01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:14.740
I was going to become, I was going to go to medical school.

01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:19.100
I was going to take, become a partner of her father

01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:21.220
in his medical practice in Hackensack.

01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:25.140
When he retired, I was going to inherit the practice.

01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:28.940
This scenario was concocted by Carolyn's mother

01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:29.820
and my mother.

01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:35.940
In my sophomore year at Princeton,

01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:39.100
I won a fellowship to spend that summer

01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:42.060
between my sophomore and junior year in Paris.

01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:43.460
I was fluent by then.

01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:47.100
I had taken an accelerated French course

01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:48.700
my freshman and sophomore year.

01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:52.460
And I went to Paris.

01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:55.580
It was my first time out of the country.

01:47:57.380 --> 01:48:02.380
And I spent the entire summer working,

01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:05.340
supporting myself there.

01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:10.900
The airfare and I earned money for room board.

01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:15.020
And I thought about my life and I decided,

01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:17.340
number one, I didn't want to be a physician.

01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:19.220
I wanted to be a lawyer.

01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:22.140
Number two, I didn't want to marry Carolyn.

01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:24.820
And I came back.

01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:27.620
I changed from pre-med to pre-law.

01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:30.900
I broke up with Carolyn,

01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:33.580
who was by that time at school at Douglas

01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:34.940
right down the road from Princeton.

01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:40.060
And she had followed me or I had followed her.

01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:45.060
And my life suddenly took a wholly different term.

01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:50.020
So that summer in Paris,

01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:55.020
Paris had a outsize effect of my life.

01:48:56.620 --> 01:49:01.180
Every year, the Brattle Theater shows Casablanca

01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:04.260
where Bogart has this great line.

01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:07.220
He says, we'll always have Paris.

01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:11.340
And I think to myself, I always used to say to Elsa,

01:49:11.340 --> 01:49:14.740
we used to see Casablanca every Valentine's Day

01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:17.260
because it was such an important movie to me

01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:21.700
because Paris was transformative in my life.

01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:25.140
And we went to Paris every year during my vacation.

01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:26.980
We went to Paris.

01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:29.580
That was where she took some great pictures.

01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:33.260
The visor was this high and this high.

01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:34.980
We were hanging up in the house.

01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:38.140
And so I always,

01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:42.220
and even after Elsa's death,

01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:45.260
I've seen Casablanca twice now.

01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:47.500
She died in 2020.

01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:52.780
And I always think we'll always have Paris.

01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:55.300
We'll always have Paris.

01:49:57.780 --> 01:50:00.700
Well, Harvey, like I said,

01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:05.340
I hope you're very successful in your run

01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:07.140
for the Harvard Board of Overseers.

01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:11.260
I think what you stand for in the realm of freedom of speech

01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:15.660
is I think the thing that makes these universities

01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:18.060
great institutions in American culture.

01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:22.140
And I'll do everything I can to help you succeed.

01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:25.180
And I just am really grateful for all the work you've done.

01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:26.900
And I'm grateful that you would talk with me today.

01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:28.340
This is amazing.

01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:29.780
Thank you.

01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:31.300
Thanks for listening to this conversation

01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:33.340
with Harvey Silverglate.

01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:34.500

01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:39.140
And now let me leave you with some words

01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:40.540
from Harry S. Truman.

01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:43.700
Once the government is committed to the principle

01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:46.220
of silencing the voice of the opposition,

01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:48.140
it is only one way to go.

01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:49.540
And that is down the path

01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:52.100
of increasingly repressive measures

01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:55.580
until it becomes the source of terror to all its citizens

01:50:55.580 --> 01:50:59.140
and creates a country where everyone lives in fear.

01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:03.340
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
