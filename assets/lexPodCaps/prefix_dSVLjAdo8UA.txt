00:00.000 --> 00:07.360
something happened where they forced my hand and this is the only time that a Soviet agent

00:07.360 --> 00:12.120
was anywhere near me on the territory of the United States.

00:12.120 --> 00:20.680
So I'm waiting for the A train on a dark morning still in Queens and there's this man in a

00:20.680 --> 00:26.600
black trench coat comes up to me from my right and he whispers into my ears,

00:26.640 --> 00:29.520
you got to come back or else you're dead.

00:29.520 --> 00:35.800
The following is a conversation with Jack Barsky, a former KGB spy,

00:35.800 --> 00:42.440
author of Deep Undercover and the subject of an excellent podcast series called The Agent.

00:42.440 --> 00:48.240
There are very few people who have defected from the KGB and live to tell the story.

00:48.240 --> 00:54.320
It is one of the most powerful intelligence organizations in history and this conversation

00:54.320 --> 01:00.400
gives a window into its operation both from an ideological and psychological perspective,

01:00.400 --> 01:06.960
but also it tells the story of a man who lived one heck of an incredible life.

01:06.960 --> 01:10.920
This is the Lux Freedman Podcast. To support it,

01:10.920 --> 01:13.280
please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:13.280 --> 01:16.920
And now, dear friends, here's Jack Barsky.

01:16.920 --> 01:21.640
Let's start with a big basic question. What is the KGB?

01:22.440 --> 01:28.760
Right, so that is the Committee of State Security.

01:28.760 --> 01:33.240
Opossumist is a threat, right?

01:33.240 --> 01:33.520
Threat.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.920
Okay, and BS means?

01:34.920 --> 01:35.680
Without.

01:35.680 --> 01:36.200
Right.

01:36.200 --> 01:40.160
And I guess that directly translates to security, without threat.

01:40.160 --> 01:47.760
So, and don't exist anymore. It was disbanded when the Soviet Union fell apart and the successor

01:48.080 --> 01:56.360
agencies were, are now the SVR and the FSB. FSB, supposedly the equivalent to the FBI and SVR,

01:56.360 --> 02:04.240
the CIA, but the SVR is relatively weak and the FSB has taken on a lot of espionage and,

02:04.240 --> 02:08.760
you know, active measures and they're much bigger and stronger,

02:08.760 --> 02:16.360
but the most capable intelligence agency in Russia is the GRU, military intelligence.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.200
That nobody knows very much about.

02:18.200 --> 02:22.560
That's right. When I was in the KGB, I had no idea that there was military intelligence.

02:22.560 --> 02:28.760
Nobody ever mentioned anything like that. And by the way, I recently had the pleasure

02:28.760 --> 02:34.240
to give a talk at the DIA. When they reached out to me, I didn't know they existed either.

02:34.240 --> 02:39.760
Interesting. Yeah, that's always the question. If you want to be an intelligence agency,

02:39.760 --> 02:44.920
should the world know anything about you? Because in some sense, you want to create

02:44.920 --> 02:49.960
the legend in order to attract great competent individuals to work for you,

02:49.960 --> 02:56.560
but at the same time, you want it to be shrouded in complete mystery. If nobody knows you exist,

02:56.560 --> 03:02.640
you might be able to operate well as an intelligence agency. That is fascinating,

03:02.640 --> 03:11.720
but FSB is the thing that carries the flag of KGB. KGB being probably one of,

03:12.200 --> 03:19.480
if not the most famous, infamous, and powerful intelligence agencies ever.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.600
In history, yes. Absolutely, 100%.

03:21.600 --> 03:27.640
It was founded in 1954 after the death of Stalin. In writing your book,

03:27.640 --> 03:34.120
you looked back at the predecessors of the history. Is there some way in which the KGB

03:34.160 --> 03:43.400
is grounded in the culture, the spirit, the soul of its predecessors?

03:43.400 --> 03:50.280
Oh, absolutely. They just changed names, and they changed personnel rather frequently,

03:50.280 --> 03:56.160
and that had something to do with Stalin's paranoia. From between 1923,

03:56.160 --> 04:00.880
and I don't remember what, I think it may have been the NKVD at that time,

04:00.880 --> 04:11.840
it started as a Cheka, and then it became the GPU, the NKVD, but with those name changes,

04:11.840 --> 04:19.480
you also had changes at the top. Between 1923 and 1953 when Stalin died, that is 30 years,

04:19.480 --> 04:28.040
they had eight heads of intelligence, and of those eight, six were executed when they were

04:28.040 --> 04:37.360
placed. That's an indication that this was an organization that ate itself from the inside.

04:37.360 --> 04:42.560
The Soviet Union was the only dictatorship in history that did not rest its powers on

04:42.560 --> 04:48.480
the military. They rested its powers on the intelligence apparatus, and that thing was

04:48.480 --> 04:56.520
unstable, so you know where that leads. Eventually, if you rest your power on something that is made

04:56.520 --> 05:00.360
out of bricks that don't hold a lot of load, it will fall apart.

05:00.360 --> 05:07.080
On sand. Why was it unstable, would you say? What of human nature makes it unstable?

05:07.080 --> 05:16.440
It's the paranoia. Stalin was always worried about the most powerful people coming after him,

05:16.440 --> 05:23.760
so he proactively killed off heads of the KGB, and he had this great purge where he got rid of a lot

05:23.760 --> 05:32.560
of his generals, really capable generals, and that cost him dearly when World War II started,

05:32.560 --> 05:40.000
because he started off with a force that wasn't as capable as it could have been.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.520
Was it paranoia at all levels?

05:42.520 --> 05:48.680
I believe so. I believe so. It comes from the top, and so if the top doesn't trust you,

05:49.440 --> 06:00.160
you always have to worry about your peers snitching on you. I think we have a very similar

06:00.160 --> 06:09.840
situation in Russia today, and in this kind of atmosphere, the truth will never get to the top.

06:10.040 --> 06:19.000
So no matter what moral rules the organization operates under, trust is fundamental to its competence.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.560
Oh, absolutely, and I want to extend this to my own existence, and this is kind of strange.

06:25.560 --> 06:34.600
It's almost dichotomous, because I was running around lying to everybody, and I couldn't

06:34.640 --> 06:40.080
fundamentally be trusted, but the relationship that I had with the KGB was based on trust.

06:40.080 --> 06:44.720
If they don't trust me, they don't send me out, and if I don't trust them, I'm not going,

06:45.680 --> 06:49.600
and I eventually broke that trust, and they knew there was always that danger.

06:50.720 --> 06:55.840
They knew that because something about you or just something about human beings.

06:55.840 --> 07:04.080
No, there were hints about how long my assignment would be, so 10 to 12 years,

07:04.800 --> 07:11.360
and you see, it makes sense. I was becoming an American, and over time,

07:11.360 --> 07:17.920
I would become more and more American, and there was always a chance that I liked it more here than

07:17.920 --> 07:23.680
there, that I was really successful in what I was supposed to do, and it sort of happened,

07:23.680 --> 07:29.360
but in my case, it happened because I fathered a child who I didn't want to leave when they

07:29.360 --> 07:31.840
wanted me back. Love always screws up.

07:32.040 --> 07:32.240
Oh.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.240
Your employment competence, yes.

07:36.240 --> 07:45.200
You're absolutely right, but they thought that I had an anchor at home because I had a wife and

07:45.200 --> 07:55.600
a son at home, which you've got to worry about them if you defect, because in the past, the KGB

07:56.160 --> 08:00.080
would go after family ruthlessly.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.040
Including, perhaps, violence?

08:03.040 --> 08:03.520
Yeah.

08:03.520 --> 08:08.080
This is a hard question about the KGB because it's one of the most ruthless organizations,

08:08.080 --> 08:16.320
but in general, are there lines, KGB agents at every level of the hierarchy

08:18.240 --> 08:24.560
that they would not cross, political, legal, ethical, or does anything go to achieve the goal?

08:25.200 --> 08:35.120
I was only in touch with two types of agents, whether the technical experts, the ones that

08:35.120 --> 08:42.560
taught me tradecraft, and they were like engineers, and they were in charge of the secret writing,

08:42.560 --> 08:50.880
and the Morse code, shortwave radio reception, decryption, encryption, and that kind of stuff.

08:51.360 --> 08:54.160
Those were just doing their job,

08:56.000 --> 09:01.760
and the others, the ones that trained me, that prepared me for life in the United States,

09:03.120 --> 09:10.720
they were nice people. They were elegant people. I don't think they would not

09:13.360 --> 09:18.160
fit into the stereotype of the ruthless gun carrying agent.

09:18.800 --> 09:23.440
Is it possible that you would not be aware of the parts of the KGB?

09:24.160 --> 09:29.440
I mean, it's very modular. It's possible that you're not aware of the parts of the KGB that

09:29.440 --> 09:30.800
are the, quote unquote, muscle?

09:32.000 --> 09:39.120
I didn't know. I would find out afterwards, after I retired and started doing some research.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.000
I had no clue.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
So you're kind of operating in a bubble.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.280
Oh, very much so. I mean, this is what the KGB did really, really well.

09:47.280 --> 09:55.440
Comfort mentalization, and that was based on the communist movement while it was still

09:55.440 --> 10:02.560
underground. The cells were very small, so that maybe there were three, four members in one cell

10:02.560 --> 10:08.480
that knew one another, and then they had a liaison to another cell. So the bottom line is,

10:08.480 --> 10:15.680
if one of those folks were caught, they could maybe betray four people or three, something like

10:15.680 --> 10:24.560
that. And the KGB continued with that tradition. I have reason to believe that my handler, the

10:24.560 --> 10:30.720
person in Moscow that sort of directed me and made decisions what to do and where to go,

10:31.520 --> 10:34.960
never met me personally. There's no reason to, right?

10:36.720 --> 10:45.280
And this actually was a big advantage over other intelligence services, because you look

10:45.280 --> 10:50.720
at what the CIA does, everybody blabs. There's a lot of leaks coming out of American intelligence.

10:50.720 --> 10:54.080
I don't think there's as many leaks coming out of the Mossad.

10:54.080 --> 10:59.760
Strong words from Jack Barsky. That is a question I want to ask a little more systematically.

10:59.760 --> 11:05.680
Is there something unique about the KGB compared to the other intelligence agencies? Let's talk

11:06.240 --> 11:13.200
about the British intelligence, MI6, Mossad, CIA. Is there unique cultures,

11:13.840 --> 11:18.640
spirits, souls of the different organizations that maybe somehow connect to the structures

11:18.640 --> 11:23.600
of government, connect maybe the values of the people, those kinds of things?

11:23.600 --> 11:31.360
I believe we were all pretty much strong believers in communism and the future of the world being-

11:31.360 --> 11:32.080
In KGB.

11:32.080 --> 11:37.280
Yes. I think that unified us to a large degree, even the technicians.

11:37.280 --> 11:44.800
So even it wasn't something like, yeah, yeah, the parents believe this thing,

11:45.520 --> 11:49.200
but we know the truth. You really believe the story of communism.

11:49.200 --> 11:56.720
Absolutely did. And you need to look at the timeframe. The Soviet Union after World War II

11:57.600 --> 12:03.520
made quite a bit of progress in influencing the third world. I still remember

12:04.800 --> 12:10.320
when I was in middle school, we had a map, the map of the world, and it was color coded.

12:10.960 --> 12:18.160
So red was communism. That was the Soviet Union and the eastern states. And then blue was capitalism.

12:18.160 --> 12:24.800
And then we had green, which were the third world countries. And the green slowly turned pink

12:24.800 --> 12:30.400
because a lot of third world governments, like I'm looking at Angola, I'm looking at

12:32.240 --> 12:39.920
Vietnam. A lot of these countries were very sympathetic to the Soviet Union.

12:39.920 --> 12:46.160
And so we sort of knew that this would go on like that and eventually we would take over and

12:46.800 --> 12:54.480
you know, pretty much overtake, that was the myth, overtake the United States,

12:55.200 --> 13:01.040
not only militarily, but also in terms of industrial production and so forth.

13:01.760 --> 13:07.040
That was a stupid pipe dream. The military, it was a standoff, as we know.

13:07.920 --> 13:19.120
Well, stupid pipe dream. Hitler had a stupid pipe dream that he executed it exceptionally

13:19.120 --> 13:27.920
effectively on. If not for a handful of military mistakes, the world could look very different.

13:27.920 --> 13:34.640
Well, the biggest one being invading the Soviet Union, particularly at the time that he did it

13:34.640 --> 13:39.280
because he ran into the same thing that Napoleon ran into General Winter.

13:40.240 --> 13:47.920
Well, within, so Operation Barbarossa, within that, he could have made different decisions.

13:49.360 --> 13:55.600
For example, attacking, skipping Kiev and attacking Moscow directly, overthrowing the

13:55.600 --> 14:01.360
government. So marching, I guess that would be learning lessons from Napoleon as opposed to

14:01.680 --> 14:06.080
as opposed to a different kind of distribution of forces and then getting bogged down in the

14:06.080 --> 14:13.600
winter. But the point is these ambitions sometimes do, you know, the ambitions of empires sometimes

14:13.600 --> 14:18.000
do materialize in the growth and the building and the establishment of those empires. And those

14:18.000 --> 14:24.800
empires write the history books in such a way that we don't think of them as empires, or we certainly

14:24.800 --> 14:29.360
don't think of them as the bad guys. They write the history books, therefore they're the good guys.

14:30.320 --> 14:36.080
And right now, America has effectively written a book about the good guys. I happen to believe

14:36.080 --> 14:43.600
that book. But it's, we should be humbled and open minded to realize that that is in fact what is

14:43.600 --> 14:49.600
happening is effective empires write the history books and tell us stories and tell us propaganda

14:49.600 --> 14:54.560
and tell us narratives that we believe because we are human beings. And we love to get together

14:54.560 --> 14:59.520
and believe ideas. We love to dream of a beautiful world and try to build that beautiful world

14:59.520 --> 15:05.440
together. In the United States, that's a beautiful world, the freedom of respect of human rights,

15:06.000 --> 15:13.680
of all men are created equal, pursuit of happiness. You know, it always sounds good. If you look at

15:13.680 --> 15:21.280
what the dream of communism is, it sure as heck in its words on the surface sounds good, respect for

15:21.280 --> 15:27.840
the workers, the working class, the lower classes that have been trodden on, that have been stolen

15:27.840 --> 15:33.520
from by the powerful. They deserve to have the money, the power, the respect that they have

15:33.520 --> 15:39.760
earned through their hard work. Sounds great. And everybody gets along and we just have to,

15:39.760 --> 15:46.960
you know, all men are wonderful people. And if they go bad, it has something to do with the fact

15:46.960 --> 15:54.640
that they have they have been oppressed, right? And that dream just never worked out. And even

15:54.640 --> 16:00.080
even it is when you think about it, and I didn't think about it when you're young, you know, you

16:00.080 --> 16:07.600
just emotionally, you accept it. But when you think about it, somehow, that new wonderful

16:07.600 --> 16:13.680
organization has to organize itself. Even though Lenin predicted that the state eventually would

16:13.680 --> 16:18.320
go away. Well, how does it work? Then you have, like, anarchy, right? You have to have an

16:18.320 --> 16:25.520
organization. And the only way to really organize a large number of people is with a hierarchy.

16:26.560 --> 16:33.760
So and who gets to the top? The ones that want to go to the top, the ones that believe in themselves,

16:33.760 --> 16:39.360
the ones that know better than everybody else. And once you have that hierarchy established,

16:39.440 --> 16:44.880
there is no guarantee that it doesn't that it won't go bad. And actually, when you look at

16:44.880 --> 16:51.040
history, every such hierarchy has gone bad. You know, you look at Cuba, for instance,

16:51.040 --> 16:58.880
I believe Fidel Castro was a an honest revolutionary. I do believe that. And so what

16:58.880 --> 17:04.880
did Cuba turn into? Yeah, there's something about and you speak about Vladimir Putin in this way,

17:04.880 --> 17:11.200
but let's step away from that for a second. Is there something about being an honest

17:11.200 --> 17:17.920
revolutionary that wants to do good for their country? And you start to believe that you know

17:17.920 --> 17:24.400
better than everyone else how to do good in the country. And you very well might first, but then

17:25.360 --> 17:32.320
somehow that grows into a distortion field where you know, you keep believing you know what's right.

17:32.880 --> 17:38.720
And all the people who disagree with you, you stop seeing them as having a point, you instead

17:39.520 --> 17:47.520
see them as like evil manipulators of the truth that are actually trying to hurt people

17:47.520 --> 17:52.240
for their own greed, for their own power, and you will protect the people because you know what's

17:52.240 --> 17:59.600
good. In the case of Stalin, I mean, I don't know. But it seems like he really believed that

17:59.600 --> 18:05.280
communism would bring about a much better world. I mean, there was a sense

18:08.400 --> 18:16.240
you have to crack a few eggs to make an omelet. This idea that sacrifice is necessary to bring

18:16.240 --> 18:25.600
about a greater world. And then the other aspect is sort of ruling by terror, creating terrorism,

18:25.600 --> 18:32.960
justify a political mechanism to achieve a better world. So it wasn't, I mean, perhaps he

18:32.960 --> 18:39.040
had to do that to be able to sleep at night with the atrocities he's committing. I think he believed

18:39.040 --> 18:44.320
he will bring about a better world. And by the way, the terror didn't start with Stalin. It started

18:44.320 --> 18:54.000
right after the Bolsheviks took over when Lenin told Mr. Dzerzhinsky, Comrade Dzerzhinsky, to

18:54.000 --> 19:01.360
build the Chekhov and then execute the, this is what he called it, the Red Terror.

19:03.040 --> 19:11.200
So at the birth of the Soviet Union, there was already terror. And it was deliberate. And it

19:12.400 --> 19:19.680
also was, it wasn't just focused on the enemies. It was focused on whoever you didn't like. There

19:19.680 --> 19:27.600
was no rule of law. There was no court cases. People were just pulled out of their apartments

19:27.600 --> 19:38.400
and shot on sight. And this was done by revolutionaries who were convinced that eventually

19:39.600 --> 19:44.320
these sacrifices had to be made and eventually that would lead to a much better planet.

19:44.400 --> 19:48.640
And the populace believed this too, that those sacrifices, in part,

19:49.360 --> 19:59.600
this is such a dark thing about dictatorships is you believe it, but you're also too afraid

19:59.600 --> 20:06.400
to question your beliefs. You're not directly afraid, but almost like, I don't know what that

20:06.400 --> 20:11.920
is. That's almost like a subconscious fear. There's a dark room with a locked door. Don't

20:11.920 --> 20:16.400
look in that door. Don't check that door. And there's something about the United States that

20:16.400 --> 20:23.280
says, especially modern culture, it's like, go to that door first and sort of question everything.

20:24.240 --> 20:27.360
That's the power of the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, but you can

20:29.760 --> 20:33.840
almost become too critical and too cynical of your own culture in that way. So there's a

20:33.840 --> 20:39.280
balance of strength, of course, but man, if communism is not a lesson of human nature,

20:39.280 --> 20:45.520
I don't know what is, but you believed, without thinking too much about it, you believed in the

20:45.520 --> 20:53.840
story of communism. What did you see? I came from the Soviet Union. What did you maybe feel

20:56.080 --> 21:01.920
that's right and good about communism, about the vision of communism? Do you remember?

21:02.800 --> 21:10.480
I think the biggest impetus in me believing in communism was that the communists,

21:12.400 --> 21:19.760
just before Hitler took over, the communists were the only force in Germany that fought

21:19.760 --> 21:27.120
the Nazis in the streets, and that's a historic truth. And communists were

21:28.080 --> 21:36.160
hunted down by the Nazis, killed, put in concentration camps. And so what we knew,

21:37.760 --> 21:42.400
what we were taught, and I think that was a huge unforced error by the Western countries,

21:42.400 --> 21:47.920
particularly the United States, that there were ex-Nazis in the government in West Germany.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.600
Yeah. And the most famous one was

21:53.440 --> 22:03.520
Reinhard Gehlen, who was the general in charge of the intelligence on the Eastern Front,

22:03.520 --> 22:13.680
under Hitler. And when the Allied won the war, it was decided that Gehlen was too important,

22:14.000 --> 22:22.240
his knowledge and his organization was too important to not use. So he was co-opted by

22:22.240 --> 22:27.840
the CIA and eventually wound up being the head of the Bundesnachrichtendienst, the CIA of West

22:27.840 --> 22:35.520
Germany. That gave us, when I say us, the East German party, a huge propaganda victory.

22:36.320 --> 22:44.080
I wanted to, because the emotional aspect of this was as follows. When we were in,

22:46.400 --> 22:54.960
juniors in high school, and in those days, you were only allowed to go to high school if you

22:54.960 --> 23:01.360
were in the top 10% of students, okay? So this was going to be the next set of ruling elite in the

23:01.440 --> 23:06.720
country. We were sent, we were required to visit a concentration camp.

23:08.480 --> 23:18.480
And if you know what we as 17-year-olds were made to look at, it was gut-wrenching. How can

23:18.480 --> 23:28.720
men do something like that to men? Piles of corpses, lampshades made out of human skin because

23:29.520 --> 23:36.000
that skin had tattoos on them and the shrunken heads, heads like the size of my fist.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.680
I mean, the girls all cried and it would have made a huge impression.

23:42.320 --> 23:47.600
And that was the Nazis and then the communists defeated the Nazis.

23:47.600 --> 23:51.600
The communists were the Nazi fighters. They were the good guys. Of course, in hindsight,

23:51.600 --> 23:54.960
if the communists had come to power, it would have been just the other way around as we know,

23:54.960 --> 24:00.320
given the example of Stalin and Mao, right? But we didn't know that.

24:01.920 --> 24:08.160
From the Russian and Soviet perspective, the communist regime banded together

24:09.040 --> 24:14.320
to win the Great Patriotic War. And that was the second one,

24:14.320 --> 24:20.560
the big brother, the Soviet Union. I mean, when I was approached by the KGB, that was like,

24:20.640 --> 24:22.080
oh, I felt so honored.

24:24.320 --> 24:30.880
So we should say that we're talking about East Germany, that you're from East Germany.

24:31.440 --> 24:36.560
Can you describe, you were born four years and what is it?

24:36.560 --> 24:37.200
Yeah, four years.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.000
Ten days?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.440
Yeah, sort of. Very good.

24:40.400 --> 24:47.760
After Germany's unconditional surrender in World War II. So what is East Germany? What is

24:47.760 --> 24:52.800
West Germany? What is East and West Germany? What is that? What's the difference? What's

24:52.800 --> 24:55.440
the historical context here? What is World War II again?

24:59.600 --> 25:05.680
We don't have to go to World War I, the result of which actually seeded World War II in some

25:05.680 --> 25:11.360
respect. Yes, there's a long history, yes. But let's start with World War II. So

25:11.920 --> 25:18.240
when Hitler came to power, he and his leadership decided that

25:19.680 --> 25:23.760
the Germans needed more what they call Lebensraum, that means room to live.

25:25.760 --> 25:33.920
And they would start expanding. They went into France, they took Belgium, the Netherlands,

25:34.880 --> 25:45.360
they annexed Austria and got a piece of Czechoslovakia. And then they decided to

25:46.560 --> 25:49.920
march into the Soviet Union after they took Poland.

25:52.960 --> 25:56.560
Cut up Poland together with the Soviet Union and they were friends.

25:56.560 --> 26:02.640
Yes, there was a non-aggression pact between, that was signed by Ribbentrop and Molotov, right?

26:03.120 --> 26:06.880
I think both parties knew that eventually they would fall apart. But at the time,

26:07.920 --> 26:15.600
it gave the Soviet Union a little more piece of Poland and a little more time to prepare what

26:15.600 --> 26:27.200
they thought might happen down the road. And the Germans had the time and the ability to pretty

26:27.200 --> 26:31.840
much conquer all of Western Europe. Do you think Stalin really knew that it's

26:31.840 --> 26:35.920
going to fall apart? Why would somebody like Stalin trust somebody like Hitler?

26:35.920 --> 26:38.400
But why did he blunder so bad not to

26:40.240 --> 26:45.600
read the intelligence that was coming his way, the troops are amassing on the border of the Soviet

26:45.600 --> 26:52.800
Union? He didn't trust his own intelligence apparatus. Here's one example. There was a

26:52.800 --> 27:00.880
German communist who went underground when Hitler took over and he went to Japan as a journalist.

27:00.880 --> 27:09.600
His name is Richard Sorge. Richard Sorge had really, really good intel about what the Japanese

27:09.600 --> 27:16.560
would do and not do. I forgot exactly what it was, but it came to Moscow and Stalin totally

27:16.560 --> 27:24.960
ignored it. And when Sorge was captured by the Japanese, the Soviet Union denied that

27:25.920 --> 27:30.880
he was one of theirs, so he was executed. The paranoia, again,

27:32.640 --> 27:40.480
does a lot of damage. When you don't believe your own intelligence apparatus, why bother having one?

27:42.880 --> 27:48.240
Yeah, but I'm sure there's contradictory information coming in from the intelligence

27:48.240 --> 27:54.720
apparatus, so it's difficult. First of all, nobody likes to be disagreed with, especially when you

27:54.960 --> 27:58.880
become more and more powerful. And then the intelligence apparatus is probably giving

27:58.880 --> 28:07.280
information you don't like. It's often negative information about... Basically, information that

28:08.160 --> 28:13.600
says that the decisions you made in the past are not great decisions, and that's a difficult truth

28:13.600 --> 28:23.120
to deal with. In the modern times, if we hop around briefly, is Vladimir Putin has been

28:24.880 --> 28:30.880
not happy with the intelligence of the FSB, thereby, at least if you read the news,

28:31.920 --> 28:37.600
choosing to put more priority to the GRU for the intelligence in Ukraine.

28:39.600 --> 28:46.160
But I guess I suppose the same story happens there throughout history as paranoia.

28:46.560 --> 28:53.520
I give you an example that comes from a very reliable source,

28:55.680 --> 29:03.360
and that my best German friend worked as a chemist in the Stasi, East German intelligence.

29:04.080 --> 29:13.680
And he eventually rose to the rank of major and was in charge of the forgery department.

29:13.680 --> 29:18.480
And it's very likely that he made passports that I used to travel.

29:20.000 --> 29:26.240
He was aware that there was intelligence that was collected. The Stasi was really good.

29:26.240 --> 29:32.480
They had about 1,000 people in West Germany, undercover agents, some of them in government.

29:32.480 --> 29:38.000
And the central committee of the party, the decision makers ignored it because it didn't

29:38.000 --> 29:46.080
quite fit in their world view. It didn't quite fit into their plans. And one delicious

29:47.520 --> 29:54.880
thing that I just want to add on to this, when Gorbachev wrote his book about Perestroika and

29:54.880 --> 30:04.880
Glasnost, the East German rulers did not like it. They were much, much more orthodox. So they had

30:04.880 --> 30:11.040
to print the books in translation. Guess where they wound up? They were piled up in the hallways

30:11.040 --> 30:21.680
of the Stasi. They bought the entire print run. Fascinating. But let's backtrack. So Operation

30:21.680 --> 30:27.600
Barbarossa, invasion of Hitler to the Soviet Union, and then hopefully that leads us all the way to

30:27.600 --> 30:33.120
East Germany, West Germany after the end of the war. So what happened was the Soviet Union rolled

30:33.120 --> 30:41.200
into the eastern part of Germany and the western allies took a larger chunk, which was

30:44.560 --> 30:51.920
occupied by the three allies, the French, the English, and the Americans. And the eastern part

30:51.920 --> 31:01.360
was occupied by Soviet troops. And the Soviet troops actually conquered Berlin. But as a

31:04.080 --> 31:10.000
in a contract, they decided that Berlin would be ruled by the four allies. And they all had,

31:10.000 --> 31:19.920
you know, had free access to that city. I was born in the East German part, which very quickly

31:19.920 --> 31:27.600
became ruled by communists, socialists, the communist party and the socialist party united.

31:28.320 --> 31:32.160
But the leaders of that new party were all communists.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.680
It's nevertheless called democratic.

31:34.400 --> 31:41.280
Yes, German Democratic Republic, which was formed a couple of months after I was born.

31:42.000 --> 31:51.520
I was born into a remote southeastern corner of East Germany. And interestingly enough,

31:51.520 --> 31:53.120
genetically, I'm only half German.

31:54.400 --> 31:55.440
The other half.

31:55.440 --> 31:56.960
The other half is Czech and Polish.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.160
Nice.

31:58.160 --> 32:03.600
Because where I grew up, you know, I could walk to the Nysa River, which was the

32:05.280 --> 32:10.160
border with Poland. And it was only about an hour by bus to get to the Czech

32:11.280 --> 32:13.760
border. So that's why I'm a mix.

32:14.400 --> 32:20.800
So, okay, so East Germany after the war was communist, socialist, and then the West Germany

32:20.800 --> 32:25.040
was representing the western world with the democracy.

32:25.040 --> 32:33.680
And what the United States did, this was really, really very forward-looking,

32:33.680 --> 32:40.480
very strategic, the Marshall Plan to rebuild the economy in the West as compared to what

32:40.480 --> 32:46.480
the Soviet Union did. Whatever they hadn't destroyed on the way in, they took with them

32:47.680 --> 32:51.440
on the way out for reparations because, you know, they had every right to do that.

32:52.080 --> 32:58.000
But it was not a good idea because, you know, East Germany was always behind in economic

32:58.000 --> 33:00.640
development to their western counterpart.

33:01.360 --> 33:07.680
So when you were young, as today, but when you were young, you were clearly an exceptional

33:07.680 --> 33:14.000
student. You're a brilliant academic superstar. Let's go to your childhood.

33:14.560 --> 33:20.800
What's a fond memory from childhood that you have in being woken up to the beauty

33:21.520 --> 33:27.600
of this world and sort of being curious about all the mysteries around you that I think

33:27.600 --> 33:30.640
ultimately lead to academic success?

33:33.200 --> 33:33.840
Or was it?

33:34.880 --> 33:38.160
The fondest memory that comes to mind is my first kiss.

33:39.200 --> 33:45.760
How's that? Do you want to go to the details of that? What did you make of that? What did

33:45.760 --> 33:50.880
you make of that kiss? What did that teach you about yourself and human nature and all that?

33:51.440 --> 33:57.200
Taught me only in hindsight. At the time, I was just like, my God, I was head over heels

33:57.200 --> 34:06.560
in love. I was 16 years old. And I knew in those days, I admired girls. I knew that girls were

34:06.560 --> 34:14.400
like sort of magical beings. They were not capable of doing evil things. They were beautiful

34:14.400 --> 34:20.880
and they had to be adored. And one of them actually loved me too. She came after me.

34:21.680 --> 34:22.800
Initially, right?

34:22.800 --> 34:25.520
And that too was magical for you.

34:25.520 --> 34:35.360
Oh my God, yeah. Literally, that's when I started studying. Up until that point,

34:35.360 --> 34:41.360
I just did whatever I had to do to be an A minus student. And that's when I started studying. And

34:41.360 --> 34:48.560
every A that I got, I dedicated to her sometimes explicitly because I knew I was going to take care

34:48.560 --> 34:50.160
of her as I grew up.

34:50.240 --> 34:54.240
So you're going to have to work hard in this world to be somebody that could be adored by

34:54.880 --> 34:55.680
those you love.

34:55.680 --> 35:03.760
Yes, you're right. You know, that kiss, the next day, I was running around in school with a grin

35:03.760 --> 35:04.560
on my face.

35:05.520 --> 35:12.560
And maybe in some way, that grin never fades. So what about the heartbreak that followed?

35:12.880 --> 35:20.160
The heartbreak followed. But just to expand on this a little more, because

35:23.680 --> 35:29.760
that passion that I had was an indication that eventually love would play a big role in my life.

35:30.400 --> 35:33.200
I wasn't aware of it. I was just directed at this one girl.

35:35.200 --> 35:40.160
You understood that that feeling that taught you something, that you're somebody that can

35:40.160 --> 35:47.040
feel those things. And that's a strong part of who you are. And therefore,

35:47.040 --> 35:50.080
it will also be a part of directing your life trajectory.

35:50.720 --> 35:56.400
Yeah. So we were an item for two years. I lost my virginity.

35:57.680 --> 36:02.800
She was not a virgin at the time. My competitor was...

36:04.400 --> 36:07.280
There always is a competitor. Isn't that how it works?

36:07.280 --> 36:09.600
He studied medicine in college already.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.040
In which ways was he better than you?

36:11.680 --> 36:15.760
He wasn't. He was older, and he was more experienced. And he was going to be a doctor.

36:17.760 --> 36:23.680
But I was there, and he was not. Presence wins.

36:23.680 --> 36:28.240
Yeah. But you still had big dreams. You wanted to be a tenure professor.

36:28.240 --> 36:29.120
Yes, yes.

36:29.120 --> 36:32.320
So you still want to outdo that guy.

36:32.320 --> 36:38.160
Oh, yeah. And she eventually told me that he was not in the picture anymore.

36:38.960 --> 36:44.640
So it was back and forth, back and forth. And our senior year, we were an item. And

36:46.000 --> 36:52.320
I was just dreaming of the future. But we didn't figure out that in those days,

36:52.320 --> 36:58.960
if she went to college in Berlin and I went to college in Jena, and the distance

36:59.920 --> 37:08.400
between the two cities was too much for a weekend visit. Public transportation

37:09.440 --> 37:11.760
was very slow, and nobody had cars.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.680
So the circumstance of life, you drifted a car.

37:17.680 --> 37:22.480
Yeah. And so we interacted with a couple of letters, and then I got the goodbye letter.

37:24.000 --> 37:24.720
Oh my God.

37:24.720 --> 37:25.200
That hurt?

37:26.480 --> 37:27.520
I can still feel it.

37:29.520 --> 37:34.960
You know, that's a good thing. You can feel the pain. That's still part of love.

37:36.400 --> 37:39.840
The pain of loss is still part of love. And then you kind of

37:41.040 --> 37:46.480
change that. You shape it, and you give that love in deeper, more profound ways to future people.

37:46.480 --> 37:50.480
It's very well put. But at the time, it emptied me out.

37:51.600 --> 37:58.640
If I had a tendency to have suicidal thoughts, I might have killed myself.

37:59.120 --> 38:02.720
So would you say that was one of the darker moments of your life?

38:04.560 --> 38:14.880
Let me see. As a single moment, yes. So I still remember, we had a mail slot in the front door,

38:16.080 --> 38:21.600
and I was expecting a letter any day, and there was the letter. I go upstairs into my

38:22.560 --> 38:29.920
bedroom, and I open it, and I read it. And it was just like the life went out of me.

38:29.920 --> 38:33.280
You're just there alone, and you have to experience this pain alone.

38:34.240 --> 38:37.440
And now you're deeply alone in this world.

38:37.440 --> 38:47.520
Yes, because there was no emotional relationship with my parents. I literally had nobody.

38:47.520 --> 38:51.360
So this love you have in you had no place to go?

38:51.360 --> 39:06.480
It was choked off. But what I did was I wanted to go on, right? And so I threw myself into the

39:06.480 --> 39:15.600
study of chemistry. I outworked all of my fellow students in a big way. I worked my ass off, and

39:15.600 --> 39:20.800
since I was pretty smart, too, I just aced practically everything. And for the first

39:21.440 --> 39:24.640
two years in college, and look, we go to college, there are all these pretty girls,

39:24.640 --> 39:30.480
and there's dances and everything. We had this great student club where I didn't look at any

39:30.480 --> 39:38.880
girls. Eventually, I knew I was going to want to have female companionship, but love? Uh-uh.

39:38.880 --> 39:43.120
No more. That hurts. There's a song that goes, love hurts.

39:43.120 --> 39:48.560
Yeah, I know that one. That's true. There's actually many songs that have a similar message,

39:48.560 --> 39:57.280
yes. So during that time, during your excellence, just being an exceptional student of chemistry,

39:57.920 --> 40:05.200
let's go to your story. So in your book, Deep Undercover, My Secret Life, Entangled Allegiances

40:05.200 --> 40:11.040
as a KGB Spy in America, and in the really, really excellent podcast series that I've been

40:11.040 --> 40:16.320
listening to, people should definitely listen to it, it's called The Agent. You document your time

40:16.320 --> 40:22.720
as a KGB spy before, during, and after. Can you tell the story of when you first were contacted

40:22.720 --> 40:32.000
by the KGB, how you were invited, the offer to join was made? Well, it was a big surprise,

40:32.000 --> 40:38.080
and I never thought of myself as a potential agent. I was going to be a tenured professor

40:38.640 --> 40:44.800
and join the ruling elite because in Europe, tenured professors are few. It's not like in

40:44.800 --> 40:50.000
the United States, you know, anybody who teaches at colleges has a title of professor. Easy now.

40:51.280 --> 40:56.800
It's true. That's not a criticism. It's 100%. So we should also clarify that tenured professor or not,

40:58.080 --> 41:04.720
it is a very prestigious position throughout history of Europe. I would say, especially

41:04.720 --> 41:10.080
communist, I don't actually know the full landscape of the respect, but at least in the

41:10.080 --> 41:16.320
Soviet Union where I grew up, it's a prestigious position. Absolutely was. The town had about

41:16.320 --> 41:25.360
100,000 people live there. It's a wild guess, but maybe 30 tenured professors, and they were

41:25.360 --> 41:32.960
part of the ruling elite. I was trying to do as much as I can to live the good life, have access

41:32.960 --> 41:40.880
to things that are nice. Yeah, but I think the powerful thing about being a professor in that

41:40.880 --> 41:48.800
context of East Germany is the prestige. And the feeling of superiority. I was full of myself.

41:50.240 --> 41:56.320
When you are the best of the best. In my third year, I received a scholarship,

41:57.200 --> 42:04.080
the Karl Marx Scholarship, that was limited to 100 concurrent recipients in the country.

42:04.960 --> 42:12.000
So my God, no, I was full of myself. I believed in myself, hook, hook, line and sinker. And I was

42:12.000 --> 42:24.240
also, I got a lot of accolades from teachers and fellow students. They were feeding the ego, the

42:25.120 --> 42:33.280
I mean, you have to believe in yourself often when you're young to truly excel. And you sure as heck

42:33.280 --> 42:39.280
did. But you know, as a balance, you need a mentor, somebody who puts things in perspective,

42:39.280 --> 42:45.040
and I didn't have one. My father was a non-entity and nobody else. They all looked up to me.

42:45.840 --> 42:50.160
I was an up and coming guy, right? So there's no father figure that put you in your place.

42:50.160 --> 42:56.320
Not at all. And I give you one extreme example. It was down the road when I fathered a child out

42:56.320 --> 43:05.760
of wedlock. That was in my fifth year, I believe. The Communist Party in East Germany was very

43:05.760 --> 43:13.200
moralistic. If you did that, they would have a talk with you and give you whatever, a severe reprimand.

43:13.200 --> 43:20.160
Nobody even mentioned a word about this. So yeah, so this is how this ego gets nurtured.

43:20.160 --> 43:29.920
But anyway, getting back to how the KGB came in contact. So they most likely got knowledge of me

43:29.920 --> 43:37.040
by looking at Stasi records. What's Stasi? Oh, that was East German Secret Police,

43:37.680 --> 43:43.360
Staatssicherheit, security for the state. There's that word security again.

43:45.360 --> 43:53.200
And they pretty much kept a record on everybody in the country. And so when you look through this,

43:53.840 --> 43:57.040
and this is what the KGB was looking for. They were looking for candidates,

43:57.600 --> 44:03.840
particularly for this kind of job that they had in mind for me, for candidates who were not,

44:04.160 --> 44:12.560
in their mid-20s, who were not fully developed yet, but mature enough to get there.

44:14.320 --> 44:18.240
And still young enough, right? Because at that level of maturity,

44:18.240 --> 44:20.320
you can test whether they can handle this kind of job.

44:20.320 --> 44:28.400
Yes, absolutely right. So and one day, I got a knock on my door and my dorm room door was on a

44:28.400 --> 44:41.920
Saturday. And they knew that I was by myself. How did they know it? I pieced this together.

44:43.360 --> 44:50.160
We had an exchange student from the Soviet Union, and he was next door to me.

44:50.880 --> 44:59.360
And he befriended me, so he got to know me a little bit. And the pattern was that my roommate

44:59.360 --> 45:05.440
would always go home for the weekend. And of course, they also knew which door to knock on,

45:05.440 --> 45:12.560
even though there were no nameplates, right? So somebody knocks. And I knew it was a stranger,

45:12.560 --> 45:18.160
because if it had been a student, the pattern was that we would knock on the door and then go in.

45:18.800 --> 45:27.120
We wouldn't wait for somebody to let us in. So I waited for 10 seconds, and he didn't come in.

45:27.120 --> 45:34.480
I knew that it was a stranger. I said, come on in. And then came a person who spoke fluent German,

45:34.480 --> 45:42.160
so that was not a KGB guy. It was a collaborator. And so he started making a bunch of small talk.

45:42.160 --> 45:48.080
He introduced himself as a representative of Carl Zeiss Jena, which was the optics

45:51.200 --> 45:57.760
company that made really, really good optical instruments. It was one of the best in the world.

45:58.320 --> 46:04.480
So it's like the super prestigious company in that place.

46:04.480 --> 46:08.400
Right. And he said that he was a representative of that company.

46:09.120 --> 46:15.040
And he would just want to find out what my plans were after graduating from college.

46:16.320 --> 46:22.240
And at that point, I knew he wasn't from Carl Zeiss Jena, because in those days,

46:22.240 --> 46:30.880
there was no recruitment. When you were done, if you were in the top 10% of the graduates,

46:31.760 --> 46:38.400
you would most likely pick to stay and get a doctorate, right? And the rest of them were

46:38.400 --> 46:49.200
assigned. You had no choice. So that guy was an idiot. He didn't know the basics.

46:50.640 --> 46:53.040
You interviewed him a little bit to understand, like,

46:55.360 --> 47:00.480
feel out, is this guy full of shit? Because yeah, he's a stranger showing up to your dorm room.

47:00.480 --> 47:06.800
I knew that at that point, I knew he was Stasi, which is wrong, but it doesn't matter because he

47:06.800 --> 47:12.000
was German and I had no idea that the KGB would be involved. So sorry to pause briefly.

47:14.240 --> 47:18.880
Did you have a sense? Did people know that there's a Stasi type of organization,

47:20.160 --> 47:25.760
that there is a large number of people doing this kind of work in East Germany in order for

47:25.760 --> 47:33.760
you to make that guess? Yeah, we knew that the Stasi existed. We even had our James Bond,

47:33.760 --> 47:42.320
we had a series called the Invisible Visor where a Stasi employee in East Germany would go into

47:42.320 --> 47:48.640
West Germany and hunt down Nazis. So yes, the Stasi was known to be there. And admired in part?

47:49.360 --> 47:55.600
Or feared? Or both? I thought they were necessary and I admired them. James Bond.

47:56.080 --> 48:02.320
Yes, the reason I did so, because I had no information to the contrary, I never knew

48:02.880 --> 48:09.520
anybody personally or even, you know, somewhat removed who was

48:11.920 --> 48:21.200
followed by the Stasi, was, you know, put in jail. I had no clue. I had no clue that they did a lot

48:21.200 --> 48:26.160
of damage and that they were like doing a lot of surveillance of the East German population the

48:26.160 --> 48:34.160
same way the KGB did for the Soviet Union. So for me to be talking to somebody from the Stasi,

48:36.960 --> 48:42.640
it raised my interest. I was curious, what comes next? Because I sort of knew something

48:42.640 --> 48:48.960
interesting would be coming at me and I had no other thoughts about that at that point.

48:48.960 --> 48:56.240
So when he was finally, when he went for the kill by reversing himself, he said, you know,

48:56.240 --> 49:01.360
I got to tell you that I really am not from Carl Zeiss, you know, I'm from the government.

49:02.880 --> 49:07.840
Okay, thank you for pointing that out. And then he asked this question. He says,

49:07.840 --> 49:15.280
can you imagine to one day work for the government? And so I gave a pretty clever answer. I said,

49:15.280 --> 49:22.160
yes, but not as a chemist. So I answered the question that he didn't ask. I helped him out.

49:23.120 --> 49:29.440
So we made an arrangement to meet for lunch, which in Germany is the main meal,

49:30.560 --> 49:35.280
at the number one restaurant in Jena. I still remember what I ate.

49:35.280 --> 49:36.400
What was that?

49:36.400 --> 49:45.280
Rum steak with butter on top and french fries was my favorite. Anyway, so when I get to the

49:45.280 --> 49:50.960
restaurant, I saw this fellow sitting in the back there at the table and there was another

49:50.960 --> 49:58.160
person at the table. So I was a little bit hesitant because in those days, it was not unusual for

49:58.160 --> 50:04.480
perfect strangers to share a table because there wasn't enough tables and chairs and so forth.

50:04.480 --> 50:10.000
So I didn't know if I could approach him, but he got up and came to me and he took me to the

50:10.000 --> 50:20.880
table and he said, I want to introduce Herman. We work with our Soviet comrades. Aha, KGB.

50:20.880 --> 50:24.880
And then he disappeared. He says, I got something else to do. I never knew his name.

50:26.240 --> 50:28.240
He just handed me over to the KGB.

50:29.200 --> 50:34.160
What was the relationship between the KGB and Astazis as collaborators,

50:34.160 --> 50:37.440
close collaborators or just distant associates?

50:37.440 --> 50:43.840
They were pretty close collaborators. As I told you that they bought forged documents that the

50:43.840 --> 50:49.840
Germans made because the Germans were better at forgery. They also exchanged information,

50:49.840 --> 50:57.520
but they didn't trust each other 100%. And I tell you why I know that. So they recruited me

50:57.520 --> 51:04.160
to send me to West Germany. As I already said, East Germany had a thousand agents over there.

51:04.160 --> 51:06.000
Why would they want to have their own?

51:08.000 --> 51:13.200
Yeah. Okay. This is a fascinating internal and external dynamic of distrust.

51:13.200 --> 51:13.440
Yeah.

51:13.440 --> 51:21.360
Okay. So there you are welcomed by the KGB. When did the offer, the invite come?

51:21.360 --> 51:28.800
Well, that took a while. So Herman and I had an unofficial relationship for about a year and a

51:28.800 --> 51:37.360
half. I would meet him once a week, once every two weeks, initially in his car. But then he

51:39.280 --> 51:48.160
took me to a conspirational flat. It was an apartment that was occupied by a party member,

51:48.160 --> 51:54.720
a lady, single lady. When we came in, she would leave. She left us tea and cookies and then we

51:54.720 --> 52:02.480
could freely talk. He also at that time gave me some West German literature magazines to read,

52:02.480 --> 52:07.440
which was of course forbidden. So already I'm starting to feel somewhat special.

52:08.080 --> 52:14.720
And as we were talking about what they had in mind for me in general, I knew that I was going

52:14.720 --> 52:22.960
to be even more special because I would be above the law. I would operate outside the law of the

52:22.960 --> 52:32.880
countries I would go to as well as East Germany, because the magazines and eventually when I joined

52:32.880 --> 52:39.840
up, they told me I had better watch West German television, which was also not explicitly prohibited,

52:39.840 --> 52:44.480
but it was something that could get you in trouble.

52:45.040 --> 52:48.080
On many levels, you're super special. You're the James Bond.

52:48.080 --> 52:49.280
Yes, yes.

52:49.280 --> 52:59.520
So what was that recruitment testing process like? Testing whether you have what it takes to be a

52:59.520 --> 53:01.280
KGB agent.

53:01.280 --> 53:14.880
First of all, we had very in-depth talks, Herman and I, about life. And I was, I still am,

53:15.840 --> 53:18.960
very honest in sharing my feelings.

53:19.680 --> 53:21.120
Philosophical or personal?

53:21.120 --> 53:24.800
Personal. I even told him that I was shy around the girls.

53:26.800 --> 53:28.640
He was giving you relationship advice or what?

53:29.440 --> 53:34.000
How old was he? So what was the dynamic? Can you tell me, was it a father, son?

53:34.000 --> 53:42.160
No, older brother. He was maybe in his early to mid-30s and I was maybe 10 years younger.

53:42.160 --> 53:43.680
And what languages did he speak?

53:43.680 --> 53:45.600
He spoke German pretty well.

53:46.320 --> 53:48.160
But he's originally from Russia?

53:48.160 --> 53:54.160
Yeah, with a Russian accent. So I got in trouble one time with him when I asked him,

53:54.160 --> 53:57.600
is your real name German? He didn't like that.

53:57.600 --> 53:58.160
He didn't like it.

53:58.960 --> 54:00.000
Was he good with girls?

54:02.960 --> 54:06.160
I remember what he told me. He says, you got to understand one thing.

54:07.120 --> 54:10.240
They're looking for guys too. That's all.

54:11.760 --> 54:15.280
Girls are looking for guys too. It's a competitive game.

54:16.560 --> 54:18.320
Don't worry about it. Don't be so shy.

54:18.320 --> 54:23.920
So that little flame of love that we talked about in all the shapes that it takes in our life,

54:23.920 --> 54:28.400
did he talk to you about that, that that could be taken advantage of,

54:28.400 --> 54:31.120
that that could be used or was it implied?

54:32.400 --> 54:36.640
Yeah, but it was not very focused, not in great detail.

54:37.840 --> 54:42.480
So we talked about personal stuff and dislikes. He gave me tasks.

54:43.120 --> 54:49.600
For instance, when my friend and I hitchhiked from East Germany all the way down to Bulgaria,

54:50.160 --> 54:54.960
he told me to write a report about it, what I saw. So fundamentally,

54:54.960 --> 55:02.560
he wanted to see how well I can write and how well I can report, how well I observe.

55:04.080 --> 55:08.000
He also asked me to write some profiles about fellow students.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.680
I don't believe that was for them to give him to the stasi. It was just like,

55:12.480 --> 55:16.320
how well do I characterize people? That's important when you're talking about,

55:17.280 --> 55:23.840
when I was active in the US, I operated as a spotter, so I did exactly that. I wrote

55:23.840 --> 55:30.800
profiles about people. He also gave me some tasks to do that were rather unpleasant.

55:36.080 --> 55:41.760
He would give me an address and a name of the people who lived at the address,

55:42.400 --> 55:49.040
and he told me to go there, ring the doorbell, and find out something about a relative who

55:49.040 --> 55:56.720
lived in West Germany. That is undercover exploration, right? So you make up a story

55:56.720 --> 56:03.120
and somehow win the confidence of your target to tell you something that you want to know.

56:04.480 --> 56:05.840
Did that come naturally to you?

56:05.840 --> 56:06.880
No, no, I hated it.

56:06.880 --> 56:09.440
The charisma involved? Which part did you hate?

56:09.440 --> 56:11.920
Yeah, charisma, I think I didn't know that I had it.

56:13.280 --> 56:14.800
It took you some time to discover.

56:14.800 --> 56:22.800
Because I always was and I still am to some degree a bit shy. I lost a lot of the shyness

56:22.800 --> 56:28.800
after moving to the South here in the United States because you don't have to be shy.

56:31.280 --> 56:33.440
You can let your love shine.

56:33.440 --> 56:38.720
That's exactly right. But anyway, I hated doing that, but I did it well.

56:38.720 --> 56:45.440
I still remember. In those days, I had a beard and I rang the bell.

56:45.440 --> 56:47.120
Tall, handsome fellow?

56:47.120 --> 56:54.320
Yeah, and I looked the part. I said, I'm a sociology student and I'm doing a survey,

56:54.320 --> 56:59.520
and I asked a whole bunch of questions. Would you like to answer the questions? No problem.

57:00.480 --> 57:06.400
And then I directed the conversation to the lady's private life.

57:07.760 --> 57:12.720
And she actually gave me information. She volunteered information that I wanted to know.

57:13.440 --> 57:14.000
Beautiful.

57:14.000 --> 57:18.720
I did well. And the other one that I didn't like, but I also did well with,

57:18.720 --> 57:25.040
when Herman drove me around the city and showed me a building and he said,

57:25.040 --> 57:30.720
find out what organization is in there, what they do, maybe get to know some people,

57:30.720 --> 57:38.800
and I did that pretty well also. You have to be inventive to come up with a cover story,

57:38.800 --> 57:48.400
and I've always been quite inventive. I'm a storyteller at heart, and I didn't know it then.

57:49.600 --> 57:51.600
But there was still something unpleasant about it.

57:52.800 --> 57:54.000
Which part was unpleasant?

57:54.480 --> 58:01.200
The shyness, and then I wasn't very comfortable lying. I became comfortable down the road, but

58:02.400 --> 58:18.400
I was brutally honest and never hid anything of me. But over time, you lose that uncomfortable

58:18.400 --> 58:23.600
feeling, and you rationalize that you've got to do it. There's only one way, right?

58:23.600 --> 58:25.360
And you're serving a good cause.

58:25.360 --> 58:28.080
So you were talking to Herman for a year and a half.

58:28.080 --> 58:29.120
A year and a half.

58:29.120 --> 58:31.200
And then how did that progress?

58:31.200 --> 58:37.440
Yes. So he finally, I guess he sent a report to headquarters in Berlin,

58:38.320 --> 58:44.880
and then he sent me on a three week, quote unquote, practice trip to Berlin.

58:45.680 --> 58:53.280
This was the first time when I had a conspiratorial meeting where I had an

58:53.280 --> 59:00.240
address and a time and a code phrase, and I met another agent. His name was Boris.

59:01.280 --> 59:04.400
These names were meaningless. They were all cover names, right?

59:04.400 --> 59:08.400
And so what was the code and the meaning? Can you give a little more detail?

59:08.400 --> 59:09.600
That code, I don't remember.

59:10.160 --> 59:12.480
Not the code, but what do you mean by code?

59:13.120 --> 59:18.240
Oh, I tell you the code we used when I met while I was active.

59:20.160 --> 59:26.080
I would approach the other person who I thought may be the person I want to meet. We both had

59:27.760 --> 59:33.600
something with us or on us to make us more likely to be the right person.

59:33.920 --> 59:38.960
And I would ask him the following questions.

59:40.800 --> 59:43.600
Excuse me, I'm looking for Susan Green.

59:45.600 --> 59:47.520
And he would answer, yes, you must be David.

59:48.800 --> 59:56.240
Stupid. If I ask a stranger, they would look at me, how could I help you?

59:56.240 --> 59:58.080
So no, it's the wrong guy.

59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.440
Yeah. It's just a low probability that the right thing would be said.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.160
Oh, absolutely.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.640
And it seems like a safe statement if it's not the right person.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.200
Exactly right.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.680
It would just come off absurd or crazy or whatever.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.160
You would have made a good secret agent.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:20.880
No, I'm not. We'll discuss this further. I'm dressed like one.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.440
Actually, yeah, were there any dress code?

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:25.920
No, just fit in.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:30.480
Fit in, no matter what. And then be creative. Figure out ways to fit.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:37.440
Right. So anyways, he gave me some tasks. And since I had rented a room in a house,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.720
he gave me Western literature to read. And we spent time together.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:55.440
And there was a practice run to West Germany. Actually, there were two.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.160
And that was very important. In hindsight, I figured that out.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:08.720
So I traveled to West Germany, no, not to West Berlin, with an East German passport that

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:16.720
was stamped that that individual was allowed to go to the West. And there was a part of the

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:25.760
border that was only guarded by Soviet troops. And that's where they smuggled me into West

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:35.440
Germany. I got on the subway and then appeared in West Berlin. No Americans, no Brits, no French

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.360
knew that I had entered. Forged documents or not?

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:42.320
No, this was an East German passport. It was real.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:42.960
Yeah, okay.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:50.720
Okay. And the first trip, all they wanted me to do is just walk around, smell the air,

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:56.240
you know, have a beer or whatever, and eat a sausage, and then come back.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:04.480
The second trip, I had a task, very similar to the one that I had back in Jena, to ring the

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:10.080
doorbell someplace and talk to some people. And that worked very well also.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:17.440
I should mention that you talk about that, you know, eat a sausage, drink some beer.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:24.640
I suppose that's a good test too, to see how you behave under Western, like when first introduced

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:32.320
to the Western college. Like this is why I might not make a good agent, is when I first came to

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:38.640
the United States in the supermarket, like bananas, as many bananas as I want to eat.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:43.120
I think that would break me.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.120
It's a shock.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.880
It's a shock to have access to Western culture.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:55.600
You're getting very close to the reason they actually made me do these two practice trips.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:04.960
When I first emerged on West Berlin territory, I felt highly uncomfortable. That was the enemy,

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:11.200
right? And I saw the cops everywhere. And even those cops had like light blue uniforms,

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:18.720
they weren't standouts. So I was wondering if they knew that I had like KGB on my forehead.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.800
So you were paranoid that they would know, they would see.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.440
I was scared, but I overcame that.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:30.160
Can we just linger on that? Because I suppose that's a natural, like if I give anybody on the

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:36.160
street the mission to do the mission you had to do, is they would be paranoid. That's a natural

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:43.200
human feeling. Am I being watched? Do they know? Like if you try to steal something from a store,

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:49.120
there's going to be a feeling like, are they watching me? Are the cameras watching? Are

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:55.280
the people watching me? They all know that kind of stuff. So you have to be somehow rugged and

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.520
robust to that kind of feeling and overcome it.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:04.560
Yes, exactly. And something very interesting happened. While I was being trained in Berlin,

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:11.600
I met a classmate of mine from high school. And he confided to me that he was recruited by the Stasi

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:20.560
to go as a spy to West Germany. And he also had this practice trip. And he peed in his pants.

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:23.440
He went back and told him, I can't do that.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.960
Just from the terror, that paranoia?

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:36.000
Now, this guy's career was over. He had an engineering degree. He was a pretty smart guy.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:41.600
He was just for the rest of his life. And he's still alive, I believe, floating around and

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:46.400
trading in model railroads and stuff like that.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.240
You mean, do you think that experience broke him?

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.960
They wouldn't let him back in.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.520
Oh, I see.

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.760
Yeah.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.720
So it's a test that if you fail, you pay the price.

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:03.360
I had no idea that something bad would happen if I failed that test, but I didn't.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:14.960
I didn't fail. And this led then to the offer. Boris was happy with me. And he told his boss,

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:22.720
who was most likely the head of the KGB in East Berlin, and I had an appointment to meet-

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.600
In East Germany?

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.640
Yes, in East Germany. Yeah, all of East Germany.

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:26.880
Yes.

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:32.320
That's right. An appointment to meet with him. And as we walk into the room,

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:38.800
there was this huge desk and a little guy sitting behind it. Very, very,

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:47.520
just like little and unimpressive. Nice. A lot of paraphernalia, like, you know,

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:55.840
I had a bust of Dzerzhinsky on his desk and some paintings, Lenin and so forth.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:05.120
But when the guy opened his mouth, he was like, whoa, huge psychological energy.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.400
He spoke only Russian. Now, and initially he would, you know, start with five minutes

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:17.520
worth of propaganda, why we're doing what we're doing. I didn't need that. I understood most of

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:26.240
it. But when I didn't understand, I asked Boris to translate. And then he sprung it on me and I was

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:34.000
not prepared. He said, so what, are you in or not? And I was, no, I hadn't made up my mind.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:43.280
I wasn't expecting that would come. And so I said to him, I'm not really trained. You know,

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:47.040
there's a lot of things I need to learn. And I came up with a couple of really stupid things,

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:51.440
one not so stupid, but the other one was, I don't know why I said that. I said,

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:55.440
for instance, I need to learn how to drive a car and to type with a typewriter.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:01.920
And he got really annoyed and he said, don't worry about it. We'll train you.

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:07.920
But I got to tell you, we need people who are decisive. So you got until tomorrow

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:14.080
noon to give Boris your decision. That made for a sleepless night.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.560
So what was going through your mind?

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:24.320
Well, I had, this was almost 50-50. I knew I was going to have a huge

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:33.680
career, a good career. I was on my way because I was already employed by the university as

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:38.800
an assistant professor. So that career would be to become a professor, become a 10-year professor,

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:46.400
be a world-class. Yes. Jena had become my hometown. I really loved the place. It was my oyster.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:52.240
And my family was my basketball team.

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.440
You love playing basketball?

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:55.920
Oh, absolutely.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:59.440
So that's what you mean. Yeah. So this is home. This is home. This is where your love is.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.960
This was home.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.880
Did you understand that the choice involved leaving the home behind?

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:11.840
Yes. And the one thing I didn't have, the two things I didn't have, an emotional relationship

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:15.840
with my mother, and I didn't have a steady girlfriend at the time.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.760
I think Freud would have a lot to say about that, but yeah, go ahead.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:24.160
But the connection between those two, but yes. Yeah, I'm sure.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:28.800
By the way, my friend Gunther, the one who worked for the Stasi, was also,

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:34.640
the Stasi tried to recruit him as an agent, but he had a love relationship at the time. And

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.160
he said politely, no, I won't. I can't.

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.920
So you didn't have, that's the one thing that really could...

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:42.800
Would have held me.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:45.040
Would have held you to this place is love.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:49.760
So you got the career on the one hand, my basketball team, the town that I would be

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:56.640
part of the ruling elite of. And then we had this great adventure and the ability to contribute

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:03.360
to the victory, the worldwide victory of communism and stick it to the Nazis.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.120
And of course, the feeling that you're really special.

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.000
Yeah, James Bond.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.880
The question, do I want to be a 10-year professor or James Bond?

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.380
Yes.

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:19.040
As funny as that sounds, that was probably a difficult decision.

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:24.640
It was a difficult decision, but fundamentally it wasn't, and it wasn't my zeal

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:34.880
to help the revolution. It was my, what they called, what the Stasi was looking for,

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:40.560
the KGB was looking for in a character that they would send over a well-controlled

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:42.640
inclination to adventure. Okay.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.840
Yeah, James Bond, what do you say? And the love of women.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:58.560
Yeah, I was. Yes, I got to put this in right here because I'm telling people I have two things

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:06.800
in common with James Bond. These are my initials, JB, and I got the girl too, three times.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.040
Yeah, and that's adventure.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:17.680
Yeah, and the ability to travel to the West because the West was closed off to us.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.120
We could go to foreign countries, but they all had to be communist countries.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:32.480
I wanted to see Paris because I had fallen in love with Honoré Balzac who wrote a phenomenal

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:38.400
set of novels that I just ate up. And so when I eventually did go to Paris, I knew all the

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:47.760
places already because he described them all. But anyway, so that one, it was 5149, but eventually,

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:56.400
when you do the side-by-side intellectual comparison, that doesn't work. It becomes a

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.920
tie. And then you just go with your gut and say, hey, I'm in.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:06.000
So now that you successfully passed the test and you were sitting with this unimpressive

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:14.960
man and had the invite and had to sleep on it and have made the decision to join, what was next?

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:21.200
I was just told that I was being recruited by the State Department of East Germany. I was going to

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:29.280
become a diplomat. I must have had some paper, but I forgot because just by saying so,

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.200
then that wouldn't have worked.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:36.880
There's some kind of document that says that that was the only entanglement you had to that place.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.360
No love, just the basketball.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:44.320
Oh, basketball. Giving up basketball was huge for me. I loved playing that game.

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:49.440
I started playing basketball when I was 18. That's a little late.

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.840
Are you better offensive, defensive? What do you like more? Do you like to shoot from a distance?

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.120
Do you like to play?

01:11:55.120 --> 01:12:03.840
I was a runner. I was very quick on my feet. And I was a good jumper too. I typically played the

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.880
four position, forward.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.840
Oh, the forward position.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:17.440
Forward position. But anyway, so that was the hardest for me to give up. But indeed,

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:23.200
the other thing that I remember I had to do to hand in my party document to the party secretary

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:30.960
of the university. And he made a comment. Yeah, we probably won't hear much about you, but we know

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:37.440
that you're going to do something very important. So he sort of had an inkling that I'm going to go

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:44.560
someplace undercover or something like that. And then I packed my bags and got on a train

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:52.320
to Berlin for another one of those secret meetings with my new handler, Nikolai.

01:12:53.920 --> 01:13:00.000
And here came another test that would have been quite easy to fail.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:10.400
So I had lived in Jena for six years in a dorm. Even when I became an employee of the university,

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:16.800
they didn't have apartments. I was still living in a dorm in a single room with a bed, a chair,

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:24.720
and a table and a toilet down the hallway. So I figured, Berlin, KGB, I'm going to get a nice

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:33.120
apartment, right? And so Nikolai took me into his car. We started talking a little bit. And then

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:38.400
he said, I have a task for you already. Your first task is to find yourself a place to live.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:49.840
I mean, I don't think I showed it in my face, but my heart dropped down into my pants. I knew this

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:57.280
was nearly impossible because there was a severe shortage of housing everywhere in Germany,

01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:03.040
East Germany. And all the apartments and homes were controlled by the government.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:11.040
There were long waiting lists. I knew couples that were promised maybe to get an apartment

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.080
five years down the road. Then they would postpone their decision to have a child.

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:26.880
Anyway, this was impossible. Well, but this was a test because I had to be inventive now. I had

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:32.480
to figure out how to get out of an impossible situation. I didn't realize it then at all.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:42.480
I just went with the flow. What do I do? So what I did, I took the train, the city train,

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:51.440
to the very last stop, a little town called Ackner. I wandered around in that town and

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:56.080
knocked on doors and asked people if they knew where somebody might have a place to live.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:01.360
After a couple of hours, somebody said, there's this lady that gave me the address.

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:08.640
I talked to the lady and she said, I happen to have a place where you might be able to stay.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:15.600
It was an outbuilding. I don't know what it served. It was not a garage. It was concrete.

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:27.920
It had a bed and a chair, running cold water and a stove, a cold stove. That was going to be my-

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.360
Pretty basic. Pretty basic.

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.800
Pretty basic? Are you kidding me?

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:35.200
That's the- Toilet across the yard, of course.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:38.080
Yeah. Well, all the essentials. What are you complaining about?

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.560
James Bond had to run a special operation out of the outhouse.

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:55.680
To my credit, and I think that established part of my reputation, I didn't complain at all

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.640
to Nikolai. That was part of the test, probably.

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:06.000
Yeah, I just told him I found something. For six months, I would get up in the morning,

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.520
get on the train, and walk around in the city, did some operational stuff,

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:17.120
operational training. I went to the library, did a lot of reading in the library.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:23.120
Then I found a basketball team that I could join, so at least I could take a shower twice a week.

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:35.120
Apparently, it took about six months that I was still on probation because after six months,

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:41.360
Nikolai, one day, we were still meeting in his car. He handed me a key and he said,

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:49.760
I'm going to take you to your new apartment. Now, and I didn't know this, now I was really in.

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:55.920
Okay? Imagine the hurdles you have to jump over and how many times you can fail.

01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:00.160
But not complaining, not asking questions.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:00.480
Yes.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:06.480
That was something you've written about. I think you wrote that bosses do not like to hear

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:09.120
complaints or problems. They prefer solutions.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:09.920
That's right.

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:16.320
So what was your interaction like with the bosses? Does that essentially represent

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:20.640
the way he went forward as well? No complaints, get to solve the problem.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:28.960
No complaints, no arguments. I know this better. I was taking it all in. Now, the technical guys,

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:35.200
they taught me something I didn't know that made sense. What Nikolai, some of the stuff that he

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:42.320
taught me was somewhat questionable. He was a generalist and there's some things he didn't

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:47.840
know really well. So I could have asked and probed a little bit, but I didn't.

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:57.440
So I just played along. So this new apartment, it was a studio, it had a kitchen with running

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:03.920
cold water. And the bathroom was just one flight down the toilet, not a bathroom,

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:06.080
one flight down the stairs.

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.360
It's an upgrade.

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:13.040
It was a big upgrade. And he gave me, I think he gave me a thousand mark to buy furniture.

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:18.960
And in that place, actually, I also bought a TV and started watching West German television.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:30.480
So I finally had a decent place to stay. And my training in Berlin took about two years.

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:36.400
What was the training? What were the interesting aspects to the training? What were sort of,

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:40.640
if you do an overview systematic of what was the training process, what was difficult,

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:46.320
what are some insights that generalize to the training process of what it takes to be a KGB

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:46.820
spy?

01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:54.800
Right. So let me start with a trade craft. So I was taught Morse code. That took a while.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:02.800
I was instructed in how to use a shortwave radio and to receive

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:13.840
the shortwave transmissions with Morse code. I was taught an encryption and decryption algorithm,

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:22.000
manual algorithm. You might be interested that eventually I figured out at least one of the

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:31.600
patterns. The algorithm was such that, and this was all about digits. And the algorithm was such

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:40.480
that in the end, the digits that were used to decipher other digits that were sent to me by

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:46.560
a shortwave radio, there were, let's say, if there were a hundred digits, there were an equal

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:53.520
number of ones, twos, threes, fours, fives, six, and sevens up until zero. And I was told that

01:19:54.160 --> 01:20:00.560
these algorithms, these manual algorithms were good for about 300 uses. After that,

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:06.800
they could still be deciphered. I'm assuming nowadays that wouldn't take as much.

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:12.160
Yeah, with computers for sure. But there's probably, they're probably designed in a way

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:19.280
that you can manually sort of, it's efficient and convenient to use them manually. It's not

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:25.280
to optimize cryptographic security, it's to optimize, it's like to balance security and

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.120
like humans being able to actually.

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.920
No, I got to disagree. It was neither efficient nor convenient. It took a long time.

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:41.200
When what was significantly easier to do, but that would require you to have spy paraphernalia

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:48.640
with you. This is what's called a one-time pad. So you have the set of numbers on a sheet of paper

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:56.560
that had to be developed. I had to use iodine to make those numbers visible. Those are known

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:04.320
to be unbreakable unless they are used multiple times, the same sheet of paper. Because the person

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:12.400
who encrypts has the same set of numbers as the person who decrypts. And one time use, you cannot

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:17.440
figure out what the message is. Oh, interesting. But this is a quick way to communicate from one

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:23.200
person to another one time. Yes. Well, one time, but I had a pad with multiple sheets of paper,

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:33.040
and the reason that they gave me a manual one is because I literally, I had only, when I wound up

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:40.000
in the United States, I had only one thing with me that only a spy can have. And that was a

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:47.600
writing pad where the first 10 pages or so were impregnated with a trace of a chemical that was

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:52.960
used for secret writing. But you really would have to know what you're looking for. You know,

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:59.120
you see this pad, it was bought at Walmart. Can you explain a little further, what is the chemical

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:05.360
here that, what are we talking about? So I don't understand how it's possible to have a physical

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:13.040
pad that does the encryption without any computing. How does it encrypt? So no, no, it doesn't do any

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:24.720
work. So the communication, the encrypted communication was a set of groups of five,

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:33.440
five digits, and then another five, and there's always a gap in between. And so let's say if I

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:39.200
get this radio transmission, I write them all down, and then I use my, develop my algorithm,

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:44.240
and then I do mathematics, either addition or subtraction. The resulting set of digits

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:51.120
then had a one-to-one correlation to letters. And this is an easy way to then do the correlation.

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:57.040
Yes. Well, that's cool. And you're saying the algorithm was not efficient. It was not...

01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:01.440
Oh, the manual took a long time, and you can't make an error.

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:07.280
Right. Would you know where, can you, is it easy to debug? No.

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.320
No, you do it twice. You do it twice, and that's how you check.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:15.760
If it's identical, then you know. If it's not, then one is right and the other is wrong.

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.120
So you just don't make mistakes.

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:25.200
No, that's right. And I really didn't. But anyway, so I was learning that. I was also

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:33.760
told that I was required to become proficient in another language, and they gave me a choice,

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.960
and I picked English. What was the other one?

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:40.800
Oh, no, pick one, French. Whatever is spoken in the West.

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:49.200
Got it. What would be second to you? Would you think French because of Paris? Why English?

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:54.960
English was a no-brainer because I was a straight A student in English without studying.

01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:03.520
It came so easily to me. So that's why I chose it, right? So that was that. Then

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:16.160
I was taught the basics of counter surveillance, some trickery and surveillance detection routes

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:24.480
where you wander around in the city for three hours and determine whether you're being followed

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:31.760
or not. That requires you to plan the route very well. I give you one example that will

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:39.120
illustrate that. My favorite spot, when I was in Moscow, I did a lot of that also.

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:49.920
My favorite spot was a not well-traveled road. It went down the hill and curved,

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:57.120
and at the bottom of the hill, there was a telephone booth. When you open the door and

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:02.880
pick up the telephone, you have to look back. So it wasn't like this, right? It wasn't a giveaway.

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:09.520
This was normal. It was natural. So I could see if somebody would come walking after me. These kinds

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:21.760
of things. Or you would use public transportation, big buildings where you needed to use an elevator

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:30.160
because surveillance, the object of surveillance is to never lose sight of the individual who you're

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:35.440
surveilling because at that point, you may miss the window where he does something that you're

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:44.560
looking for. So somebody always has to come close, right? Did you have to also study surveillance?

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:55.280
No, only counter surveillance. What helped me in all my training, I would have a competition with

01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:03.600
folks that were coming that were following me and me, and I beat them every time. They were at a

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:09.680
disadvantage because one of them always had to be close. If you saw the same face twice, you know

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:15.280
that you were being followed. I had a very, very good memory for faces.

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:21.360
So basically, figure out a fixed route and then a fixed route that allows you to

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:30.880
survey the area and then record the faces you've seen inside your mind. If you see multiple times

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:36.720
a single face, that's a bad sign. They could use different clothes,

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:45.520
but they didn't have face masks. The CIA does nowadays. They can give you a different face

01:26:45.520 --> 01:27:01.920
within seconds. I mean, again, you talk about paranoia. Is that a big part of the job,

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:06.880
counter surveillance, like being constantly paranoid that you're being watched?

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.080
Yeah, I was supposed to-

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:13.200
Isn't that quite stressful? Is that actually an effective way to operate?

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:20.800
No, but it sort of becomes a routine. I was told to do it while in the U.S. once a month, and-

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:22.800
Okay, it's like a cleaning out-

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:28.240
Oh, not every day. No, no, no, no, no. Once a month, or before I would say mail a letter

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:38.400
with secret writing. So I was sure that nobody saw me put an envelope into a post box.

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:42.640
So this is one of the tools in your toolbox. So there's Morse code, there's the decryption

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:45.040
and the encryption, there's the counter surveillance-

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:51.440
Photography, making microdots. You know what a microdot is?

01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:52.240
Yeah, what's a microdot?

01:27:52.240 --> 01:28:05.360
Well, you take a photograph and you use a microscope in reverse and make that photograph

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:15.920
really small, so small that it's like the head of a pin that can be used to hide under a postage

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:25.520
stamp. I knew how to make them, but in reality they never asked me to make use of that technique.

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:28.960
It's sort of an encryption mechanism for photographs.

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:35.680
Yeah, so what we do nowadays is embed code in PDFs and stuff like that, right?

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:41.760
Beautiful. Okay, all right. So that was a learning, a training process both in the

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:46.640
physical space and sort of algorithmically. Is there other things?

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:55.920
Oh, you bet. Interestingly enough, the first book I was given to read was the history of

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:59.360
the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.560
Oh, so understand. That's interesting because you said you had to read western literature.

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:05.200
Yeah, that too.

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:10.800
How much reading, so history, politics, geopolitics?

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:17.600
Not much more, but they made me read that document. Other than that, I wasn't supposed

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:24.880
to study the Soviet Union. When they sent me to Moscow, it wasn't to learn Russian, right?

01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:31.440
It wasn't to learn English. The second document they gave me was the Constitution of West Germany,

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:38.160
and then I got lots of magazines and stuff like that. As I told you, I was also told to

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:48.480
watch West German television, which I embraced with a vengeance because it was better than East

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:52.320
German. So I would get up in the morning and have a little breakfast and watch

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:55.120
the German version of Sesame Street.

01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:03.680
And that helps you get an understanding of the culture because if you have to do any kind of

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:09.920
of interaction, any kind of spying, then you have to be able to effectively integrate yourself.

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:16.720
Well, you also have to know that would have been easier if they had sent me to West Germany.

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:22.240
All the soccer teams, stuff that everybody knows. When I came to the U.S., I knew very little stuff

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:28.000
that everybody knows. That's why I had to be very cautious and take it in over time. Anyway,

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:34.480
and the last thing I want to mention is I was strongly encouraged to

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:44.720
expand my cultural education. In other words, go to visit museums, go to the theater,

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:54.960
not so much movies, opera, read books from all kinds of authors. That was important to them.

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:59.760
Once a month, I had to write a report, what I did. But the interesting thing,

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:05.200
there was no curriculum, there was no agenda, there were no check marks.

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:08.080
It was all ad hoc. Now you do this and then you do that.

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:15.920
A lot of this also, they relied on my initiative. Again.

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:17.600
I mean, that's part of the evaluation too.

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:18.100
You bet.

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:24.480
It's interesting that they're developing a James Bond type of character here,

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:30.640
which is, what's the reason to go to the opera? As you become cultured in a certain kind of way,

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:36.640
where perhaps that makes you more charming, more charismatic in terms of your ability to

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:38.320
integrate yourself in different situations.

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:50.240
You're absolutely right. When I came to the U.S. after about two years, roughly,

01:31:50.240 --> 01:32:02.240
I was cultured enough to not make a bad impression at a diplomatic soiree in Washington, D.C.

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:03.440
I mingled freely.

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:12.080
The whole idea was for me to reach into the upper realms of society,

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:16.960
where the targets would be juicier than the worker bees.

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:24.480
How did you end up in Moscow? Why? What is that journey?

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:33.120
I told you, I started studying English. I started back from scratch. They paid for a tutor.

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:40.160
I went from English 101. I went through that in a couple of months, and then I got another guy with

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:47.680
whom I expanded this. We had conversations rather than working from a textbook. I worked

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:55.200
like a maniac. I threw myself into the study of English like you wouldn't believe.

01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:02.880
My inspiration came from Vladimir Lenin. I had read somewhere in a book that when Lenin was in

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:10.560
exile, he studied German. He learned 100 German words every day, new German words.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:16.400
I started reading newspapers, and every word that I didn't know, I wrote down on an index card,

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:25.280
German, English, and I piled them up. I really learned 100 new English words every day.

01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:29.680
I know this because I counted them. I had a system how to do this.

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:36.240
You take your index card, and you have five categories. It's a really good way to learn

01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:42.640
rote by rote. You've got category one, that's the new ones, and you've got category five.

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:51.200
You start with five. Five you already had right four times. If you have it right again,

01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:53.680
it goes into the archive.

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:56.960
Oh, like long-term cold archive.

01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:03.600
Four, if you get it right, it goes to five. If you get it wrong, it gets relegated to three.

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:13.840
You go through this. Occasionally, I would throw the archive things back into one.

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:22.160
I really acquired a phenomenal vocabulary. When I was done with my English, my vocabulary was

01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:27.920
significantly higher than the average American because I didn't discriminate. Whatever word I

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:34.240
didn't know, I learned, which is not necessarily the best way because English has a lot of synonyms.

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:44.160
One synonym is usually the preferable one. When I first interacted with people,

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:52.080
I very often used the one that wasn't as good. I have an interesting way of talking.

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:56.960
They didn't know what that meant. It builds a good foundation for a language.

01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:01.120
It's getting a large vocabulary. It's really interesting. There's something I do which is

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:05.120
called space repetition, which is a programmatic way of doing this kind of system that you've

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:12.640
developed yourself, which is if you successfully remember a thing, it's going to be a longer time

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:20.000
before it brings it up to you again. That requires a computer to keep track of the information. If

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.920
you have cars, that's a really interesting pile system. One, two, three, four, five,

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:29.040
you upgrade it one, two, three, four, five. Maybe I wouldn't go to the archive and go to

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:36.880
pile one right away. Maybe I would go to like, I don't know, pile five perhaps is probably the

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:41.360
right place to put it because you have to go through that full step again. That is a really

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:47.360
powerful way to learn definitely language but also facts like people that go to medical school.

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:52.800
Disconnected facts. When you're done, you know what you know.

01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:58.080
Then again, to use it, to integrate it into the music of language, that's more difficult.

01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.360
Yeah, exactly right.

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:07.680
Maybe it's not good for spycraft but there's a charm to having an accent

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:15.040
and using words incorrectly but confidently because language isn't a simple formula.

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:19.440
Language is the play of words so actually using the incorrect synonym.

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:32.240
Instead of saying I'm cold, saying I'm chilled or something. Using off beat words can actually be

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:35.440
part of the charm so it's interesting if you can learn how to use that correctly.

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:41.440
I know a bunch of people with a Russian accent and I feel like they get away with saying a lot

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:48.480
of ridiculous shit because they're able to sort of leverage the charm of the non-sequiturs.

01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:54.320
By the way, by the way, just one thing you talked about using a computer. When I had my

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:58.880
first personal computer, I actually wrote a program that does that.

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:05.840
It does that. By the way, when was that? Because you were a world-class programmer for a time,

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:10.880
you were a very good programmer. First PC was probably 1984.

01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.680
1984. When did you fall in love with programming?

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:19.520
When I went to college in the U.S. and part of the core curriculum was that you were required

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:26.960
to take a course in computer and it was mostly just talk but we also had to learn a language.

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:35.600
We had to write some programs in Fortran which was what, five at the time. It was a dumb

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:45.040
down Fortran but listen, I see the ability, I see what you can do with this. I programmed a

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:53.520
sine curve and then I divided the sine curve into really, really small rectangles and then

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:59.600
ran the program and it came up with the right area. Wow, this is great.

01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:07.040
It's incredible. It's incredible. It's so powerful. You're creating a little helper

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:10.240
that helps you understand the world, to help you analyze the world and so on.

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:15.760
We'll return to that because it's interesting. You have so many interesting aspects to your life.

01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:23.440
Moscow. How I was sent to Moscow. One day I had a visitor from Moscow

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:32.240
and he came to visit me in my apartment together with Nikolai and we talked and then he said,

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:37.200
how's your English? I said, I pulled a book from the shelf and says I can read that without

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:45.440
the help of a dictionary. Oh, that's interesting. He said, you know what, we're going to send you a

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:51.360
tape recorder and you just talk, say something for 20 minutes, whatever you want to talk about.

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:56.960
They sent this thing and two weeks later I was on a plane to Moscow

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:06.960
because I also spoke English, sort of the British variety of English with not a strong German

01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:14.400
accent because I've always had the ability to imitate others and sounds. That was an innate

01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:25.280
ability. When we were in a lab as students, I would very often do monologues imitating

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:28.240
East German comedians. Compressions.

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:37.680
Yes, yes. I'm not good enough to make a living out of it but that raised some interest and so

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:45.200
they sent me to Moscow. That was the first time on a plane by the way and I had a conversation

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:52.560
with two ladies who spoke English. One was a Russian, a professor at Lomonosov University.

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:58.160
She was obviously KGB. That was her cover and the other one was an American born lady.

01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:02.720
By the way, she was an actual professor using that as the cover or is it just a story?

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:07.120
No, she said she was a professor. She may have taught there too.

01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:13.280
That's an interesting distinction. One is like a story you tell people and one is like you legit

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:21.280
are doing the thing but also as a cover. Anyway, that's an interesting aspect of how

01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:24.640
to be a good liar. You might as well live the lie.

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:31.680
Yeah, exactly right. The other one was a middle-aged, the Russian was pretty young,

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:39.120
the other one was middle-aged American and so we talked for maybe a couple of hours and then they

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:46.960
withdrew and I was left alone. Eventually, my liaison, he came back in and he said

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:50.640
it was close but the American thinks you can actually

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:57.920
become, you get close enough to becoming a native speaker of American English.

01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:05.920
He said the Russian was very doubtful and so I think wishful, it was a tie literally,

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:13.040
wishful thinking prevailed. Within a couple of weeks, I was moving to Moscow.

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:20.800
Mm-hmm. What was the task in Moscow? How long were you in Moscow?

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:21.280
Two years.

01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:26.880
What was the task there? Is it training or is it espionage?

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:34.560
No, it was training. The American-born became my tutor. I met with her twice a week.

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:46.240
I also listened to a lot of BBC, Shortwave, BBC Worldwide. I read more English books.

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:49.920
So a lot of that was about the language and the culture of English, American.

01:41:51.120 --> 01:42:02.080
And I did phonetics exercises every night. I had a tape that was about a half hour long

01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:08.240
and they would say a word and I would repeat the word, say a word, repeat the word. It's

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:14.320
mostly about the vowels, by the way, most of the accent and particularly, let's say,

01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:18.960
coming from German into English but also Russian. It's the vowels.

01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:22.240
Are we talking about the, so you would have a single word?

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:22.720
A word.

01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.400
Apple and you would just say apple.

01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:25.200
Yes.

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:27.840
American English or British English?

01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:34.000
No, American English. I'll give you one example that almost nobody gets right.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.080
The difference between hot and hut.

01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:43.040
German speakers, it's very tough.

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:48.880
You know which one, for everyone it's different. For example, I can say this on a podcast,

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:52.400
something that my brother struggles with, I struggled with too when I first

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:57.760
came to this country learning English, is there's differences, there's embarrassing differences

01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:05.120
like beach and bitch. And you get so, as a young kid also, you get so nervous. I don't

01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:12.720
want to say the wrong thing. I can also say that this is almost a jokey thing, but there's a

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:18.880
famous philosopher, Immanuel Kant, and you can guess which other word is very similar to that.

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:25.200
So there's a nervousness about what is that? That's interesting. I mean,

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:31.520
and Germans probably have a different tension of like what is hard to learn,

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:35.200
the difference between the pronunciation of the vowels or the control of the vowels.

01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:39.360
Yeah, it's interesting. So you had to really master this daily exercise.

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:44.560
And you know, and this was my discipline. I did this every night, routine, boring as hell.

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:52.480
So English was the focus. And I also had interaction with some agents who had operated

01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:57.840
in the United States as diplomats on a diplomatic cover. They would come and talk to me a little

01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:04.640
bit and tell me and sort of prepare me what was ahead of me. And then I did a whole lot of

01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:09.760
operational training, particularly surveillance detection that was big. They also taught me how

01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:15.520
to drive a car in Moscow. Finally, the one skill you needed. What's surveillance detection?

01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:19.120
Okay, so this is what when you find out whether you're being followed.

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:22.800
Ah, got it, got it, got it. So it's the anti-surveillance, yeah, gotcha.

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:32.240
The abbreviation that's used in, yes, in intelligence services, SDR, surveillance detection

01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:39.120
route. When they say that, you know what that is. And that was it. And a few other things

01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:50.000
one-offs, for instance, I was once taught to read silhouettes of ships. When you see a ship from a

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:57.440
distance, what kind of a ship it might be. They thought this would come in handy. Actually,

01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:06.720
there was in 1982, Andropov started a campaign. It was, now I forget the name,

01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:10.640
Operation Something Something, where everybody who was in the West was supposed to

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:18.800
look for signs that the West was getting ready for war. And everybody had an object to

01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:33.360
pay attention to. I had a harbor, a military harbor in New Jersey near Red Bank. It was called Earl

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:40.960
Weapon Station. And its code name for that was early. So they asked me to just wander by there

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:47.120
to see if there was something unusual going on. Because the Soviet Union were, at that point,

01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:51.920
it was Ronald Reagan were really afraid that Reagan was going to start a war. They were

01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:58.800
absolutely 100% afraid of him. Is there something memorable to you on a personal level, on a

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:04.000
philosophical level, about your time in Moscow? Something that kind of stays with you outside of

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:07.520
the training stuff, maybe? Like the details of the training?

01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:18.560
You'll love the answer. You will love the answer. I was given tickets to two performances by

01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:25.840
Americans. There was a theater troupe that played Our Town. And then there was this,

01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:31.840
I forget the name of the guy, but you may not be old enough. Have you ever watched Hee Haw?

01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:34.420
Maybe.

01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:41.360
There was a country music show, real kitschy. But the star of Hee Haw

01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:48.480
was giving a concert in Moscow. And I guarantee you at least half the audience were KGB.

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:52.400
Oh, man.

01:46:52.400 --> 01:47:02.000
And at the other end, the opposite of a highlight was my visit to the

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:17.520
mausoleum where Lenin is still today. There was nothing. He was my hero,

01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:24.000
but he looked like a wax figure. And you walk by there, there was nothing inspirational.

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:28.960
It was not a religious experience, nothing. It was a big old nothing.

01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:36.800
Did your faith and belief in communism start to crumble at some point here?

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:37.300
No.

01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:39.440
That was still pretty strong.

01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:45.680
What I did notice that the standard of living in Moscow was significantly lower than in East

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:55.840
Germany. In the supermarkets, you could expect with reliability that you can find canned fish

01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:03.600
and mineral water. Everything else was whatever. And if you saw a line at a store, you just line

01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:07.360
up. You don't even ask what they have because if you don't like it, somebody else will.

01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:16.240
It was not poverty, but it was close to poverty. There were a lot of drunken men in the streets.

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:19.040
This is the 80s?

01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:28.800
No, this is the late 70s, mid to late 70s. And also they had these high-rise apartment buildings

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:34.000
that looked pretty good from the front, but you went into the backyard. Ouch.

01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:37.200
Yeah, you're describing my childhood here. Okay.

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:43.200
But it's interesting. Even with a professor, even with everything else,

01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:50.240
it's interesting because I think the standard of living was much lower, even in Moscow.

01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:55.680
Yeah, absolutely was. The one thing that they always had, at least in my days, was in those

01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:00.160
two years, there was always fresh bread in the Bulletinayas. Always.

01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:07.520
That's probably one of the memories I have of childhood. Well, you're hungry a lot, but

01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:11.120
when you eat is bread. And the bread was good.

01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:19.040
It was good. I actually wonder how good it was, but I remember it being incredibly good.

01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:25.920
To me, it was really good. You had it from white to very dark and all the varieties.

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:32.560
The other thing that was good was, if you knew where to get it, Stolichnaya was four rubles.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.320
Not only is it good vodka, but it's cheap vodka. I like it.

01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:44.560
Yeah, but you had to know where... This would be like holes in the wall someplace.

01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:49.360
Well, I think a lot of the way they operate... I wonder if East Germany is this way, but a lot

01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:53.280
of the ways that Moscow operates is you had to know.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.400
Yes. There's a very kind of...

01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:03.920
If you make the right friends, if you give money to the right guy, the guy, the friend of the friend

01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:09.920
of the friend is going to hook you up. There's a culture. This is how you work around a very big

01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:12.080
bureaucracy. Underground economy.

01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:24.480
Underground economy, yeah. Which is, boy, such a stark contrast between that and the United States,

01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:33.360
the capitalist system. Yeah, that was a very big culture shock to me to understand the

01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:38.400
fundamentally different way of life. But the interesting thing is

01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:44.720
human nature pervades both systems. There's something about the Russian system that reveals

01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:50.400
human nature more intensely because of the underground nature of it, because you get to

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:56.560
deal with greed and trust and all those kinds of things. In the United States, there is much more

01:50:56.560 --> 01:51:02.480
power to the rule of law, so there's rules, and people follow those rules. You have to break the

01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:06.240
rules nonstop. Well, in East Germany and Russia, I believe

01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:11.360
theft, if you could get away with it, was part of your economic activity.

01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:21.280
Yeah. I have a friend who I went to school with up until my fourth year, and we reconnected,

01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:26.880
and he told me how he survived. He would just steal stuff and then sell it or trade it.

01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:32.160
Yeah, theft, it's a relative concept. Taking stuff.

01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:36.800
You are taking stuff. Bribery, all those kinds of things. People,

01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:44.400
corruption, it's a relative term. No, I'm just kidding. I mean, it is. You have to work around

01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:50.480
the giant bureaucracy about the giant corruption. Corruption builds on top of corruption, and it

01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:55.520
just becomes this giant system that's unstable, as you talked about.

01:51:55.520 --> 01:52:07.200
One last word. The two years in Moscow taught me how to be alone. I had no social interaction.

01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:10.640
Not with friends, not with women?

01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:15.360
No. The only interaction I had was with the folks that trained me,

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:20.480
so I was alone. It was a lonely two years.

01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:22.880
For a person who loves love, was that difficult?

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:29.040
Yes, but that prepared me for my first year and first and second year in the United States

01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:34.960
because I could not interact socially without giving away that something was wrong with me.

01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:39.520
I had to learn how to be an American. They didn't teach me in Moscow. They couldn't.

01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:45.760
The first two years in America, you had to kind of listen more than talk.

01:52:45.760 --> 01:52:51.040
Oh, you bet. The very first year, I couldn't even work because I had to acquire the documents,

01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:57.920
a social security card, and a driver's license to get a job. Then when I had the job,

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.400
I worked as a bike messenger. That gave me a good opportunity to listen

01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:10.640
because these people, they weren't very curious about me.

01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:16.880
What was your name in East Germany? What was your name in Moscow? What was your name in America?

01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:20.480
Okay, so the name I was given at birth is Albrecht Dittrich.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.640
So sexy when you speak in German for the German accent.

01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:30.000
I hated that name, Albrecht. I didn't like it. It was very rarely used.

01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:35.360
My mother named me after a famous German painter, Albrecht de Dürer.

01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:44.240
My cover name in Moscow was known as Dieter. In the United States, I became Jack Barsky.

01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:48.560
In between, I used a whole bunch of other names that were associated with

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:56.560
false passports that I used. One of the names I remember is William Dyson because

01:53:57.120 --> 01:54:02.080
that is the name that was on the Canadian passport I used to enter the United States.

01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:06.160
So how did you enter the United States? Can we take the journey from Moscow to the United States?

01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:07.360
Yeah.

01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:12.640
What was the assignment? What was that leap? What was like?

01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:22.160
Just one thing in between. I had a three-month practice trip to Canada. That was a good idea.

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:25.280
And I've got to tell you this one thing that happened there.

01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:25.520
Yes, please.

01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:33.680
Okay. Because the one thing that I like to tell people nowadays is one of the secrets

01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:37.600
to happiness is the ability to make fun of the worst situations that you're in.

01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:38.160
Yes, absolutely.

01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:39.040
You see the humor.

01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:39.440
Yes.

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:43.200
Okay. So here comes something quite humorous, in hindsight at least.

01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:49.280
The task that I had in Canada was to acquire a birth certificate.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:57.600
The name was Henry Van Randall, who was born someplace in California, and I was supposed to

01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:03.280
write a little letter saying, I'm Henry Van Randall. Please send me a copy of my birth

01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:13.360
certificate. The fee is enclosed. And I lived in a small hotel, so the return address,

01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:19.840
it wasn't visible that it was a hotel. That was important. And it took like three weeks,

01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:25.760
and I get nothing. Four weeks, I get nothing. Eventually, I got annoyed and I

01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:36.320
I mustered the courage to call them up from a payphone. I called up the office registrar,

01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:41.360
whatever they were called in this town in California, and I yelled at them. I said,

01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:46.080
you got my money. Where's my birth certificate? Well, a couple of weeks later, it came.

01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:55.600
So I see the envelope. It says Henry Van Randall. Yes. I had prepared the caretakers of the hotel

01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:02.720
that I'm expecting a letter from my friend. So I went up to my room. I opened it, and I was like,

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:09.360
yes, yes, this is a success. And I opened this thing, and it was a copy of a birth certificate,

01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:15.920
but it was stamped with big letters across in red, deceased. Now think about it. So here's the

01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:22.800
dead people who was asking for, that person who was asking for a birth certificate. I had the

01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:28.240
presence of mind to leave, okay? I went to a couple of other cities. I should have left the

01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:36.320
country, but I know that the Royal Mounted Police was following me. I was given that information by

01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:43.360
the FBI later on, and they were- Oh, you were able to at least suspect that at the time?

01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:48.720
Through the- I knew that there was trouble. So

01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:55.280
my counter surveillance route- SDR.

01:56:55.280 --> 01:57:02.800
Yes, didn't discover anything. So I kept on going. I was supposed to visit two more cities,

01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:10.080
and they were always one step behind. What is interesting to me is that they didn't catch me

01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:20.880
on the way out. You have to show your passport to the airline. I was known by name because I had to

01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:29.040
give that to the hotel, right? And I escaped by a hair. They would have to keep you on a list,

01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:37.520
right? Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting, but that requires a good computerized updated system.

01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:44.720
And this was Swiss air, so- Well, you got lucky. Part of life is luck.

01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:54.880
You bet. And other than that, the trip to Canada was a big success because it

01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:05.520
gave me the culture shock that I needed to not be blown out of the water when I get to the United

01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:12.240
States. So you hopped a few places in Canada, and then Swiss air. I even had a relationship

01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:21.040
with a young lady. A Canadian, French Canadian, regular Canadian. French Canadian, and she gave me

01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:27.280
a book, Winnie the Pooh, because we went to see the movie, and then she wrote the dedication,

01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:34.240
she says, to the nicest German I've ever met. Was she lying? No. Or you don't know.

01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:40.800
Speaking of spycraft, and that led to heartbreak too?

01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:52.560
No. That was sexual. I was not at that point- Ready to return to that old-

01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:58.320
Well, I was already married in Germany. That woman I loved.

01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:06.160
We should return to this. So Swiss air, where did you land in the United States?

01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:13.280
When I came, where did I land? An American Airlines flight from Mexico City to

01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:21.840
Toronto, but they made me de-plane in Chicago. I have no idea. I think that was over-engineering.

01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:27.840
That didn't make any sense to me. Why can't a Canadian just take a flight from Mexico City?

01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:34.080
With this stopover, this kind of nonsense. Yeah, but okay. Nevertheless, that was it,

01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:36.160
and then you landed in Chicago. Right.

01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:42.720
Tell me the story in America. What was the day-to-day life? Now you're a spy.

01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:46.400
No, I got to tell you another funny story. Yes.

01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:55.760
There's two things that happened that could have ended my career as a spy right then and there.

01:59:56.320 --> 02:00:09.040
So I'm arriving in Chicago in the evening. It's already dark. I had no idea what kind of hotel

02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:16.800
to take. I picked one out of Yellow Pages and got a taxi. When I gave him the address,

02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:23.680
he looked at me like a little funny. Whatever, what do I know? Just keep on going. I need to

02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:31.760
get sleep because I was extremely tense having gone through customs and border control.

02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:39.760
We were going in the southern direction, and I noticed that the neighborhoods became less

02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:46.800
and less inviting. I didn't know what that meant either. I entered the hotel. It was a

02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:52.240
five-story brownstone, and something else looked funny. The reception desk was

02:00:52.960 --> 02:01:00.240
protected by plexiglass. Not having enough background, I didn't know that this was

02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:05.360
unusual. All I knew was that there was a lot of crime in the United States, so I thought maybe

02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:11.360
every hotel was like that. So I go up into my room and drink a half a bottle of Johnny Walker Red.

02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:19.360
Because I was so damn tense, I just wanted to sleep. I wanted to get into a coma,

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:27.920
which I did. The next day I woke up with a headache. It felt twice as big, but I was prepared.

02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:33.680
I had aspirin with me, so I killed the headache and went outside to see if I could get something

02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:40.080
to eat. I was right smack in the middle of the south side of Chicago. I didn't know that the

02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:48.400
south side of Chicago existed later. I found out where I was. It was time to go very quickly.

02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:58.480
I go up there, and at that point I decided I would register at the next hotel under Jack Barsky.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:06.320
I went to the bathroom, and I tried to kill off Mr. Dyson by burning his passport.

02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:14.000
Unfortunately, I was not trained in how to train passport, how to destroy passports.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:23.600
So I tried to burn it, and these things were flame retardant. It created a cloud of smoke,

02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:26.640
and I'm looking up there, and there's a smoke detector.

02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:28.400
Yeah, oh no.

02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:33.840
Okay, so presence of mind, I threw this thing in the toilet, and then took out a pair of scissors

02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:39.280
and cut it into small pieces and flushed it down. If that smoke alarm goes off, I'm busted.

02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:47.920
Right? If somebody, if some criminal steals, I had $6,000 on me in cash, steals either my passport

02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:52.240
or my money or both, I don't know what to do.

02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:54.400
Yeah, you can't go to the authorities. You can't do anything.

02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:57.360
There weren't any Russian, the Soviets in Chicago.

02:02:57.360 --> 02:02:58.640
Do you have any contacts?

02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:08.400
No, there was no Plan B for Chicago at all. That's an oversight. I shouldn't have gone to

02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:15.600
Chicago. They could have shipped me into San Francisco or Washington, D.C. because both of

02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:25.760
them had Soviets. My end goal was to go to New York. Fine. I would have been a really, really

02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:30.640
dangerous agent if I had gone back and worked with the KGB, because I could have told them

02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:33.360
all the things, how to do it right. Right?

02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:41.280
In that sense, there is some, given the scale of the KGB, there is some incompetence in this.

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:41.520
Some?

02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:43.120
A lot of incompetence.

02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:48.000
With regard to preparing me to be an American, it was almost total incompetent.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.840
Do you think that's representative of the way they operate, is there's an incompetence to the

02:03:55.280 --> 02:04:00.160
logistics, to the strategies involved, all that kind of stuff?

02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:06.880
None of these guys had operated as illegals. They were outsiders to American society. They

02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:13.120
had interaction with Americans, but they all lived in New York. They lived in a compound

02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:17.200
in northern Manhattan, where they all lived together with their families.

02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:23.920
Most of the time, they spent interacting with themselves, with their own people at work.

02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:26.080
They really didn't integrate well?

02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:33.120
They did not know what it's like to be an American, to have a job, to live like an American.

02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:34.000
They didn't know it.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:38.800
It's interesting that KGB didn't put a high value to that kind of integration.

02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:40.080
They didn't know what they didn't know.

02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:46.800
By the way, this was mutual. Do you think the CIA had good knowledge of the Russian culture?

02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:54.160
Same thing. There was a lot of lack of understanding, because good intelligence could

02:04:54.160 --> 02:05:01.360
have possibly avoided some of the high tension situations that we had in the 80s when we got

02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:02.480
close to nuclear war.

02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:07.280
Good intelligence would be integrating yourself in society.

02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:11.840
Yes, and understanding that Ronald Reagan was not a warmonger,

02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:15.360
but he was talking about the end times because he was a Christian.

02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:20.800
But then that kind of integration can be dangerous, because you start to question

02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:26.480
the propaganda, the narratives on which the KGB is built, on which the CIA is built.

02:05:26.480 --> 02:05:32.320
And then they always had the option of ignoring the intelligence that they're getting, right?

02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:36.240
Well, let me ask you this question to jump around.

02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:43.280
There is a lot of conspiracy theories in this current climate throughout history, but now

02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:51.920
especially. Some of the conspiracy theories put a lot of power in the hands of the intelligence

02:05:51.920 --> 02:06:02.080
agencies like CIA, FSB, Mossad, MI6. Basically, the conspiracy theories go that they control

02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:10.320
the powerful people in this world and are able to thereby manipulate those powerful people and

02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:16.400
manipulate the populace in order to deliver different kinds of messages and so on.

02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:22.720
Given your experience with this kind of tension between competence and malevolence,

02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:25.760
would you say there's some truth to those conspiracy theories?

02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:33.920
Not one way. I think there is collusion, there's collaboration, but I would think that,

02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:41.200
like for instance, some folks in the CIA and the FBI are being used by the ones that are really

02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:50.640
in power. Power is money, power is wealth. But it can go both directions. You can acquire wealth

02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:55.040
first, which leads you to power, or you can acquire power first.

02:06:55.040 --> 02:07:02.480
Yeah, power is also knowledge, I understand, and a position in society, in the military,

02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:07.440
in intelligence. But I don't think it's a straight one way that all the intelligence agencies

02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:12.560
control the powerful people in their country. You see what's happening in Russia. Putin dominates

02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:15.280
his intelligence agencies, right?

02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:21.440
Well, so the question is which way the direction goes,

02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:25.520
but you're saying that it's not a one-way flow of power.

02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:32.240
I would think so. And I also believe it exists, but it's not as prevalent as, you know,

02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:38.160
not every conspiracy theory pans out, and most of them don't. They're just damn rumors,

02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:42.400
but it does mean they don't exist. I guarantee you they exist. There's collusion, there's people

02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:51.520
getting together, and not necessarily preparing a specific action, but more sort of a plan to go

02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:57.360
forward and maintain the position or even, you know, strengthen the position that they already

02:07:57.360 --> 02:08:05.680
have. So KGB, but we can generalize, FSB, CIA, do you think a KGB agent would kill someone against

02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:09.200
international law if they were ordered to do so? So we talked about-

02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:21.760
They did. They did. And there's a famous case of one, I think it's Vasily Kuklov,

02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:30.240
who defected. He was a killer. He was a train killer, and he had done assassinations in other

02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:36.480
countries. He was sent to West Germany to kill a defector, a KGB defector, and he decided not to

02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:41.760
do it. He talked to the guy, and he said, I'm supposed to kill you. I'm not. And then he

02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:48.640
eventually wound up in the United States. I have a connection to this fellow because the KGB once

02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:57.360
asked me to go to California and see if the guy still lives and works there. And I found him,

02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:07.280
and we looked at each other. So there was an active KGB agent looking at a man that he didn't

02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:12.480
know was the KGB defector, looking at each other. Neither one knew who the other one was.

02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:17.200
I found out later. But he was able to survive.

02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:25.600
Yes. And, you know, there have been assassinations, not a lot. And, you know-

02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:26.960
That we know of.

02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:28.800
A good point.

02:09:28.800 --> 02:09:36.800
This is very difficult. The question is, how many lines are intelligence agencies

02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:42.560
willing to cross to achieve the goal?

02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:52.080
I think none of these agencies have the ultimate line. I think eventually the last line will be

02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:55.360
crossed if they believe it's necessary.

02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:59.200
Well, I think you can justify a lot of things, especially in this modern

02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:03.120
world with nuclear weapons, that you can justify that you're saving the world, actually.

02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:08.000
Let me ask a few difficult questions, and we'll jump back to your time in America.

02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:17.360
Vladimir Putin has been accused of ordering the poisoning and assassination of several people,

02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:24.320
including Aleksandr Levinenko, early on, all the way to Alexei Navalny. Do you think these

02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:31.760
accusations are grounded in truth? And we will return to a couple more questions, maybe,

02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:35.840
above Vladimir Putin's early days in the KGB, which would be interesting.

02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:42.320
Yeah. There's a phrase that I like to say, and the response is called plausible deniability.

02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:48.560
I don't think Putin gave a direct command as they do that. He would just maybe muse. It would be

02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:52.880
nice if something were to happen, and then somebody picks it up and does it.

02:10:55.360 --> 02:11:02.000
Can you still man the case that Putin did not have direct or indirect involvement with this?

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.240
Who would know? Who would know?

02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:17.520
Well, the reputation, perhaps catalyzed by Putin himself, is that he is the kind of person that

02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:24.960
would directly or indirectly make those orders. Perhaps the case there is he's somebody to be

02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:28.480
feared, and thereby you won't have that narrative out there.

02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:39.440
But the act itself, the poisoning of Levinenko and the assassination of the Bulgarian

02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:49.360
Markov with the umbrella, and they all directly traced back to Russian Soviet intelligence.

02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:58.240
And so that's enough to be feared, right? My answer that I gave you is an educated guess.

02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:02.160
I can't pretend to know this for sure.

02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:06.560
It's frustrating to me because there's a lot of people listening to this would say,

02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:13.520
would even sort of chuckle at the naive nature of the question.

02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:18.720
But if you actually keep an open mind, you have to understand what is the way that intelligence

02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:26.800
agencies function? Is it possible to the head of an intelligence agency not to make direct orders

02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:29.520
of that kind? Where there's a distributed-

02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:33.520
No, the head of the intelligence agency would most likely give the order.

02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:35.120
Even though it's compartmentalized.

02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:38.080
Yeah, but not the head of state.

02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:40.080
Maybe not the head of state.

02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:48.320
Although in the case, this is the case in the United States as well, but certainly is the case

02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:53.920
in Russia, there are close relationships between the head of the FSB and the GRU and

02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:56.640
personal relationships, not just even-

02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:58.400
The head of the FSB who was now in jail?

02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:09.120
There's interesting details, especially coming out recently around the war in Ukraine.

02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:13.280
So let me actually ask about the war in Ukraine.

02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:22.160
What is your analysis of the war in Ukraine from 2014 to the full-on invasion of Ukraine by Russia

02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:31.440
in 2022, in February 2022? There's many questions we could ask.

02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:41.120
One is, what are the sins of the governments involved? What are the sins of Russia, Ukraine,

02:13:41.920 --> 02:13:49.520
America, China? Are those sins comparable? Who are the good guys and the bad guys?

02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:56.400
That was more than one question. Let me just give you the basics about this.

02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:06.480
Savvy observers saw this coming. They were a very small minority because Vladimir Putin was pretty

02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:13.920
open about what he told the world his mission was, was the re-establishment of a strong Russia,

02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:19.920
the re-establishment of something like the Russian Empire to unite all the Russian-speaking

02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:32.080
people under one country, and the world ignored him. He was open. He was at a conference in France,

02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:39.200
I believe, where he said this out in the open. Then what we had in the United States,

02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:47.600
we had wishful thinking. Obama had this reset with Russia. We all get friendly.

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:59.280
Then when Putin invaded Crimea, we did nothing. It just escalated slowly, but surely

02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:09.920
it was pretty clear. I think two years ago there was an essay published by Putin. Whether he wrote

02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:14.640
it or not doesn't matter, but that was also out in public where he was, again, quite clear what

02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:24.000
he was going to do. Now, how do you do this? With force. The sins committed by the American

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:29.840
government was that we ignored it. We were engaged in wishful thinking, and we didn't stop it

02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:37.520
with sanctions before the shooting started. To push back, I don't think you're fully describing,

02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:42.720
you are describing the sins of the Russian government and Putin. I don't think you're

02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:49.360
fully describing the sins of the American government here because you're describing

02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:57.280
the miscalculation. Not only did they not pressure correctly with sanctions and so on, and clearly

02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:02.080
respond to the actual statements and the essays and the words spoken.

02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:04.000
I know where you're going, but keep on speaking.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:14.080
Yes, but they also, at the same time, pressured Russia. They also, as Putin himself said,

02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:20.000
there's a rat, and they pushed the rat towards the corner by expanding NATO.

02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:23.840
And arming Ukraine.

02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:31.760
And, well, the military industrial complex is a machine that led us,

02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:40.160
and I think a lot of younger people, I mean, when I came to this country, and this is a country I

02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:50.240
love, I lived through 9-11. I lived through the full roller coaster of emotion. I'm a,

02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:57.680
at that time, before that, and after, was a proud American. I went through the whole roller coaster

02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:06.560
of being sold, I would say, a lie about the reason to invade Iraq and even Afghanistan.

02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:14.320
And I got to live through understanding of this military industrial complex that leads to the

02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:22.640
expansion of empires, of the delusion that we have in the populace, in the government,

02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:29.040
that convinces us that we're the good guys, and somehow, with military force,

02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:35.440
we can instill our values, instill happiness, the pursuit of happiness, that all men are created

02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:44.080
equal, these ideas into other lands. And we can do so with drones, and we can do so with weapons,

02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:51.760
and we can do so without significant cost from our own pockets. And so, this idea, this machine

02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:56.960
doesn't just apply to Afghanistan and Iraq, it doesn't just apply to Yemen and Syria,

02:17:56.960 --> 02:18:01.680
it doesn't just apply to China, it also applies to Ukraine, it also applies to Russia.

02:18:01.680 --> 02:18:09.680
Agreed. Two thoughts, if I may. First of all, one does not hear the term military industrial

02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:16.720
complex in the public discourse these days. Eisenhower warned about it. Eisenhower was a

02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:23.920
capitalist, he was the President of the United States. So, it exists, and it is very powerful.

02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:28.800
The more weapons you can sell, the more you have to replace them, or send over,

02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:35.840
you have to replace them, so yes. The other thing is, there's also a messianic streak

02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:46.560
that powers American foreign policy. We want to make the world just like us. Why don't they get it?

02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:52.800
Because they don't want to. It's almost like, it's not communism, but it's a very similar romantic

02:18:52.800 --> 02:19:00.000
idea that we can make the world and fashion the world the way we are. And that's the romantic side

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:06.160
and the honest side, but it doesn't work. It failed every time, right? Afghanistan

02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:13.600
is a royal mess and would never have become a functioning democracy. I don't know if Ukraine

02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:20.400
can become a functioning democracy. Well, I don't know if American weapons can help

02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:27.120
Ukraine become a functional democracy. Yeah, absolutely right. But there's a huge amount

02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:33.600
of interest in seeing the world in black and white, and selling the story of the world as

02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:42.720
black and white, that Ukraine is the symbol of democracy in this Eastern European world,

02:19:42.720 --> 02:19:49.120
and Russia is the symbol of authoritarian dictatorship. And the story is not so simple

02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:56.240
as many indices show. Ukraine and Russia are the number one and the number two most corrupt

02:19:56.240 --> 02:20:02.080
countries in Europe. There are two peas in a pod. One is bigger and one is, in this case,

02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:09.760
the aggressor. Now, two peas, the aggressor is still ultimately responsible.

02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:15.360
The person that throws the first punch, now there's a lot of people going to disagree

02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:22.240
where the first punch came from, but there is magnitude. And the struggle

02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:29.040
by Ukraine for its sovereignty stretches back to the beginning of the 20th century,

02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:34.320
it stretches back even further than that. But there's been, the Ukrainian people are proud people,

02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:42.640
and they've been, in many cases, tortured by those that sit in the Kremlin throughout the 20th

02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:49.680
century. The famine in the early 30s. And it's always, it's never the middle class and upper

02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:57.280
class that suffer. It's always the lower classes, the peasants in that time. This history stretches

02:20:57.280 --> 02:21:05.520
back far. And this is yet another manifestation of that. And there's a lot of interest to play.

02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:14.000
China watches closely, Russia, America watches closely, and there's an extra caveat here that

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:24.240
there's nuclear weapons at play as well. Exactly. And the situation is as dangerous as I have

02:21:24.240 --> 02:21:31.280
lived through in my entire life, I believe. And because it's not necessarily at the highest point

02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:37.760
of escalation, but it will be, in my view, a protracted crisis. And the longer that crisis

02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:45.840
lasts, the more of a chance there is of an accident. Yeah. One rocket. Yep. There seems

02:21:45.840 --> 02:21:51.840
to be a strong incentive to prolong, to do siege tactics, to prolong this conflict over

02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:59.280
perhaps many years, which is terrifying to think about. And over that, one, a single rocket

02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:06.400
can lead to, given that there's leaders that might not, that might be losing their mind,

02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:15.600
and Ukraine is not part of NATO. The thing I'm really afraid of is that somebody might think

02:22:15.600 --> 02:22:22.240
it's a good idea. But for Russia, so Putin might think it's a good idea for Russia to send a message

02:22:23.200 --> 02:22:29.760
by launching a nuke against Ukraine, because they're not part of NATO. So surely the West

02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:37.760
is not going to respond. What is the West going to do if Russia nukes Ukraine to send a message?

02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:43.200
I don't know if anyone knows the answer to that question, but it's a terrifying question.

02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:52.000
And I don't know the exact protocol that needs to be followed to launch a nuclear

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:58.240
strike from NATO's end, because we have several countries in NATO that have nuclear weapons.

02:22:58.960 --> 02:23:05.040
So let's say for France to fire a nuke, does the United States have to agree? I don't know

02:23:05.040 --> 02:23:13.600
how that works. I don't know if anyone knows how that works. I worry, now we have different,

02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:19.120
very kind of anecdotal perspectives on these things, but the people I've interacted with in

02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:25.840
the DOD Department of Defense, in the military, there is a compartmentalization. There is a

02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:30.400
bureaucracy, and within that giant bureaucracy, there's incompetence. We'd like to think

02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:39.120
that there is really well-organized, for really important things, there's going to be the best

02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:43.520
of the best in the world that's going to execute on the correct decisions,

02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:48.080
both geopolitically, militarily, all that kind of stuff. And I've seen enough to know

02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:54.480
that competence at any level of government, at any level of the military is not guaranteed.

02:23:54.480 --> 02:24:00.560
Let's go back to the law of hierarchy. The government is the biggest hierarchy there is,

02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:07.520
and so invariably, politicians find their way to the top. And once you have politics in

02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:18.880
dictating substantive decisions, they're going to be weak or wrong. I don't know how this could

02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:26.080
work any other way there. Right now, we have some functional idiots in the United States government.

02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:34.960
Well, because you said that, I think elsewhere, you said that Putin was not a good KGB agent,

02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:38.800
a mediocre one, but is an excellent politician.

02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:43.200
Yeah, and a good organizer. He was known as a really, really good organizer. When

02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:52.880
Yeltsin hired him as Prime Minister, he cleaned up the mess because under Yeltsin,

02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:04.480
Russia deteriorated tremendously. It became sort of a mix of an oligarchy and a criminal enterprise

02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:08.880
and chaotic. So he had skills that made him a good executive.

02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:12.320
Absolutely. Now, let's go back to him as a KGB agent.

02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:21.680
He was a KGB agent. According to him, once a KGB agent, always a KGB agent, but 16 years,

02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:28.320
let's say, something like this. What do you think about, from your experience,

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:34.560
now you're maybe the same age as him, approximately the same age as him.

02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:35.520
He's a little younger.

02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:36.080
A little younger.

02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:36.580
Yeah.

02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:45.360
What do you think about the KGB experience he had made him the man he is? What aspect of that,

02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:52.400
from your own experience, how much does that define you, who you are, how you think about

02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:57.840
the world, how you analyze the geopolitics of the world, how you analyze human nature?

02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:01.920
Now, I got to tell you one thing. He had a different type of training than I did. Mine

02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:06.560
was one-on-one, and he went to school, so to speak.

02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:08.560
A classroom journey.

02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:20.720
Right. But fundamentally, he was not a top agent. This is very simple. There's only one thing you

02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:29.120
need to know. He knows German pretty well. Where was he deployed? In East Germany. Not in West

02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:32.720
Germany, not in Switzerland, not in Austria. That's where they sent the best, right?

02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:34.960
One would think, generally.

02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:36.800
We're learning here.

02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:37.200
Right.

02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:42.800
So this is your classification of where they sent the best. People classify all kinds of stuff,

02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:46.960
like what is the best university in the world, what is the best football team in the world.

02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:52.480
You start to get a sense, the good guys get sent, the best athletes get sent to,

02:26:53.280 --> 02:26:57.600
well, we disagree on this, but the football team is in trouble. But you have a sense,

02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:00.000
and you're saying that the best agents would have been sent.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:07.120
One would think so. Now, this is not a forcing argument, but I also have it from a word from

02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:07.920
the horse's mouth.

02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:13.920
Which horse? I mean, what kind of horse? What's the breed of the horse?

02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:19.920
Oleg Kalugin. You know who Oleg Kalugin is, and he's still alive. He was, at one point,

02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:26.800
the head of counterintelligence for the first directorate, espionage, right? And Putin was in

02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:33.040
the first directorate and reported to Kalugin for a while. And Oleg told me, to my face,

02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:39.200
that Oleg was not an impressive agent trainee or agent.

02:27:39.200 --> 02:27:40.960
That Vladimir Putin was not impressive?

02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:42.320
Not impressive at all.

02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:45.920
Now, he's biased, given this current situation.

02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:51.840
Well, yeah, you know, he could still make it up because he had this big ruckus when

02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:57.200
he was in parliament and called Putin a war criminal about the war in Serbia.

02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:01.440
Not only could he make it up, I wouldn't trust his analysis.

02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:08.720
I mean, I have to, you know, when people, I've been working very hard even before this war to

02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:13.360
try to understand objective analysis of all the parties involved. You have to really keep

02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:20.400
an open mind here to see clearly, to understand if you are to try to help in some way

02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:31.520
make a better world. In this case, stop this war or have all the countries involved flourish,

02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:36.320
bring out the best in the people, remove the corruption and the greed and the destructive

02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:41.440
aspects of the governments and let the people flourish. For all of that, you have to put all

02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:52.640
the biases aside, all the political bickering, all the, I don't know, all the biased analysis.

02:28:55.200 --> 02:29:01.600
There's a lot of propaganda that says that, in fact, Putin was a good agent.

02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:05.120
How else would he rise to the ranks, right?

02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:13.280
Because he was a good politician and he made a lot of good connections within the KGB.

02:29:14.240 --> 02:29:22.480
Allow me to say something. You just taught me a lesson and the lesson I should have figured out

02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:28.960
myself because I keep on telling people that in the intelligence world, you never know the truth

02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:34.960
100%. So when you said, oh, I could make that up, of course you could have. But you get to a point

02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:42.800
where you're forced to make a decision or have an opinion and then you use your best educated guess.

02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:47.680
So I'm going to take the certainty of the statement that I made back

02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:50.640
because it's quite possible that you're right.

02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:54.720
Well, what I've noticed about Vladimir Putin, and this is true about, for example,

02:29:54.720 --> 02:30:02.320
Donald Trump and all those kinds of divisive figures, that for some reason people's opinion

02:30:02.320 --> 02:30:07.760
on the details of those people are very sticky. Once you decide this is a bad guy,

02:30:09.040 --> 02:30:15.120
there's like a black hole and people are not able to think one act at a time.

02:30:17.440 --> 02:30:24.560
That doesn't somehow justify this, that somehow doesn't remove all the evil things that are done,

02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:31.040
but you can analyze clearly each of the actions. To me, it is interesting to see how did this man

02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:38.400
rise through the ranks. Now you're saying that to be a KGB agent, there's a lot of skills involved

02:30:39.920 --> 02:30:51.440
and perhaps raw technical skill of spycraft is perhaps not related to the skill of rising

02:30:51.440 --> 02:30:56.400
through the ranks. And you're saying as a politician, he was good at rising through the ranks.

02:30:56.400 --> 02:31:06.320
Lying and influencing is something that is a significant talent and ability that an agent

02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:14.880
must have. That helps you as a politician. Continuing the kind of thread of the role

02:31:14.880 --> 02:31:24.800
of KGB in defining the heart, soul, and mind of Vladimir Putin. Let me return to Yuri Besmenov,

02:31:24.800 --> 02:31:30.240
who was a Soviet KGB agent that wrote a four-step framework for ideological subversion

02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:38.320
on a national scale as practiced by the Soviet Union. The four steps are demoralization,

02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:44.960
destabilization, crisis, and normalization. He had a lot of other kind of systematic ways of describing

02:31:44.960 --> 02:31:52.080
this kind of stuff. Can you speak to some of these ideas about the systematic large-scale

02:31:52.560 --> 02:31:58.640
ideological subversion goals of the KGB? Is there truth to that kind of those ideas?

02:31:58.640 --> 02:32:08.880
Yes, but I think I already sort of mentioned that I think Besmenov was a fraud. And I have, again,

02:32:08.880 --> 02:32:10.080
Can you elaborate?

02:32:10.080 --> 02:32:18.480
Good arguments, let's put it this way. First of all, we know that the KGB was involved in active

02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:31.200
measures, which is, you know, you can call it fake news. Seeding fake news into the countries that

02:32:31.200 --> 02:32:38.800
are your adversaries. And the Russians have been doing this lately by meddling in our election and

02:32:39.600 --> 02:32:44.400
focusing on the left and the right fringe and influencing them to become more left and no more

02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:52.000
right. And Vasily Mitrokin has, in one of his books, he has a whole chapter about active measures.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:57.520
Okay, so what he has to say about the department, and I forgot what department it was, was the one

02:32:57.520 --> 02:33:04.560
department that was the least desirable for KGB agents, because these were desk jobs for people

02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:12.240
who had to come up with fake stories in countries where they didn't quite know too much about the

02:33:12.240 --> 02:33:21.040
country. Now, there were some successes, like one of the two most famous successes that I'm aware of

02:33:21.040 --> 02:33:30.960
is that the Canard, the AIDS virus was concocted in a CIA lab, and the KGB, the KGB, the KGB,

02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:38.800
AIDS virus was concocted in a CIA lab. And a lot of people around the world believe that.

02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:49.040
And the other one was that J. Edgar Hoover was a secret cross dresser. That is still known by a

02:33:49.040 --> 02:33:54.960
lot of Americans who are of a certain age that this was the truth. But Mitrokin actually traces

02:33:54.960 --> 02:34:03.280
it back to a story that was placed in a sort of left wing but close to mainstream French magazine,

02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:14.560
and it was then taken up by larger newspapers and well-established papers. So they had some

02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:25.600
successes, but this kind of a massive, well thought out campaign to destabilize the United

02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:32.880
States, I don't believe the KGB was capable of doing that. Mitrokin seems to agree with me.

02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:38.960
I was trained, I would think, you know, I was one of the crown jewels of the agents.

02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:46.960
One would think that they used the best that they had to help me, how to become an American,

02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:51.840
and they didn't have a clue. So how did they, if you don't know how a country operates,

02:34:51.840 --> 02:35:00.400
how do you come up with this kind of a very detailed long-term plan that's also timed,

02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:03.040
you know, two years this and one year that and all of that?

02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:10.960
Yeah, so we should actually just clarify. So he has this whole idea that there's 15 to 20 years

02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:21.200
are needed for demoralization where you're basically infiltrating a country or people

02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:25.840
from a young age, manipulating their mind, you're destabilizing them. That's the second step that

02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:31.680
takes two to five years. You target the country's foreign relations, defense, and economy. You create

02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:38.400
a crisis artificially, and then you normalize it as if it always was this way. So it's basically

02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:50.400
saying that the KGB is capable of, at scale, over many years, manipulate an entire population of

02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:58.720
people. And this is kind of, there's a lot of people that believe in conspiracy theories that

02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:06.000
are amenable to this kind of idea. Now, my own experience is that there is, in fact,

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:10.720
just a giant amount of incompetence, and that this is something that's actually very difficult

02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:21.440
to pull off because it's incredibly difficult to achieve this kind of manipulation. I think

02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:29.280
it would require, first of all, not much bureaucracy, not much slowing down. You have

02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:34.640
to have incredible, in the modern world, digital systems that are able to do surveillance,

02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:41.760
manipulation. There has to be a strategy that is carried out in secrecy across a huge number of

02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:49.360
people effectively that also requires you hire the best people in the world. And I think it's

02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:57.840
difficult to execute on this kind of thing if you compartmentalize, because there has to be

02:36:57.840 --> 02:37:05.040
great collaboration. There has to be a great, where there's a unified vision and coordination

02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:14.160
across multiple groups. It's very difficult to do. Now, nevertheless, especially with technology,

02:37:14.160 --> 02:37:19.600
this becomes easier and easier. So the bar becomes lower and lower. To achieve mass

02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:25.200
surveillance becomes easier and easier and easier. Mass manipulation through platforms,

02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:29.760
because we're now digitally connected, you can now do that kind of manipulation. So it becomes more

02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:36.000
and more realistic that you could do this kind of thing. But you're saying that, no, intelligence,

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:43.440
first of all, intelligence is hard. And to do it at scale and to do it well and to do it

02:37:45.040 --> 02:37:50.160
in a way that it's also not just collecting information about the populace, but manipulating

02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:54.960
the populace is very, very difficult. Right. Now, let me give you another argument

02:37:54.960 --> 02:38:04.720
why I think that Besmanov was a fraud. I have Matrokin on my side and my personal observation

02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:11.760
of the incompetence that I witnessed. I mean, they really, really didn't know what they didn't

02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:22.640
know. So now Besmanov was KGB, where was he stationed? In India. He was a low-level agent

02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:30.560
in India. And I told you the one thing that the KGB was really good at was compartmentalization.

02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:36.800
How does Besmanov in India find out about this massive plan that should have been super secret,

02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:43.600
right? He made it up, sorry. And you know why he got away with it? Because Americans eat that up,

02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:49.040
because it's not our fault. It's the damn Russians that are doing all that bad stuff.

02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:54.640
Speaking of the damn Russians doing all that bad stuff, you know about the Internet Research Agency.

02:38:55.600 --> 02:39:02.880
They have been doing quite a bit of damage. And I'm now familiar with the world of

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:11.680
enhanced artificial persons. These are the avatars on Facebook and Twitter and so forth

02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:20.000
that look like real people. And there are quite a few of them. And I have a good friend who

02:39:20.080 --> 02:39:26.880
operates in that realm. And you know, he uses, for instance, facial recognition when he

02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:36.800
thinks that there's a suspicious character, say on LinkedIn or on Facebook. And very often

02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:43.120
he finds out, yeah, that that person exists, but it's not the person who it pretends to be.

02:39:43.920 --> 02:39:47.600
So basically detecting the artificial, the enhanced artificial.

02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:54.160
Yes, but he can also make them. You think the United States doesn't do it, we do it too.

02:39:54.960 --> 02:39:59.440
Well, this is to push back against your pushback, right? Yeah, Besmanov might be a fraud,

02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:06.800
but is it possible, especially in the modern age, that there is these kind of large-scale

02:40:06.800 --> 02:40:17.760
systematic operatives? Wouldn't you, as a government that's investing billions of dollars

02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:26.000
into military equipment in a world that's more and more clearly going to be defined by

02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:36.320
cyber war versus hot war, wouldn't you start to have serious meetings, large amounts of hires,

02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:42.640
that are working at how do we manipulate the information flow? How do we manipulate the minds

02:40:42.640 --> 02:40:49.520
of the populace? How do we sell them a narrative? So even though he might've been making up a story

02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:56.320
because people eat it up, could it speak to some deep truth that's actually different than the

02:40:56.320 --> 02:41:01.200
truth you came up in as a KGB agent? Oh, I agree with you 100%. This is much easier.

02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:06.720
You know, all you need is an army of nerds who also-

02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:09.600
No offense. No offense to nerds.

02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:16.880
That's a term of endearment, I guess. I love nerds. I used to be one myself, but anyway-

02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:18.080
Once a nerd, always a nerd.

02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:22.800
So what I was going to say here is-

02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:24.400
All you need is an army of nerds.

02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:33.760
And what also experts in the culture of the target country, okay? And nowadays,

02:41:33.760 --> 02:41:38.480
the world is different. There's a whole lot more fluidity. There's a whole lot of more people that,

02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:43.280
like say Russians, for instance, study in the United States. Chinese, an army of Chinese studying

02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:49.520
in the United States, they have a lot more knowledge of how we function than the KGB did,

02:41:50.240 --> 02:41:56.080
and it's vice versa. Not as many Americans in Russia, but we have some,

02:41:56.080 --> 02:41:59.040
but the Chinese and the Russians have an advantage here.

02:42:00.240 --> 02:42:07.680
Can I ask you a question based on your experience? So I have been talking to a lot of

02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:15.120
powerful people, and some of which have very close connections in this particular conflict,

02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:21.920
Ukraine and Russia, but in other places as well. I don't believe I've ever been contacted by

02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:31.600
or interacted with an intelligence agency. CIA, FSB, MI6, Assad, I don't think I have- Well,

02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:37.120
let me say explicitly, I haven't had an official conversation, which is what I assume I would have

02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:42.560
because I have nothing to hide, right? So I think there's no reason for people to be secretive,

02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:52.480
but why is that? Would I know? Am I interesting at all? How are people determined if they're a

02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:58.480
person of interest or not? And I guess the question, I mean, some of it I ask in a bit of

02:42:58.480 --> 02:43:04.880
a humorous way, but also perhaps there's truth in some of the humor, is would I know if I have

02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:13.040
ever interacted with an intelligence agency spy? Well, you don't know that you haven't been

02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:22.960
contacted, but certainly not- I think you never had a conversation that related to intelligence

02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:27.120
in any way, shape or form, right? Right, like where another person introduced-

02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:33.120
Yeah, introduced themselves or sort of wants to be your friend and then

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:44.400
talks about these types of topics, right? Yeah, but there's people because of who I'm

02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:51.680
interacting with, I mean, even with Elon Musk, like if you think about Elon Musk,

02:43:51.680 --> 02:44:00.400
there's a lot of people that are part of the conversations that happen. How do I know they're

02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:05.200
all trustworthy? They all present themselves as trustworthy. Now, again, I have nothing,

02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:09.600
so this is for the intelligence agencies, I have nothing to hide. I am the same person

02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:17.840
privately as publicly, well-intentioned, real, no controlled, no weird sexual stuff where you

02:44:17.840 --> 02:44:24.960
can manipulate me. What else? No drug use. No drug use, no skeletons in the closet,

02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:32.560
none of that kind of stuff, but I don't know, I mean, just even having these conversations,

02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:36.480
I tend to trust people as a default. Yeah, me too.

02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:44.480
And you start when you think, well, especially with some of the people I've been talking with

02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:52.480
and some of the traveling I'm doing, I'm realizing there's hard men in this world,

02:44:52.560 --> 02:45:00.880
there's military, there's serious suffering, and there's war, and there's serious people there

02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:06.800
who are doing serious harm. And so you have to be careful of thinking who to trust.

02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:13.760
When a person approaches you with a smile and asks you a question, my natural inclination is

02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:19.680
that person is a cool person, I'll answer the question, I'll become a friend, but it becomes

02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:25.280
difficult when you realize that there's things like intelligence agencies with thousands of

02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:30.640
employees, there's people that are doing major military actions that involve tens of thousands,

02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:36.560
hundreds of thousands of soldiers. This is serious stuff. And so how do you know how to

02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:39.040
operate in this world? The folks that you're interacting with

02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:45.840
have a responsibility not to tell you what they shouldn't tell you, right?

02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:47.840
Right. So and most of the time,

02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:54.240
probably won't, and I'm guessing occasionally they will say, well, I can't go there, right?

02:45:54.240 --> 02:46:07.120
Yeah. So what you are aware of is sort of public, and what you're doing is you're collecting it and

02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:15.760
you're editing it to some extent, you're not changing the verbiage. You just repeat what they

02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:25.760
say. So from that angle, you're not privy to any real secrets. What you have possibly that could be

02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:35.680
of use is you learn to get to know the person. So I'm not saying that you have to learn to know the

02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:43.440
person. So I'm thinking there's a good possibility if you get the interviews in the East,

02:46:43.440 --> 02:46:47.440
that somebody may actually approach you and ask you what's your opinion.

02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:53.680
I just hope they approach me and introduce themselves properly. I just, there's a kind of,

02:46:55.200 --> 02:47:00.240
I mean, would you know, like how many Russian spies are there in the United States? How many

02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:06.080
American spies are there in Russia? Do you have a sense? Is it just like with the GRU?

02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:06.580
No idea.

02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:12.720
Is it possible there's like tens of thousands or like thousands?

02:47:12.720 --> 02:47:18.480
Not thousands like I used to operate. We are too hard to train and we weren't that successful to

02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:30.080
begin with. But particularly Russians and Chinese, you know, both governments know who is going

02:47:30.080 --> 02:47:37.280
abroad. And I guarantee you there's a lot of amateur spies. They're being asked, you know,

02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:39.760
help us out, you know, do something for the motherland.

02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:41.840
Crowd source spying.

02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:43.120
Yeah, sort of.

02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:44.880
Not serious training, but yeah.

02:47:44.880 --> 02:47:52.640
And yeah, for instance, this lady, I forgot her first name, Butina, she was a rank amateur.

02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:58.960
She used social media to communicate with Moscow. So she had no training,

02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:08.720
but she was reasonably successful. I mean, she got, and the difference between, let's say,

02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:15.760
the current Russian intelligence and the KGB, Vladimir Putin and his henchmen

02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:24.240
are okay with people being caught. Because, and every time I go and talk and give a talk

02:48:24.240 --> 02:48:30.800
someplace, I'm always asked this question. How many Russian spies do you think we have here?

02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:35.280
Because that scares the people, right? And Putin likes to scare people.

02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:42.000
The KGB was very solicitous of the agents. They were, you know, they didn't want any one

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:45.760
of them caught, right? So that's a big difference.

02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:51.920
So for the FSB, getting caught sends a strong signal to the world that there's agents everywhere.

02:48:51.920 --> 02:49:01.680
Yeah, there could be many more. And there probably are. But because also the world,

02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:05.760
again, there's a whole lot more travel going on, a whole lot more interaction,

02:49:05.760 --> 02:49:13.120
studying abroad, doing business. And, you know, there will be attempts at espionage probably

02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:18.320
every minute in this country. That doesn't mean they would be successful, no.

02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:27.280
But there is a cottage industry now that is doing quite well that teaches companies how to,

02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:36.320
you know, fortify themselves against like industrial espionage or also foreign actors spying.

02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:38.480
It's all over the place.

02:49:38.480 --> 02:49:44.800
Yeah, as it becomes easier and easier with digital, with cyber, it becomes a very serious threat.

02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:48.960
We might wind up in a world where nobody knows anymore what's up and what's down.

02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:56.560
If I was to have a conversation with Vladimir Putin and or Volodymyr Zelensky,

02:49:57.520 --> 02:50:10.000
is there something you would ask about the time in the KGB, the time in its past? We are, all of us,

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:17.520
men and women are creations of the experiences we have in our life, early on in life and through

02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:21.440
the formative experiences, successes and failures.

02:50:22.240 --> 02:50:26.000
So, yeah, you just said the key words, you know, I would ask, you know,

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:29.600
without giving away anything, you know, just being high level,

02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:32.080
your biggest success and your biggest failure.

02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:35.520
As a politician or as a KGB agent?

02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:45.360
We talked in the realm of KGB. When the wall came down and he was in an office,

02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:56.000
KGB office in the city of Dresden and these Germans were besieging Stasi offices and they

02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:04.320
also dropped by the KGB office and they were, that was pretty threatening. It looked like they were

02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:10.160
actually stormed the office and get, you know, the documents and stuff like that.

02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:24.160
And initially, the first demonstration was told that if they come any closer, weapons would be

02:51:24.160 --> 02:51:31.120
used. So, they disappeared and then they came back and I don't know, somebody in that office

02:51:31.120 --> 02:51:37.920
called Berlin and said, what are we going to do? Are we allowed to use force? And the answer came

02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:44.320
back that Gorbachev said, absolutely not. And so, this is where Putin, all of a sudden,

02:51:44.320 --> 02:51:48.160
you know, he was at one point a member of the greatest, the most powerful

02:51:48.960 --> 02:51:52.080
intelligence organization in the world and all of a sudden he was powerless

02:51:52.720 --> 02:51:58.320
and he had to watch how, you know, this was a defeat, big one.

02:51:58.320 --> 02:51:58.820
Yeah.

02:52:00.880 --> 02:52:08.320
It's supposedly a powerful intelligence agency cowering, sort of crawling back

02:52:08.320 --> 02:52:09.920
into a position of weakness.

02:52:09.920 --> 02:52:13.920
And he probably promised himself, never again, Russia needs to be great again.

02:52:15.200 --> 02:52:23.840
The KGB, FSB, Russia, the Russian Empire needs to rise again and that there's a feeling for him

02:52:23.840 --> 02:52:28.640
that that's, as he talks about the collapse of the Soviet Union being a great tragedy,

02:52:29.440 --> 02:52:37.680
there's a feeling like that was like never again.

02:52:38.480 --> 02:52:48.640
Yeah. And I believe that he has a strong conviction that, I don't know if he's religious,

02:52:48.640 --> 02:52:55.840
he carries a cross now, but I don't know what that means, but somehow, but that it's the

02:52:55.840 --> 02:53:03.680
destiny of the Russian nation to be great. And that is sort of, that's whether it's determined

02:53:03.680 --> 02:53:07.840
by God or some higher power, that is very important for him.

02:53:07.840 --> 02:53:15.760
Of course, that nationalist idea is one that Americans share as well and, you know,

02:53:16.560 --> 02:53:21.200
it could help the nation flourish. So by itself is not necessarily a bad thing.

02:53:21.200 --> 02:53:21.520
Oh, I agree.

02:53:21.520 --> 02:53:23.680
It's how it manifests itself is the question.

02:53:24.800 --> 02:53:34.800
Well, one other thing, if I were to get a chat with the Ukrainian president, I would ask him

02:53:36.560 --> 02:53:44.800
how many lives, what is the equation between giving up some land and how many lives

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:47.360
are worth this land?

02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:54.480
And that's a good way to phrase the question. Of course, that question gets you killed in Ukraine.

02:53:55.440 --> 02:54:02.480
But because there's another part of that equation, which is it's not just land versus lives.

02:54:02.480 --> 02:54:09.600
It's the sovereignty, the knowledge that you're free and you're self-determined.

02:54:10.400 --> 02:54:17.360
And like, it's not about like fighting for the particular land. It's saying we are messed up,

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:28.800
corrupt. We have problems. It's a messy world, but it's our world. I think Stephen Crane has

02:54:28.800 --> 02:54:36.240
a poem about like a man eating his own heart. And he was asked, how does it taste? And he said,

02:54:36.240 --> 02:54:40.560
it's bitter, but I like it because it is bitter and because it is my heart.

02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:46.800
And that there's a sense of like, I want this is not just about land. This is our nation,

02:54:47.680 --> 02:54:53.680
the same love of nation that Putin has for Russia, the greater Russia, this vision of

02:54:53.680 --> 02:55:02.560
this great empire. I believe Ukraine does as well. There's levels to this game and Ukrainian people

02:55:02.560 --> 02:55:09.040
are some of the proudest people throughout the history of the 20th century, throughout the history

02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:16.880
of earth, the Polish people, proud people. You can just see in World War II, the people who said,

02:55:16.880 --> 02:55:24.400
fuck you. You're not having this. We will die to the last man. There's different cultures that kind

02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:30.080
of really hold their ground and Ukrainian people are that. You know, I have to admit in that

02:55:30.080 --> 02:55:42.160
respect, I'm a bit of a coward. I could not do what Zelensky has been doing. I would sort of

02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:55.760
try to find a way to carve out something that I can live with. However, if that force, that evil

02:55:55.760 --> 02:56:05.280
force gets to my family. Right. There's lines. Yes. That's right. You become the world's bravest

02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:12.320
man if somebody crosses that line. Oh yeah. You mentioned something about you've not been to

02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:23.200
Moscow back and that it might not be safe for you to travel there. Yes. Can you speak to the nature

02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:32.720
of that? You know, as somebody that successfully got out of the KGB, how are you still alive?

02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:41.920
A number of reasons. First of all, when my story became public, it was six years ago.

02:56:42.800 --> 02:56:50.400
I was pretty old, right? And so the folks that may have a personal interest or may have had a

02:56:50.400 --> 02:56:55.920
personal interest in doing me harm, most of them don't live anymore, all right? That's number one.

02:56:55.920 --> 02:57:06.720
Number two, I wasn't a hired hand, a German. I did not betray the motherland. That's a crime that is

02:57:08.160 --> 02:57:18.160
punished by death. You betray the motherland. And the other thing is,

02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:27.440
if there is, you know that these kinds of operations to assassination in another country

02:57:27.440 --> 02:57:33.760
are very difficult to plan and implement. And if there's a list of people that they don't like,

02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:41.280
I may not be at the very top. Having said that, if I wind up, say, in Moscow or even in countries

02:57:41.280 --> 02:57:50.160
like Turkey where there's a lot of lawlessness, accidents can easily be arranged. And that's just

02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:56.800
sending another message. We can do a lot of things.

02:57:56.800 --> 02:57:57.600
You're powerful.

02:57:57.600 --> 02:57:58.100
Yes.

02:57:58.640 --> 02:58:01.520
Do you think it's safe for me to travel in Russia and Ukraine?

02:58:03.760 --> 02:58:12.480
I think you know very well how to communicate in both countries. You've shown this in this

02:58:12.480 --> 02:58:19.120
interaction that you have a lot of empathy for the people that you'll be talking with,

02:58:19.200 --> 02:58:24.240
and empathy means good understanding where they're coming from. And then there are lines that you

02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:29.200
can't cross. Like the question that I was going to ask Zelensky, who I'm not going to ask, good for

02:58:29.200 --> 02:58:34.880
you. Yeah. Isn't that the funny thing about this world? There's lines. There's lines everywhere,

02:58:34.880 --> 02:58:38.480
even in love, even in personal relationships. There's lines you should not cross.

02:58:39.520 --> 02:58:40.800
How did you finally get caught?

02:58:41.920 --> 02:58:44.400
I resigned in 1988.

02:58:44.720 --> 02:58:51.760
Let's actually talk about that. I resigned. There's warning signs. There's yet another choice,

02:58:51.760 --> 02:58:56.480
yet another crossroads. What was the calculation? What was the choice to be made?

02:58:57.360 --> 02:59:11.280
To give a little background, it was 1988 and I thought my time in the US would soon end

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:18.240
because I thought 10 to 12 years, it was already past 10 years. There was no indication that they

02:59:19.760 --> 02:59:26.960
indicated, that they said, you're done. But in December of 1988, I got this one

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:37.680
thing that I never wanted to see. So we had a system of signals that either one of those

02:59:37.680 --> 02:59:45.680
diplomat agents could set at a spot that I pass by every day, or I could set where they would pass

02:59:45.680 --> 02:59:51.360
by, like on their way from where they live to the United Nations, for instance, who would just drive.

02:59:52.000 --> 03:00:02.240
So the signal spot for me was on a support beam for the elevated A-train in Queens.

03:00:03.120 --> 03:00:09.360
And it was morning in December that I walked by there and routinely

03:00:09.360 --> 03:00:13.440
looked at it and I never expected anything. And there was this red dot, it was about the

03:00:13.440 --> 03:00:22.320
size of my fist with a red paint. And since you have done it already, I think I can curse in this

03:00:22.960 --> 03:00:28.000
moment because it's the only way I can really indicate how I felt. I said,

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:34.720
oh shit, because that was the danger signal. It was like, you must, you are in severe danger

03:00:35.520 --> 03:00:41.280
and you need to get out of the country as soon as possible. There was a protocol that I was

03:00:41.280 --> 03:00:47.200
supposed to follow. I wasn't even supposed to go home. I just needed to, was supposed to get my

03:00:47.200 --> 03:00:56.560
reserve documents that I had hidden in a park in the Bronx and make a beeline to the Canadian border.

03:00:56.560 --> 03:01:04.320
I wasn't ready. So I just ignored this thing. I mean, I couldn't ignore it, but I went on to work,

03:01:04.960 --> 03:01:11.200
got on the A-train, went to work, and then went to my cubicle and stared at the computer screen

03:01:11.200 --> 03:01:15.520
all day because I couldn't think. I could think only about what to do, what to do, what to do.

03:01:15.520 --> 03:01:25.840
The reason for this indecisiveness was that I was a father at the time. My little girl by the name

03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:39.600
of Chelsea was 18 months old. I was there when she was born. I took her to her home. I watched her

03:01:39.600 --> 03:01:47.520
grow up. I watched her take the first steps and always look at me with these big eyes, lovingly

03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:58.400
look at me. That is when I started my re-entry into the human race because I just fell in love

03:01:58.400 --> 03:02:05.200
with this girl. That's when love came back and it was completely unexpected.

03:02:07.600 --> 03:02:13.040
There's a lot of fathers who understand, particularly fathers of girls, who understand

03:02:13.040 --> 03:02:22.000
what happened there. I still thought I need to go back because there was probably some danger,

03:02:22.560 --> 03:02:29.520
but I hadn't figured out how to take care of the girl. I'd leave her, but maybe she needed to have

03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:36.080
a good life and grow up and have a chance. Her mother was from South America. She had a fourth

03:02:36.080 --> 03:02:45.840
grade education. That would have not worked very well. I played for time. Obviously,

03:02:46.960 --> 03:02:52.000
I could be sick. I could be in a hospital. There was a precedent where I was sick where I couldn't

03:02:52.000 --> 03:03:01.520
communicate for about three weeks. I just did nothing. There was on a Monday. On a Thursday

03:03:01.520 --> 03:03:11.600
was my regular shortwave transmission. I listened and they explained a little in a few sentences.

03:03:11.600 --> 03:03:17.680
We have reason to believe that the FBI is on your case. You need to execute the emergency

03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:26.800
procedure. Come home right away. I still had some time because the radio could be broken or the

03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:34.800
transmission was bad, or I still could be in a hospital. I gave myself some more time. Then

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:45.920
something happened where they forced my hand. The only time that a Soviet agent was anywhere

03:03:45.920 --> 03:03:56.080
near me on the territory of the United States. I'm waiting for the A train on a dark morning still.

03:03:57.520 --> 03:04:06.240
In Queens and there's this man, the short man in a black trench coat comes up to me from my right

03:04:07.040 --> 03:04:13.520
and he whispers into my ears, you got to come back or else you're dead. I can't imitate the

03:04:13.520 --> 03:04:22.320
Russian accent. That was a Russian accent. It was a pretty strong accent. The you're dead phrase

03:04:22.320 --> 03:04:30.720
is can have two meanings. An American would have said, or else you're busted or else you get

03:04:30.720 --> 03:04:38.560
arrested or else you're dead is very strong. Now you have to take it seriously to some degree

03:04:38.560 --> 03:04:45.680
because I knew that they had a history of assassinating or at least trying to assassinate

03:04:45.840 --> 03:04:54.800
factors. That obviously raised the stakes a little bit, but I just talked myself into believing this

03:04:54.800 --> 03:05:04.480
was just bad phrasing. At this point, I knew and they knew that we both knew. There was no more

03:05:04.480 --> 03:05:11.440
guessing. He found me, he talked to me, I know. Now I had to act. In the next radiogram, I was

03:05:11.440 --> 03:05:21.360
asked to execute a dead drop operation where they would give me money and a passport.

03:05:23.200 --> 03:05:33.280
That was in a park on Staten Island. It was a location that I found and I described. I was always

03:05:33.280 --> 03:05:42.880
appraised for my ability to describe spots that are easy to find. That was a given.

03:05:44.640 --> 03:05:49.840
The only thing that was different for this operation, they scheduled it for the dark,

03:05:51.600 --> 03:05:59.280
but it was still no problem because it was in a park about 100 yards in

03:05:59.920 --> 03:06:09.040
by next to a fallen tree. It would be hard to miss. So I go to Staten Island and I read the

03:06:09.040 --> 03:06:18.400
signal that said I put the container in the drop. That was the protocol. There's a signal that the

03:06:18.400 --> 03:06:28.560
person who hands over something puts at a spot not too far from the spot itself. That means I would

03:06:28.560 --> 03:06:37.600
go in and just pick it up. The reason I actually went to pick up this container because there was

03:06:37.600 --> 03:06:44.720
money in it. I didn't have to make a decision yet. I could throw away the passport. It was like I

03:06:44.720 --> 03:06:49.440
was still trying to figure out what to do, what to do, what to do. I get to the spot, I get to the

03:06:49.440 --> 03:06:57.680
tree and I had a flashlight with me. There was no way in the park. Even during the day, this park

03:06:58.640 --> 03:07:08.000
it was almost like a little forest. I don't see the container. It wasn't supposed to be in a

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:16.640
crushed oil can. Pretty sizable, hard to miss. I do a double take and I look again and I look around

03:07:16.640 --> 03:07:23.760
and I look around a little more, see if they misplaced it. I can't find it. That's the only

03:07:23.760 --> 03:07:32.640
one that one of those operations failed. That just doesn't make a lot of sense.

03:07:33.840 --> 03:07:37.280
As I'm walking away from this, like sort of numb emotionally,

03:07:40.640 --> 03:07:42.400
I said to myself, I'm staying.

03:07:44.640 --> 03:07:50.080
Yeah, some kind of signal, some kind of muse just spoke to you.

03:07:50.080 --> 03:07:56.400
That decision was made for me. Now, you know that I'm a Christian now and I think it was like

03:07:56.960 --> 03:07:57.840
God told me this.

03:08:00.640 --> 03:08:02.800
But it was certain there. It was right there.

03:08:02.800 --> 03:08:15.360
That was it. That was it. So, what I did, first of all, divine intervention helped me to find a good

03:08:16.240 --> 03:08:24.240
explanation. I sent them my last letter with secret writing. I communicated to them. I said,

03:08:25.040 --> 03:08:33.520
I wish I could come, but I can't because I have contracted HIV AIDS. That was the best lie ever

03:08:34.080 --> 03:08:38.640
because nobody wanted to have AIDS in their country. Those days it was a death sentence,

03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:44.960
right? And I knew we had conversations when I was back in Moscow, how they

03:08:44.960 --> 03:08:49.600
were snickering about what's going on in the United States, you know, that depraved culture.

03:08:49.600 --> 03:08:52.400
And you see, they're killing each other.

03:08:52.400 --> 03:08:56.800
And the depraved culture took over your being and how you're saying-

03:08:56.800 --> 03:09:03.600
Yes. No, and I was convincing enough, I even traced it back to a girlfriend I had once that

03:09:03.600 --> 03:09:10.480
I actually reported on that she, you know, I interacted with this lady who had a boyfriend

03:09:11.280 --> 03:09:15.680
at one point who was a drug addict and she was infected and she infected me.

03:09:16.720 --> 03:09:24.480
So, they believed it. They sent, and I asked them to give my dollar savings to my German family.

03:09:25.760 --> 03:09:32.560
They gave them some, but they told my family that I already passed away, that I'm dead.

03:09:33.120 --> 03:09:39.840
They believed it, 100%. And I guess the agent who took the money took half of it for himself.

03:09:40.640 --> 03:09:50.960
So, that was it. And the next three months, I made sure that I wasn't reliably at the same spot

03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:58.640
in the same timeframe. So, I went to work in different paths at different times just to,

03:09:58.640 --> 03:10:05.840
you know, just to see safety measures, so to speak, and not huge. But, you know,

03:10:06.240 --> 03:10:18.240
it allowed me to keep my sanity. And obviously, after I sent the letter, I threw the shortwave

03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:24.560
radio in the Hudson River, destroyed the one-time paths that I still had. So, I was now

03:10:26.480 --> 03:10:28.800
ready to- For a new life.

03:10:28.800 --> 03:10:36.080
For a new life and live out my life as an American, undiscovered, but, you know,

03:10:36.720 --> 03:10:48.080
starting to work on my version of the American dream. And the first action was telling my wife,

03:10:48.080 --> 03:10:54.480
the mother of this child, you know, she always wanted to have a house and said,

03:10:54.480 --> 03:11:00.160
you know what, we should buy a house. And a year later, we moved into the suburbs,

03:11:00.160 --> 03:11:06.400
and then I said, we should have another child, and we had another child. And I had a career

03:11:06.400 --> 03:11:12.880
where I did pretty well. I moved a couple of times, wound up in a McMansion.

03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:19.760
But before that, my second house was actually in Pennsylvania, in rural Pennsylvania. And this is

03:11:20.720 --> 03:11:30.720
where I was discovered by the FBI. And how did they know about me? If it hadn't been for this

03:11:30.720 --> 03:11:38.560
defector, Vasily Mitrokin, who was an archivist in the KGB archives, he was actually pretty high

03:11:38.560 --> 03:11:45.120
level. He was in charge of the relocation of the archive from Lubyanka to Yasenovo.

03:11:46.080 --> 03:11:57.120
And he really hated the, he had reason to believe he hated the Soviet system. I think I remember

03:11:57.120 --> 03:12:02.560
that his son was quite ill, and he could have gotten treatment in England, and he was not allowed

03:12:03.440 --> 03:12:10.800
to travel to England with his son. So he, his hatred, he tried to figure out what to do and

03:12:10.800 --> 03:12:17.600
how to do damage to that system. So he started copying notes, little slips of paper,

03:12:18.480 --> 03:12:22.960
handwritten, that he smuggled out in his underwear and his socks over the years.

03:12:23.680 --> 03:12:29.760
And then he transcribed them with a typewriter and then put the pieces of paper

03:12:29.760 --> 03:12:41.280
into some kind of a container and buried this in his stacha. It was, I believe, in 1992,

03:12:41.280 --> 03:12:47.760
when he showed up. That was already, the Soviet Union was gone. So he showed up at the US embassy

03:12:47.760 --> 03:12:52.800
in Moscow and told him what he had. And it was on a weekend, and apparently there was a junior

03:12:52.800 --> 03:12:57.200
person in charge. And he said, you know what, what you got, we are not interested in. It's really old.

03:12:57.200 --> 03:13:06.720
And that's a career limiting move, right? Because Vasily Mitrokin then made his way to

03:13:07.520 --> 03:13:16.560
one of the Baltic republics and contacted MI6. And they said, come on in old fellow,

03:13:16.560 --> 03:13:24.320
we'll have a cup of tea. And so they managed to get the stuff out of the dacha and get it

03:13:24.320 --> 03:13:32.000
to England. And eventually MI6 shared it with the FBI. And there wasn't a whole lot of information

03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:37.360
about me. It was very, very little. It was like there's a person by the name of Jack Barsky who

03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:44.080
is an illegal operating in the Northeast of the United States. Now, if it was Jim Miller,

03:13:44.080 --> 03:13:49.920
they wouldn't have found me. Jack Barsky was easy to find. So they checked Social Security.

03:13:50.400 --> 03:14:00.800
And Jack Barsky had gotten his Social Security card at the age of 33. Bingo, okay? All they knew,

03:14:00.800 --> 03:14:04.720
though, was that I wasn't illegal, that I was still living there. They didn't know whether I

03:14:04.720 --> 03:14:11.200
was active, inactive. And the other thing that they knew that I was a really, really well-trained

03:14:11.200 --> 03:14:21.440
agent, because I was still there. So they took, I think, almost three years to investigate me,

03:14:21.440 --> 03:14:28.080
watch me from a distance, because if I was still active, I would have found out that somebody is

03:14:29.040 --> 03:14:32.800
investigating me. So you started being less and less active in terms of-

03:14:32.800 --> 03:14:35.280
Oh, I stopped completely. What I mean is-

03:14:35.280 --> 03:14:38.000
Oh, surveillance detection. Yes, surveillance detection.

03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:41.600
After three months, I stopped altogether. Yeah, good point.

03:14:41.600 --> 03:14:43.760
And FBI is still very careful.

03:14:43.760 --> 03:14:50.480
They were very careful. They pretty much watched me. And at one point, I had a house in the country

03:14:50.480 --> 03:14:56.400
with one neighbor. At one point, that house was for sale, so the FBI bought it. And they put a

03:14:56.400 --> 03:15:04.000
couple of agents there and just didn't keep a closer eye on me. There was no indication that

03:15:04.960 --> 03:15:14.080
I was still active, but they were still cautious. But at one point, they were able to plant a bug

03:15:14.080 --> 03:15:24.880
in my kitchen, a listening device. And my wife and I didn't get along very well. There was a lot

03:15:24.880 --> 03:15:30.400
of friction, and she was constantly complaining about things, and I got sick and tired of it.

03:15:30.720 --> 03:15:39.680
One day, we had an argument in the kitchen, and I chose to deploy the nuclear option.

03:15:42.560 --> 03:15:49.840
That is telling her what I sacrificed to be with her, so she would understand that I am there

03:15:49.840 --> 03:15:55.040
on her side. I'm supporting her. If something doesn't quite fit, it is not because I don't

03:15:55.040 --> 03:16:03.920
love both of them, Chelsea and Penelope. So when I said that, the listening device was active,

03:16:03.920 --> 03:16:10.960
so the FBI was hearing my confession. I was once a KGB agent, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

03:16:10.960 --> 03:16:24.480
and I quit and stayed here because of you and Chelsea. And that also made it clear to the FBI

03:16:24.480 --> 03:16:31.760
that I wasn't active anymore. They had both of that. So now, they knew an attempt to turn me

03:16:31.760 --> 03:16:38.720
would have been useless because you turned somebody who was active. But they figured

03:16:39.920 --> 03:16:48.000
there was enough reason to treat me nicely because they figured I had a lot of information

03:16:48.560 --> 03:16:54.720
that was as aged as it was, but it was still important for the FBI to get to know.

03:16:57.280 --> 03:17:07.520
One day, it was a Friday evening. I am driving back home from the office, and I am being stopped

03:17:07.520 --> 03:17:20.640
by a state police. As I am going through the toll, it is a bridge over the Hudson,

03:17:20.640 --> 03:17:26.560
and they had to pay a toll. He got me right where I had stopped, and he said,

03:17:26.560 --> 03:17:32.480
could you please move over here? It is a routine traffic stop. I thought nothing of it. I had

03:17:32.480 --> 03:17:41.760
forgotten at that point that I once was a spy. It was gone. Then he said, could you please step

03:17:41.760 --> 03:17:47.120
out of the car? That should have aroused my suspicion. That is unusual, a routine traffic

03:17:47.120 --> 03:17:55.040
stop. Yeah, I did it, no problem. Then again, somebody came from the right, came into my view,

03:17:55.040 --> 03:18:00.160
and he flipped his ID and said, FBI, we would like to have a talk with you.

03:18:00.160 --> 03:18:11.120
This is my now friend, Joe Reilly, who is the godfather of Trinity, my last child. Anyway,

03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:21.440
he told me later that when I heard that phrase, all the blood left my face. It became totally

03:18:21.440 --> 03:18:30.240
white. I recovered very quickly, and he said it himself. They took me to a vehicle,

03:18:31.360 --> 03:18:39.680
and there was another agent in the vehicle, and he had a gun strapped to his ankle. It was pretty

03:18:39.680 --> 03:18:49.520
real. The first question I had was, am I under arrest? The answer was no. Then my instinct

03:18:49.520 --> 03:18:57.840
kicked in, and my ability to operate very well under high pressure situations. I asked him,

03:18:57.840 --> 03:19:13.040
what took you so long? The intent of that was to diffuse any kind of tension, and I saw a smile.

03:19:13.680 --> 03:19:15.600
Yeah, instant friends.

03:19:16.640 --> 03:19:27.280
Yeah, I knew that I had to make them like me. I think by now I know I'm a pretty likable person.

03:19:32.320 --> 03:19:41.040
When they took me to a motel, which they had rented, there were two wings at a right angle.

03:19:41.360 --> 03:19:47.840
They bought all the rooms in one wing, and they had a guard at each end of

03:19:48.880 --> 03:19:56.640
that wing, and they took me in the middle. There were some props there, some binders with labels,

03:19:57.280 --> 03:20:04.960
and I immediately thought, this is pretty silly, because what I noticed was that the labels all

03:20:04.960 --> 03:20:13.360
referred back to my early years. I knew that they didn't know much else. I told Joe that afterwards,

03:20:13.360 --> 03:20:22.000
and that was not a great idea. I volunteered. I made the following statement before we even

03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:29.920
started the interview. I said, I know there's only one way for me and my family to have a chance to

03:20:29.920 --> 03:20:36.800
get through here without much damage, if I'm completely 100% cooperative, and is it my intent

03:20:37.440 --> 03:20:44.480
to do exactly that? All right, so we spent about two hours in the interview. They allowed me to

03:20:44.480 --> 03:20:50.160
call my wife, tell her that I'm going to be late. That indicated to me already that they would let

03:20:50.160 --> 03:20:59.120
me go, and after two hours, they let me go. But they had the area covered with a whole bunch of

03:20:59.120 --> 03:21:07.520
people, and the head of that team talked to me and said, if you think of running, we got every

03:21:07.520 --> 03:21:14.640
intersection in this area covered. You can't. I didn't say anything, but I had no thought of running.

03:21:16.800 --> 03:21:24.640
That was the beginning of another phase of my life where I was cooperating with the FBI for

03:21:24.640 --> 03:21:29.680
quite a while and living still undercover for several years until I had real good documentation

03:21:30.240 --> 03:21:37.040
and became an American citizen seven years ago. From today, seven years ago. So recently.

03:21:37.760 --> 03:21:46.800
Yeah, quite recently. The bureaucracy took a long time to figure out how to make me real and also

03:21:46.800 --> 03:21:55.520
not put me in these witness protection program to keep my name and then just make everything

03:21:56.240 --> 03:22:03.840
official. So for instance, I had to change my birth year simply because if Jack Barsky was

03:22:03.840 --> 03:22:10.000
born in 1944, if I kept 1944, the FBI would have helped me commit a crime because I would have

03:22:10.080 --> 03:22:19.760
collected Social Security four years sooner. So anyway, yes, it took quite a while.

03:22:19.760 --> 03:22:27.920
And when I finally got the call from the Office of Homeland Security, the lady says,

03:22:28.800 --> 03:22:35.920
this is Agent so-and-so from Homeland Security. Can you come into the office tomorrow?

03:22:36.800 --> 03:22:44.720
And I said, let me look at my calendar. And then I said, wait a minute, what am I talking about?

03:22:44.720 --> 03:22:49.040
What time do you want me to be there? Because I had waited for that moment for a long time

03:22:49.040 --> 03:22:54.800
and I was sworn in right then and there. It was a good feeling to walk out of there because I

03:22:55.680 --> 03:23:02.080
had a country again. And I love this country just as much as you said you love it with all its

03:23:02.080 --> 03:23:10.160
warts and its problems that we're going through right now. And then the last thing that changed

03:23:10.160 --> 03:23:14.800
my life again, and I don't want to get into details because it's a little complicated story,

03:23:14.800 --> 03:23:22.000
I never wanted to be a public person. And then I was discovered through a number of

03:23:23.360 --> 03:23:29.120
dots that were unlikely to be connected. It had to do with a relative, with a half brother of my

03:23:29.120 --> 03:23:39.200
wife who lives in Germany, was taken to Germany by his mother who came to visit somebody,

03:23:39.200 --> 03:23:44.800
not us, but that somebody that he came to visit lived 50 miles from our house.

03:23:45.760 --> 03:23:53.120
And that my wife and this half brother never met in person before. They knew about each other

03:23:53.120 --> 03:24:00.400
through social media. And when he found out my background, he was a conductor of the German

03:24:00.400 --> 03:24:05.520
Railroad at the time. He said, oh, this is a big story, that's going to be big, big, big.

03:24:07.680 --> 03:24:10.960
Well, he happened to know this one person who happened to know

03:24:12.880 --> 03:24:20.880
one of the star reporters of Der Spiegel. And after she did some research and determined that

03:24:20.880 --> 03:24:28.400
I was real, she was on my case. And she happened to know Steve Croft, the guy from 60 Minutes,

03:24:28.400 --> 03:24:30.640
did you see all these connections? I had nothing to do with it.

03:24:30.640 --> 03:24:35.120
That's how life works, dots get connected somehow, sometimes. Most of us it doesn't.

03:24:35.120 --> 03:24:37.360
Stuff happens, you get lucky.

03:24:37.360 --> 03:24:38.240
You don't know what's happening.

03:24:38.240 --> 03:24:40.400
You've gotten lucky a few times in your life.

03:24:40.400 --> 03:24:50.000
Yeah, I think I must be part Irish too. Yeah, so it's been an interesting ride

03:24:51.760 --> 03:24:57.520
and I'm just still shaking my head about all the stuff that happened.

03:24:57.520 --> 03:25:03.840
Oh, it's been a fun one. Well, you wrote, because I'm allowed to leave behind a documented legacy

03:25:03.840 --> 03:25:13.200
of my unusual life, I'm praying that the legacy will be described by a single word, love. So,

03:25:13.200 --> 03:25:16.720
let us return to the thing we started the conversation with, which is love.

03:25:17.200 --> 03:25:24.720
What role does love play in this human condition, in your life and in our life here together?

03:25:25.520 --> 03:25:34.560
I give you an answer by telling you what happened one day. I gave a presentation at Microsoft

03:25:34.560 --> 03:25:40.240
headquarters. That's a strange beginning of a love story, but yes.

03:25:40.240 --> 03:25:45.920
No, that's not a love story. And so there's this beautiful young lady sitting in the back

03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:53.520
and she's paying a lot of attention. Found out later that her job at Microsoft, her job title

03:25:53.520 --> 03:26:00.720
was storyteller. It's soft marketing, right? Yeah, you could say that.

03:26:00.720 --> 03:26:10.560
Yeah, but if you can't afford somebody like that, that's good. Anyway, question and answer,

03:26:10.560 --> 03:26:17.840
she raised her hand and she asked me, all the things that you have done and you've experienced,

03:26:17.840 --> 03:26:24.960
what's the number one lesson you've taken away from your life? That was a new question for me.

03:26:25.600 --> 03:26:32.400
Never been asked that question. And I thought about it for 20 seconds and then I came up with

03:26:32.400 --> 03:26:41.040
this phrase that we all know, love conquers all, because in my life it did, in the end.

03:26:46.240 --> 03:26:50.320
It's the strongest human emotion and that is what makes us human, really.

03:26:53.120 --> 03:27:00.400
Offline, as I've spoken with you, it's clear to me how transformative, how powerful the life of

03:27:01.120 --> 03:27:08.000
your children are, your daughters in your life and who you are and why you think life is beautiful

03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:16.080
and why you think this country is beautiful. Now that I'm pretty mature, to put it mildly,

03:27:17.760 --> 03:27:26.720
I'm also more loving towards many more people. These things like random acts of kindness for

03:27:26.720 --> 03:27:31.120
strangers, I do them, I'm looking for them now and you know what, it's good for me.

03:27:32.880 --> 03:27:39.200
Well, welcome to Texas because this random acts of kindness to strangers seems to be a way of life,

03:27:40.880 --> 03:27:46.720
which is one of the reasons I love it here. It just reminds me why I love human beings,

03:27:47.440 --> 03:27:49.760
is that there's just this warmth, this connection.

03:27:49.760 --> 03:27:52.080
Yeah, yeah, and Georgia is the same thing.

03:27:52.080 --> 03:28:01.200
Yeah, amen. Do you have any regrets? Looking back on life, do you wish you'd done something

03:28:01.200 --> 03:28:10.080
different? Well, I could have, but then I would have a different regret. I betrayed the wife,

03:28:10.080 --> 03:28:17.840
the German wife that I loved. I really did love her and I betrayed her. But if I don't betray her,

03:28:17.840 --> 03:28:28.560
then I betray the child. That is a source of so much love for you now. So maybe life is a kind of,

03:28:30.720 --> 03:28:32.560
you get to choose your regrets.

03:28:34.640 --> 03:28:42.080
Yeah, it's a little bit of a strange way of putting it, but there's no other choice.

03:28:42.960 --> 03:28:50.480
And I tell you what I don't regret and that may be, you probably understand it now because

03:28:50.480 --> 03:28:53.520
you have enough background about me. I don't regret having lied to my mother

03:28:55.600 --> 03:29:01.200
because I had no really strong emotional relationship with her. She took care of me.

03:29:02.400 --> 03:29:10.320
She was proud of me, but we didn't hug. We didn't interact emotionally whatsoever.

03:29:11.280 --> 03:29:13.760
So you don't feel like you betrayed that love?

03:29:15.280 --> 03:29:24.560
Well, I did. I know that she was looking for me until the day she died. She wrote a letter to

03:29:24.560 --> 03:29:34.320
President Gorbachev asking him for help to locate me. She checked with Stasi. She just was

03:29:35.200 --> 03:29:42.320
like hell-bent on finding me and couldn't find me. So she passed away without knowing

03:29:44.080 --> 03:29:51.680
what happened to me. Now there was this rumor that was flying around and she possibly may have

03:29:51.680 --> 03:29:59.200
bought into that rumor because my cover for when I went to the United States was that I

03:29:59.200 --> 03:30:08.560
changed careers again and I joined an institution in Kazakhstan that did space research.

03:30:10.240 --> 03:30:17.920
Intercosmos something something and I had a piece of paper that invited me to

03:30:17.920 --> 03:30:25.120
start there and it was a forgery. Intercosmos never existed, but people knew that in Kazakhstan

03:30:25.120 --> 03:30:34.960
there were super secret facilities. One of my classmates, old classmates from high school,

03:30:34.960 --> 03:30:41.600
started the rumor that I died in a rocket accident and everybody knew that.

03:30:43.040 --> 03:30:51.040
So when I came back to Germany, went back to Germany, I found the telephone number of this

03:30:51.040 --> 03:31:00.400
girl that had dumped me. I called her and I said, so guess who this is? Maybe you hold onto your

03:31:00.400 --> 03:31:09.120
chair. She says yes. I said, this is Albrecht. It's a good payback.

03:31:10.640 --> 03:31:18.240
No, we actually met. So there's two elderly people in their 60s who meet each other after so many

03:31:18.240 --> 03:31:27.440
years and the one that ended the relationship started the conversation by saying, you know what?

03:31:28.240 --> 03:31:35.200
I made a really bad mistake and the tears came down her cheeks. I wasn't asking for that.

03:31:35.200 --> 03:31:44.880
I wasn't happy about it, but it did feel good. Now, a while later I knew why she said she made

03:31:44.880 --> 03:31:58.160
a mistake. I met her husband. Tom Weiss has a song called Martha where an older gentleman calls

03:31:58.960 --> 03:32:02.400
somebody he used to love and they have a conversation. They're both married now

03:32:03.120 --> 03:32:09.200
and sometimes you can meet people from your past and it gives you a glimpse of a possible

03:32:09.200 --> 03:32:14.400
different life you could have had. I was actually, when she said I made a mistake

03:32:14.400 --> 03:32:20.880
and I was thinking to myself, no you didn't. There was none. There was nothing left.

03:32:22.480 --> 03:32:25.440
There was nothing left and also the person that she became

03:32:28.320 --> 03:32:34.880
personality wise wasn't as attractive as I remembered her. You know, it's puppy love,

03:32:34.880 --> 03:32:42.080
you know. But it's still love. Yeah, it was. It was passionate love for sure and I would have

03:32:42.640 --> 03:32:48.240
thrown myself under the bus if I could save her. It was that strong and just as strong as the love

03:32:48.240 --> 03:32:57.680
for my two girls. Yeah. Life is full of moments and periods like that of love and that's what makes

03:32:57.680 --> 03:33:04.720
life so freaking awesome. But it does come to an end. And so does this conversation, I guess.

03:33:05.920 --> 03:33:10.720
No, this goes on for many more hours, but yes. Do you think about your own death?

03:33:11.040 --> 03:33:14.560
Huh? Do you think about death? Do you think about your own death? Yes.

03:33:15.200 --> 03:33:18.880
Are you afraid of it? Yes, even though I'm a Christian.

03:33:22.880 --> 03:33:27.520
As a Christian, do you have a sense of what's coming after? Or is it full of uncertainty?

03:33:27.520 --> 03:33:37.360
I have a hope. I have a hope. You know, there's a lot of Christianity which is quite logical.

03:33:37.360 --> 03:33:46.160
A lot of Christianity, which is also, you know, the life of Christ has a lot of proof. But you know,

03:33:48.240 --> 03:34:02.720
and I became a Christian starting with a head. And I was already quite old and I

03:34:07.680 --> 03:34:16.240
you know, when you don't get this faith very early, it's tougher to buy into everything.

03:34:16.800 --> 03:34:23.840
You know, there are some things that are difficult for me to understand and believe, but

03:34:24.560 --> 03:34:28.800
there's many, many other things that I can't explain only with the existence of a God.

03:34:29.440 --> 03:34:35.760
But whether he lets us go again for in eternity, I just hope.

03:34:37.360 --> 03:34:41.120
I won't convince somebody else at this point, which doesn't make me

03:34:41.680 --> 03:34:44.960
a really, really good Christian because I'm supposed to evangelize.

03:34:46.400 --> 03:34:49.840
But there's still a fear. There's a fear and a hope.

03:34:50.800 --> 03:34:58.640
On the other hand, I know that, you see, this is how I approached the last years of my life.

03:34:59.360 --> 03:35:10.080
I will not mentally or physically get decrepit. I will do everything I can do

03:35:10.880 --> 03:35:17.760
to be alert and fit. I still run. I run four or five times a week.

03:35:18.640 --> 03:35:21.120
And I'm going to start lifting weights again.

03:35:21.760 --> 03:35:24.720
Good. You stay physically and mentally sharp.

03:35:24.720 --> 03:35:24.960
Yes.

03:35:26.160 --> 03:35:27.600
Go out with guns blazing.

03:35:28.560 --> 03:35:33.600
And I once read a book written by a medical doctor. He said most people,

03:35:37.200 --> 03:35:42.800
when they're becoming mature, the rest of their life is a slow downward move.

03:35:46.400 --> 03:35:46.960
Not for you.

03:35:48.640 --> 03:35:54.080
The last years are pretty bad. He said, you got to do this. Boom.

03:35:55.040 --> 03:36:01.360
That's pretty good advice from a doctor. And if nothing else, from Christianity,

03:36:02.320 --> 03:36:06.640
whichever parts you take on, one of the big ones is love.

03:36:06.640 --> 03:36:12.720
That's something you've lived from the very beginning before God was part of your life,

03:36:12.720 --> 03:36:16.240
before anything was part of your life. It seemed that love was part of your life

03:36:16.240 --> 03:36:18.480
and has been a consistent thread throughout.

03:36:18.560 --> 03:36:25.360
Yes, sir. And there's a short sentence in the Bible that says, God is love.

03:36:26.560 --> 03:36:34.880
And the other thing I want to say, the Christian morality is I can sign that with my blood.

03:36:36.800 --> 03:36:42.720
God is love. Amen. Jack, you're an incredible person, lived an incredible life.

03:36:44.880 --> 03:36:47.280
Thank you for talking today. Thank you for telling your story.

03:36:48.480 --> 03:36:54.880
Thank you for being who you are. And thank you for being all about love. This is a beautiful

03:36:54.880 --> 03:36:57.280
conversation. It was an honor. Thank you for talking today.

03:36:57.280 --> 03:36:59.440
Appreciate the tough questions that you asked.

03:37:00.560 --> 03:37:04.400
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jack Barsky. To support this podcast,

03:37:04.400 --> 03:37:09.280
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from

03:37:09.280 --> 03:37:14.960
Edward Snowden. You can't come up against the world's most powerful intelligence agencies

03:37:14.960 --> 03:37:20.560
and not accept the risk. If they want to get you over time, they will.

03:37:22.000 --> 03:37:24.960
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
